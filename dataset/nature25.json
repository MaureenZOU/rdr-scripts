    "abstract": "Tabular data, spreadsheets organized in rows and columns, are ubiquitous across scientific fields, from biomedicine to particle physics to economics and climate science1,2. The fundamental prediction task of filling in missing values of a label column based on the rest of the columns is essential for various applications as diverse as biomedical risk models, drug discovery and materials science. Although deep learning has revolutionized learning from raw data and led to numerous high-profile success stories3–5, gradient-boosted decision trees6–9 have dominated tabular data for the past 20 years. Here we present the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN), a tabular foundation model that outperforms all previous methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training time. In 2.8 s, TabPFN outperforms an ensemble of the strongest baselines tuned for 4 h in a classification setting. As a generative transformer-based foundation model, this model also allows fine-tuning, data generation, density estimation and learning reusable embeddings. TabPFN is a learning algorithm that is itself learned across millions of synthetic datasets, demonstrating the power of this approach for algorithm development. By improving modelling abilities across diverse fields, TabPFN has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and enhance important decision-making in various domains. Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network, a tabular foundation model, provides accurate predictions on small data and outperforms all previous methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems are highly biodiverse1 and important for livelihoods and economic development2, but are under substantial stress3. To date, comprehensive global assessments of extinction risk have not included any speciose groups primarily living in freshwaters. Consequently, data from predominantly terrestrial tetrapods4,5 are used to guide environmental policy6 and conservation prioritization7, whereas recent proposals for target setting in freshwaters use abiotic factors8–13. However, there is evidence14–17 that such data are insufficient to represent the needs of freshwater species and achieve biodiversity goals18,19. Here we present the results of a multi-taxon global freshwater fauna assessment for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species covering 23,496 decapod crustaceans, fishes and odonates, finding that one-quarter are threatened with extinction. Prevalent threats include pollution, dams and water extraction, agriculture and invasive species, with overharvesting also driving extinctions. We also examined the degree of surrogacy of both threatened tetrapods and freshwater abiotic factors (water stress and nitrogen) for threatened freshwater species. Threatened tetrapods are good surrogates when prioritizing sites to maximize rarity-weighted richness, but poorer when prioritizing based on the most range-restricted species. However, they are much better surrogates than abiotic factors, which perform worse than random. Thus, although global priority regions identified for tetrapod conservation are broadly reflective of those for freshwater faunas, given differences in key threats and habitats, meeting the needs of tetrapods cannot be assumed sufficient to conserve freshwater species at local scales. A global multi-taxon extinction risk assessment of freshwater fauna for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species finds one-quarter of species to be at high risk of extinction.",

    "abstract": "The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in driving technological advances in areas such as energy storage, catalysis and carbon capture1–3. Generative models accelerate materials design by directly generating new materials given desired property constraints, but current methods have a low success rate in proposing stable crystals or can satisfy only a limited set of property constraints4–11. Here we present MatterGen, a model that generates stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property constraints. Compared with previous generative models4,12, structures produced by MatterGen are more than twice as likely to be new and stable, and more than ten times closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully generates stable, new materials with desired chemistry, symmetry and mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. As a proof of concept, we synthesize one of the generated structures and measure its property value to be within 20% of our target. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of abilities of MatterGen represent an important advancement towards creating a foundational generative model for materials design. MatterGen is a model that generates stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property constraints.",

    "abstract": "Seawater electrolysis powered by renewable electricity provides an attractive strategy for producing green hydrogen1–5. However, direct seawater electrolysis faces many challenges, primarily arising from corrosion and competing reactions at the anode caused by the abundance of halide ions (Cl−, Br−) in seawater6. Previous studies3,6–14 on seawater electrolysis have mainly focused on the anode development, because the cathode operates at reducing potentials, which is not subject to electrode dissolution or chloride corrosion reactions during seawater electrolysis11,15. However, renewable energy sources are intermittent, variable and random, which cause frequent start–shutdown operations if renewable electricity is used to drive seawater electrolysis. Here we first unveil dynamic evolution and degradation of seawater splitting cathode in intermittent electrolysis and, accordingly, propose construction of a catalyst’s passivation layer to maintain the hydrogen evolution performance during operation. An in situ-formed phosphate passivation layer on the surface of NiCoP–Cr2O3 cathode can effectively protect metal active sites against oxidation during frequent discharge processes and repel halide ion adsorption on the cathode during shutdown conditions. We demonstrate that electrodes optimized using this design strategy can withstand fluctuating operation at 0.5 A cm−2 for 10,000 h in alkaline seawater, with a voltage increase rate of only 0.5% khr−1. The newly discovered challenge and our proposed strategy herein offer new insights to facilitate the development of practical seawater splitting technologies powered by renewable electricity. Construction of a phosphate passivation layer on the surface of a cathode to withstand fluctuating operation in alkaline seawater is proposed following understanding the mechanism behind the dynamic evolution and degradation of cathode in intermittent electrolysis.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment use various mechanisms to evade the immune system, particularly T cell attack1. For example, metabolic reprogramming in the tumour microenvironment and mitochondrial dysfunction in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) impair antitumour immune responses2–4. However, detailed mechanisms of such processes remain unclear. Here we analyse clinical specimens and identify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in TILs that are shared with cancer cells. Moreover, mitochondria with mtDNA mutations from cancer cells are able to transfer to TILs. Typically, mitochondria in TILs readily undergo mitophagy through reactive oxygen species. However, mitochondria transferred from cancer cells do not undergo mitophagy, which we find is due to mitophagy-inhibitory molecules. These molecules attach to mitochondria and together are transferred to TILs, which results in homoplasmic replacement. T cells that acquire mtDNA mutations from cancer cells exhibit metabolic abnormalities and senescence, with defects in effector functions and memory formation. This in turn leads to impaired antitumour immunity both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, the presence of an mtDNA mutation in tumour tissue is a poor prognostic factor for immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of cancer immune evasion through mitochondrial transfer and can contribute to the development of future cancer immunotherapies. Mitochondria with mutations in their DNA from cancer cells can be transferred to T cells in the tumour microenvironment, which leads to T cell dysfunction and impaired antitumour immunity.",

    "abstract": "The Yamnaya archaeological complex appeared around 3300 bc across the steppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and by 3000 bc it reached its maximal extent, ranging from Hungary in the west to Kazakhstan in the east. To localize Yamnaya origins among the preceding Eneolithic people, we assembled ancient DNA from 435 individuals, demonstrating three genetic clines. A Caucasus–lower Volga (CLV) cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer1 ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end and a northern end at Berezhnovka along the lower Volga river. Bidirectional gene flow created intermediate populations, such as the north Caucasus Maikop people, and those at Remontnoye on the steppe. The Volga cline was formed as CLV people mixed with upriver populations of Eastern hunter-gatherer2 ancestry, creating hypervariable groups, including one at Khvalynsk. The Dnipro cline was formed when CLV people moved west, mixing with people with Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry3 along the Dnipro and Don rivers to establish Serednii Stih groups, from whom Yamnaya ancestors formed around 4000 bc and grew rapidly after 3750–3350 bc. The CLV people contributed around four-fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya and, entering Anatolia, probably from the east, at least one-tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age central Anatolians, who spoke Hittite4,5. We therefore propose that the final unity of the speakers of ‘proto-Indo-Anatolian’, the language ancestral to both Anatolian and Indo-European people, occurred in CLV people some time between 4400 bc and 4000 bc. Ancient DNA reveals how the explosive expansion of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists began with a small community north of the Black Sea speaking ancestral Indo-European, and detects genetic links with Anatolian speakers, stemming from a common Indo-Anatolian homeland in the North Caucasus–lower Volga region.",

    "abstract": "With promises for high specific energy, high safety and low cost, the all-solid-state lithium–sulfur battery (ASSLSB) is ideal for next-generation energy storage1–5. However, the poor rate performance and short cycle life caused by the sluggish solid–solid sulfur redox reaction (SSSRR) at the three-phase boundaries remain to be solved. Here we demonstrate a fast SSSRR enabled by lithium thioborophosphate iodide (LBPSI) glass-phase solid electrolytes (GSEs). On the basis of the reversible redox between I− and I2/I3−, the solid electrolyte (SE)—as well as serving as a superionic conductor—functions as a surficial redox mediator that facilitates the sluggish reactions at the solid–solid two-phase boundaries, thereby substantially increasing the density of active sites. Through this mechanism, the ASSLSB exhibits ultrafast charging capability, showing a high specific capacity of 1,497 mAh g−1sulfur on charging at 2C (30 °C), while still maintaining 784 mAh g−1sulfur at 20C. Notably, a specific capacity of 432 mAh g−1sulfur is achieved on charging at an extreme rate of 150C at 60 °C. Furthermore, the cell demonstrates superior cycling stability over 25,000 cycles with 80.2% capacity retention at 5C (25 °C). We expect that our work on redox-mediated SSSRR will pave the way for developing advanced ASSLSBs that are high energy and safe. By using lithium thioborophosphate iodide glass-phase solid electrolytes in all-solid-state lithium–sulfur batteries, fast solid–solid sulfur redox reaction is demonstrated, leading to cells with ultrafast charging capability, superior cycling stability and high capacity.",

    "abstract": "Lithium (Li) ions are central to the energy storing functionality of rechargeable batteries1. Present technology relies on sophisticated Li-inclusive electrode materials to provide Li ions and exactingly protect them to ensure a decent lifetime2. Li-deficient materials are thus excluded from battery design, and the battery fails when active Li ions are consumed3. Our study breaks this limit by means of a cell-level Li supply strategy. This involves externally adding an organic Li salt into an assembled cell, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases. This non-invasive and rapid process preserves cell integrity without necessitating disassembly. We leveraged machine learning to discover such functional salts and identified lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3) with optimal electrochemical activity, potential, product formation, electrolyte solubility and specific capacity. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated a 3.0 V, 1,192 Wh kg−1 Li-free cathode, chromium oxide, in the anode-less cell, as well as an organic sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode incorporated in a 388 Wh kg−1 pouch cell with a 440-cycle life. These systems exhibit improved energy density, enhanced sustainability and reduced cost compared with conventional Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the lifetime of commercial LiFePO4 batteries was extended by at least an order of magnitude. With repeated external Li supplies, a commercial graphite|LiFePO4 cell displayed a capacity retention of 96.0% after 11,818 cycles. A strategy is reported that improves the performance and lifetime of lithium-ion batteries by adding organic Li salt after assembly, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge for cancer vaccines is to generate long-lived functional T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Here we find that mRNA–lipoplex vaccines against somatic mutation-derived neoantigens may solve this challenge in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a lethal cancer with few mutations. At an extended 3.2-year median follow-up from a phase 1 trial of surgery, atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitory antibody), autogene cevumeran1 (individualized neoantigen vaccine with backbone-optimized uridine mRNA–lipoplex nanoparticles) and modified (m) FOLFIRINOX (chemotherapy) in patients with PDAC, we find that responders with vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8) have prolonged recurrence-free survival (RFS; median not reached) compared with non-responders without vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8; median RFS 13.4 months; P  =  0.007). In responders, autogene cevumeran induces CD8+ T cell clones with an average estimated lifespan of 7.7 years (range 1.5 to roughly 100 years), with approximately 20% of clones having latent multi-decade lifespans that may outlive hosts. Eighty-six percent of clones per patient persist at substantial frequencies approximately 3 years post-vaccination, including clones with high avidity to PDAC neoepitopes. Using PhenoTrack, a novel computational strategy to trace single T cell phenotypes, we uncover that vaccine-induced clones are undetectable in pre-vaccination tissues, and assume a cytotoxic, tissue-resident memory-like T cell state up to three years post-vaccination with preserved neoantigen-specific effector function. Two responders recurred and evidenced fewer vaccine-induced T cells. Furthermore, recurrent PDACs were pruned of vaccine-targeted cancer clones. Thus, in PDAC, autogene cevumeran induces de novo CD8+ T cells with multiyear longevity, substantial magnitude and durable effector functions that may delay PDAC recurrence. Adjuvant mRNA–lipoplex neoantigen vaccines may thus solve a pivotal obstacle for cancer vaccination. In a phase 1 trial, patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who were treated with surgery and bespoke neoantigen mRNA vaccines combined with anti-PD-L1 and chemotherapy exhibited marked long-lived persistence of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell clones, which correlated with prolonged recurrence-free survival at a 3.2-year follow-up.",

    "abstract": "At the heart of medicine lies physician–patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking enables effective diagnosis, management and enduring trust1,2. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians’ expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based3 simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE’s performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination4,5. The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians used synchronous text chat, which permits large-scale LLM–patient interactions, but this is unfamiliar in clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI. The conversational diagnostic artificial intelligence system AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer) has potential as a real-world tool for clinical history-taking and diagnostic dialogue, based on its performance in simulated consultations.",

    "abstract": "Snakebite envenoming remains a devastating and neglected tropical disease, claiming over 100,000 lives annually and causing severe complications and long-lasting disabilities for many more1,2. Three-finger toxins (3FTx) are highly toxic components of elapid snake venoms that can cause diverse pathologies, including severe tissue damage3 and inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in life-threatening neurotoxicity4. At present, the only available treatments for snakebites consist of polyclonal antibodies derived from the plasma of immunized animals, which have high cost and limited efficacy against 3FTxs5–7. Here we used deep learning methods to de novo design proteins to bind short-chain and long-chain α-neurotoxins and cytotoxins from the 3FTx family. With limited experimental screening, we obtained protein designs with remarkable thermal stability, high binding affinity and near-atomic-level agreement with the computational models. The designed proteins effectively neutralized all three 3FTx subfamilies in vitro and protected mice from a lethal neurotoxin challenge. Such potent, stable and readily manufacturable toxin-neutralizing proteins could provide the basis for safer, cost-effective and widely accessible next-generation antivenom therapeutics. Beyond snakebite, our results highlight how computational design could help democratize therapeutic discovery, particularly in resource-limited settings, by substantially reducing costs and resource requirements for the development of therapies for neglected tropical diseases. Deep learning methods have been used to design proteins that can neutralize the effects of three-finger toxins found in snake venom, which could lead to the development of safer and more accessible antivenom treatments.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease1. Despite high heritability (60–80%), the majority of the underlying genetic determinants remain unknown2. We analysed data from participants of European, East Asian, African American and Latino ancestries (n = 158,036 cases with bipolar disorder, 2.8 million controls), combining clinical, community and self-reported samples. We identified 298 genome-wide significant loci in the multi-ancestry meta-analysis, a fourfold increase over previous findings3, and identified an ancestry-specific association in the East Asian cohort. Integrating results from fine-mapping and other variant-to-gene mapping approaches identified 36 credible genes in the aetiology of bipolar disorder. Genes prioritized through fine-mapping were enriched for ultra-rare damaging missense and protein-truncating variations in cases with bipolar disorder4, highlighting convergence of common and rare variant signals. We report differences in the genetic architecture of bipolar disorder depending on the source of patient ascertainment and on bipolar disorder subtype (type I or type II). Several analyses implicate specific cell types in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, including GABAergic interneurons and medium spiny neurons. Together, these analyses provide additional insights into the genetic architecture and biological underpinnings of bipolar disorder. Using multi-ancestry genome-wide association study and fine-mapping, 298 loci and 36 credible genes are identified in the aetiology of bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "Personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) can generate circulating immune responses against predicted neoantigens1–6. However, whether such responses can target cancer driver mutations, lead to immune recognition of a patient’s tumour and result in clinical activity are largely unknown. These questions are of particular interest for patients who have tumours with a low mutational burden. Here we conducted a phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02950766) to test a neoantigen-targeting PCV in patients with high-risk, fully resected clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC; stage III or IV) with or without ipilimumab administered adjacent to the vaccine. At a median follow-up of 40.2 months after surgery, none of the 9 participants enrolled in the study had a recurrence of RCC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All patients generated T cell immune responses against the PCV antigens, including to RCC driver mutations in VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, KDM5C and PIK3CA. Following vaccination, there was a durable expansion of peripheral T cell clones. Moreover, T cell reactivity against autologous tumours was detected in seven out of nine patients. Our results demonstrate that neoantigen-targeting PCVs in high-risk RCC are highly immunogenic, capable of targeting key driver mutations and can induce antitumour immunity. These observations, in conjunction with the absence of recurrence in all nine vaccinated patients, highlights the promise of PCVs as effective adjuvant therapy in RCC. A phase I trial of a neoantigen-targeting personalized cancer vaccine led to durable and polyfunctional T cell responses and antitumour recognition, and was associated with no recurrence in patients with high-risk clear cell renal cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia1–5. Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects6–9. Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth. Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, P = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system10. Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence. Using a natural experiment that avoids common bias concerns, this study finds that the live-attenuated shingles vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis within a follow-up period of 7 years by approximately one-fifth.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the brain requires understanding neurons’ functional responses to the circuit architecture shaping them. Here we introduce the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset with dense calcium imaging of around 75,000 neurons in primary visual cortex (VISp) and higher visual areas (VISrl, VISal and VISlm) in an awake mouse that is viewing natural and synthetic stimuli. These data are co-registered with an electron microscopy reconstruction containing more than 200,000 cells and 0.5 billion synapses. Proofreading of a subset of neurons yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections that map up to thousands of cell-to-cell connections per neuron. Released as an open-access resource, this dataset includes the tools for data retrieval and analysis1,2. Accompanying studies describe its use for comprehensive characterization of cell types3–6, a synaptic level connectivity diagram of a cortical column4, and uncovering cell-type-specific inhibitory connectivity that can be linked to gene expression data4,7. Functionally, we identify new computational principles of how information is integrated across visual space8, characterize novel types of neuronal invariances9 and bring structure and function together to uncover a general principle for connectivity between excitatory neurons within and across areas10,11. Dense calcium imaging combined with co-registered high-resolution electron microscopy reconstruction of the brain of the same mouse provide a functional connectomics map of tens of thousands of neurons of a region of the primary cortex and higher visual areas.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer and trilayer graphene1–5 has generated tremendous interest. The key feature of these systems is an interplay between interlayer coupling and a moiré superlattice that gives rise to low-energy flat bands with strong correlations6. Flat bands can also be induced by moiré patterns in lattice-mismatched and/or twisted heterostructures of other two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)7,8. Although a wide range of correlated phenomena have indeed been observed in moiré TMDs9–19, robust demonstration of superconductivity has remained absent9. Here we report superconductivity in 5.0° twisted bilayer WSe2 with a maximum critical temperature of 426 mK. The superconducting state appears in a limited region of displacement field and density that is adjacent to a metallic state with a Fermi surface reconstruction believed to arise from AFM order20. A sharp boundary is observed between the superconducting and magnetic phases at low temperature, reminiscent of spin fluctuation-mediated superconductivity21. Our results establish that moiré flat-band superconductivity extends beyond graphene structures. Material properties that are absent in graphene but intrinsic among TMDs, such as a native band gap, large spin–orbit coupling, spin-valley locking and magnetism, offer the possibility of accessing a broader superconducting parameter space than graphene-only structures. We report superconductivity, in a limited region of displacement field and density, in 5.0° twisted bilayer WSe2 with a maximum critical temperature of 426 mK, establishing that moiré flat-band superconductivity extends beyond graphene structures.",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision-making is driven by multimodal data, including clinical notes and pathological characteristics. Artificial intelligence approaches that can effectively integrate multimodal data hold significant promise in advancing clinical care1,2. However, the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets in clinical settings has hindered the development of useful models. In this study, we developed the Multimodal transformer with Unified maSKed modeling (MUSK), a vision–language foundation model designed to leverage large-scale, unlabelled, unpaired image and text data. MUSK was pretrained on 50 million pathology images from 11,577 patients and one billion pathology-related text tokens using unified masked modelling. It was further pretrained on one million pathology image–text pairs to efficiently align the vision and language features. With minimal or no further training, MUSK was tested in a wide range of applications and demonstrated superior performance across 23 patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, including image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, visual question answering, image classification and molecular biomarker prediction. Furthermore, MUSK showed strong performance in outcome prediction, including melanoma relapse prediction, pan-cancer prognosis prediction and immunotherapy response prediction in lung and gastro-oesophageal cancers. MUSK effectively combined complementary information from pathology images and clinical reports and could potentially improve diagnosis and precision in cancer therapy. Trained on unlabelled, unpaired image and text data, the Multimodal transformer with Unified maSKed modeling excelled in outcome prediction, image-to-text retrieval and visual question answering, potentially improving cancer diagnosis and therapy precision.",

    "abstract": "The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above a teraelectronvolt (TeV) offers a unique exploration into astrophysical phenomena1–3. Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here we report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by KM3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea4, which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection. We detect a muon with an estimated energy of \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$12{0}_{-60}^{+110}$$\n                \n               petaelectronvolts (PeV). In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now5–7 falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino8, resulting from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe. A very high-energy muon observed by the KM3NeT experiment in the Mediterranean Sea is evidence for the interaction of an exceptionally high-energy neutrino of cosmic origin.",

    "abstract": "The peripheral nervous system (PNS) orchestrates organ function in health and disease. Most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), are infiltrated by PNS neurons, and this contributes to the complex tumour microenvironment (TME)1,2. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumour mass. Thus, cancer-innervating or healthy-organ-innervating neurons are lacking in current tissue-sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single-cell resolution, we developed Trace-n-Seq. This method uses retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia, followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing more than 5,000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons, with about 4,000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas, we reveal novel neuronal cell types and molecular networks that are distinct to the pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuron–cancer–microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic-cancer nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a pro-inflammatory TME and increases the effectiveness of immune-checkpoint inhibitors. The taxane nab-paclitaxel causes intratumoral neuropathy, which attenuates PDAC growth and, in combination with sympathetic denervation, results in synergistic tumour regression. Our multi-dimensional data provide insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, and support the inclusion of denervation in future therapies. A technique that combines retrograde axon tracing with single-cell transcriptomics is used to characterize neurons innervating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and healthy pancreas, providing insight into the role of neural connections in cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with maximized metal use and discrete energy levels hold promise for broad applications in heterogeneous catalysis, energy conversion, environmental science and biomedicine1–7. The activity and stability of SACs are governed by the pair of metal–adsorbate and metal–support interactions8–10. However, the understanding of these interactions with their catalytic performance in nature is challenging. Correlations of activity with the charge state of metal atoms have frequently reached controversial conclusions11–15. Here we report that the activity of palladium (Pd1) SACs exhibits a linear scaling relationship with the positions of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of oxide supports across 14 types of semiconductor. Elevation of the LUMO position by reducing the support particle size to a few nanometres boosts a record high activity along with excellent stability in the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. We show that the elevated LUMO of support reduces its energy gap with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Pd1 atoms, which promotes Pd1–support orbital hybridizations for high stability and further amends the LUMO of anchored Pd1 atoms to enhance Pd1–adsorbate interactions for high activity. These findings are consistent with the frontier molecular orbital theory and provide a general descriptor for the rational selection of metal–support pairs with predictable activity. The acetylene hydrogenation activity and stability of a palladium single-atom catalyst are both controlled by the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the oxide support.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is caused by the loss of dopamine neurons, causing motor symptoms. Initial cell therapies using fetal tissues showed promise but had complications and ethical concerns1–5. Pluripotent stem (PS) cells emerged as a promising alternative for developing safe and effective treatments6. In this phase I/II trial at Kyoto University Hospital, seven patients (ages 50–69) received bilateral transplantation of dopaminergic progenitors derived from induced PS (iPS) cells. Primary outcomes focused on safety and adverse events, while secondary outcomes assessed motor symptom changes and dopamine production for 24 months. There were no serious adverse events, with 73 mild to moderate events. Patients’ anti-parkinsonian medication doses were maintained unless therapeutic adjustments were required, resulting in increased dyskinesia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no graft overgrowth. Among six patients subjected to efficacy evaluation, four showed improvements in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III OFF score, and five showed improvements in the ON scores. The average changes of all six patients were 9.5 (20.4%) and 4.3 points (35.7%) for the OFF and ON scores, respectively. Hoehn–Yahr stages improved in four patients. Fluorine-18-l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) influx rate constant (Ki) values in the putamen increased by 44.7%, with higher increases in the high-dose group. Other measures showed minimal changes. This trial (jRCT2090220384) demonstrated that allogeneic iPS-cell-derived dopaminergic progenitors survived, produced dopamine and did not form tumours, therefore suggesting safety and potential clinical benefits for Parkinson’s disease. After transplantation into the brain of patients with Parkinson’s disease, allogeneic dopaminergic progenitors derived from induced pluripotent stem cells survived, produced dopamine and did not form tumours, therefore suggesting safety and potential clinical benefits for Parkinson’s disease.",

    "abstract": "Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising for high-energy-density rechargeable batteries1–3. However, Li dendrites formed by the reaction between highly active Li and non-aqueous electrolytes lead to safety concerns and rapid capacity decay4–7. Developing a reliable solid–electrolyte interphase is critical for realizing high-rate and long-life LMBs, but remains technically challenging4,8. Here we demonstrate that adding excess m-Li2ZrF6 (monoclinic) nanoparticles to a commercial LiPF6-containing carbonate electrolyte of LMBs facilitates the release of abundant ZrF62– ions into the electrolyte driven by the applied voltage, converting to t-Li2ZrF6 (trigonal) and creating a stable solid–electrolyte interphase in situ with high Li-ion conductivity. Computational and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the in situ formation of the t-Li2ZrF6-rich solid–electrolyte interphase markedly enhanced Li-ion transfer and suppressed the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, LMBs assembled with LiFePO4 cathodes (areal loading, 1.8/2.2 mAh cm−2), three-dimensional Li–carbon anodes (50-µm-thick Li) and Li2ZrF6-based electrolyte displayed greatly improved cycling stability with high capacity retention (>80.0%) after 3,000 cycles (1C/2C rate). This achievement represents leading performance and, thus, delivers a reliable Li2ZrF6-based electrolyte for durable LMBs under practical high-rate conditions. Adding excess m-Li2ZrF6 (monoclinic) nanoparticles to a commercial LiPF6-containing carbonate electrolyte forms a stable interphase rich in t-Li2ZrF6 (trigonal), enhancing Li-ion transfer, suppressing dendrite growth and considerably improving the cycling stability of high-rate lithium metal batteries.",

    "abstract": "Granzymes are a family of serine proteases that are mainly expressed by CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells and innate-like lymphocytes1. Although their primary function is thought to be the induction of cell death in virally infected cells and tumours, accumulating evidence indicates that some granzymes can elicit inflammation by acting on extracellular substrates1. We previously found that most tissue CD8+ T cells in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, and in inflamed organs for some other diseases, express granzyme K (GZMK)2, a tryptase-like protease with poorly defined function. Here, we show that GZMK can activate the complement cascade by cleaving the C2 and C4 proteins. The nascent C4b and C2b fragments form a C3 convertase that cleaves C3, enabling the assembly of a C5 convertase that cleaves C5. The resulting convertases generate all the effector molecules of the complement cascade: the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, the opsonins C4b and C3b, and the membrane attack complex. In rheumatoid arthritis synovium, GZMK is enriched in regions with abundant complement activation, and fibroblasts are the main producers of complement proteins that serve as substrates for GZMK-mediated complement activation. Furthermore, Gzmk-deficient mice are significantly protected from inflammatory disease, exhibiting reduced arthritis and dermatitis, with concomitant decreases in complement activation. Our findings describe the discovery of a previously unidentified mechanism of complement activation that is driven entirely by lymphocyte-derived GZMK. Given the widespread abundance of GZMK-expressing T cells in tissues in chronic inflammatory diseases, GZMK-mediated complement activation is likely to be an important contributor to tissue inflammation in multiple disease contexts. A study finds that a protease called granzyme K can activate the entire complement cascade, explaining how it can drive destructive inflammation in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.",

These samples span five main developmental stages, ranging from the first trimester to adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a subset of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular communication. This atlas enables us to catalogue cell-type-specific, age-specific and area-specific gene regulatory networks underlying neural differentiation. Moreover, combining single-cell profiling, progenitor purification and lineage-tracing experiments, we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis transition. We identified a tripotential intermediate progenitor subtype—tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs)—that is responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes. Notably, most glioblastoma cells resemble Tri-IPCs at the transcriptomic level, suggesting that cancer cells hijack developmental processes to enhance growth and heterogeneity. Furthermore, by integrating our atlas data with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we created a disease-risk map highlighting enriched risk associated with autism spectrum disorder in second-trimester intratelencephalic neurons. Our study sheds light on the molecular and cellular dynamics of the developing human neocortex. Tripotential intermediate progenitor cells are responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes in the human neocortex.",

    "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes can be implanted to remuscularize the failing heart1–7. Challenges include sufficient cardiomyocyte retention for a sustainable therapeutic impact without intolerable side effects, such as arrhythmia and tumour growth. We investigated the hypothesis that epicardial engineered heart muscle (EHM) allografts from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells structurally and functionally remuscularize the chronically failing heart without limiting side effects in rhesus macaques. After confirmation of in vitro and in vivo (nude rat model) equivalence of the newly developed rhesus macaque EHM model with a previously established Good Manufacturing Practice-compatible human EHM formulation8, long-term retention (up to 6 months) and dose-dependent enhancement of the target heart wall by EHM grafts constructed from 40 to 200 million cardiomyocytes/stromal cells were demonstrated in macaques with and without myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. In the heart failure model, evidence for EHM allograft-enhanced target heart wall contractility and ejection fraction, which are measures for local and global heart support, was obtained. Histopathological and gadolinium-based perfusion magnetic resonance imaging analyses confirmed cell retention and functional vascularization. Arrhythmia and tumour growth were not observed. The obtained feasibility, safety and efficacy data provided the pivotal underpinnings for the approval of a first-in-human clinical trial on tissue-engineered heart repair. Our clinical data confirmed remuscularization by EHM implantation in a patient with advanced heart failure. Epicardial engineered heart muscle allografts from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes can safely and effectively remuscularize chronically failing hearts in rhesus macaques, leading to improved cardiac function and paving the way for human clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Crystal symmetry guides the development of condensed matter. The unique crystal symmetry connecting magnetic sublattices not only distinguishes altermagnetism1–6 from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism but also enables it to combine the advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism4,5. Altermagnetic order is essentially a magnetic crystal order7, determined by the magnetic-order (Néel) vector and crystal symmetry. Previous experimental studies have concentrated on manipulating the altermagnetic symmetry by tuning the Néel vector orientations8–12. However, manipulation of the crystal symmetry, which holds great promise for manipulating the altermagnetic order, remains challenging. Here we realize the manipulation of altermagnetic order in chromium antimonide (CrSb) films via crystal symmetry. The locking between the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector and the magnetic space symmetry helps to reconstruct the altermagnetic order, from a collinear Néel vector to a canted one. It generates a room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in an altermagnet. The relative direction between the current-induced spin polarization and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector determines the switching modes of altermagnetic order, that is, parallel for the field-assisted mode in CrSb\n                \n                  \n                \n                $$(1\\bar{1}00)$$\n                \n              /Pt and non-parallel for the field-free mode in W/CrSb\n                \n                  \n                \n                $$(11\\bar{2}0)$$\n                \n              . The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector induces an asymmetric energy barrier in the field-assisted mode and generates an asymmetric driving force in the field-free mode. In particular, the latter is guaranteed by the emerging Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya torque in altermagnets. Reconstructing crystal symmetry adds a new twist to the manipulation of altermagnetic order. It not only underpins the magnetic-memory and nano-oscillator technology4,5 but also inspires crossover studies between altermagnetism and other research topics. The altermagnetic order in CrSb films can be manipulated via crystal symmetry; the reconstructed altermagnetic order generates a room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect and designable switching modes as field-assisted and field-free modes.",

    "abstract": "Glaciers are indicators of ongoing anthropogenic climate change1. Their melting leads to increased local geohazards2, and impacts marine3 and terrestrial4,5 ecosystems, regional freshwater resources6, and both global water and energy cycles7,8. Together with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, glaciers are essential drivers of present9,10 and future11–13 sea-level rise. Previous assessments of global glacier mass changes have been hampered by spatial and temporal limitations and the heterogeneity of existing data series14–16. Here we show in an intercomparison exercise that glaciers worldwide lost 273 ± 16 gigatonnes in mass annually from 2000 to 2023, with an increase of 36 ± 10% from the first (2000–2011) to the second (2012–2023) half of the period. Since 2000, glaciers have lost between 2% and 39% of their ice regionally and about 5% globally. Glacier mass loss is about 18% larger than the loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and more than twice that from the Antarctic Ice Sheet17. Our results arise from a scientific community effort to collect, homogenize, combine and analyse glacier mass changes from in situ and remote-sensing observations. Although our estimates are in agreement with findings from previous assessments14–16 at a global scale, we found some large regional deviations owing to systematic differences among observation methods. Our results provide a refined baseline for better understanding observational differences and for calibrating model ensembles12,16,18, which will help to narrow projection uncertainty for the twenty-first century11,12,18. An intercomparison exercise reassesses mass loss from glaciers worldwide based on the main in situ and satellite methods from 2000 to 2023; the results are consistent with previous assessments and provide a refined and comprehensive observational baseline for future impact and modelling studies.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell genomic technologies enable the multimodal profiling of millions of cells across temporal and spatial dimensions. However, experimental limitations hinder the comprehensive measurement of cells under native temporal dynamics and in their native spatial tissue niche. Optimal transport has emerged as a powerful tool to address these constraints and has facilitated the recovery of the original cellular context1–4. Yet, most optimal transport applications are unable to incorporate multimodal information or scale to single-cell atlases. Here we introduce multi-omics single-cell optimal transport (moscot), a scalable framework for optimal transport in single-cell genomics that supports multimodality across all applications. We demonstrate the capability of moscot to efficiently reconstruct developmental trajectories of 1.7 million cells from mouse embryos across 20 time points. To illustrate the capability of moscot in space, we enrich spatial transcriptomic datasets by mapping multimodal information from single-cell profiles in a mouse liver sample and align multiple coronal sections of the mouse brain. We present moscot.spatiotemporal, an approach that leverages gene-expression data across both spatial and temporal dimensions to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of mouse embryogenesis. We also resolve endocrine-lineage relationships of delta and epsilon cells in a previously unpublished mouse, time-resolved pancreas development dataset using paired measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our findings are confirmed through experimental validation of NEUROD2 as a regulator of epsilon progenitor cells in a model of human induced pluripotent stem cell islet cell differentiation. Moscot is available as open-source software, accompanied by extensive documentation. Moscot is an optimal transport approach that overcomes current limitations of similar methods to enable multimodal, scalable and consistent single-cell analyses of datasets across spatial and temporal dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Zoonoses are infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans. Bats have been suggested to harbour more zoonotic viruses than any other mammalian order1. Infections in bats are largely asymptomatic2,3, indicating limited tissue-damaging inflammation and immunopathology. To investigate the genomic basis of disease resistance, the Bat1K project generated reference-quality genomes of ten bat species, including potential viral reservoirs. Here we describe a systematic analysis covering 115 mammalian genomes that revealed that signatures of selection in immune genes are more prevalent in bats than in other mammalian orders. We found an excess of immune gene adaptations in the ancestral chiropteran branch and in many descending bat lineages, highlighting viral entry and detection factors, and regulators of antiviral and inflammatory responses. ISG15, which is an antiviral gene contributing to hyperinflammation during COVID-19 (refs. 4,5), exhibits key residue changes in rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats. Cellular infection experiments show species-specific antiviral differences and an essential role of protein conjugation in antiviral function of bat ISG15, separate from its role in secretion and inflammation in humans. Furthermore, in contrast to humans, ISG15 in most rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats has strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our work reveals molecular mechanisms that contribute to viral tolerance and disease resistance in bats. A systematic analysis of 115 mammalian genomes, including 10 new bat genomes, reveals prevalent positive selection in immune genes in bats and shows key adaptations in the antiviral gene ISG15 that aid disease resistance in bats, including to coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive differential diagnosis is a cornerstone of medical care that is often reached through an iterative process of interpretation that combines clinical history, physical examination, investigations and procedures. Interactive interfaces powered by large language models present new opportunities to assist and automate aspects of this process1. Here we introduce the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a large language model that is optimized for diagnostic reasoning, and evaluate its ability to generate a differential diagnosis alone or as an aid to clinicians. Twenty clinicians evaluated 302 challenging, real-world medical cases sourced from published case reports. Each case report was read by two clinicians, who were randomized to one of two assistive conditions: assistance from search engines and standard medical resources; or assistance from AMIE in addition to these tools. All clinicians provided a baseline, unassisted differential diagnosis prior to using the respective assistive tools. AMIE exhibited standalone performance that exceeded that of unassisted clinicians (top-10 accuracy 59.1% versus 33.6%, P = 0.04). Comparing the two assisted study arms, the differential diagnosis quality score was higher for clinicians assisted by AMIE (top-10 accuracy 51.7%) compared with clinicians without its assistance (36.1%; McNemar’s test: 45.7, P < 0.01) and clinicians with search (44.4%; McNemar’s test: 4.75, P = 0.03). Further, clinicians assisted by AMIE arrived at more comprehensive differential lists than those without assistance from AMIE. Our study suggests that AMIE has potential to improve clinicians’ diagnostic reasoning and accuracy in challenging cases, meriting further real-world evaluation for its ability to empower physicians and widen patients’ access to specialist-level expertise. Diagnostic reasoning using an optimized large language model with a dataset comprising real-world medical cases exhibited improved differential diagnostic performance as an assistive tool for clinicians over search engines and standard medical resources.",

Tens of millions of missense variants exist in the current human population, and the vast majority of these have unknown functional consequences. Here we present a large-scale experimental analysis of human missense variants across many different proteins. Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the effect of more than 500,000 variants on the abundance of more than 500 human protein domains. This dataset reveals that 60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We combine stability measurements with protein language models to annotate functional sites across proteins. Mutational effects on stability are largely conserved in homologous domains, enabling accurate stability prediction across entire protein families using energy models. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and training and benchmarking of computational methods. Large-scale experimental analysis of Human Domainome 1, a library containing more than 500,000 missense mutation variants across more than 500 human protein domains, reveals that 60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce stability of protein domains.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory diseases are often chronic and recurrent, and current treatments do not typically remove underlying disease drivers1. T cells participate in a wide range of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis2, Crohn’s disease3, oesophagitis4 and multiple sclerosis5,6, and clonally expanded antigen-specific T cells may contribute to disease chronicity and recurrence, in part by forming persistent pathogenic memory. Chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma are inflammatory airway diseases that often present as comorbidities7. Chronic rhinosinusitis affects more than 10% of the general population8. Among these patients, 20–25% would develop nasal polyps, which often require repeated surgical resections owing to a high incidence of recurrence9. Whereas abundant T cells infiltrate the nasal polyps tissue10,11, T cell subsets that drive the disease pathology and promote recurrence are not fully understood. By comparing T cell repertoires in nasal polyp tissues obtained from consecutive surgeries, here we report that persistent CD8+ T cell clones carrying effector memory-like features colonize the mucosal tissue during disease recurrence, and these cells characteristically express the tryptase Granzyme K (GZMK). We find that GZMK cleaves many complement components, including C2, C3, C4 and C5, that collectively contribute to the activation of the complement cascade. GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells participate in organized tertiary lymphoid structures, and tissue GZMK levels predict the disease severity and comorbidities better than well-established biomarkers such as eosinophilia and tissue interleukin-5. Using a mouse asthma model, we further show that GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells exacerbate the disease in a manner dependent on the proteolytic activity of GZMK and complements. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of GZMK after the disease onset markedly alleviates tissue pathology and restores lung function. Our work identifies a pathogenic CD8+ memory T cell subset that promotes tissue inflammation and recurrent airway diseases by the effector molecule GZMK and suggests GZMK as a potential therapeutic target. Comparing T cells in nasal polyps from repeated surgeries shows that effector memory-like persistent clones colonize the mucosal tissue during disease recurrence and promote inflammation by producing Granzyme K, a complement-activating tryptase, which is a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Mitigating loss of genetic diversity is a major global biodiversity challenge1–4. To meet recent international commitments to maintain genetic diversity within species5,6, we need to understand relationships between threats, conservation management and genetic diversity change. Here we conduct a global analysis of genetic diversity change via meta-analysis of all available temporal measures of genetic diversity from more than three decades of research. We show that within-population genetic diversity is being lost over timescales likely to have been impacted by human activities, and that some conservation actions may mitigate this loss. Our dataset includes 628 species (animals, plants, fungi and chromists) across all terrestrial and most marine realms on Earth. Threats impacted two-thirds of the populations that we analysed, and less than half of the populations analysed received conservation management. Genetic diversity loss occurs globally and is a realistic prediction for many species, especially birds and mammals, in the face of threats such as land use change, disease, abiotic natural phenomena and harvesting or harassment. Conservation strategies designed to improve environmental conditions, increase population growth rates and introduce new individuals (for example, restoring connectivity or performing translocations) may maintain or even increase genetic diversity. Our findings underscore the urgent need for active, genetically informed conservation interventions to halt genetic diversity loss. A comprehensive meta-analysis of global terrestrial and marine genetic diversity covering more than three decades of research demonstrates rapid loss of genetic diversity and identifies conservation interventions that could mitigate this process.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasmall CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) are the most promising candidates for realizing efficient and stable pure-red perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs)1–5. However, it is challenging for ultrasmall CsPbI3 QDs to retain their solution-phase properties when they assemble into conductive films, greatly hindering their device application3,6. Here we report an approach for in situ deposit stabilized ultrasmall CsPbI3 QD conductive solids, by constructing CsPbI3 QD/quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite heteroepitaxy. The well-aligned periodic array of edge-oriented ligands at heterointerface triggers a substantial octahedral tilting in a critical layer thickness of CsPbI3 QDs, which heightens the Gibbs free energy difference between the tilted-CsPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 leading to thermodynamic stabilization of CsPbI3 QDs. The approach allows us to fabricate stabilized CsPbI3 QD conductive films with tunable emission covering the entire red spectral region from 600 nm to 710 nm. Here we report the pure-red PeLEDs with narrow electroluminescence peak centred at 630 nm, matching the Rec. 2100 standard for ultrahigh-definition display. The champion device exhibits a certified external quantum efficiency of 24.6% and a half-lifetime of 6,330 min, ranking as one of the most efficient and stable pure-red PeLED reported to date. The approach is also compatible with large-area manufacturing, enabling 1 cm2 PeLED to exhibit the best external quantum efficiency of 20.5% at 630 nm. A heteroepitaxial-strain-based strategy for enhancing the stability of perovskite quantum dots for spectrally narrow (pure) red LEDs is reported.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from primary tumours to distant organs and is the cause of 90% of cancer deaths globally1,2. Metastasizing cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, as they are initially deprived of the immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours3. There is interest in therapeutically exploiting this immune vulnerability to prevent recurrence in patients with early cancer at risk of metastasis. Here we show that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), including aspirin, enhance immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). TXA2 acts on T cells to trigger an immunosuppressive pathway that is dependent on the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases. Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner that is dependent on T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo. These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway that limits T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 releases T cells from immunosuppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2, thereby enhancing the immune response against metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Biological ageing can be defined as a gradual loss of homeostasis across various aspects of molecular and cellular function1,2. Mammalian brains consist of thousands of cell types3, which may be differentially susceptible or resilient to ageing. Here we present a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing dataset containing roughly 1.2 million high-quality single-cell transcriptomes of brain cells from young adult and aged mice of both sexes, from regions spanning the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. High-resolution clustering of all cells results in 847 cell clusters and reveals at least 14 age-biased clusters that are mostly glial types. At the broader cell subclass and supertype levels, we find age-associated gene expression signatures and provide a list of 2,449 unique differentially expressed genes (age-DE genes) for many neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Whereas most age-DE genes are unique to specific cell types, we observe common signatures with ageing across cell types, including a decrease in expression of genes related to neuronal structure and function in many neuron types, major astrocyte types and mature oligodendrocytes, and an increase in expression of genes related to immune function, antigen presentation, inflammation, and cell motility in immune cell types and some vascular cell types. Finally, we observe that some of the cell types that demonstrate the greatest sensitivity to ageing are concentrated around the third ventricle in the hypothalamus, including tanycytes, ependymal cells, and certain neuron types in the arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and paraventricular nucleus that express genes canonically related to energy homeostasis. Many of these types demonstrate both a decrease in neuronal function and an increase in immune response. These findings suggest that the third ventricle in the hypothalamus may be a hub for ageing in the mouse brain. Overall, this study systematically delineates a dynamic landscape of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal ageing that will serve as a foundation for the investigation of functional changes in ageing and the interaction of ageing and disease. A comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing study delineates cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal ageing that will inform the investigation into functional changes and the interaction of ageing and disease.",

    "abstract": "Metabolites derived from the intestinal microbiota, including bile acids (BA), extensively modulate vertebrate physiology, including development1, metabolism2–4, immune responses5–7 and cognitive function8. However, to what extent host responses balance the physiological effects of microbiota-derived metabolites remains unclear9,10. Here, using untargeted metabolomics of mouse tissues, we identified a family of BA–methylcysteamine (BA–MCY) conjugates that are abundant in the intestine and dependent on vanin 1 (VNN1), a pantetheinase highly expressed in intestinal tissues. This host-dependent MCY conjugation inverts BA function in the hepatobiliary system. Whereas microbiota-derived free BAs function as agonists of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and negatively regulate BA production, BA–MCYs act as potent antagonists of FXR and promote expression of BA biosynthesis genes in vivo. Supplementation with stable-isotope-labelled BA–MCY increased BA production in an FXR-dependent manner, and BA–MCY supplementation in a mouse model of hypercholesteraemia decreased lipid accumulation in the liver, consistent with BA–MCYs acting as intestinal FXR antagonists. The levels of BA–MCY were reduced in microbiota-deficient mice and restored by transplantation of human faecal microbiota. Dietary intervention with inulin fibre further increased levels of both free BAs and BA–MCY levels, indicating that BA–MCY production by the host is regulated by levels of microbiota-derived free BAs. We further show that diverse BA–MCYs are also present in human serum. Together, our results indicate that BA–MCY conjugation by the host balances host-dependent and microbiota-dependent metabolic pathways that regulate FXR-dependent physiology. A family of host-derived bile acid–methylcysteamine conjugates functions as FXR antagonists, forming part of a microbiota-dependent metabolic network that regulates FXR-dependent physiology.",

    "abstract": "Human activities drive a wide range of environmental pressures, including habitat change, pollution and climate change, resulting in unprecedented effects on biodiversity1,2. However, despite decades of research, generalizations on the dimensions and extent of human impacts on biodiversity remain ambiguous. Mixed views persist on the trajectory of biodiversity at the local scale3 and even more so on the biotic homogenization of biodiversity across space4,5. We compiled 2,133 publications covering 97,783 impacted and reference sites, creating an unparallelled dataset of 3,667 independent comparisons of biodiversity impacts across all main organismal groups, habitats and the five most predominant human pressures1,6. For all comparisons, we quantified three key measures of biodiversity to assess how these human pressures drive homogenization and shifts in composition of biological communities across space and changes in local diversity, respectively. We show that human pressures distinctly shift community composition and decrease local diversity across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Yet, contrary to long-standing expectations, there is no clear general homogenization of communities. Critically, the direction and magnitude of biodiversity changes vary across pressures, organisms and scales at which they are studied. Our exhaustive global analysis reveals the general impact and key mediating factors of human pressures on biodiversity and can benchmark conservation strategies. Key measures of biodiversity were quantified and found to be affected by human pressures that shifted community composition and decreased local diversity across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) powers brain activity1,2, and mitochondrial defects are linked to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders3,4. To understand the basis of brain activity and behaviour, there is a need to define the molecular energetic landscape of the brain5–10. Here, to bridge the scale gap between cognitive neuroscience and cell biology, we developed a physical voxelization approach to partition a frozen human coronal hemisphere section into 703 voxels comparable to neuroimaging resolution (3 × 3 × 3 mm). In each cortical and subcortical brain voxel, we profiled mitochondrial phenotypes, including OXPHOS enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA and volume density, and mitochondria-specific respiratory capacity. We show that the human brain contains diverse mitochondrial phenotypes driven by both topology and cell types. Compared with white matter, grey matter contains >50% more mitochondria. Moreover, the mitochondria in grey matter are biochemically optimized for energy transformation, particularly among recently evolved cortical brain regions. Scaling these data to the whole brain, we created a backwards linear regression model that integrates several neuroimaging modalities11 to generate a brain-wide map of mitochondrial distribution and specialization. This model predicted mitochondrial characteristics in an independent brain region of the same donor brain. This approach and the resulting MitoBrainMap of mitochondrial phenotypes provide a foundation for exploring the molecular energetic landscape that enables normal brain function. This resource also relates to neuroimaging data and defines the subcellular basis for regionalized brain processes relevant to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. All data are available at \n                http://humanmitobrainmap.bcblab.com\n                \n              . The ability to physically partition the human brain at a spatial resolution comparable to neuroimaging methods enabled the development of a brain-wide atlas of mitochondrial content, specialization and enzymatic oxidation and phosphorylation activities.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation, which involves a complex interplay between regulatory sequences and proteins, directs all biological processes. Computational models of transcription lack generalizability to accurately extrapolate to unseen cell types and conditions. Here we introduce GET (general expression transformer), an interpretable foundation model designed to uncover regulatory grammars across 213 human fetal and adult cell types1,2. Relying exclusively on chromatin accessibility data and sequence information, GET achieves experimental-level accuracy in predicting gene expression even in previously unseen cell types3. GET also shows remarkable adaptability across new sequencing platforms and assays, enabling regulatory inference across a broad range of cell types and conditions, and uncovers universal and cell-type-specific transcription factor interaction networks. We evaluated its performance in prediction of regulatory activity, inference of regulatory elements and regulators, and identification of physical interactions between transcription factors and found that it outperforms current models4 in predicting lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay readout5,6. In fetal erythroblasts7, we identified distal (greater than 1 Mbp) regulatory regions that were missed by previous models, and, in B cells, we identified a lymphocyte-specific transcription factor–transcription factor interaction that explains the functional significance of a leukaemia risk predisposing germline mutation8–10. In sum, we provide a generalizable and accurate model for transcription together with catalogues of gene regulation and transcription factor interactions, all with cell type specificity. A foundation model learns transcriptional regulatory syntax from chromatin accessibility and sequence data across a range of cell types to predict gene expression and transcription factor interactions, with generalizability to unseen cell types.",

    "abstract": "T cell exhaustion limits effector T cell function in chronic infection and tumours1,2. The development of these hypofunctional T cells and of their precursors was considered to require stimulatory conditions that are met only after persistent exposure to antigen and inflammation. Here we show, however, that similar T cell populations exist in the early phase of acute infections1,2. At that stage, the early developing TCF1+ precursor population exhibits an unexpected diversity; it includes precursors of normal memory T cells, but also cells with phenotypic, gene-expression and epigenetic profiles that resemble those of precursors of exhausted T cells found in chronic infections. We show that high ligand affinity promotes and PD-1 signalling restricts the development of these precursors. Although the exhausted precursors are at first found frequently, they decline without being completely lost in infections that the immune system resolves. We therefore conclude that precursor T cells with at least two distinct phenotypes are pre-emptively generated irrespective of the outcome of an infection. T cell exhaustion was thought to be strictly associated only with chronic infections and tumours, but it turns out that acute infections also generate a subset of precursor T cells with exhaustion-like phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The use of reactive supports to disperse metal species is crucial for constructing highly efficient interfacial catalysts, by tuning the competitive reactant adsorption–activation pattern in supported metal catalysts into a non-competitive mechanism1–3. However, these reactive supports are prone to deterioration during catalysis, limiting the lifespan of the catalyst and their potential practical applications4. New strategies are needed to simultaneously protect reactive supports and surface metal species without compromising the inherent catalytic performance. Here we report a new strategy to augment the structural stability of highly active interfacial catalysts by using inert nano-overlays to partially shield and partition the surface of the reactive support. Specifically, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/γ-Mo2N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of γ-Mo2N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation. This strategy yields an efficient and highly durable catalyst for hydrogen production by methanol-reforming reaction with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading, exhibiting a record-high turnover number, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 and a notable apparent turnover frequency of \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$\\mathrm{24,500}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}$$\n                \n              . This innovative approach showcases the prospects of reducing noble metal consumption and boosting longevity, which could be applied to design effective and stable heterogeneous catalysts. Atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/γ-Mo2N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of γ-Mo2N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation, without compromising the intrinsic activity of active Pt@Mo2N interface.",

    "abstract": "Plant absorption is important for the entry of many pollutants into food chains. Although terrestrial microplastics (MPs) can be absorbed by the roots1,2, their upward translocation is slow1. Meanwhile, atmospheric MPs are widely present3,4, but strong evidence on their direct absorption by plants is still lacking. Here, analyses using mass spectrometry detection show the widespread occurrence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) polymers and oligomers in plant leaves, and identify that their levels increase with atmospheric concentrations and the leaf growth duration. The concentrations of PET and PS polymers can reach up to 104 ng per g dry weight in leaves at the high-pollution areas studied, such as the Dacron factory and a landfill site, and 102–103 ng per g dry weight of PET and PS can be detected in the open-air-grown leafy vegetables. Nano-sized PET and PS particles in the leaves were visually detected by hyperspectral imaging and atomic force microscopy–infrared spectroscopy. Absorption of the proactively exposed non-labelled, fluorescently labelled or europium-labelled plastic particles by maize (Zea mays L.) leaves through stomatal pathways, as well as their translocation to the vascular tissue through the apoplastic pathway, and accumulation in trichomes was identified using hyperspectral imaging, confocal microscopy and laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrate that the absorption and accumulation of atmospheric MPs by plant leaves occur widely in the environment, and this should not be neglected when assessing the exposure of humans and other organisms to environmental MPs. Absorption and accumulation of atmospheric microplastics by plant leaves occurs widely in the environment.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical force is an essential feature for many physical and biological processes1–7, and remote measurement of mechanical signals with high sensitivity and spatial resolution is needed for diverse applications, including robotics8, biophysics9,10, energy storage11 and medicine12,13. Nanoscale luminescent force sensors excel at measuring piconewton forces, whereas larger sensors have proven powerful in probing micronewton forces14–16. However, large gaps remain in the force magnitudes that can be probed remotely from subsurface or interfacial sites, and no individual, non-invasive sensor is capable of measuring over the large dynamic range needed to understand many systems14,17. Here we demonstrate Tm3+-doped avalanching-nanoparticle18 force sensors that can be addressed remotely by deeply penetrating near-infrared light and can detect piconewton to micronewton forces with a dynamic range spanning more than four orders of magnitude. Using atomic force microscopy coupled with single-nanoparticle optical spectroscopy, we characterize the mechanical sensitivity of the photon-avalanching process and reveal its exceptional force responsiveness. By manipulating the Tm3+ concentrations and energy transfer within the nanosensors, we demonstrate different optical force-sensing modalities, including mechanobrightening and mechanochromism. The adaptability of these nanoscale optical force sensors, along with their multiscale-sensing capability, enable operation in the dynamic and versatile environments present in real-world, complex structures spanning biological organisms to nanoelectromechanical systems. An avalanching-nanoparticle force sensor that can operate in the piconewton-to-micronewton range with exceptional force responsiveness is achieved by using the mechanical sensitivity of the photon-avalanching process.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the origin and differentiation of stem-like CD8+ T cells that are essential for sustained T cell immunity in chronic viral infections and cancer and also have a key role in PD-1 directed immunotherapy1–10. These PD-1+TCF-1+TOX+ stem-like CD8+ T cells (also known as precursors of exhausted T cells8,9) have a distinct program that enables them to adapt to chronic antigen stimulation. Here, using the mouse model of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, we find that virus-specific stem-like CD8+ T cells are generated early (day 5) during chronic infection, suggesting that this crucial fate commitment occurs irrespective of the infection outcome. Indeed, we find that nearly identical populations of stem-like CD8+ T cells were generated early during acute or chronic LCMV infection, and that antigen was essential for maintaining the stem-like phenotype. We performed reciprocal adoptive transfer experiments to determine the fate of these early stem-like CD8+ T cells after viral clearance versus persistence. After transfer of day 5 stem-like CD8+ T cells from chronically infected mice into acutely infected mice, these cells downregulated canonical markers of the chronic stem-like CD8+ T cells and expressed markers (CD127 and CD62L) associated with central memory CD8+ T cells. Reciprocally, when day 5 stem-like cells from acutely infected mice were transferred into chronically infected mice, these CD8+ T cells functioned like chronic resource cells and responded effectively to PD-1 therapy. These findings highlight the ability of these early PD-1+TCF-1+TOX+ stem-like CD8+ T cells to adapt their differentiation trajectory to either an acute or a chronic viral infection. Importantly, our study shows that the host is prepared a priori to deal with a potential chronic infection. Stem-like CD8+ T cells specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus are generated early during chronic infection, suggesting that this crucial fate commitment occurs irrespective of the infection outcome.",

    "abstract": "Methane, the main component of natural and shale gas, is a significant carbon source for chemical synthesis. The direct partial oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenates under mild conditions1–3 is an attractive pathway, but the inertness of the molecule makes it challenging to achieve simultaneously high conversion and high selectivity towards a single target product. This difficulty is amplified when aiming for more valuable products that require C–C coupling4,5. Whereas selective partial methane oxidation processes1–3,6–9 have thus typically generated C1 oxygenates6,7, recent reports have documented photocatalytic methane conversion to the C2 oxygenate ethanol with low conversions but good-to-high selectivities4,5,8–12. Here we show that the intramolecular junction photocatalyst covalent triazine-based framework-1 with alternating benzene and triazine motifs13,14 drives methane coupling and oxidation to ethanol with a high selectivity and significantly improved conversion. The heterojunction architecture not only enables efficient and long-lived separation of charges after their generation, but also preferential adsorption of H2O and O2 to the triazine and benzene units, respectively. This dual-site feature separates C–C coupling to form ethane intermediates from the sites where •OH radicals are formed, thereby avoiding over-oxidation. When loaded with Pt to further boost performance, the molecular heterojunction photocatalyst generates ethanol in a packed-bed flow reactor with greatly improved conversion that results in an apparent quantum efficiency of 9.4%. We anticipate that further developing the ‘intramolecular junction’ approach will deliver efficient and selective catalysts for C–C coupling, pertaining, but not limited, to methane conversion to C2+ chemicals. Mechanistic insights into a photocatalyst with an intramolecular junction and two different active sites could inspire further exploration of ‘intramolecular heterojunctions’ as the basis of selective and stable photocatalysts for C–H activation and C–C coupling.",

    "abstract": "Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, ideally enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity1,2. Photonic networks are well suited as a versatile and reconfigurable interconnect layer for DQC; remote entanglement shared between matter qubits across the network enables all-to-all logical connectivity through quantum gate teleportation (QGT)3,4. For a scalable DQC architecture, the QGT implementation must be deterministic and repeatable; until now, no demonstration has satisfied these requirements. Here we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of quantum computations between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules. The modules, separated by about two metres, each contain dedicated network and circuit qubits. By using heralded remote entanglement between the network qubits, we deterministically teleport a controlled-Z (CZ) gate between two circuit qubits in separate modules, achieving 86% fidelity. We then execute Grover’s search algorithm5—to our knowledge, the first implementation of a distributed quantum algorithm comprising several non-local two-qubit gates—and measure a 71% success rate. Furthermore, we implement distributed iSWAP and SWAP circuits, compiled with two and three instances of QGT, respectively, demonstrating the ability to distribute arbitrary two-qubit operations6. As photons can be interfaced with a variety of systems, the versatile DQC architecture demonstrated here provides a viable pathway towards large-scale quantum computing for a range of physical platforms. The distribution of quantum computations is demonstrated between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules, using repeatable, deterministic teleported controlled-Z gates to perform Grover’s search algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) bilayer nickelate superconductors under high pressure has opened a new chapter in high-transition-temperature superconductivity1–8. However, the high-pressure conditions and presence of impurity phases have hindered comprehensive investigations into their superconducting properties and potential applications. Here we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset above the McMillan limit (40 K) in RP bilayer nickelate epitaxial thin films. Three-unit-cell-thick La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 pure-phase single-crystal films are grown using the gigantic-oxidative atomic layer-by-layer epitaxy on SrLaAlO4 substrates9. Resistivity measurements and magnetic field responses indicate onset transition temperature of 45 K. The transition to zero resistance shows characteristics consistent with a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT) behaviour, with TBKT = 9 K. The Meissner diamagnetic effect is observed at 8 K by using a mutual inductance setup, in agreement with the BKT-like transition. In- and out-of-plane critical magnetic fields show anisotropy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy images and X-ray reciprocal space mappings reveal that the RP bilayer nickelate films adopt a tetragonal phase under roughly 2% coherent epitaxial compressive strain in the NiO2 planes relative to the bulk. Our findings pave the way for comprehensive investigations of nickelate superconductors under ambient pressure conditions and for exploring superconductivity at higher transition temperatures through strain engineering in heterostructures. Ambient-pressure superconductivity onset above the McMillan limit in bilayer nickelate epitaxial thin films is reported, paving the way for comprehensive investigations of superconductors and for exploring superconductivity at higher transition temperatures in heterostructures.",

    "abstract": "The fusion of non-Abelian anyons is a fundamental operation in measurement-only topological quantum computation1. In one-dimensional topological superconductors (1DTSs)2–4, fusion amounts to a determination of the shared fermion parity of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here we introduce a device architecture5 that is compatible with future tests of fusion rules. We implement a single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity6–11 in indium arsenide–aluminium heterostructures with a gate-defined superconducting nanowire12–14. The interferometer is formed by tunnel-coupling the proximitized nanowire to quantum dots. The nanowire causes a state-dependent shift of the quantum capacitance of these quantum dots of up to 1 fF. Our quantum-capacitance measurements show flux h/2e-periodic bimodality with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1 in 3.6 μs at optimal flux values. From the time traces of the quantum-capacitance measurements, we extract a dwell time in the two associated states that is longer than 1 ms at in-plane magnetic fields of approximately 2 T. We discuss the interpretation of our measurements in terms of both topologically trivial and non-trivial origins. The large capacitance shift and long poisoning time enable a parity measurement with an assignment error probability of 1%. A device architecture based on indium arsenide–aluminium heterostructures with a gate-defined superconducting nanowire allows single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity and demonstrates an assignment error probability of 1%.",

    "abstract": "The most dynamic and repetitive regions of great ape genomes have traditionally been excluded from comparative studies1–3. Consequently, our understanding of the evolution of our species is incomplete. Here we present haplotype-resolved reference genomes and comparative analyses of six ape species: chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan and siamang. We achieve chromosome-level contiguity with substantial sequence accuracy (<1 error in 2.7 megabases) and completely sequence 215 gapless chromosomes telomere-to-telomere. We resolve challenging regions, such as the major histocompatibility complex and immunoglobulin loci, to provide in-depth evolutionary insights. Comparative analyses enabled investigations of the evolution and diversity of regions previously uncharacterized or incompletely studied without bias from mapping to the human reference genome. Such regions include newly minted gene families in lineage-specific segmental duplications, centromeric DNA, acrocentric chromosomes and subterminal heterochromatin. This resource serves as a comprehensive baseline for future evolutionary studies of humans and our closest living ape relatives. Complete sequences of chromosomes telomere-to-telomere from chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan and siamang provide a comprehensive and valuable resource for future evolutionary comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Integrated photonics, particularly silicon photonics, have emerged as cutting-edge technology driven by promising applications such as short-reach communications, autonomous driving, biosensing and photonic computing1–4. As advances in AI lead to growing computing demands, photonic computing has gained considerable attention as an appealing candidate. Nonetheless, there are substantial technical challenges in the scaling up of integrated photonics systems to realize these advantages, such as ensuring consistent performance gains in upscaled integrated device clusters, establishing standard designs and verification processes for complex circuits, as well as packaging large-scale systems. These obstacles arise primarily because of the relative immaturity of integrated photonics manufacturing and the scarcity of advanced packaging solutions involving photonics. Here we report a large-scale integrated photonic accelerator comprising more than 16,000 photonic components. The accelerator is designed to deliver standard linear matrix multiply–accumulate (MAC) functions, enabling computing with high speed up to 1 GHz frequency and low latency as small as 3 ns per cycle. Logic, memory and control functions that support photonic matrix MAC operations were designed into a cointegrated electronics chip. To seamlessly integrate the electronics and photonics chips at the commercial scale, we have made use of an innovative 2.5D hybrid advanced packaging approach. Through the development of this accelerator system, we demonstrate an ultralow computation latency for heuristic solvers of computationally hard Ising problems whose performance greatly relies on the computing latency. A large-scale photonic accelerator comprising more than 16,000 components integrated on a single chip to process MAC operations is described, demonstrating ultralow latency and reduced computing time compared with a commercially available GPU.",

    "abstract": "Inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) are genetic disorders that underlie susceptibility to infection, autoimmunity, autoinflammation, allergy and/or malignancy1. Incomplete penetrance is common among IEIs despite their monogenic basis2. Here we investigate the contribution of autosomal random monoallelic expression (aRMAE), a somatic commitment to the expression of one allele3,4, to phenotypic variability observed in families with IEIs. Using a clonal primary T cell system to assess aRMAE status of genes in healthy individuals, we find that 4.30% of IEI genes and 5.20% of all genes undergo aRMAE. Perturbing H3K27me3 and DNA methylation alters allele expression commitment, in support of two proposed mechanisms5,6 for the regulation of aRMAE. We tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with IEIs with shared genetic lesions but discordant clinical phenotypes for aRMAE. Among two relatives who were heterozygous for a mutation in PLCG2 (delEx19), an antibody deficiency phenotype corresponds to selective mutant allele expression in B cells. By contrast, among relatives who were heterozygous for a mutation in JAK1 (c.2099G>A; p.S700N), the unaffected carrier T cells predominantly expressed the wild-type JAK1 allele, whereas the affected carrier T cells exhibited biallelic expression. Allelic expression bias was also documented in phenotypically discordant family members with mutations in STAT1 and CARD11. This study highlights the importance of considering both the genotype and the ‘transcriptotype’ in analyses of the penetrance and expressivity of monogenic disorders. Somatically determined preferential allelic expression of select genes that when mutated cause inborn errors of immunity corresponds with disease phenotypes, suggesting that the penetrance and expressivity of monogenic disorders is also dependent on the ‘transcriptotype’.",

    "abstract": "Piezoelectric materials directly convert between electrical and mechanical energies. They are used as transducers in applications such as nano-positioning and ultrasound imaging. Improving the properties of these devices requires piezoelectric materials capable of delivering a large longitudinal strain on the application of an electric field. A large longitudinal strain of more than 1% is generally anticipated in suitably oriented single crystals of specific compositions of ferroelectric materials1. Polycrystalline piezoceramics typically show a longitudinal strain of approximately 0.2–0.4%. We demonstrate that when the thickness of a polycrystalline piezoceramic is reduced to such an extent that a large fraction of the grains are in the triaxial–biaxal crossover regime, the domain-switching fraction increases considerably. If the positive and the negative surfaces of the piezoceramic respond to electric fields symmetrically, as in the classical PbZrxTixO3, a longitudinal strain of approximately 1% can be achieved in a 0.2 mm disc of the morphotropic phase boundary composition (a 300% increase from a thickness of 0.7 mm). We show that oxygen vacancies in piezoceramics cause asymmetrical switching at the positive and negative surfaces, which causes thin piezoceramics to bend. We expect these findings will encourage further engineering of these mechanisms across different piezoelectric material systems, opening new applications for electromechanical actuation. We find that if the thickness of a polycrystalline piezoceramic is reduced such that a large fraction of the grains are in the triaxial–biaxal crossover regime, the longitudinal strain is enhanced and the piezoceramic bends.",

    "abstract": "Molecular recognition events between proteins drive biological processes in living systems1. However, higher levels of mechanistic regulation have emerged, in which protein–protein interactions are conditioned to small molecules2–5. Despite recent advances, computational tools for the design of new chemically induced protein interactions have remained a challenging task for the field6,7. Here we present a computational strategy for the design of proteins that target neosurfaces, that is, surfaces arising from protein–ligand complexes. To develop this strategy, we leveraged a geometric deep learning approach based on learned molecular surface representations8,9 and experimentally validated binders against three drug-bound protein complexes: Bcl2–venetoclax, DB3–progesterone and PDF1–actinonin. All binders demonstrated high affinities and accurate specificities, as assessed by mutational and structural characterization. Remarkably, surface fingerprints previously trained only on proteins could be applied to neosurfaces induced by interactions with small molecules, providing a powerful demonstration of generalizability that is uncommon in other deep learning approaches. We anticipate that such designed chemically induced protein interactions will have the potential to expand the sensing repertoire and the assembly of new synthetic pathways in engineered cells for innovative drug-controlled cell-based therapies10. A computational deep learning approach is used to design synthetic proteins that target the neosurfaces formed by protein–ligand interactions, with applications in the development of new therapeutic modalities such as molecular glues or cell-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "The human genome contains millions of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) with cell-type-specific activities that shape both health and many disease states1. However, we lack a functional understanding of the sequence features that control the activity and cell-type-specific features of these cCREs. Here we used lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assays (lentiMPRAs) to test the regulatory activity of more than 680,000 sequences, representing an extensive set of annotated cCREs among three cell types (HepG2, K562 and WTC11), and found that 41.7% of these sequences were active. By testing sequences in both orientations, we find promoters to have strand-orientation biases and their 200-nucleotide cores to function as non-cell-type-specific ‘on switches’ that provide similar expression levels to their associated gene. By contrast, enhancers have weaker orientation biases, but increased tissue-specific characteristics. Utilizing our lentiMPRA data, we develop sequence-based models to predict cCRE function and variant effects with high accuracy, delineate regulatory motifs and model their combinatorial effects. Testing a lentiMPRA library encompassing 60,000 cCREs in all three cell types further identified factors that determine cell-type specificity. Collectively, our work provides an extensive catalogue of functional CREs in three widely used cell lines and showcases how large-scale functional measurements can be used to dissect regulatory grammar. Lentivirus-based reporter assays for 680,000 regulatory sequences from three cell lines coupled to machine-learning models lead to insights into the grammar of cis-regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "The precise control of mechanochemical activation within deep tissues using non-invasive ultrasound holds profound implications for advancing our understanding of fundamental biomedical sciences and revolutionizing disease treatments1–4. However, a theory-guided mechanoresponsive materials system with well-defined ultrasound activation has yet to be explored5,6. Here we present the concept of using porous hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) as toolkits for focused ultrasound (FUS) programmably triggered drug activation to control specific cellular events in the deep brain, through on-demand scission of the supramolecular interactions. A theoretical model is developed to potentially visualize the mechanochemical scission and ultrasound mechanics, providing valuable guidelines for the rational design of mechanoresponsive materials to achieve programmable control. To demonstrate the practicality of this approach, we encapsulate the designer drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO) into the optimal HOF nanocrystals for FUS-gated release to activate engineered G-protein-coupled receptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of mice and rats and hence achieve targeted neural circuit modulation even at depth 9 mm with a latency of seconds. This work demonstrates the capability of ultrasound to precisely control molecular interactions and develops ultrasound-programmable HOFs to non-invasively and spatiotemporally control cellular events, thereby facilitating the establishment of precise molecular therapeutic possibilities. The concept of using hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks triggered by non-invasive focused ultrasound for programmable drug activation is explored and demonstrated practically with the designer drug clozapine N-oxide for deep brain stimulation in mice and rats.",

    "abstract": "High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the leading cause of brain cancer-related death. HGGs include clinically, anatomically and molecularly distinct subtypes that stratify into diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), such as H3K27M-altered diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and hemispheric HGGs, such as IDH wild-type glioblastoma. Neuronal activity drives glioma progression through paracrine signalling1,2 and neuron-to-glioma synapses3–6. Glutamatergic AMPA receptor-dependent synapses between neurons and glioma cells have been demonstrated in paediatric3 and adult4 high-grade gliomas, and early work has suggested heterogeneous glioma GABAergic responses7. However, neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by neurotransmitters other than glutamate remain understudied. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, in vivo optogenetics and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models, we identified functional, tumour-promoting GABAergic neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by GABAA receptors in DMGs. GABAergic input has a depolarizing effect on DMG cells due to NKCC1 chloride transporter function and consequently elevated intracellular chloride concentration in DMG malignant cells. As membrane depolarization increases glioma proliferation3,6, we found that the activity of GABAergic interneurons promotes DMG proliferation in vivo. The benzodiazepine lorazepam enhances GABA-mediated signalling, increases glioma proliferation and growth, and shortens survival in DMG patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models. By contrast, only minimal depolarizing GABAergic currents were found in hemispheric HGGs and lorazepam did not influence the growth rate of hemispheric glioblastoma xenografts. Together, these findings uncover growth-promoting GABAergic synaptic communication between GABAergic neurons and H3K27M-altered DMG cells, underscoring a tumour subtype-specific mechanism of brain cancer neurophysiology. Functional, tumour-promoting GABAergic neuron-to-glioma synapses in diffuse midline gliomas are identified.",

Here we introduce a manufacturable platform7 for quantum computing with photons. We benchmark a set of monolithically integrated silicon-photonics-based modules to generate, manipulate, network and detect heralded photonic qubits, demonstrating dual-rail photonic qubits with 99.98% ± 0.01% state preparation and measurement fidelity, Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) quantum interference between independent photon sources with 99.50% ± 0.25% visibility, two-qubit fusion with 99.22% ± 0.12% fidelity and a chip-to-chip qubit interconnect with 99.72% ± 0.04% fidelity, conditional on photon detection and not accounting for loss. We preview a selection of next-generation technologies: low-loss silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides and components to address loss, as well as fabrication-tolerant photon sources, high-efficiency photon-number-resolving detectors (PNRDs), low-loss chip-to-fibre coupling and barium titanate (BTO) electro-optic phase shifters for high-performance fast switching. A manufacturable platform for quantum computing with photons is introduced and a set of monolithically integrated silicon-photonics-based modules is benchmarked, demonstrating dual-rail photonic qubits with performance close to thresholds required for operation.",

    "abstract": "Reproduction, development and homeostasis depend on motile cilia, whose rhythmic beating is powered by a microtubule-based molecular machine called the axoneme. Although an atomic model of the axoneme is available for the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii1, structures of mammalian axonemes are incomplete1–5. Furthermore, we do not fully understand how molecular structures of axonemes vary across motile-ciliated cell types in the body. Here we use cryoelectron microscopy, cryoelectron tomography and proteomics to resolve the 96-nm modular repeat of axonemal doublet microtubules (DMTs) from both sperm flagella and epithelial cilia of the oviduct, brain ventricles and respiratory tract. We find that sperm DMTs are the most specialized, with epithelial cilia having only minor differences across tissues. We build a model of the mammalian sperm DMT, defining the positions and interactions of 181 proteins including 34 newly identified proteins. We elucidate the composition of radial spoke 3 and uncover binding sites of kinases associated with regeneration of ATP and regulation of ciliary motility. We discover a sperm-specific, axoneme-tethered T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC) chaperone that may contribute to construction or maintenance of the long flagella of mammalian sperm. We resolve axonemal dyneins in their prestroke states, illuminating conformational changes that occur during ciliary movement. Our results illustrate how elements of chemical and mechanical regulation are embedded within the axoneme, providing valuable resources for understanding the aetiology of ciliopathy and infertility, and exemplifying the discovery power of modern structural biology. Cryoelectron microscopy, cryoelectron tomography and proteomics are used to resolve the 96-nm modular repeat of axonemal doublet microtubules from both sperm flagella and epithelial cilia of the oviduct, brain ventricles and respiratory tract.",

    "abstract": "Silicon photonics is a rapidly developing technology that promises to revolutionize the way we communicate, compute and sense the world1–6. However, the lack of highly scalable, native complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS)-integrated light sources is one of the main factors hampering its widespread adoption. Despite considerable progress in hybrid and heterogeneous integration of III–V light sources on silicon7–12, monolithic integration by direct epitaxy of III–V materials remains the pinnacle of cost-effective on-chip light sources. Here we report the electrically driven gallium arsenide (GaAs)-based laser diodes fully fabricated on 300-mm Si wafers in a CMOS pilot manufacturing line based on a new integration approach, nano-ridge engineering. GaAs nano-ridge waveguides with embedded p–i–n diodes and InGaAs quantum wells are grown at high quality on a wafer scale. Room-temperature continuous-wave lasing is demonstrated at wavelengths around 1,020 nm in more than 300 devices across a wafer, with threshold currents as low as 5 mA, output powers beyond 1 mW, laser linewidths down to 46 MHz and laser operation up to 55 °C. These results illustrate the potential of the III–V/Si nano-ridge engineering concept for the monolithic integration of laser diodes in a Si photonics platform, enabling future cost-sensitive high-volume applications in optical sensing, interconnects and beyond. A new integration approach, nano-ridge engineering, enables electrically driven GaAs-based laser diodes to be fabricated on Si wafers in a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) pilot line, showing potential for the integration of laser diodes in a Si photonics platform.",

    "abstract": "Positive effects of plant diversity on productivity have been globally demonstrated and explained by two main effects: complementarity effects and selection effects1–4. However, plant diversity experiments have shown substantial variation in these effects, with driving factors poorly understood4–6. On the basis of a meta-analysis of 452 experiments across the globe, we show that productivity increases on average by 15.2% from monocultures to species mixtures with an average species richness of 2.6; net biodiversity effects are stronger in grassland and forest experiments and weaker in container, cropland and aquatic ecosystems. Of the net biodiversity effects, complementarity effects and selection effects contribute 65.6% and 34.4%, respectively. Complementarity effects increase with phylogenetic diversity, the mixing of nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing species and the functional diversity of leaf nitrogen contents, which indicate the key roles of niche partitioning, biotic feedback and abiotic facilitation in complementarity effects. More positive selection effects occur with higher species biomass inequality in their monocultures. Complementarity effects increase over time, whereas selection effects decrease over time, and they remain consistent across global variations in climates. Our results provide key insights into understanding global variations in plant diversity effects on productivity and underscore the importance of integrating both complementarity and selection effects into strategies for biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration. A meta-analysis of biodiversity effects on plant productivity found that complementarity effects increased over time whereas selection effects decreased, and both remained consistent across global variations in climate.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable development aspires to “leave no one behind”1. Even so, limited attention has been paid to small-scale fisheries (SSF) and their importance in eradicating poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Through a collaborative and multidimensional data-driven approach, we have estimated that SSF provide at least 40% (37.3 million tonnes) of global fisheries catches and 2.3 billion people with, on average, 20% of their dietary intake across six key micronutrients essential for human health. Globally, the livelihood of 1 in every 12 people, nearly half of them women, depends at least partly on small-scale fishing, in total generating 44% (US$77.2 billion) of the economic value of all fisheries landed. Regionally, Asian SSF provide fish, support livelihoods and supply nutrition to the largest number of people. Relative to the total capture of the fisheries sector (comprising large-scale and small-scale fisheries), across all regions, African SSF supply the most catch and nutrition, and SSF in Oceania improve the most livelihoods. Maintaining and increasing these multidimensional SSF contributions to sustainable development requires targeted and effective actions, especially increasing the engagement of fisherfolk in shared management and governance. Without management and governance focused on the multidimensional contributions of SSF, the marginalization of millions of fishers and fishworkers will worsen. A study aimed at revealing the role of small-scale fisheries in sustainable development shows they provide at least 40% of the global fishing catch and affect the livelihoods of 1 in 12 people in the world, among other important contributions.",

In March 2024, HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was first detected in dairy cows in Texas, USA, and continues to circulate on dairy farms in many states7,8. Milk production and quality are diminished in infected dairy cows, with high virus titres in milk raising concerns of exposure to mammals including humans through consumption9–12. Here we investigated routes of infection with bovine HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in cynomolgus macaques, a surrogate model for human infection13. We show that intranasal or intratracheal inoculation of macaques could cause systemic infection resulting in mild and severe respiratory disease, respectively. By contrast, infection by the orogastric route resulted in limited infection and seroconversion of macaques that remained subclinical. Routes of infection with bovine highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in cynomolgus macaques are investigated, and in contrast to orogastric inoculation, intranasal or intratracheal inoculation could cause systemic infection resulting in mild and severe respiratory disease, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are de novo ectopic lymphoid aggregates that regulate immunity in chronically inflamed tissues, including tumours. Although TLSs form due to inflammation-triggered activation of the lymphotoxin (LT)–LTβ receptor (LTβR) pathway1, the inflammatory signals and cells that induce TLSs remain incompletely identified. Here we show that interleukin-33 (IL-33), the alarmin released by inflamed tissues2, induces TLSs. In mice, Il33 deficiency severely attenuates inflammation- and LTβR-activation-induced TLSs in models of colitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In PDAC, the alarmin domain of IL-33 activates group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) expressing LT that engage putative LTβR+ myeloid organizer cells to initiate tertiary lymphoneogenesis. Notably, lymphoneogenic ILC2s migrate to PDACs from the gut, can be mobilized to PDACs in different tissues and are modulated by gut microbiota. Furthermore, we detect putative lymphoneogenic ILC2s and IL-33-expressing cells within TLSs in human PDAC that correlate with improved prognosis. To harness this lymphoneogenic pathway for immunotherapy, we engineer a recombinant human IL-33 protein that expands intratumoural lymphoneogenic ILC2s and TLSs and demonstrates enhanced anti-tumour activity in PDAC mice. In summary, we identify the molecules and cells of a druggable pathway that induces inflammation-triggered TLSs. More broadly, we reveal a lymphoneogenic function for alarmins and ILC2s. IL-33 induces tertiary lymphoid structures.",

    "abstract": "Increasing soil salinity causes significant crop losses globally; therefore, understanding plant responses to salt (sodium) stress is of high importance. Plants avoid sodium toxicity through subcellular compartmentation by intricate processes involving a high level of elemental interdependence. Current technologies to visualize sodium, in particular, together with other elements, are either indirect or lack in resolution. Here we used the newly developed cryo nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry ion microprobe1, which allows high-resolution elemental imaging of cryo-preserved samples and reveals the subcellular distributions of key macronutrients and micronutrients in root meristem cells of Arabidopsis and rice. We found an unexpected, concentration-dependent change in sodium distribution, switching from sodium accumulation in the cell walls at low external sodium concentrations to vacuolar accumulation at stressful concentrations. We conclude that, in root meristems, a key function of the NHX family sodium/proton antiporter SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE 1 (also known as Na+/H+ exchanger 7; SOS1/NHX7) is to sequester sodium into vacuoles, rather than extrusion of sodium into the extracellular space. This is corroborated by the use of new genomic, complementing fluorescently tagged SOS1 variants. We show that, in addition to the plasma membrane, SOS1 strongly accumulates at late endosome/prevacuoles as well as vacuoles, supporting a role of SOS1 in vacuolar sodium sequestration. This study demonstrates that cryo nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (CryoNanoSIMS) enables direct multi-elemental imaging at subcellular resolution of macro- and micronutrients or trace elements in plants and may provide insights into the in vivo roles of many transporters.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical metamaterials with high recoverable elastic energy density, which we refer to as high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials, can offer many enhanced properties, including efficient mechanical energy storage1,2, load-bearing capability, impact resistance and motion agility. These qualities make them ideal for lightweight, miniaturized and multi-functional structures3–8. However, achieving high enthalpy is challenging, as it requires combining conflicting properties: high stiffness, high strength and large recoverable strain9–11. Here, to address this challenge, we construct high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials from freely rotatable chiral metacells. Compared with existing non-chiral lattices, the non-optimized chiral metamaterials simultaneously maintain high stiffness, sustain larger recoverable strain, offer a wider buckling plateau, improve the buckling strength by 5–10 times, enhance enthalpy by 2–160 times and increase energy per mass by 2–32 times. These improvements arise from torsional buckling deformation that is triggered by chirality and is absent in conventional metamaterials. This deformation mode stores considerable additional energy while having a minimal impact on peak stresses that define material failure. Our findings identify a mechanism and provide insight into the design of metamaterials and structures with high mechanical energy storage capacity, a fundamental and general problem of broad engineering interest. High-enthalpy elastic metamaterials constructed from freely rotatable chiral metacells have high stiffness, large recoverable strain and improved buckling strength.",

    "abstract": "Magnonic systems provide a fertile playground for bosonic topology1, for example, Dirac2–6 and Weyl7,8 magnons, leading to a variety of exotic phenomena such as charge-free topologically protected boundary modes6,7, the magnon thermal Hall effect9 and the magnon spin Nernst effect10. However, their understanding has been hindered by the absence of fundamental symmetry descriptions of magnetic geometries and spin Hamiltonians primarily governed by isotropic Heisenberg interactions. The ensuing magnon dispersions enable gapless magnon band nodes that go beyond the scenario of representation theory of the magnetic space groups11,12, thus referred to as unconventional magnons. Here we developed spin space group13–17 theory to elucidate collinear magnetic configurations, classifying the 1,421 collinear spin space groups into 4 types, constructing their band representations and providing a comprehensive tabulation of unconventional magnons, such as duodecuple points, octuple nodal lines and charge-4 octuple points. On the basis of the MAGNDATA database18, we identified 498 collinear magnets with unconventional magnons, among which more than 200 magnon band structures were obtained by using first-principles calculations and linear spin wave theory. In addition, we evaluated the influence of the spin–orbit-coupling-induced exchange interaction in these magnets and found that more than 80 per cent are predominantly governed by the Heisenberg interactions, indicating that the spin space group serves as an ideal framework for describing magnon band nodes in most 3d, 4d and half-filled 4f collinear magnets. Spin space group theory is applied to identify more than 200 collinear magnets with unconventional magnons; high-throughput calculations with spin–orbit coupling find that most of these unconventional magnets are dictated by the Heisenberg exchange interaction.",

    "abstract": "The shortage of donors is a major challenge for transplantation; however, organs from genetically modified pigs can serve as ideal supplements1,2. Until now, porcine hearts and kidneys have been successively transplanted into humans3–7. In this study, heterotopic auxiliary transplantation was used to donate a six-gene-edited pig liver to a brain-dead recipient. The graft function, haemodynamics, and immune and inflammatory responses of the recipient were monitored over the subsequent 10 days. Two hours after portal vein reperfusion of the xenograft, goldish bile was produced, increasing to 66.5 ml by postoperative day 10. Porcine liver-derived albumin also increased after surgery. Alanine aminotransferase levels remained in the normal range, while aspartate aminotransferase levels increased on postoperative day 1 and then rapidly declined. Blood flow velocity in the porcine hepatic artery and portal and hepatic veins remained at an acceptable level. Although platelet numbers decreased early after surgery, they ultimately returned to normal levels. Histological analyses showed that the porcine liver regenerated capably with no signs of rejection. T cell activity was inhibited by anti-thymocyte globulin administration, and B cell activation increased 3 days after surgery and was then inhibited by rituximab. There were no significant peri-operative changes in immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin M levels. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were initially elevated and then quickly declined. The xenograft remained functional until study completion. A gene-edited pig liver transplanted into a human recipient remains functional after 10 days and indicates that porcine organs could help meet the growing demand for liver transplants.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with a considerable health and economic burden1. It is characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a diminished response to symptomatic medical or surgical therapy as the disease progresses2. Cell therapy aims to replenish lost dopaminergic neurons and their striatal projections by intrastriatal grafting. Here, we report the results of an open-label phase I clinical trial (NCT04802733) of an investigational cryopreserved, off-the-shelf dopaminergic neuron progenitor cell product (bemdaneprocel) derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cells and grafted bilaterally into the putamen of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Twelve patients were enrolled sequentially in two cohorts—a low-dose (0.9 million cells, n = 5) and a high-dose (2.7 million cells, n = 7) cohort—and all of the participants received one year of immunosuppression. The trial achieved its primary objectives of safety and tolerability one year after transplantation, with no adverse events related to the cell product. At 18 months after grafting, putaminal 18Fluoro-DOPA positron emission tomography uptake increased, indicating graft survival. Secondary and exploratory clinical outcomes showed improvement or stability, including improvement in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III OFF scores by an average of 23 points in the high-dose cohort. There were no graft-induced dyskinesias. These data demonstrate safety and support future definitive clinical studies. Bilateral grafts of cryopreserved human embryonic stem cell-derived dopaminergic neuron progenitor cells into the putamen of patients with Parkinson’s disease in a phase I clinical trial showed safety, improvements in off-drug motor function and graft survival at 18 months after transplant.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) infiltrates the brain and can be synaptically innervated by neurons, which drives tumour progression1,2. Synaptic inputs onto GBM cells identified so far are largely short range and glutamatergic3,4. The extent of GBM integration into the brain-wide neuronal circuitry remains unclear. Here we applied rabies virus-mediated and herpes simplex virus-mediated trans-monosynaptic tracing5,6 to systematically investigate circuit integration of human GBM organoids transplanted into adult mice. We found that GBM cells from multiple patients rapidly integrate into diverse local and long-range neural circuits across the brain. Beyond glutamatergic inputs, we identified various neuromodulatory inputs, including synapses between basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and GBM cells. Acute acetylcholine stimulation induces long-lasting elevation of calcium oscillations and transcriptional reprogramming of GBM cells into a more motile state via the metabotropic CHRM3 receptor. CHRM3 activation promotes GBM cell motility, whereas its downregulation suppresses GBM cell motility and prolongs mouse survival. Together, these results reveal the striking capacity for human GBM cells to rapidly and robustly integrate into anatomically diverse neuronal networks of different neurotransmitter systems. Our findings further support a model in which rapid connectivity and transient activation of upstream neurons may lead to a long-lasting increase in tumour fitness. A study leveraging transsynaptic tracing demonstrates rapid and extensive integration of human glioblastoma organoids into the mouse brain.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved over short timescales, leading to the emergence of more transmissible variants such as Alpha and Delta1–3. The arrival of the Omicron variant marked a major shift, introducing numerous extra mutations in the spike gene compared with earlier variants1,2. These evolutionary changes have raised concerns regarding their potential impact on immune evasion, disease severity and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments1,3. In this epidemiological study, we identified two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron versus pre-Omicron eras. Before Omicron, natural infection provided strong and durable protection against reinfection, with minimal waning over time. However, during the Omicron era, protection was robust only for those recently infected, declining rapidly over time and diminishing within a year. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by a dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution, leading to contrasting reinfection patterns before and after Omicron’s first wave. This shift in patterns suggests a change in evolutionary pressures, with intrinsic transmissibility driving adaptation pre-Omicron and immune escape becoming dominant post-Omicron, underscoring the need for periodic vaccine updates to sustain immunity. Two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron variant versus pre-Omicron eras show that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamus is a brain region that plays a key role in coordinating fundamental biological functions1. However, our understanding of the underlying cellular components and neurocircuitries have, until recently, emerged primarily from rodent studies2,3. Here we combine single-nucleus sequencing of 433,369 human hypothalamic cells with spatial transcriptomics, generating a comprehensive spatio-cellular transcriptional map of the hypothalamus, the ‘HYPOMAP’. Although conservation of neuronal cell types between humans and mice, as based on transcriptomic identity, is generally high, there are notable exceptions. Specifically, there are significant disparities in the identity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and in the expression levels of G-protein-coupled receptors between the two species that carry direct implications for currently approved obesity treatments. Out of the 452 hypothalamic cell types, we find that 291 neuronal clusters are significantly enriched for expression of body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study genes. This enrichment is driven by 426 ‘effector’ genes. Rare deleterious variants in six of these (MC4R, PCSK1, POMC, CALCR, BSN and CORO1A) associate with BMI at population level, and CORO1A has not been linked previously to BMI. Thus, HYPOMAP provides a detailed atlas of the human hypothalamus in a spatial context and serves as an important resource to identify new druggable targets for treating a wide range of conditions, including reproductive, circadian and metabolic disorders. HYPOMAP integrates single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data to create a comprehensive spatio-cellular map of the human hypothalamus.",

    "abstract": "UM171 is a potent agonist of ex vivo human haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal1. By co-opting KBTBD4, a substrate receptor of the CUL3–RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, UM171 promotes the degradation of the LSD1–CoREST corepressor complex, thereby limiting haematopoietic stem cell attrition2,3. However, the direct target and mechanism of action of UM171 remain unclear. Here we show that UM171 acts as a molecular glue to induce high-affinity interactions between KBTBD4 and HDAC1/2 to promote corepressor degradation. Through proteomics and chemical inhibitor studies, we identify the principal target of UM171 as HDAC1/2. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of dimeric KBTBD4 bound to UM171 and the LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST complex identifies an asymmetric assembly in which a single UM171 molecule enables a pair of KELCH-repeat propeller domains to recruit the HDAC1 catalytic domain. One KBTBD4 propeller partially masks the rim of the HDAC1 active site, which is exploited by UM171 to extend the E3–neosubstrate interface. The other propeller cooperatively strengthens HDAC1 binding through a distinct interface. The overall CoREST–HDAC1/2–KBTBD4 interaction is further buttressed by the endogenous cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate, which acts as a second molecular glue. The functional relevance of the quaternary complex interaction surfaces is demonstrated by base editor scanning of KBTBD4 and HDAC1. By delineating the direct target of UM171 and its mechanism of action, we reveal how the cooperativity offered by a dimeric CRL3 E3 can be leveraged by a small molecule degrader. UM171 promotes corepressor degradation by acting as a molecular glue to induce KBTBD4–HDAC1/2 interactions with the help of inositol hexakisphosphate.",

    "abstract": "Cumulative silicon photovoltaic (PV) waste highlights the importance of considering waste recycling before the commercialization of emerging PV technologies1,2. Perovskite PVs are a promising next-generation technology3, in which recycling their end-of-life waste can reduce the toxic waste and retain resources4,5. Here we report a low-cost, green-solvent-based holistic recycling strategy to restore all valuable components from perovskite PV waste. We develop an efficient aqueous-based perovskite recycling approach that can also rejuvenate degraded perovskites. We further extend the scope of recycling to charge-transport layers, substrates, cover glasses and metal electrodes. After repeated degradation–recycling processes, the recycled devices show similar efficiency and stability compared with the fresh devices. Our holistic recycling strategy reduces by 96.6% resource depletion and by 68.8% human toxicity (cancer effects) impacts associated with perovskite PVs compared with the landfill treatment. With recycling, the levelized cost of electricity also decreases for both utility-scale and residential systems. This study highlights unique opportunities of perovskite PVs for holistic recycling and paves the way for a sustainable perovskite solar economy. A recycling strategy based predominantly on the use of water to restore and reuse valuable components from perovskite photovoltaic waste is described, with recycled devices showing similar efficiency and stability compared with fresh devices.",

    "abstract": "Defence from environmental threats is provided by physical barriers that confer mechanical protection and prevent the entry of microorganisms1. If microorganisms overcome those barriers, however, innate immune cells use toxic chemicals to kill the invading cells2,3. Here we examine immune diversity across tissues and identify a population of neutrophils in the skin that expresses a broad repertoire of proteins and enzymes needed to build the extracellular matrix. In the naive skin, these matrix-producing neutrophils contribute to the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, reinforce its mechanical properties and promote barrier function. After injury, these neutrophils build ‘rings’ of matrix around wounds, which shield against foreign molecules and bacteria. This structural program relies on TGFβ signalling; disabling the TGFβ receptor in neutrophils impaired ring formation around wounds and facilitated bacterial invasion. We infer that the innate immune system has evolved diverse strategies for defence, including one that physically shields the host from the outside world. A population of neutrophils in the skin produces extracellular matrix, providing a defence strategy by reinforcing the barrier properties of the skin and helping to block the entry of pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The forces generated by action potentials in muscle cells shuttle blood, food and waste products throughout the luminal structures of the body. Although non-invasive electrophysiological techniques exist1–3, most mechanosensors cannot access luminal structures non-invasively4–6. Here we introduce non-toxic ingestible mechanosensors to enable the quantitative study of luminal forces and apply them to study feeding in living Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms. These optical ‘microgauges’ comprise upconverting NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4 nanoparticles embedded in polystyrene microspheres. Combining optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study microgauges in vitro, we show that force evokes a linear and hysteresis-free change in the ratio of emitted red to green light. With fluorescence imaging and non-invasive electrophysiology, we show that adult C. elegans generate bite forces during feeding on the order of 10 µN and that the temporal pattern of force generation is aligned with muscle activity in the feeding organ. Moreover, the bite force we measure corresponds to Hertzian contact stresses in the pressure range used to lyse the bacterial food of the worm7,8. Microgauges have the potential to enable quantitative studies that investigate how neuromuscular stresses are affected by ageing, genetic mutations and drug treatments in this organ and other luminal organs. Nanoparticle-based ‘microgauges’ are developed for in vivo force sensing and deployed in C. elegans to investigate how mechanical force correlates with electrical signalling in neuromuscular organs.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-resident memory CD8 T (TRM) cells provide protection from infection at barrier sites. In the small intestine, TRM cells are found in at least two distinct subpopulations: one with higher expression of effector molecules and another with greater memory potential1. However, the origins of this diversity remain unknown. Here we proposed that distinct tissue niches drive the phenotypic heterogeneity of TRM cells. To test this, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics of human samples, a mouse model of acute systemic viral infection and a newly established strategy for pooled optically encoded gene perturbations to profile the locations, interactions and transcriptomes of pathogen-specific TRM cell differentiation at single-transcript resolution. We developed computational approaches to capture cellular locations along three anatomical axes of the small intestine and to visualize the spatiotemporal distribution of cell types and gene expression. Our study reveals that the regionalized signalling of the intestinal architecture supports two distinct TRM cell states: differentiated TRM cells and progenitor-like TRM cells, located in the upper villus and lower villus, respectively. This diversity is mediated by distinct ligand–receptor activities, cytokine gradients and specialized cellular contacts. Blocking TGFβ or CXCL9 and CXCL10 sensing by antigen-specific CD8 T cells revealed a model consistent with anatomically delineated, early fate specification. Ultimately, our framework for the study of tissue immune networks reveals that T cell location and functional state are fundamentally intertwined. Profiling of the location and transcriptome of tissue-resident memory CD8 T cell formation at single-transcript resolution finds regionalized signalling as the basis of immune diversity in the intestine and provides a conceptual framework for the study of tissue immune networks.",

    "abstract": "Dielectric-based energy storage capacitors characterized with fast charging and discharging speed and reliability1–4 play a vital role in cutting-edge electrical and electronic equipment. In pursuit of capacitor miniaturization and integration, dielectrics must offer high energy density and efficiency5. Antiferroelectrics with antiparallel dipole configurations have been of significant interest for high-performance energy storage due to their negligible remanent polarization and high maximum polarization in the field-induced ferroelectric state6–8. However, the low antiferroelectric–ferroelectric phase-transition field and accompanying large hysteresis loss deteriorate energy density and reliability. Here, guided by phase-field simulations, we propose a new strategy to frustrate antipolar ordering in antiferroelectrics by incorporating non-polar or polar components. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively tunes the antiferroelectric–ferroelectric phase-transition fields and simultaneously reduces hysteresis loss. In PbZrO3-based films, we hence realized a record high energy density among all antiferroelectrics of 189 J cm−3 along with a high efficiency of 81% at an electric field of 5.51 MV cm−1, which rivals the most state-of-the-art energy storage dielectrics9–12. Atomic-scale characterization by scanning transmission electron microscopy directly revealed that the dispersed non-polar regions frustrate the long-range antipolar ordering, which contributes to the improved performance. This strategy presents new opportunities to manipulate polarization profiles and enhance energy storage performances in antiferroelectrics. This study reports that incorporating non-polar nanodomains into antiferroelectrics greatly enhanced the energy density and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Evaporation or freezing of water-rich fluids with dilute concentrations of dissolved salts can produce brines, as observed in closed basins on Earth1 and detected by remote sensing on icy bodies in the outer Solar System2,3. The mineralogical evolution of these brines is well understood in regard to terrestrial environments4, but poorly constrained for extraterrestrial systems owing to a lack of direct sampling. Here we report the occurrence of salt minerals in samples of the asteroid (101955) Bennu returned by the OSIRIS-REx mission5. These include sodium-bearing phosphates and sodium-rich carbonates, sulfates, chlorides and fluorides formed during evaporation of a late-stage brine that existed early in the history of Bennu’s parent body. Discovery of diverse salts would not be possible without mission sample return and careful curation and storage, because these decompose with prolonged exposure to Earth’s atmosphere. Similar brines probably still occur in the interior of icy bodies Ceres and Enceladus, as indicated by spectra or measurement of sodium carbonate on the surface or in plumes2,3. Samples from the asteroid (101955) Bennu, returned by the OSIRIS-REx mission, include sodium-bearing phosphates and sodium-rich carbonates, sulfates, chlorides and fluorides formed during evaporation of a late-stage brine.",

    "abstract": "Although cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for anti-tumour immunity, they are frequently dysfunctional in tumours1. Cytokines that sustain CTL activity are attractive for cancer immunotherapy, but avoiding inflammatory toxicity remains a challenge for their clinical use2. Here we show that expression of a CTL signature is strongly associated with IL27 expression in human and mouse tumours. In mice, IL-27 acts directly on tumour-specific CTLs to promote their persistence and effector function in the tumour microenvironment. Moreover, treatment with inducible IL-27 overexpression or a half-life-extended IL-27 protein in vivo is well tolerated, induces regression of established tumours, drives an enhanced cytotoxic program in anti-tumour CTLs and synergizes with PD-L1 blockade. In patients with cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, high expression of IL-27 correlates with a favourable clinical response, and IL-27 supports human CTL function during chronic antigen stimulation ex vivo. Our data demonstrate that endogenous IL-27 is essential for anti-tumour immunity and that IL-27 receptor agonism can safely improve anti-tumour T cell responses alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade. IL-27 promotes tumour control by preventing dysfunction and enhancing cytotoxicity of tumour-specific CD8+ T cells.",

    "abstract": "Linear conducting polymers show ballistic transport, imposed by mobile carriers moving along the polymer chains1,2, whereas conductance in the extended dimension, that is, between polymer strands or layers, remains weak due to the lack of intermolecular ordering and electronic coupling3–5. Here we report a multilayer-stacked two-dimensional polyaniline (2DPANI) crystal, which shows metallic out-of-plane charge transport with high electrical conductivity. The material comprises columnar π arrays with an interlayer distance of 3.59 Å and periodic rhombohedral lattices formed by interwoven polyaniline chains. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals significant electron delocalization in the 2DPANI lattices. First-principles calculations indicate the in-plane 2D conjugation and strong interlayer electronic coupling in 2DPANI facilitated by the Cl-bridged layer stacking. To assess the local optical conductivity, we used terahertz and infrared nanospectroscopy to unravel a Drude-type conductivity with an infrared plasma frequency and an extrapolated local d.c. conductivity of around 200 S cm−1. Conductive scanning probe microscopy showed an unusually high out-of-plane conductivity of roughly 15 S cm−1. Transport measurements through vertical and lateral micro-devices revealed comparable high out-of-plane (roughly 7 S cm−1) and in-plane conductivity (roughly 16 S cm−1). The vertical micro-devices further showed increasing conductivity with decreasing temperature, demonstrating unique out-of-plane metallic transport behaviour. By using this multilayer-stacked 2D conducting polymer design, we predict the achievement of strong electronic coupling beyond in-plane interactions, potentially reaching three-dimensional metallic conductivity6,7. A multilayer-stacked two-dimensional polyaniline crystal shows high electrical conductivity and unique out-of-plane metallic transport behaviour, indicating potential for strong electronic coupling beyond in-plane interactions and three-dimensional metallic conductivity.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells have been shown to exploit neurons to modulate their survival and growth, including through the establishment of neural circuits within the central nervous system1–3. Here we report a distinct pattern of cancer–nerve interactions between the peripheral nervous system and gastric cancer. In multiple mouse models of gastric cancer, nociceptive nerves demonstrated the greatest degree of nerve expansion in an NGF-dependent manner. Neural tracing identified CGRP+ peptidergic neurons as the primary gastric sensory neurons. Three-dimensional co-culture models showed that sensory neurons directly connect with gastric cancer spheroids. Chemogenetic activation of sensory neurons induced the release of calcium into the cytoplasm of cancer cells, promoting tumour growth and metastasis. Pharmacological ablation of sensory neurons or treatment with CGRP inhibitors suppressed tumour growth and extended survival. Depolarization of gastric tumour membranes through in vivo optogenetic activation led to enhanced calcium flux in jugular nucleus complex and CGRP release, defining a cancer cell–peptidergic neuronal circuit. Together, these findings establish the functional connectivity between cancer and sensory neurons, identifying this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Functional connectivity between gastric cancer cells and sensory neurons offers a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "To solve problems of practical importance1,2, quantum computers probably need to incorporate quantum error correction, in which a logical qubit is redundantly encoded in many noisy physical qubits3–5. The large physical-qubit overhead associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches6–18. Here, using a superconducting quantum circuit19, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance d = 5 (ref. 10). A stabilizing circuit passively protects cat qubits against bit flips20–24. The repetition code, using ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement, corrects cat qubit phase flips. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below the threshold. The logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat qubit mean photon number, enabled by our realization of a cat-transmon noise-biased CX gate. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average 1.75(2)% for the distance-3 code sections, and 1.65(3)% for the distance-5 code. Despite the increased number of fault locations of the distance-5 code, the high degree of noise bias preserved during error correction enables comparable performance. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings enables us to use a hardware-efficient outer error-correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes can be a compelling model for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation. Bosonic qubits can be engineered to feature intrinsic protection against certain kinds of errors, which makes quantum error correction across many bosonic qubits possible with less overhead.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) metals are appealing for many emergent phenomena and have recently attracted research interests1–9. Unlike the widely studied 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, 2D metals are extremely challenging to achieve, because they are thermodynamically unstable1,10. Here we develop a vdW squeezing method to realize diverse 2D metals (including Bi, Ga, In, Sn and Pb) at the ångström thickness limit. The achieved 2D metals are stabilized from a complete encapsulation between two MoS2 monolayers and present non-bonded interfaces, enabling access to their intrinsic properties. Transport and Raman measurements on monolayer Bi show excellent physical properties, for example, new phonon mode, enhanced electrical conductivity, notable field effect and large nonlinear Hall conductivity. Our work establishes an effective route for implementing 2D metals, alloys and other 2D non-vdW materials, potentially outlining a bright vision for a broad portfolio of emerging quantum, electronic and photonic devices. Melting and squeezing pure metals between two sapphires covered in molybdenum disulfide produces diverse two-dimensional metals at the ångström thickness limit.",

    "abstract": "Interfacial water exhibits rich and complex behaviour1, playing an important part in chemistry, biology, geology and engineering. However, there is still much debate on the fundamental properties of water at hydrophobic interfaces, such as orientational ordering, the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide, improper hydrogen bonds and the presence of large electric fields2–5. This controversy arises from the challenges in measuring interfacial systems, even with the most advanced experimental techniques and theoretical approaches available. Here we report on an in-solution, interface-selective Raman spectroscopy method using multivariate curve resolution6,7 to probe hexadecane-in-water emulsions, aided by a monomer-field theoretical model for Raman spectroscopy8. Our results indicate that oil–water emulsion interfaces can exhibit reduced tetrahedral order and weaker hydrogen bonding, along with a substantial population of free hydroxyl groups that experience about 95 cm−1 redshift in their stretching mode compared with planar oil–water interfaces. Given the known electrostatic zeta potential characteristic of oil droplets9, we propose the existence of a strong electric field (about 50–90 MV cm−1) emanating from the oil phase. This field is inferred indirectly but supported by control experiments and theoretical estimates. These observations are either absent or opposite in the molecular hydrophobic interface formed by small solutes or at planar oil–water interfaces. Instead, water structural disorder and enhanced electric fields emerge as unique features of the mesoscale interface in oil–water emulsions, potentially contributing to the accelerated chemical reactivity observed at hydrophobic–water interfaces10–13. Raman spectroscopy measurements of water at the interface with oil droplets show a perturbed hydrogen-bond network and evidence for a strong interfacial electric field.",

    "abstract": "Lasso peptides (biologically active molecules with a distinct structurally constrained knotted fold) are natural products that belong to the class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides1–3. Lasso peptides act on several bacterial targets4,5, but none have been reported to inhibit the ribosome, one of the main targets of antibiotics in the bacterial cell6,7. Here we report the identification and characterization of the lasso peptide antibiotic lariocidin and its internally cyclized derivative lariocidin B, produced by Paenibacillus sp. M2, which has broad-spectrum activity against a range of bacterial pathogens. We show that lariocidins inhibit bacterial growth by binding to the ribosome and interfering with protein synthesis. Structural, genetic and biochemical data show that lariocidins bind at a unique site in the small ribosomal subunit, where they interact with the 16S ribosomal RNA and aminoacyl-tRNA, inhibiting translocation and inducing miscoding. Lariocidin is unaffected by common resistance mechanisms, has a low propensity for generating spontaneous resistance, shows no toxicity to human cells, and has potent in vivo activity in a mouse model of Acinetobacter baumannii infection. Our identification of ribosome-targeting lasso peptides uncovers new routes towards the discovery of alternative protein-synthesis inhibitors and offers a novel chemical scaffold for the development of much-needed antibacterial drugs. A new lasso peptide antibiotic exhibits broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, is unaffected by common resistance mechanisms and shows no toxicity towards human cells.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian cortex features a vast diversity of neuronal cell types, each with characteristic anatomical, molecular and functional properties1. Synaptic connectivity shapes how each cell type participates in the cortical circuit, but mapping connectivity rules at the resolution of distinct cell types remains difficult. Here we used millimetre-scale volumetric electron microscopy2 to investigate the connectivity of all inhibitory neurons across a densely segmented neuronal population of 1,352 cells spanning all layers of mouse visual cortex, producing a wiring diagram of inhibition with more than 70,000 synapses. Inspired by classical neuroanatomy, we classified inhibitory neurons based on targeting of dendritic compartments and developed an excitatory neuron classification based on dendritic reconstructions with whole-cell maps of synaptic input. Single-cell connectivity showed a class of disinhibitory specialist that targets basket cells. Analysis of inhibitory connectivity onto excitatory neurons found widespread specificity, with many interneurons exhibiting differential targeting of spatially intermingled subpopulations. Inhibitory targeting was organized into ‘motif groups’, diverse sets of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same excitatory targets. Collectively, our analysis identified new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a foundation for linking contemporary multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram. Using volumetric electron microscopy, the authors map and analyze the structure of cortical inhibition with synaptic resolution across a column of visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Somatosensory pathways convey crucial information about pain, touch, itch and body part movement from peripheral organs to the central nervous system1,2. Despite substantial needs to understand how these pathways assemble and to develop pain therapeutics, clinical translation remains challenging. This is probably related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models of the polysynaptic pathway. Here we established a human ascending somatosensory assembloid (hASA), a four-part assembloid generated from human pluripotent stem cells that integrates somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids to model the spinothalamic pathway. Transcriptomic profiling confirmed the presence of key cell types of this circuit. Rabies tracing and calcium imaging showed that sensory neurons connect to dorsal spinal cord neurons, which further connect to thalamic neurons. Following noxious chemical stimulation, calcium imaging of hASA demonstrated a coordinated response. In addition, extracellular recordings and imaging revealed synchronized activity across the assembloid. Notably, loss of the sodium channel NaV1.7, which causes pain insensitivity, disrupted synchrony across hASA. By contrast, a gain-of-function SCN9A variant associated with extreme pain disorder induced hypersynchrony. These experiments demonstrated the ability to functionally assemble the essential components of the human sensory pathway, which could accelerate our understanding of sensory circuits and facilitate therapeutic development. A human ascending somatosensory assembloid model was developed, which integrates multiple organoids to simulate the spinothalamic pathway, demonstrating functional connectivity and responsiveness to stimuli and revealing insights into pain-related genetic mutations.",

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are microsecond-to-millisecond-duration radio transients1 that originate mostly from extragalactic distances. The FRB emission mechanism remains debated, with two main competing classes of models: physical processes that occur within close proximity to a central engine2–4; and relativistic shocks that propagate out to large radial distances5–8. The expected emission-region sizes are notably different between these two types of models9. Here we present the measurement of two mutually coherent scintillation scales in the frequency spectrum of FRB 20221022A10: one originating from a scattering screen located within the Milky Way, and the second originating from its host galaxy or local environment. We use the scattering media as an astrophysical lens to constrain the size of the observed FRB lateral emission region9 to ≲3 × 104 kilometres. This emission size is inconsistent with the expectation for the large-radial-distance models5–8, and is more naturally explained by an emission process that operates within or just beyond the magnetosphere of a central compact object. Recently, FRB 20221022A was found to exhibit an S-shaped polarization angle swing10, most likely originating from a magnetospheric emission process. The scintillation results presented in this work independently support this conclusion, while highlighting scintillation as a useful tool in our understanding of FRB emission physics and progenitors. The detection of scintillation caused by inhomogeneous plasma near a fast radio burst indicates an emission process that occurs within or just beyond the magnetosphere of a compact object.",

    "abstract": "Topological design of π electrons in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) leads to a wealth of magnetic quantum phenomena and exotic quantum phases1–10. Symmetric ZGNRs typically show antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states1,2. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains11, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the one-dimensional limit3,12, but also establishes a long-sought-after carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics1–3,9,13. Here we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs (JGNRs) with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb’s theorem and topological classification theory14–16, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introducing a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks the structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin-symmetry breaking. Three Z-shaped precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the ‘defective’ edge. Characterization by scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of JGNRs with a ferromagnetic ground-state localized along the pristine zigzag edge. Janus graphene nanoribbons with localized states on a single zigzag edge are fabricated by introducing a topological defect array of benzene motifs on the opposite zigzag edge, to break the structural symmetry.",

    "abstract": "Mimicking the superstructures and properties of spherical biological encapsulants such as viral capsids1 and ferritin2 offers viable pathways to understand their chiral assemblies and functional roles in living systems. However, stereospecific assembly of artificial polyhedra with mechanical properties and guest-binding attributes akin to biological encapsulants remains a formidable challenge. Here we report the stereospecific assembly of dynamic supramolecular snub cubes from 12 helical macrocycles, which are held together by 144 weak C–H hydrogen bonds3. The enantiomerically pure snub cubes, which have external diameters of 5.1 nm, contain 2,712 atoms and chiral cavities with volumes of 6,215 Å3. The stereospecific assembly of left- and right-handed snub cubes was achieved by means of a hierarchical chirality transfer protocol4, which was streamlined by diastereoselective crystallization. In addition to their reversible photochromic behaviour, the snub cubes exhibit photocontrollable elasticity and hardness in their crystalline states. The snub cubes can accommodate numerous small guest molecules simultaneously and encapsulate two different guest molecules separately inside the uniquely distinct compartments in their frameworks. This research expands the scope of artificial supramolecular assemblies to imitate the chiral superstructures, dynamic features and binding properties of spherical biomacromolecules and also establishes a protocol for construction of crystalline materials with photocontrollable mechanical properties. Left- and right-handed snub cubes show photocontrollable elasticity and hardness, in addition to the ability to encapsulate different small molecules in distinct compartments simultaneously, with potential applications in the development of advanced biomimetic materials.",

    "abstract": "Cells display a range of mechanical activities generated by motor proteins powered through catalysis1. This raises the fundamental question of how the acceleration of a chemical reaction can enable the energy released from that reaction to be transduced (and, consequently, work to be done) by a molecular catalyst2–7. Here we demonstrate the molecular-level transduction of chemical energy to mechanical force8 in the form of the powered contraction and powered re-expansion of a cross-linked polymer gel driven by the directional rotation of artificial catalysis-driven9 molecular motors. Continuous 360° rotation of the rotor about the stator of the catalysis-driven motor-molecules incorporated in the polymeric framework of the gel twists the polymer chains of the cross-linked network around one another. This progressively increases writhe and tightens entanglements, causing a macroscopic contraction of the gel to approximately 70% of its original volume. The subsequent addition of the opposite enantiomer fuelling system powers the rotation of the motor-molecules in the reverse direction, unwinding the entanglements and causing the gel to re-expand. Continued powered twisting of the strands in the new direction causes the gel to re-contract. In addition to actuation, motor-molecule rotation in the gel produces other chemical and physical outcomes, including changes in the Young modulus and storage modulus—the latter is proportional to the increase in strand crossings resulting from motor rotation. The experimental demonstration of work against a load by a synthetic organocatalyst, and its mechanism of energy transduction6, informs both the debate3,5,7 surrounding the mechanism of force generation by biological motors and the design principles6,10–14 for artificial molecular nanotechnology. A cross-linked polymer gel driven by artificial molecular motors transforms chemical energy into mechanical force, achieving powered contraction and re-expansion, demonstrating a considerable advance in understanding energy transduction mechanisms and informing nanotechnology design principles.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are promising for advanced electronics beyond silicon1–3. Traditionally, TMDs are epitaxially grown on crystalline substrates by chemical vapour deposition. However, this approach requires post-growth transfer to target substrates, which makes controlling thickness and scalability difficult. Here we introduce a method called hypotaxy (‘hypo’ meaning downward and ‘taxy’ meaning arrangement), which enables wafer-scale single-crystal TMD growth directly on various substrates, including amorphous and lattice-mismatched substrates, while preserving crystalline alignment with an overlying 2D template. By sulfurizing or selenizing a pre-deposited metal film under graphene, aligned TMD nuclei form, coalescing into a single-crystal film as graphene is removed. This method achieves precise MoS2 thickness control from monolayer to hundreds of layers on diverse substrates, producing 4-inch single-crystal MoS2 with high thermal conductivity (about 120 W m−1 K−1) and mobility (around 87 cm2 V−1 s−1). Furthermore, nanopores created in graphene using oxygen plasma treatment allow MoS2 growth at a lower temperature of 400 °C, compatible with back-end-of-line processes. This hypotaxy approach extends to other TMDs, such as MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, offering a solution to substrate limitations in conventional epitaxy and enabling wafer-scale TMDs for monolithic three-dimensional integration. A new method ‘hypotaxy’ enables wafer-scale, single-crystal transition metal dichalcogenides growth directly on crystalline, lattice-mismatched and amorphous substrates.",

    "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation generally reduces biodiversity at the patch scale (α diversity)1. However, there is ongoing debate about whether such negative effects can be alleviated at the landscape scale (γ diversity) if among-patch diversity (β diversity) increases as a result of fragmentation2–6. This controversial view has not been rigorously tested. Here we use a dataset of 4,006 taxa across 37 studies from 6 continents to test the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity across scales by explicitly comparing continuous and fragmented landscapes. We find that fragmented landscapes consistently have both lower α diversity and lower γ diversity. Although fragmented landscapes did tend to have higher β diversity, this did not translate into higher γ diversity. Our findings refute claims that habitat fragmentation can increase biodiversity at landscape scales, and emphasize the need to restore habitat and increase connectivity to minimize biodiversity loss at ever-increasing scales. An analysis of habitat fragmentation using a dataset of more than 4,000 species worldwide shows that fragmentation reduces biodiversity at all scales, and that increases in β diversity do not compensate for the loss of α diversity.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryote Tree of Life (eToL) depicts the relationships among all eukaryotic organisms; its root represents the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) from which all extant complex lifeforms are descended1. Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start point for the evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling and limited phylogenetic signal1. Here we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution on the basis of a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins that includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our analyses of a 100 taxon × 93 protein dataset with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models and an extensive evaluation of alternative hypotheses show that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages: ‘Opimoda+’ and ‘Diphoda+’. This position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups containing ‘typical excavates’ are placed on both sides of the root, suggesting the complex features of the ‘excavate’ cell architecture trace back to LECA. This study sheds light on the ancestral cells from which extant eukaryotes arose and provides a crucial framework for investigating the origin and evolution of canonical eukaryotic features. The root of the eukaryote Tree of Life is estimated from a new, larger dataset of mitochondrial proteins including all known eukaryotic supergroups, showing it lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages.",

    "abstract": "Vision provides animals with detailed information about their surroundings and conveys diverse features such as colour, form and movement across the visual scene. Computing these parallel spatial features requires a large and diverse network of neurons. Consequently, from flies to humans, visual regions in the brain constitute half its volume. These visual regions often have marked structure–function relationships, with neurons organized along spatial maps and with shapes that directly relate to their roles in visual processing. More than a century of anatomical studies have catalogued in detail cell types in fly visual systems1–3, and parallel behavioural and physiological experiments have examined the visual capabilities of flies. To unravel the diversity of a complex visual system, careful mapping of the neural architecture matched to tools for targeted exploration of this circuitry is essential. Here we present a connectome of the right optic lobe from a male Drosophila melanogaster acquired using focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy. We established a comprehensive inventory of the visual neurons and developed a computational framework to quantify their anatomy. Together, these data establish a basis for interpreting how the shapes of visual neurons relate to spatial vision. By integrating this analysis with connectivity information, neurotransmitter identity and expert curation, we classified the approximately 53,000 neurons into 732 types. These types are systematically described and about half are newly named. Finally, we share an extensive collection of split-GAL4 lines matched to our neuron-type catalogue. Overall, this comprehensive set of tools and data unlocks new possibilities for systematic investigations of vision in Drosophila and provides a foundation for a deeper understanding of sensory processing. A connectome of the right optic lobe from a male fruitfly is presented together with an extensive collection of genetic drivers matched to a comprehensive neuron-type catalogue.",

However, the dynamics and energy associated with these processes, including submesoscale eddies and nonlinear internal waves, have never been observed from a global perspective. Where, when and how much do these submesoscale processes contribute to the large-scale ocean circulation and climate system? Here we show data from the recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite12 that not only confirm the characteristics of submesoscale eddies and waves but also suggest that their potential impacts on ocean energetics, the marine ecosystem, atmospheric weather and Earth’s climate system are much larger than anticipated. SWOT ushers in a new era of global ocean observing, placing submesoscale ocean dynamics as a critical element of the Earth’s climate system. Data from the recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite reveal the characteristics of submesoscale eddies and waves and suggest that their potential impacts on overall ocean circulation is much larger than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "During the twentieth century, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered a disease of early industrialized regions in North America, Europe and Oceania1. At the turn of the twenty-first century, IBD incidence increased in newly industrialized and emerging regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America, while the prevalence in early industrialized regions continued to grow steadily2–4. Changes in the incidence and prevalence denote the evolution of IBD across four epidemiologic stages: stage 1 (emergence), characterized by low incidence and prevalence; stage 2 (acceleration in incidence), marked by rapidly rising incidence and low prevalence; and stage 3 (compounding prevalence), where the incidence decelerates, plateaus or declines while the prevalence steadily increases. A fourth stage (prevalence equilibrium) has been proposed in which the prevalence slope plateaus due to demographic shifts in an ageing IBD population, but it has not yet been evidenced. To date, these stages have remained theoretical, lacking specific numerical indicators to define transition points. Here, using real-world data from 522 population-based studies encompassing 82 global regions and spanning more than a century (1920–2024), we show spatiotemporal transitions across stages 1–3 and model stage 4 progression. Understanding the evolution of IBD across epidemiologic stages enables healthcare systems to better anticipate the future worldwide burden of IBD. An analysis of data from 522 population-based studies encompassing 82 global regions and spanning more than a century (1920–2024) shows spatiotemporal transitions across epidemiologic stages 1 to 3 of inflammatory bowel disease, and models stage 4 progression.",

    "abstract": "Plants lack specialized and mobile immune cells. Consequently, any cell type that encounters pathogens must mount immune responses and communicate with surrounding cells for successful defence. However, the diversity, spatial organization and function of cellular immune states in pathogen-infected plants are poorly understood1. Here we infect Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with bacterial pathogens that trigger or supress immune responses and integrate time-resolved single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial transcriptomic data to identify cell states. We describe cell-state-specific gene-regulatory logic that involves transcription factors, putative cis-regulatory elements and target genes associated with disease and immunity. We show that a rare cell population emerges at the nexus of immune-active hotspots, which we designate as primary immune responder (PRIMER) cells. PRIMER cells have non-canonical immune signatures, exemplified by the expression and genome accessibility of a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, GT-3A, which contributes to plant immunity against bacterial pathogens. PRIMER cells are surrounded by another cell state (bystander) that activates genes for long-distance cell-to-cell immune signalling. Together, our findings suggest that interactions between these cell states propagate immune responses across the leaf. Our molecularly defined single-cell spatiotemporal atlas provides functional and regulatory insights into immune cell states in plants. The development of a molecularly defined spatiotemporal atlas of pathogen-infected Arabidopsis thaliana leaves reveals specific cell states that have distinct roles in plant immunity.",

    "abstract": "Rubisco is the primary CO2-fixing enzyme of the biosphere1, yet it has slow kinetics2. The roles of evolution and chemical mechanism in constraining its biochemical function remain debated3,4. Engineering efforts aimed at adjusting the biochemical parameters of rubisco have largely failed5, although recent results indicate that the functional potential of rubisco has a wider scope than previously known6. Here we developed a massively parallel assay, using an engineered Escherichia coli7 in which enzyme activity is coupled to growth, to systematically map the sequence–function landscape of rubisco. Composite assay of more than 99% of single-amino acid mutants versus CO2 concentration enabled inference of enzyme velocity and apparent CO2 affinity parameters for thousands of substitutions. This approach identified many highly conserved positions that tolerate mutation and rare mutations that improve CO2 affinity. These data indicate that non-trivial biochemical changes are readily accessible and that the functional distance between rubiscos from diverse organisms can be traversed, laying the groundwork for further enzyme engineering efforts. A massively parallel assay developed to map the essential photosynthetic enzyme rubisco showed that non-trivial biochemical changes and improvements in CO2 affinity are possible, signposting further enzyme engineering efforts to increase crop yields.",

    "abstract": "Photonics offers a promising platform for quantum computing1–4, owing to the availability of chip integration for mass-manufacturable modules, fibre optics for networking and room-temperature operation of most components. However, experimental demonstrations are needed of complete integrated systems comprising all basic functionalities for universal and fault-tolerant operation5. Here we construct a (sub-performant) scale model of a quantum computer using 35 photonic chips to demonstrate its functionality and feasibility. This combines all the primitive components as discrete, scalable rack-deployed modules networked over fibre-optic interconnects, including 84 squeezers6 and 36 photon-number-resolving detectors furnishing 12 physical qubit modes at each clock cycle. We use this machine, which we name Aurora, to synthesize a cluster state7 entangled across separate chips with 86.4 billion modes, and demonstrate its capability of implementing the foliated distance-2 repetition code with real-time decoding. The key building blocks needed for universality and fault tolerance are demonstrated: heralded synthesis of single-temporal-mode non-Gaussian resource states, real-time multiplexing actuated on photon-number-resolving detection, spatiotemporal cluster-state formation with fibre buffers, and adaptive measurements implemented using chip-integrated homodyne detectors with real-time single-clock-cycle feedforward. We also present a detailed analysis of our architecture’s tolerances for optical loss, which is the dominant and most challenging hurdle to crossing the fault-tolerant threshold. This work lays out the path to cross the fault-tolerant threshold and scale photonic quantum computers to the point of addressing useful applications. A proof-of-principle study reports a complete photonic quantum computer architecture that can, once appropriate component performance is achieved, deliver a universal and fault-tolerant quantum computer.",

    "abstract": "The development of animal models is crucial for studying and treating mitochondrial diseases. Here we optimized adenine and cytosine deaminases to reduce off-target effects on the transcriptome and the mitochondrial genome, improving the accuracy and efficiency of our newly developed mitochondrial base editors (mitoBEs)1. Using these upgraded mitoBEs (version 2 (v2)), we targeted 70 mouse mitochondrial DNA mutations analogous to human pathogenic variants2, establishing a foundation for mitochondrial disease mouse models. Circular RNA-encoded mitoBEs v2 achieved up to 82% editing efficiency in mice without detectable off-target effects in the nuclear genome. The edited mitochondrial DNA persisted across various tissues and was maternally inherited, resulting in F1 generation mice with mutation loads as high as 100% and some mice exhibiting editing only at the target site. By optimizing the transcription activator-like effector (TALE) binding site, we developed a single-base-editing mouse model for the mt-Nd5 A12784G mutation. Phenotypic evaluations led to the creation of mouse models for the mt-Atp6 T8591C and mt-Nd5 A12784G mutations, exhibiting phenotypes corresponding to the reduced heart rate seen in Leigh syndrome and the vision loss characteristic of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, respectively. Moreover, the mt-Atp6 T8591C mutation proved to be more deleterious than mt-Nd5 A12784G, affecting embryonic development and rapidly diminishing through successive generations. These upgraded mitoBEs offer a highly efficient and precise strategy for constructing mitochondrial disease models, laying a foundation for further research in this field. A study reports optimized mitochondrial base editors with reduced off-target effects to facilitate the generation of mouse models of human mitochondrial diseases.",

    "abstract": "Since the onset of the pandemic, many SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, exhibiting substantial evolution in the virus’ spike protein1, the main target of neutralizing antibodies2. A plausible hypothesis proposes that the virus evolves to evade antibody-mediated neutralization (vaccine- or infection-induced) to maximize its ability to infect an immunologically experienced population1,3. Because viral infection induces neutralizing antibodies, viral evolution may thus navigate on a dynamic immune landscape that is shaped by local infection history. Here we developed a comprehensive mechanistic model, incorporating deep mutational scanning data4,5, antibody pharmacokinetics and regional genomic surveillance data, to predict the variant-specific relative number of susceptible individuals over time. We show that this quantity precisely matched historical variant dynamics, predicted future variant dynamics and explained global differences in variant dynamics. Our work strongly suggests that the ongoing pandemic continues to shape variant-specific population immunity, which determines a variant’s ability to transmit, thus defining variant fitness. The model can be applied to any region by utilizing local genomic surveillance data, allows contextualizing risk assessment of variants and provides information for vaccine design. A modelling approach predicts SARS-CoV-2 variant dynamics on the basis of immunity and cross-neutralization, which was shaped by a region’s SARS-CoV-2 infection history.",

    "abstract": "The construction of superlattices with a spatial modulation of chemical compositions allows for the creation of artificial materials with tailorable periodic potential landscapes and tunable electronic and optical properties1–5. Conventional semiconductor superlattices with designable potential modulation in one dimension has enabled high-electron-mobility transistors and quantum-cascade lasers. More recently, a diverse set of superlattices has been constructed through self-assembly or guided assembly of multiscale building units, including zero-dimensional nanoclusters and nanoparticles6,7, one-dimensional nanorods and nanowires8,9, two-dimensional nanolayers and nanosheets10–13, and hybrid two-dimensional molecular assemblies14–17. These self-assembled superlattices feature periodic structural modulation in two or three dimensions, but often lack atomic precision owing to the inevitable structural disorder at the interfaces between the constituent units. Here we report a one-pot synthesis of multi-dimensional single-crystalline superlattices consisting of periodic arrangement of zero-, one- and two-dimensional building units. By exploiting zirconium (IV) metal–organic frameworks as host templates for directed nucleation and precise growth of metal-halide sublattices through a coordination-assisted assembly strategy, we synthesize a family of single-crystalline porous superlattices. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy clearly resolve the high-order superlattice structure with deterministic atomic coordinates. Further treatment with selected amine molecules produces perovskite-like superlattices with highly tunable photoluminescence and chiroptical properties. Our study creates a platform of high-order single-crystalline porous superlattices, opening opportunities to tailor the electronic, optical and quantum properties beyond the reach of conventional crystalline solids. Using zirconium metal–organic frameworks as the host template for directed nucleation and precise growth of metal-halide sublattices, multi-dimensional single-crystalline porous superlattices can be achieved through a one-pot synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages specialize in phagocytosis, a cellular process that eliminates extracellular matter, including microorganisms, through internalization and degradation1,2. Despite the critical role of phagocytosis during bacterial infection, the fate of phagocytosed microbial cargo and its impact on the host cell are poorly understood. In this study, we show that ingested bacteria constitute an alternative nutrient source that skews immunometabolic host responses. By tracing stable isotope-labelled bacteria, we found that phagolysosomal degradation of bacteria provides carbon atoms and amino acids that are recycled into various metabolic pathways, including glutathione and itaconate biosynthesis, and satisfies the bioenergetic needs of macrophages. Metabolic recycling of microbially derived nutrients is regulated by the nutrient-sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex C1 and is intricately tied to microbial viability. Dead bacteria, as opposed to live bacteria, are enriched in cyclic adenosine monophosphate, sustain the cellular adenosine monophosphate pool and subsequently activate adenosine monophosphate protein kinase to inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex C1. Consequently, killed bacteria strongly fuel metabolic recycling and support macrophage survival but elicit decreased reactive oxygen species production and reduced interleukin-1β secretion compared to viable bacteria. These results provide a new insight into the fate of engulfed microorganisms and highlight a microbial viability-associated metabolite that triggers host metabolic and immune responses. Our findings hold promise for shaping immunometabolic intervention for various immune-related pathologies. Phagocytosed bacteria can serve as an alternative nutrient source for macrophages, influencing their metabolic and immune responses through the recycling of microbial components, with the process regulated by nutrient-sensing mechanisms and bacterial viability.",

    "abstract": "Social grouping increases survival in many species, including humans1,2. By contrast, social isolation generates an aversive state (‘loneliness’) that motivates social seeking and heightens social interaction upon reunion3–5. The observed rebound in social interaction triggered by isolation suggests a homeostatic process underlying the control of social need, similar to physiological drives such as hunger, thirst or sleep3,6. In this study, we assessed social responses in several mouse strains, among which FVB/NJ mice emerged as highly, and C57BL/6J mice as moderately, sensitive to social isolation. Using both strains, we uncovered two previously uncharacterized neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus that are activated during either social isolation or social rebound and orchestrate the behaviour display of social need and social satiety, respectively. We identified direct connectivity between these two populations and with brain areas associated with social behaviour, emotional state, reward and physiological needs and showed that mice require touch to assess the presence of others and fulfil their social need. These data show a brain-wide neural system underlying social homeostasis and provide significant mechanistic insights into the nature and function of circuits controlling instinctive social need and for the understanding of healthy and diseased brain states associated with social context. New data on brain-wide circuits centred around two interconnected hypothalamic neuron populations provide significant mechanistic insights into the emergence of social need during social isolation and the satiation of social need during social reunion.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has shown that increased levels of circulating long-chain ceramides predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease independently of cholesterol1,2. Although targeting ceramide signalling may provide therapeutic benefits beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, the underlying mechanism by which circulating ceramides aggravate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains elusive. Here we examine whether circulating long-chain ceramides activate membrane G-protein-coupled receptors to exacerbate atherosclerosis. We perform a systematic screen that combines G-protein-signalling quantification, bioinformatic analysis of G-protein-coupled receptor expression and functional examination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The results suggest that CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 are potential endogenous receptors of C16:0 ceramide-induced inflammasome activation in both endothelial cells and macrophages. Inhibition of CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 genetically or pharmacologically alleviates ceramide-induced atherosclerosis aggravation. Moreover, increased ceramide levels correlate with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Notably, CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 deficiency mitigates chronic-kidney-disease-aggravated atherosclerosis in mice without affecting cholesterol or ceramide levels. Structural analyses of ceramide–CYSLTR2–Gq complexes reveal that both C16:0 and C20:0 ceramides bind in an inclined channel-like ligand-binding pocket on CYSLTR2. We further reveal an unconventional mechanism underlying ceramide-induced CYSLTR2 activation and the CYSLTR2–Gq interface. Overall, our study provides structural and molecular mechanisms of how long-chain ceramides initiate transmembrane Gq and inflammasome signalling through direct binding to CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 receptors. Therefore, blocking these signals may provide a new therapeutic potential to treat atherosclerosis-related diseases. CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 are identified as endogenous ceramide receptors, and inhibition of these ameliorates atherosclerosis, particularly in chronic-kidney-disease-associated cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "DNA sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) modulate transcription and chromatin architecture, acting from regulatory sites in enhancers and promoters of eukaryotic genes1,2. How multiple TFs cooperate to regulate individual genes is still unclear. In yeast, most TFs are thought to regulate transcription via binding to upstream activating sequences, which are situated within a few hundred base pairs upstream of the regulated gene3. Although this model has been validated for individual TFs and specific genes, it has not been tested in a systematic way. Here we integrated information on the binding and expression targets for the near-complete set of yeast TFs and show that, contrary to expectations, there are few TFs with dedicated activator or repressor roles, and that most TFs have a dual function. Although nearly all protein-coding genes are regulated by one or more TFs, our analysis revealed limited overlap between TF binding and gene regulation. Rapid depletion of many TFs also revealed many regulatory targets that were distant from detectable TF binding sites, suggesting unexpected regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a comprehensive survey of TF functions and offers insights into interactions between the set of TFs expressed in a single cell type and how they contribute to the complex programme of gene regulation. A near-complete survey of transcription factor activities in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that most transcription factors have both activator and repressor activities and limited overlap between their binding sites on DNA and regulation of nearby genes.",

    "abstract": "In organisms ranging from vertebrates to plants, major components of centromeres are rapidly evolving repeat sequences, such as tandem repeats (TRs) and transposable elements (TEs), which harbour centromere-specific histone H3 (CENH3)1,2. Complete centromere structures recently determined in human and Arabidopsis suggest frequent integration and purging of retrotransposons within the TR regions of centromeres3–5. Despite the high impact of ‘centrophilic’ retrotransposons on the paradox of rapid centromere evolution, the mechanisms involved in centromere targeting remain poorly understood in any organism. Here we show that both Ty3 and Ty1 long terminal repeat retrotransposons rapidly turnover within the centromeric TRs of Arabidopsis species. We demonstrate that the Ty1/Copia element Tal1 (Transposon of Arabidopsis lyrata 1) integrates de novo into regions occupied by CENH3 in Arabidopsis thaliana, and that ectopic expansion of the CENH3 region results in spread of Tal1 integration regions. The integration spectra of chimeric TEs reveal the key structural variations responsible for contrasting chromatin-targeting specificities to centromeres versus gene-rich regions, which have recurrently converted during the evolution of these TEs. Our findings show the impact of centromeric chromatin on TE-mediated rapid centromere evolution, with relevance across eukaryotic genomes.  An Arabidopsis long terminal repeat retrotransposon integrates de novo into regions occupied by centromere-specific histone variant, showing the impact of centromeric chromatin on transposable element-mediated rapid centromere evolution, with relevance across eukaryotic genomes.",

This process is concomitant with the hippocampal reactivation of previous memories4–6, posing the problem of how to prevent interference between older and recent, initially labile, memory traces. Theoretical work has suggested that consolidating multiple memories while minimizing interference can be achieved by randomly interleaving their reactivation7–10. An alternative is that a temporal microstructure of sleep can promote the reactivation of different types of memories during specific substates. Here, to test these two hypotheses, we developed a method to simultaneously record large hippocampal ensembles and monitor sleep dynamics through pupillometry in naturally sleeping mice. Oscillatory pupil fluctuations revealed a previously unknown microstructure of non-REM sleep-associated memory processes. We found that memory replay of recent experiences dominated in sharp-wave ripples during contracted pupil substates of non-REM sleep, whereas replay of previous memories preferentially occurred during dilated pupil substates. Selective closed-loop disruption of sharp-wave ripples during contracted pupil non-REM sleep impaired the recall of recent memories, whereas the same manipulation during dilated pupil substates had no behavioural effect. Stronger extrinsic excitatory inputs characterized the contracted pupil substate, whereas higher recruitment of local inhibition was prominent during dilated pupil substates. Thus, the microstructure of non-REM sleep organizes memory replay, with previous versus new memories being temporally segregated in different substates and supported by local and input-driven mechanisms, respectively. Our results suggest that the brain can multiplex distinct cognitive processes during sleep to facilitate continuous learning without interference. The temporal microstructure of the brain can multiplex distinct cognitive processes during sleep to support continuous learning.",

    "abstract": "Lung metastases occur in up to 54% of patients with metastatic tumours1,2. Contributing factors to this high frequency include the physical properties of the pulmonary system and a less oxidative environment that may favour the survival of cancer cells3. Moreover, secreted factors from primary tumours alter immune cells and the extracellular matrix of the lung, creating a permissive pre-metastatic environment primed for the arriving cancer cells4,5. Nutrients are also primed during pre-metastatic niche formation6. Yet, whether and how nutrients available in organs in which tumours metastasize confer cancer cells with aggressive traits is mostly undefined. Here we found that pulmonary aspartate triggers a cellular signalling cascade in disseminated cancer cells, resulting in a translational programme that boosts aggressiveness of lung metastases. Specifically, we observe that patients and mice with breast cancer have high concentrations of aspartate in their lung interstitial fluid. This extracellular aspartate activates the ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor in cancer cells, which promotes CREB-dependent expression of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). DOHH is essential for hypusination, a post-translational modification that is required for the activity of the non-classical translation initiation factor eIF5A. In turn, a translational programme with TGFβ signalling as a central hub promotes collagen synthesis in lung-disseminated breast cancer cells. We detected key proteins of this mechanism in lung metastases from patients with breast cancer. In summary, we found that aspartate, a classical biosynthesis metabolite, functions in the lung environment as an extracellular signalling molecule to promote aggressiveness of metastases. Aspartate in the tumour environment activates the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor in cancer cells to induce cellular programmes that increase the aggressiveness of metastasis.",

    "abstract": "The concept of non-Hermiticity has expanded the understanding of band topology, leading to the emergence of counter-intuitive phenomena. An example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)1–7, which involves the concentration of eigenstates at the boundary. However, despite the potential insights that can be gained from high-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum systems in areas such as curved space8–10, high-order topological phases11,12 and black holes13,14, the realization of this effect in high dimensions remains unexplored. Here we create a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian topological band for ultracold fermions in spin–orbit-coupled optical lattices with tunable dissipation, which exhibits the NHSE. We first experimentally demonstrate pronounced nonzero spectral winding numbers in the complex energy plane with nonzero dissipation, which establishes the existence of 2D skin effect. Furthermore, we observe the real-space dynamical signature of NHSE in real space by monitoring the centre of mass motion of atoms. Finally, we also demonstrate that a pair of exceptional points are created in the momentum space, connected by an open-ended bulk Fermi arc, in contrast to closed loops found in Hermitian systems. The associated exceptional points emerge and shift with increasing dissipation, leading to the formation of the Fermi arc. Our work sets the stage for further investigation into simulating non-Hermitian physics in high dimensions and paves the way for understanding the interplay of quantum statistics with NHSE. A two-dimensional non-Hermitian topological band is created in an ultracold system of fermions, which exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect.",

    "abstract": "C–H activation is the most direct way of functionalizing organic molecules. Many advances in this field still require specific directing groups to achieve the necessary activity and selectivity. Developing C–H activation reactions directed by native functional groups is essential for their broad application in synthesis1. Over the past decade, several generations of bifunctional ligands developed have enabled C(sp3)–H activation reactions of free carboxylic acids2, free aliphatic amines3, native amides4,5 and alcohols6. However, an effective catalyst for ketones and carboxylic esters remains to be realized. Here we report diverse methyl β-C−H functionalizations, including intermolecular arylation, hydroxylation and intramolecular C(sp3)–H/C(sp2)–H coupling of ketones and carboxylic esters with a monoprotected amino neutral amide (MPANA) ligand. The in situ generation of cationic Pd(II) complexes by the combination MPANA ligand and HBF4 is crucial for achieving the reactivity. The compatibility of these reactions with cyclic ketones and lactams provides a method to access spirocyclic and fused ring systems. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory studies support the role of cationic Pd complexes with MPANA ligands in enhancing catalyst–substrate affinity and facilitating the C−H cleavage step. Diverse methyl β-C−H functionalizations of ketones and esters are enabled by cationic Pd(II) complexes with MPANA ligands, offering access to spirocyclic and fused ring systems through enhanced catalyst–substrate affinity.",

    "abstract": "Histone H3 monoaminylations at Gln5 represent an important family of epigenetic marks in brain that have critical roles in permissive gene expression1–3. We previously demonstrated that serotonylation4–10 and dopaminylation9,11–13 of Gln5 of histone H3 (H3Q5ser and H3Q5dop, respectively) are catalysed by transglutaminase 2 (TG2), and alter both local and global chromatin states. Here we found that TG2 additionally functions as an eraser and exchanger of H3 monoaminylations, including H3Q5 histaminylation (H3Q5his), which displays diurnally rhythmic expression in brain and contributes to circadian gene expression and behaviour. We found that H3Q5his, in contrast to H3Q5ser, inhibits the binding of WDR5, a core member of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes, thereby antagonizing methyltransferase activities on H3K4. Taken together, these data elucidate a mechanism through which a single chromatin regulatory enzyme has the ability to sense chemical microenvironments to affect the epigenetic states of cells, the dynamics of which have critical roles in the regulation of neural rhythmicity. TG2 functions as an eraser and exchanger of H3 monoaminylations, including histaminylation of Gln5 of histone H3.",

    "abstract": "The genetic code is conserved across all domains of life, yet exceptions have revealed variations in codon assignments and associated translation factors1–3. Inspired by this natural malleability, synthetic approaches have demonstrated whole-genome replacement of synonymous codons to construct genomically recoded organisms (GROs)4,5 with alternative genetic codes. However, no efforts have fully leveraged translation factor plasticity and codon degeneracy to compress translation function to a single codon and assess the possibility of a non-degenerate code. Here we describe construction and characterization of Ochre, a GRO that fully compresses a translational function into a single codon. We replaced 1,195 TGA stop codons with the synonymous TAA in ∆TAG Escherichia coli C321.∆A4. We then engineered release factor 2 (RF2) and tRNATrp to mitigate native UGA recognition, translationally isolating four codons for non-degenerate functions. Ochre thus utilizes UAA as the sole stop codon, with UGG encoding tryptophan and UAG and UGA reassigned for multi-site incorporation of two distinct non-standard amino acids into single proteins with more than 99% accuracy. Ochre fully compresses degenerate stop codons into a single codon and represents an important step toward a 64-codon non-degenerate code that will enable precise production of multi-functional synthetic proteins with unnatural encoded chemistries and broad utility in biotechnology and biotherapeutics. Ochre, a strain of Escherichia coli engineered to have a single stop codon, enables reassignment of four codons for non-degenerate functions, such as incorporation of non-standard amino acids into proteins.",

    "abstract": "Cancer mutations can create neomorphic protein–protein interactions to drive aberrant function1,2. As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma3, the most common embryonal brain tumour in children4. These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST5. However, their mechanism remains unresolved. Here we establish that KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2 as the direct target of the mutant substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we chart the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat β-propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 β-propellers is stabilized by the medulloblastoma mutations, which insert a bulky side chain into the HDAC1 active site pocket. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3–neosubstrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, we unveil a converging shape-complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4–HDAC1 interface and proliferation of KBTBD4-mutant medulloblastoma cells. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein–protein interactions. We show that gain-of-function cancer mutations in the KBTBD4 E3 ligase promote neodegradation of substrates via a shape-complementarity-based mechanism, which converges with the mechanism of action of the UM171 molecular glue degrader and can be blocked by HDAC1/2 inhibitors.",

We identified T cell receptor clones capable of recognizing and targeting neoantigens derived from aberrant splicing in GNAS and RPL22. In cases with multi-site biopsies, we detected the tumour-wide expression of the GNAS neojunction in glioma, mesothelioma, prostate cancer and liver cancer. These neoantigens are endogenously generated and presented by tumour cells under physiologic conditions and are sufficient to trigger cancer cell eradication by neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Moreover, our study highlights a role for dysregulated splicing factor expression in specific cancer types, leading to recurrent patterns of neojunction upregulation. These findings establish a molecular basis for T cell-based immunotherapies addressing the challenges of intratumoural heterogeneity. A study identifies public neoantigens generated by tumor-wide aberrant mRNA splicing activity across distinct cancer types.",

    "abstract": "When two insulating, neutral materials are contacted and separated, they exchange electrical charge1. Experiments have long suggested that this ‘contact electrification’ is transitive, with different materials ordering into ‘triboelectric series’ based on the sign of charge acquired2. At the same time, the effect is plagued by unpredictability, preventing consensus on the mechanism and casting doubt on the rhyme and reason that series imply3. Here we expose an unanticipated connection between the unpredictability and order in contact electrification: nominally identical materials initially exchange charge randomly and intransitively, but—over repeated experiments—order into triboelectric series. We find that this evolution is driven by the act of contact itself—samples with more contacts in their history charge negatively to ones with fewer contacts. Capturing this ‘contact bias’ in a minimal model, we recreate both the initial randomness and ultimate order in numerical simulations and use it experimentally to force the appearance of a triboelectric series of our choosing. With a set of surface-sensitive techniques to search for the underlying alterations contact creates, we only find evidence of nanoscale morphological changes, pointing to a mechanism strongly coupled with mechanics. Our results highlight the centrality of contact history in contact electrification and suggest that focusing on the unpredictability that has long plagued the effect may hold the key to understanding it. Nominally identical materials are found to spontaneously order into triboelectric series over repeated processes, which is found to be driven by the act of contact itself using experiments as well as numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "Topological defects and disorder counteract each other1–5. Intuitively, disorder is considered detrimental, requiring efforts to mitigate its effects in conventional topological photonics6–9. We propose a counter-intuitive approach that exploits a real–momentum topological photonic crystal that harnesses real-space disorder to generate a Pancharatnam–Berry phase10,11, without disrupting the momentum-space singularity originating from bound states in the continuum12. This methodology allows flat optical devices to encode spatial information or even extra topological charge in real space while preserving the topology of bound states in the continuum in momentum space with inherent alignment. Here, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the simultaneous and independent generation of a real-space broadband vortex or a holographic image alongside resonant momentum-space vortex beams with a narrow bandwidth, which cannot be achieved with conventional methods. Such engineered disorder contributes to vast intrinsic freedoms without adding extra dimensions or compromising the optical flatness13,14. Our findings of real–momentum duality not only lay the foundation for disorder engineering in topological photonics but also open new avenues for optical wavefront shaping, encryption and communications. A real–momentum topological photonic crystal that harnesses real-space disorder is used to generate a Pancharatnam–Berry phase while preserving momentum-space topology.",

    "abstract": "A quantum network1–3 provides an infrastructure that connects quantum devices with revolutionary computing, sensing and communication capabilities. A quantum satellite constellation offers a solution to facilitate the quantum network on a global scale4,5. The Micius satellite has verified the feasibility of satellite quantum communications6–9; however, scaling up quantum satellite constellations is challenging, requiring small lightweight satellites, portable ground stations and real-time secure key exchange. Here we tackle these challenges and report the development of a quantum microsatellite capable of performing space-to-ground quantum key distribution using portable ground stations. The microsatellite payload weighs approximately 23 kilograms, and the portable ground station weighs about 100 kilograms, representing reductions by more than 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively. Using this set-up, we demonstrate satellite-based quantum key distribution with multiple ground stations and achieve the sharing of up to 1.07 million bits of secure keys during a single satellite pass. In addition, we multiplex bidirectional satellite–ground optical communication with quantum communication, enabling key distillation and secure communication in real time. Also, a secret key, enabling one-time pad encryption of images, is created between China and South Africa at locations separated by over 12,900 kilometres on Earth. The compact quantum payload can be readily assembled on existing space stations10,11 or small satellites12, paving the way for a satellite-constellation-based quantum and classical network for widespread real-life applications. A quantum microsatellite, with a payload weighing only 23 kilograms, in combination with portable ground stations that weigh merely 100 kilograms, is capable of performing space-to-ground real-time quantum key distribution.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic reionization began when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe1,2. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300 Myr old3–5. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-α (Ly-α), the principal hydrogen transition6–9. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES10) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveals a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly-α, as well as a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of EWLy-α > 40 Å (rest frame), previously only seen at z < 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium becomes increasingly ionized11. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly-α emission indicates that the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionizing photons. This suggests that massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus have created an early reionized region to prevent complete extinction of Ly-α, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of reionization only 330 Myr after the Big Bang. Spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey of a galaxy at redshift 13 shows a singular, bright emission line identified as Lyman-α, suggesting the onset of reionization only 330 Myr after the Big Bang.",

    "abstract": "An important challenge in the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is the simultaneous attainment of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high stability. Using polymer interfaces in PSCs can enhance durability by blocking water and oxygen and by suppressing ion interdiffusion, but their electronic shielding poses a challenge for efficient and stable PSCs1–3. Here we report a magnetic endohedral metallofullerene Nd@C82–polymer coupling layer, which features ultrafast electron extraction and in situ encapsulation, thereby promoting homogeneous electron extraction and suppressing ion interdiffusion. The Nd@C82–polymer coupling layer in PSCs exhibited a PCE of 26.78% (certified 26.29%) and 23.08% with an aperture area of 0.08 cm2 and 16 cm2 (modules), respectively. The unencapsulated devices retained about 82% of the initial PCE after 2,500 h of continuous 1-sun maximum power point operation at 65 °C. An endohedral metallofullerene–polymer layer, which features ultrafast electron extraction and in situ encapsulation, improves the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian neocortex contains a highly diverse set of cell types. These cell types have been mapped systematically using a variety of molecular, electrophysiological and morphological approaches1–4. Each modality offers new perspectives on the variation of biological processes underlying cell-type specialization. Cellular-scale electron microscopy provides dense ultrastructural examination and an unbiased perspective on the subcellular organization of brain cells, including their synaptic connectivity and nanometre-scale morphology. In data that contain tens of thousands of neurons, most of which have incomplete reconstructions, identifying cell types becomes a clear challenge for analysis5. Here, to address this challenge, we present a systematic survey of the somatic region of all cells in a cubic millimetre of cortex using quantitative features obtained from electron microscopy. This analysis demonstrates that the perisomatic region is sufficient to identify cell types, including types defined primarily on the basis of their connectivity patterns. We then describe how this classification facilitates cell-type-specific connectivity characterization and locating cells with rare connectivity patterns in the dataset. An analysis demonstrates that quantitative measurements of perisomatic ultrastructure features of neurons can be used to categorize them into cell types.",

Despite these advances, no photonic chip has achieved the precision necessary for practical AI applications, and demonstrations have been limited to simplified benchmark tasks. Here we introduce a photonic AI processor that executes advanced AI models, including ResNet3 and BERT20,21, along with the Atari deep reinforcement learning algorithm originally demonstrated by DeepMind22. This processor achieves near-electronic precision for many workloads, marking a notable entry for photonic computing into competition with established electronic AI accelerators23 and an essential step towards developing post-transistor computing technologies.

    "abstract": "Incidence rates of colorectal cancer vary geographically and have changed over time1. Notably, in the past two decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, which affects individuals below 50 years of age, has doubled in many countries2–5. The reasons for this increase are unknown. Here we investigate whether mutational processes contribute to geographic and age-related differences by examining 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries. No major differences were found in microsatellite-unstable cancers, but variations in mutation burden and signatures were observed in the 802 microsatellite-stable cases. Multiple signatures, most with unknown aetiologies, exhibited varying prevalence in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia and Thailand, indicating geographically diverse levels of mutagenic exposure. Signatures SBS88 and ID18, caused by the bacteria-produced mutagen colibactin6,7, had higher mutation loads in countries with higher colorectal cancer incidence rates. SBS88 and ID18 were also enriched in early-onset colorectal cancers, being 3.3 times more common in individuals who were diagnosed before 40 years of age than in those over 70 years of age, and were imprinted early during colorectal cancer development. Colibactin exposure was further linked to APC driver mutations, with ID18 being responsible for about 25% of APC driver indels in colibactin-positive cases. This study reveals geographic and age-related variations in colorectal cancer mutational processes, and suggests that mutagenic exposure to colibactin-producing bacteria in early life may contribute to the increasing incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer. Analysis of genomic data from 981 colorectal cancers from participants in 11 countries reveals variations in mutational signatures of microsatellite-stable cancers that are dependent on geographical origin and age at which the cancer was diagnosed.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is an incurable brain malignancy. By the time of clinical diagnosis, these tumours exhibit a degree of genetic and cellular heterogeneity that provides few clues to the mechanisms that initiate and drive gliomagenesis1,2. Here, to explore the early steps in gliomagenesis, we utilized conditional gene deletion and lineage tracing in tumour mouse models, coupled with serial magnetic resonance imaging, to initiate and then closely track tumour formation. We isolated labelled and unlabelled cells at multiple stages—before the first visible abnormality, at the time of the first visible lesion, and then through the stages of tumour growth—and subjected cells of each stage to single-cell profiling. We identify a malignant cell state with a neural crest-like gene expression signature that is highly abundant in the early stages, but relatively diminished in the late stage of tumour growth. Genomic analysis based on the presence of copy number alterations suggests that these neural crest-like states exist as part of a heterogeneous clonal hierarchy that evolves with tumour growth. By exploring the injury response in wounded normal mouse brains, we identify cells with a similar signature that emerge following injury and then disappear over time, suggesting that activation of an injury response program occurs during tumorigenesis. Indeed, our experiments reveal a non-malignant injury-like microenvironment that is initiated in the brain following oncogene activation in cerebral precursor cells. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the early stages of glioblastoma, identifying a unique cell state and an injury response program tied to early tumour formation. These findings have implications for glioblastoma therapies and raise new possibilities for early diagnosis and prevention of disease. A study using glioblastoma mouse models, serial magnetic resonance imaging and single-cell profiling details changes in the identity and balance of cellular states from initiation of tumorigenesis to the end point.",

    "abstract": "Imaging inflammation holds immense potential for advancing the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of many conditions1–3. The lack of a specific and sensitive positron emission tomography (PET) probe to detect inflammation is a critical challenge. To bridge this gap, we present CD45-PET imaging, which detects inflammation with exceptional sensitivity and clarity in several preclinical models. Notably, the intensity of the CD45-PET signal correlates robustly with the severity of disease in models of inflammatory lung and bowel diseases, outperforming 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, the most widely used imaging modality for inflammation globally. Longitudinal CD45-PET imaging further enables precise monitoring of dynamic changes in tissue-specific inflammatory profiles. Finally, we developed a human CD45-PET probe for clinical translation that effectively detects human immune cells in a humanized mouse model. CD45-PET imaging holds substantial clinical promise, offering a tool for guiding diagnostic and therapeutic decisions for inflammatory diseases through a precise, whole-body assessment of the inflammation profiles of individual patients. A non-invasive in vivo positron emission tomography imaging approach detects inflammatory disease using various preclinical models.",

    "abstract": "Soil alkalinization and global warming are predicted to pose major challenges to agriculture in the future, as they continue to accelerate, markedly reducing global arable land and crop yields1,2. Therefore, strategies for future agriculture are needed to further improve globally cultivated, relatively high-yielding Green Revolution varieties (GRVs) derived from the SEMIDWARF 1 (SD1) gene3,4. Here we propose that precise regulation of the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) to optimal levels is the key to not only confer alkali–thermal tolerance to GRVs, but also to further enhance their yield. Endogenous modulation of ALKALI-THERMAL TOLERANCE 1/2 (ATT1/2), quantitative trait loci encoding GA20-oxidases or exogenous application of GA minimized rice yield loss affected by sodic soils. Mechanistically, high GA concentrations induce reactive oxygen species over-accumulation, whereas low GA concentrations repress the expression of stress-tolerance genes by means of DELLA–NGR5-mediated H3K27me3 methylation. We further showed that ATT1 induces large fluctuations in GA levels, whereas ATT2 is the ideal candidate for fine-tuning GA concentrations to appropriate levels to balance reactive oxygen species and H3K27me3 methylation to improve alkali–thermal tolerance and yield. Thus, ATT2 is expected to be a potential new post-Green Revolution gene that could be harnessed to develop and use marginal lands for sustainable agriculture in the future. Precise regulation of the phytohormone gibberellin to optimal levels may not only confer alkali–thermal tolerance to Green Revolution rice varieties but may also further enhance their yield, and ATT2, by enabling the fine-tuning of gibberellins, is expected to be a potential new post-Green Revolution gene.",

    "abstract": "The robustness of the macroscopic quantum nature of a superconductor can be characterized by the superfluid stiffness, ρs, a quantity that describes the energy required to vary the phase of the macroscopic quantum wavefunction. In unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, the low-temperature behaviour of ρs markedly differs from that of conventional superconductors owing to quasiparticle excitations from gapless points (nodes) in momentum space. Intensive research on the recently discovered magic-angle twisted graphene family has revealed, in addition to superconducting states, strongly correlated electronic states associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, inviting the study of ρs to uncover the potentially unconventional nature of its superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of ρs in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG), revealing unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity. Utilizing radio-frequency reflectometry techniques to measure the kinetic inductive response of superconducting TTG coupled to a microwave resonator, we find a linear temperature dependence of ρs at low temperatures and nonlinear Meissner effects in the current-bias dependence, both indicating nodal structures in the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, the doping dependence shows a linear correlation between the zero-temperature ρs and the superconducting transition temperature Tc, reminiscent of Uemura’s relation in cuprates, suggesting phase-coherence-limited superconductivity. Our results provide strong evidence for nodal superconductivity in TTG and put strong constraints on the mechanisms of these graphene-based superconductors. Measurements of the superfluid stiffness in twisted trilayer graphene reveal unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity, where the superconducting transition is controlled by phase fluctuations rather than Cooper-pair breaking.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced weathering (EW) with agriculture uses crushed silicate rocks to drive carbon dioxide removal (CDR)1,2. If widely adopted on farmlands, it could help achieve net-zero emissions by 20502–4. Here we show, with a detailed US state-specific carbon cycle analysis constrained by resource provision, that EW deployed on agricultural land could sequester 0.16–0.30 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2050, rising to 0.25–0.49 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2070. Geochemical assessment of rivers and oceans suggests effective transport of dissolved products from EW from soils, offering CDR on intergenerational timescales. Our analysis further indicates that EW may temporarily help lower ground-level ozone and concentrations of secondary aerosols in agricultural regions. Geospatially mapped CDR costs show heterogeneity across the USA, reflecting a combination of cropland distance from basalt source regions, timing of EW deployment and evolving CDR rates. CDR costs are highest in the first two decades before declining to about US$100–150 tCO2−1 by 2050, including for states that contribute most to total national CDR. Although EW cannot be a substitute for emission reductions, our assessment strengthens the case for EW as an overlooked practical innovation for helping the USA meet net-zero 2050 goals5,6. Public awareness of EW and equity impacts of EW deployment across the USA require further exploration7,8 and we note that mobilizing an EW industry at the necessary scale could take decades. A state-level analysis of the impact of enhanced weathering deployment on carbon sequestration on agricultural land suggests that enhanced weathering could help the USA meet net-zero 2050 goals.",

    "abstract": "Dense crowds form some of the most dangerous environments in modern society1. Dangers arise from uncontrolled collective motions, leading to compression against walls, suffocation and fatalities2–4. Our current understanding of crowd dynamics primarily relies on heuristic collision models, which effectively capture the behaviour observed in small groups of people5,6. However, the emergent dynamics of dense crowds, composed of thousands of individuals, remains a formidable many-body problem lacking quantitative experimental characterization and explanations rooted in first principles. Here we analyse the dynamics of thousands of densely packed individuals at the San Fermín festival (Spain) and infer a physical theory of dense crowds in confinement. Our measurements reveal that dense crowds can self-organize into macroscopic chiral oscillators, coordinating the orbital motion of hundreds of individuals without external guidance. Guided by these measurements and symmetry principles, we construct a mechanical model of dense-crowd motion. Our model demonstrates that emergent odd frictional forces drive a non-reciprocal phase transition7 towards collective chiral oscillations, capturing all our experimental observations. To test the robustness of our findings, we show that similar chiral dynamics emerged at the onset of the 2010 Love Parade disaster and propose a protocol that could help anticipate these previously unpredictable dynamics. Analysis of the confined crowds at the San Fermín festival in Spain shows that dense crowds can self-organize into macroscopic chiral oscillators, coordinating the orbital motion of hundreds of individuals without external guidance.",

    "abstract": "Cancer genome alterations often lead to vulnerabilities that can be used to selectively target cancer cells. Various inhibitors of such synthetic lethal targets have been approved by the FDA or are in clinical trials, highlighting the potential of this approach1–3. Here we analysed large-scale CRISPR knockout screening data from the Cancer Dependency Map and identified a new synthetic lethal target, PELO, for two independent molecular subtypes of cancer: biallelic deletion of chromosomal region 9p21.3 or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). In 9p21.3-deleted cancers, PELO dependency emerges from biallelic deletion of the 9p21.3 gene FOCAD, a stabilizer of the superkiller complex (SKIc). In MSI-H cancers, PELO is required owing to MSI-H-associated mutations in TTC37 (also known as SKIC3), a critical component of the SKIc. We show that both cancer subtypes converge to destabilize the SKIc, which extracts mRNA from stalled ribosomes. In SKIc-deficient cells, PELO depletion induces the unfolded protein response, a stress response to accumulation of misfolded or unfolded nascent polypeptides. Together, our findings indicate PELO as a promising therapeutic target for a large patient population with cancers characterized as MSI-H with deleterious TTC37 mutations or with biallelic 9p21.3 deletions involving FOCAD. Analysis of large-scale CRISPR screening data, combined with experiments in patient-derived tumour organoid models, identifies PELO as a potential therapeutic target in chromosomal 9p21.3-deleted cancers and microsatellite-unstable cancers harbouring specific mutations.",

    "abstract": "The biogenic structures produced by termites, ants and earthworms provide key functions across global ecosystems1,2. However, little is known about the drivers of the soil engineering effects caused by these small but important invertebrates3 at the global scale. Here we show, on the basis of a meta-analysis of 12,975 observations from 1,047 studies on six continents, that all three taxa increase soil macronutrient content, soil respiration and soil microbial and plant biomass compared with reference soils. The effect of termites on soil respiration and plant biomass, and the effect of earthworms on soil nitrogen and phosphorus content, increase with mean annual temperature and peak in the tropics. By contrast, the effects of ants on soil nitrogen, soil phosphorus, plant biomass and survival rate peak at mid-latitude ecosystems that have the lowest primary productivity. Notably, termites and ants increase plant growth by alleviating plant phosphorus limitation in the tropics and nitrogen limitation in temperate regions, respectively. Our study highlights the important roles of these invertebrate taxa in global biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions. Given the importance of these soil-engineering invertebrates, biogeochemical models should better integrate their effects, especially on carbon fluxes and nutrient cycles. A meta-analysis of more than 1,000 studies reveals the global ecosystem functions provided by termites, ants and earthworms as they improve soil quality by making biogenic structures such as termite mounds, ant hills and earthworm casts.",

    "abstract": "The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is highly specialized to protect the brain from harmful circulating factors in the blood and maintain brain homeostasis1,2. The brain endothelial glycocalyx layer, a carbohydrate-rich meshwork composed primarily of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycolipids that coats the BBB lumen, is a key structural component of the BBB3,4. This layer forms the first interface between the blood and brain vasculature, yet little is known about its composition and roles in supporting BBB function in homeostatic and diseased states. Here we find that the brain endothelial glycocalyx is highly dysregulated during ageing and neurodegenerative disease. We identify significant perturbation in an underexplored class of densely O-glycosylated proteins known as mucin-domain glycoproteins. We demonstrate that ageing- and disease-associated aberrations in brain endothelial mucin-domain glycoproteins lead to dysregulated BBB function and, in severe cases, brain haemorrhaging in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that we can improve BBB function and reduce neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in aged mice by restoring core 1 mucin-type O-glycans to the brain endothelium using adeno-associated viruses. Cumulatively, our findings provide a detailed compositional and structural mapping of the ageing brain endothelial glycocalyx layer and reveal important consequences of ageing- and disease-associated glycocalyx dysregulation on BBB integrity and brain health. Disruption of mucin-domain glycoprotein expression and function in the endothelial glycocalyx are associated with ageing and Alzheimer’s disease, leading to dysregulated blood–brain barrier function.",

    "abstract": "For decades, antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex class I for T cell-mediated immunity has been considered the primary function of proteasome-derived peptides1,2. However, whether the products of proteasomal degradation play additional parts in mounting immune responses remains unknown. Antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of defence against invading pathogens before the adaptive immune system responds. Although the protective function of antimicrobial peptides across numerous tissues is well established, the cellular mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. Here we uncover a role for proteasomes in the constitutive and bacterial-induced generation of defence peptides that impede bacterial growth both in vitro and in vivo by disrupting bacterial membranes. In silico prediction of proteome-wide proteasomal cleavage identified hundreds of thousands of potential proteasome-derived defence peptides with cationic properties that may be generated en route to degradation to act as a first line of defence. Furthermore, bacterial infection induces changes in proteasome composition and function, including PSME3 recruitment and increased tryptic-like cleavage, enhancing antimicrobial activity. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into the role of proteasomes in cell-autonomous innate immunity, our study suggests that proteasome-cleaved peptides may have previously overlooked functions downstream of degradation. From a translational standpoint, identifying proteasome-derived defence peptides could provide an untapped source of natural antibiotics for biotechnological applications and therapeutic interventions in infectious diseases and immunocompromised conditions. Proteasomal degradation of cellular proteins generate defence peptides constitutively and in response to bacterial infection. Such peptides might provide a source of natural antibiotics that could lead to biotechnology applications and therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have a central pathogenetic role in the development of liver fibrosis. However, their fibrosis-independent and homeostatic functions remain poorly understood1–5. Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion of HSCs changes WNT activity and zonation of hepatocytes, leading to marked alterations in liver regeneration, cytochrome P450 metabolism and injury. We identify R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), an HSC-enriched modulator of WNT signalling, as responsible for these hepatocyte-regulatory effects of HSCs. HSC-selective deletion of Rspo3 phenocopies the effects of HSC depletion on hepatocyte gene expression, zonation, liver size, regeneration and cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification, and exacerbates alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. RSPO3 expression decreases with HSC activation and is inversely associated with outcomes in patients with alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. These protective and hepatocyte-regulating functions of HSCs via RSPO3 resemble the R-spondin-expressing stromal niche in other organs and should be integrated into current therapeutic concepts. Hepatic stellate cells regulate hepatocyte functions via R-spondin 3.",

    "abstract": "Given the high recurrence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) post-resection1–3, improved early identification of patients at high risk for post-resection recurrence would help to improve patient outcomes and prioritize healthcare resources4–6. Here we observed a spatial and HCC recurrence-associated distribution of natural killer (NK) cells in the invasive front and tumour centre from 61 patients. Using extreme gradient boosting and inverse-variance weighting, we developed the tumour immune microenvironment spatial (TIMES) score based on the spatial expression patterns of five biomarkers (SPON2, ZFP36L2, ZFP36, VIM and HLA-DRB1) to predict HCC recurrence risk. The TIMES score (hazard ratio = 88.2, P < 0.001) outperformed current standard tools for patient risk stratification including the TNM and BCLC systems. We validated the model in 231 patients from five multicentred cohorts, achieving a real-world accuracy of 82.2% and specificity of 85.7%. The predictive power of these biomarkers emerged through the integration of their spatial distributions, rather than individual marker expression levels alone. In vivo models, including NK cell-specific Spon2-knockout mice, revealed that SPON2 enhances IFNγ secretion and NK cell infiltration at the invasive front. Our study introduces TIMES, a publicly accessible tool for predicting HCC recurrence risk, offering insights into its potential to inform treatment decisions for early-stage HCC. A publicly accessible tool—the TIMES score—for predicting the risk of recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma is revealed, providing mechanistic insights into the prognostic patterns for hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma remains a life-threatening malignancy with limited therapeutic options following the failure of second-line treatments1,2. Oncolytic viruses selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells, releasing neoantigens and stimulating systemic antitumour immunity3, offering a potential therapeutic option. Here we present the results of a multicentre phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VG161, an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses IL-12, IL-15, IL-15Rα and a PD-1–PD-L1-blocking fusion protein4, for safety and efficacy in patients with advanced liver cancer. VG161 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed, and it demonstrated promising efficacy by reshaping the tumour immune microenvironment and re-sensitizing tumours that were previously resistant to systemic treatments. Notably, we also found that patients who had previously been sensitive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy showed enhanced efficacy with VG161 treatment. Furthermore, we developed an efficacy-prediction model based on differentially expressed genes, which successfully identified patients who were likely to benefit from VG161 and predicted prolonged overall survival. These findings position VG161 as a promising third-line therapeutic option for refractory hepatocellular carcinoma. This provides a new avenue for treatment and advances the field of oncolytic virus-based immunotherapies.

    "abstract": "CD8+ T cell immune responses are critical for combating infectious diseases and tumours1–3. Antigen cross-presentation, primarily occurring at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of dendritic cells, is essential for protein-based vaccines to induce CD8+ T cell responses4. Current efforts have focused on antigen delivery at the tissue and cellular levels, whereas subcellular delivery has been limited to facilitating antigen escape from lysosomes into the cytosol. In the absence of a small-sized high-affinity ER-targeting molecule, the importance of the ‘last mile’ from the cytosol to the ER remains elusive. Here we developed stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist-based ER-targeting molecules (SABER), which effectively deliver antigens to the ER and cluster key machinery in cross-presentation to form microreactors by folding the ER membrane. Conjugation of SABER to various antigens substantially enhances the induction of CD8+ T cell immune responses to tumour neoantigens and conserved viral epitopes, far exceeding that achieved by mixtures of antigens with STING agonists or conventional adjuvants. SABER also retains a potent adjuvant effect, effectively enhancing the ability of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. This study provides a high-affinity ER-targeting delivery system and vaccine adjuvant, demonstrating that precise subcellular delivery targeting the last mile of cross-presentation can lead to a qualitative leap. STING agonist-based endoplasmic reticulum-targeting molecules can be conjugated directly onto antigens to deliver them to the cross-presentation pathway, improving CD8+ T cell responses against tumours and viruses.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that antibiotic exposure may lead to impaired vaccine responses1–4; however, the mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. Here we prospectively followed 191 healthy, vaginally born, term infants from birth to 15 months, using a systems vaccinology approach to assess the effects of antibiotic exposure on immune responses to vaccination. Exposure to direct neonatal but not intrapartum antibiotics was associated with significantly lower antibody titres against various polysaccharides in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylribitol phosphate and diphtheria toxoid antigens in the combined 6-in-1 Infanrix Hexa vaccine at 7 months of age. Blood from infants exposed to neonatal antibiotics had an inflammatory transcriptional profile before vaccination; in addition, faecal metagenomics showed reduced abundance of Bifidobacterium species in these infants at the time of vaccination, which was correlated with reduced vaccine antibody titres 6 months later. In preclinical models, responses to the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were strongly dependent on an intact microbiota but could be restored in germ-free mice by administering a consortium of Bifidobacterium species or a probiotic already widely used in neonatal units. Our data suggest that microbiota-targeted interventions could mitigate the detrimental effects of early-life antibiotics on vaccine immunogenicity. Neonatal antibiotic use is shown to reduce immune response to infant vaccines, accompanied by reduced abundance of Bifidobacteria in the gut microbiota, with experiments in mice indicating that probiotic therapy could be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between circuit connectivity and function is crucial for uncovering how the brain computes. In mouse primary visual cortex, excitatory neurons with similar response properties are more likely to be synaptically connected1–8; however, broader connectivity rules remain unknown. Here we leverage the millimetre-scale MICrONS dataset to analyse synaptic connectivity and functional properties of neurons across cortical layers and areas. Our results reveal that neurons with similar response properties are preferentially connected within and across layers and areas—including feedback connections—supporting the universality of ‘like-to-like’ connectivity across the visual hierarchy. Using a validated digital twin model, we separated neuronal tuning into feature (what neurons respond to) and spatial (receptive field location) components. We found that only the feature component predicts fine-scale synaptic connections beyond what could be explained by the proximity of axons and dendrites. We also discovered a higher-order rule whereby postsynaptic neuron cohorts downstream of presynaptic cells show greater functional similarity than predicted by a pairwise like-to-like rule. Recurrent neural networks trained on a simple classification task develop connectivity patterns that mirror both pairwise and higher-order rules, with magnitudes similar to those in MICrONS data. Ablation studies in these recurrent neural networks reveal that disrupting like-to-like connections impairs performance more than disrupting random connections. These findings suggest that these connectivity principles may have a functional role in sensory processing and learning, highlighting shared principles between biological and artificial systems. The MICrONS mouse visual cortex dataset shows that neurons with similar response properties preferentially connect, a pattern that emerges within and across brain areas and layers, and independently emerges in artificial neural networks where these ‘like-to-like’ connections prove important for task performance.",

    "abstract": "Iron catalyses the oxidation of lipids in biological membranes and promotes a form of cell death called ferroptosis1. Defining where this chemistry occurs in the cell can inform the design of drugs capable of inducing or inhibiting ferroptosis in various disease-relevant settings. Genetic approaches have revealed suppressors of ferroptosis2–4; by contrast, small molecules can provide spatiotemporal control of the chemistry at work5. Here we show that the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 exerts cytoprotective effects by inactivating iron in lysosomes. We also show that the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 initiates membrane lipid oxidation in lysosomes. We designed a small-molecule activator of lysosomal iron—fentomycin-1—to induce the oxidative degradation of phospholipids and ultimately ferroptosis. Fentomycin-1 is able to kill iron-rich CD44high primary sarcoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, which can promote metastasis and fuel drug tolerance. In such cells, iron regulates cell adaptation6,7 while conferring vulnerability to ferroptosis8,9. Sarcoma cells exposed to sublethal doses of fentomycin-1 acquire a ferroptosis-resistant cell state characterized by the downregulation of mesenchymal markers and the activation of a membrane-damage response. This phospholipid degrader can eradicate drug-tolerant persister cancer cells in vitro and reduces intranodal tumour growth in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. Together, these results show that control of iron reactivity confers therapeutic benefits, establish lysosomal iron as a druggable target and highlight the value of targeting cell states10. Some cancer cells exhibit high loads of reactive iron in lysosomes, and this feature is exploited by using fentomycin-1, a newly developed small molecule, to induce ferroptosis.",

Methods based on shared haplotypes1,2 and rare variants3,4 improve power but are not explicitly temporal and have not been possible to adopt in unbiased ancestry models. Here we develop Twigstats, an approach of time-stratified ancestry analysis that can improve statistical power by an order of magnitude by focusing on coalescences in recent times, while remaining unbiased by population-specific drift. We apply this framework to 1,556 available ancient whole genomes from Europe in the historical period. We are able to model individual-level ancestry using preceding genomes to provide high resolution. During the first half of the first millennium ce, we observe at least two different streams of Scandinavian-related ancestry expanding across western, central and eastern Europe. By contrast, during the second half of the first millennium ce, ancestry patterns suggest the regional disappearance or substantial admixture of these ancestries. In Scandinavia, we document a major ancestry influx by approximately 800 ce, when a large proportion of Viking Age individuals carried ancestry from groups related to central Europe not seen in individuals from the early Iron Age. Our findings suggest that time-stratified ancestry analysis can provide a higher-resolution lens for genetic history. Twigstats, a method for ancestry reconstruction, provides high-resolution genetic histories and movement patterns of people living in Europe during the first millennium ce.",

    "abstract": "Identifying phase-separated structures remains challenging, and effective intervention methods are currently lacking1. Here we screened for phase-separated proteins in breast tumour cells and identified forkhead (FKH) box protein M1 (FOXM1) as the most prominent candidate. Oncogenic FOXM1 underwent liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) with FKH consensus DNA element, and compartmentalized the transcription apparatus in the nucleus, thereby sustaining chromatin accessibility and super-enhancer landscapes crucial for tumour metastatic outgrowth. Screening an epigenetics compound library identified AMPK agonists as suppressors of FOXM1 condensation. AMPK phosphorylated FOXM1 in the intrinsically disordered region (IDR), perturbing condensates, reducing oncogenic transcription, accumulating double-stranded DNA to stimulate innate immune responses, and endowing discrete FOXM1 with the ability to activate immunogenicity-related gene expressions. By developing a genetic code-expansion orthogonal system, we demonstrated that a phosphoryl moiety at a specific IDR1 site causes electrostatic repulsion, thereby abolishing FOXM1 LLPS and aggregation. A peptide targeting IDR1 and carrying the AMPK-phosphorylated residue was designed to disrupt FOXM1 LLPS and was shown to inhibit tumour malignancy, rescue tumour immunogenicity and improve tumour immunotherapy. Together, these findings provide novel and in-depth insights on function and mechanism of FOXM1 and develop methodologies that hold promising implications in clinics. The transcription factor FOXM1 forms functional condensates, the formation of which can be targeted with a specific peptide to suppress breast cancer growth and metastasis.",

As clinical sequencing technologies continue to advance, the ability to identify patients with rare disease harbouring pathogenic genetic variants amenable to this therapeutic strategy will probably improve. Here we describe a scalable platform for generating patient-derived cellular models and demonstrate that these personalized models can be used for preclinical evaluation of patient-specific ASOs. We describe protocols for delivery of ASOs to patient-derived organoid models and confirm reversal of disease-associated phenotypes in cardiac organoids derived from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a structural deletion in the gene encoding dystrophin (DMD) that is amenable to treatment with existing ASO therapeutics. Furthermore, we designed novel patient-specific ASOs for two additional patients with DMD (siblings) with a deep intronic variant in the DMD gene that gives rise to a novel splice acceptor site, incorporation of a cryptic exon and premature transcript termination. We showed that treatment of patient-derived cardiac organoids with patient-specific ASOs results in restoration of DMD expression and reversal of disease-associated phenotypes. The approach outlined here provides the foundation for an expedited path towards the design and preclinical evaluation of personalized ASO therapeutics for a broad range of rare diseases. A scalable platform for generating patient-specific organoids for testing personalized oligonucleotide therapeutics is described.",

    "abstract": "The integrated frequency comb generator based on Kerr parametric oscillation1 has led to chip-scale, gigahertz-spaced combs with new applications spanning hyperscale telecommunications, low-noise microwave synthesis, light detection and ranging, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration2–6. Recent progress in lithium niobate (LiNbO3) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has resulted in chip-scale, electro-optic (EO) frequency combs7,8, offering precise comb-line positioning and simple operation without relying on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons. However, current integrated EO combs face limited spectral coverage due to the large microwave power required to drive the non-resonant capacitive electrodes and the strong intrinsic birefringence of LiNbO3. Here we overcome both challenges with an integrated triply resonant architecture, combining monolithic microwave integrated circuits with PICs based on the recently emerged thin-film lithium tantalate (LiTaO3)9. With resonantly enhanced EO interaction and reduced birefringence in LiTaO3, we achieve a fourfold comb span extension and a 16-fold power reduction compared to the conventional, non-resonant microwave design. Driven by a hybrid integrated laser diode, the comb spans over 450 nm (more than 60 THz) with  more than 2,000 lines, and the generator fits within a compact 1-cm2 footprint. We additionally observe that the strong EO coupling leads to an increased comb existence range approaching the full free spectral range of the optical microresonator. The ultra-broadband comb generator, combined with detuning-agnostic operation, could advance chip-scale spectrometry and ultra-low-noise millimetre wave synthesis10–13 and unlock octave-spanning EO combs. The methodology of co-designing microwave and photonics can be extended to a wide range of integrated EOs applications14–16. An integrated electro-optic frequency comb that combines microwave integrated circuits with a photonic circuit based on lithium tantalate leads to broadband operation with low power requirements.",

Although VTA dopaminergic cells strongly influence aggression in novice aggressors, they become ineffective in expert aggressors. Furthermore, eliminating dopamine synthesis in the VTA prevents the emergence of aggression in naive mice but leaves aggression intact in expert aggressors. VTA dopamine modulates aggression through the dorsal lateral septum (dLS), a region known for aggression control. Dopamine enables the flow of information from the hippocampus to the dLS by weakening local inhibition in novice aggressors. In expert aggressors, dLS local inhibition naturally weakens, and the ability of dopamine to modulate dLS cells diminishes. Overall, these results reveal a sophisticated role of dopamine in the rise of aggression in adult male mice. Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area have a role in modulating aggression in adult male mice, and this effect of dopamine depends strongly on fighting experience.",

    "abstract": "Population studies provide insights into the interplay between the gut microbiome and geographical, lifestyle, genetic and environmental factors. However, low- and middle-income countries, in which approximately 84% of the world’s population lives1, are not equitably represented in large-scale gut microbiome research2–4. Here we present the AWI-Gen 2 Microbiome Project, a cross-sectional gut microbiome study sampling 1,801 women from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. By engaging with communities that range from rural and horticultural to post-industrial and urban informal settlements, we capture a far greater breadth of the world’s population diversity. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we identify taxa with geographic and lifestyle associations, including Treponema and Cryptobacteroides species loss and Bifidobacterium species gain in urban populations. We uncover 1,005 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes, and we identify antibiotic susceptibility as a factor that might drive Treponema succinifaciens absence in urban populations. Finally, we find an HIV infection signature defined by several taxa not previously associated with HIV, including Dysosmobacter welbionis and Enterocloster sp. This study represents the largest population-representative survey of gut metagenomes of African individuals so far, and paired with extensive clinical biomarkers and demographic data, provides extensive opportunity for microbiome-related discovery. A cross-sectional study from four African countries shows the importance of investigating the gut microbiome in previously under-represented populations and provides a framework for equitable microbiome research.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of non-equilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter1, fundamental high-energy processes2, quantum metrology3,4 and quantum algorithms5. Here we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)-dimensional Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains6. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (‘Higgs’) mode7. These observations offer a viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and non-equilibrium quantum processes. A programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays is used to study the collective dynamics of a quantum phase transition and observe the phenomenon of quantum coarsening.",

    "abstract": "Topological wave structures, such as vortices1–6, polarization textures7–11 and skyrmions12–19, appear in various quantum and classical wave fields, including optics and acoustics. In particular, optical vortices have found numerous applications20,21, ranging from quantum information to astrophysics. Furthermore, both optical and acoustic structured waves are crucial in the manipulation of small particles22–25, from atoms to macroscopic biological objects. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in structured water surface waves, which can be notable analogues of quantum, optical and acoustic wave systems26–29. However, topological water-wave forms, especially their ability to manipulate particles, have not yet been demonstrated. Here we describe the controllable generation of topological structures, namely wave vortices, skyrmions and polarization Möbius strips, in gravity water waves. Most importantly, we demonstrate the efficient manipulation of subwavelength and wavelength-order floating particles with topologically structured water waves. This includes trapping the particles in the high-intensity field zones and controlling their orbital and spinning motion due to the orbital and spin angular momenta of the water waves. Our results reveal the water-wave counterpart of optical and acoustic manipulation, which paves the way for applications in hydrodynamics and microfluidics. Interfering water waves can be tailored to realize topological structures, namely wave vortices, skyrmions and polarization Möbius strips, that can be used to manipulate particles floating on the water surface.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators1,2. Unlocking the full potential of such systems towards this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution and extensive probes for final state characterization. Here we present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits that supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analogue evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. This hybrid platform features more versatile measurement capabilities compared with analogue-only simulators, which we leverage here to reveal a coarsening-induced breakdown of Kibble–Zurek scaling predictions3 in the XY model, as well as signatures of the classical Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition4. Moreover, the digital gates enable precise energy control, allowing us to study the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis5–7 in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. We also demonstrate digital preparation of pairwise-entangled dimer states, and image the transport of energy and vorticity during subsequent thermalization in analogue evolution. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analogue–digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics. A hybrid analogue–digital quantum simulator is used to demonstrate beyond-classical performance in benchmarking experiments and to study thermalization phenomena in an XY quantum magnet, including the breakdown of Kibble–Zurek scaling predictions and signatures of the Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal phenotypic traits such as morphology, connectivity and function are dictated, to a large extent, by a specific combination of differentially expressed genes. Clusters of neurons in transcriptomic space correspond to distinct cell types and in some cases—for example, Caenorhabditis elegans neurons1 and retinal ganglion cells2–4—have been shown to share morphology and function. The zebrafish optic tectum is composed of a spatial array of neurons that transforms visual inputs into motor outputs. Although the visuotopic map is continuous, subregions of the tectum are functionally specialized5,6. Here, to uncover the cell-type architecture of the tectum, we transcriptionally profiled its neurons, revealing more than 60 cell types that are organized in distinct anatomical layers. We measured the visual responses of thousands of tectal neurons by two-photon calcium imaging and matched them with their transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, we characterized the morphologies of transcriptionally identified neurons using specific transgenic lines. Notably, we found that neurons that are transcriptionally similar can diverge in shape, connectivity and visual responses. Incorporating the spatial coordinates of neurons within the tectal volume revealed functionally and morphologically defined anatomical subclusters within individual transcriptomic clusters. Our findings demonstrate that extrinsic, position-dependent factors expand the phenotypic repertoire of genetically similar neurons. Transcriptomic profiling of neurons from the zebrafish optic tectum identified more than 60 cell types; functional imaging revealed that response tuning, morphology and connectivity of specific cell types vary systematically with the neurons’ positions in the tissue.",

    "abstract": "Zinc is emerging as a key material for next-generation biodegradable implants1–5. However, its inherent softness limits its use in load-bearing orthopaedic implants. Although reducing the grain size of zinc can make it stronger, it also destabilizes its mechanical properties and thus makes it less durable at body temperature6. Here we show that extruded Zn alloys of dilute compositions can achieve ultrahigh strength and excellent durability when their micron-scale grain size is increased while maintaining a basal texture. In this inverse Hall–Petch effect, the dominant deformation mode changes from inter-granular grain boundary sliding and dynamic recrystallization at the original grain size to intra-granular pyramidal slip and unusual twinning at the increased grain size. The role of the anomalous twins, termed ‘accommodation twins’ in this work, is to accommodate the altered grain shape in the plane lying perpendicular to the external loading direction, in contrast to the well-known ‘mechanical twins’ whose role is to deliver plasticity along the external loading direction7,8. The strength level achieved in these dilute zinc alloys is nearly double those of biodegradable implants made of magnesium alloys—making them the strongest and most stable biodegradable alloys available, to our knowledge, for fabricating bone fixation implants. Extruded zinc alloys of dilute compositions can achieve ultrahigh strength and excellent durability when their micron-scale grain size is increased.",

Progress has been made in the de novo design of transmembrane proteins1–6, as well as in designing water-soluble proteins to bind small molecules7–12, but de novo design of transmembrane proteins that tightly and specifically bind to small molecules remains an outstanding challenge13. Here we present the accurate design of ligand-binding transmembrane proteins by integrating deep learning and energy-based methods. We designed pre-organized ligand-binding pockets in high-quality four-helix backbones for a fluorogenic ligand, and generated a transmembrane span using gradient-guided hallucination. The designer transmembrane proteins specifically activated fluorescence of the target fluorophore with mid-nanomolar affinity, exhibiting higher brightness and quantum yield compared to those of enhanced green fluorescent protein. These proteins were highly active in the membrane fraction of live bacterial and eukaryotic cells following expression. The crystal and cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the designer protein–ligand complexes were very close to the structures of the design models. We showed that the interactions between ligands and transmembrane proteins within the membrane can be accurately designed. Our work paves the way for the creation of new functional transmembrane proteins, with a wide range of applications including imaging, ligand sensing and membrane transport. A study describes the design of de novo ligand-binding transmembrane proteins, demonstrating their specific binding and activation of fluorogenic ligands.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas are incurable malignancies notable for having an immunosuppressive microenvironment with abundant myeloid cells, the immunomodulatory phenotypes of which remain poorly defined1. Here we systematically investigate these phenotypes by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility, spatial transcriptomics and glioma organoid explant systems. We discovered four immunomodulatory expression programs: microglial inflammatory and scavenger immunosuppressive programs, which are both unique to primary brain tumours, and systemic inflammatory and complement immunosuppressive programs, which are also expressed by non-brain tumours. The programs are not contingent on myeloid cell type, developmental origin or tumour mutational state, but instead are driven by microenvironmental cues, including tumour hypoxia, interleukin-1β, TGFβ and standard-of-care dexamethasone treatment. Their relative expression can predict immunotherapy response and overall survival. By associating the respective programs with mediating genomic elements, transcription factors and signalling pathways, we uncover strategies for manipulating myeloid-cell phenotypes. Our study provides a framework to understand immunomodulation by myeloid cells in glioma and a foundation for the development of more-effective immunotherapies. A study of myeloid cells in gliomas, a type of brain tumour, used a factor-based computational framework to reveal four immunomodulatory gene-expression programs that are expressed across myeloid cell types, driven by microenvironmental cues and predictive of therapeutic response.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a time-sensitive emergency that requires prompt identification and intervention: sudden, unwitnessed cardiac arrest is nearly unsurvivable1–3. A cardinal sign of cardiac arrest is sudden loss of pulse4. Automated biosensor detection of unwitnessed cardiac arrest, and dispatch of medical assistance, may improve survivability given the substantial prognostic role of time3,5, but only if the false-positive burden on public emergency medical systems is minimized5–7. Here we show that a multimodal, machine learning-based algorithm on a smartwatch can reach performance thresholds making it deployable at a societal scale. First, using photoplethysmography, we show that wearable photoplethysmography measurements of peripheral pulselessness (induced through an arterial occlusion model) manifest similarly to pulselessness caused by a common cardiac arrest arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation. On the basis of the similarity of the photoplethysmography signal (from ventricular fibrillation or arterial occlusion), we developed and validated a loss of pulse detection algorithm using data from peripheral pulselessness and free-living conditions. Following its development, we evaluated the end-to-end algorithm prospectively: there was 1 unintentional emergency call per 21.67 user-years across two prospective studies; the sensitivity was 67.23% (95% confidence interval of 64.32% to 70.05%) in a prospective arterial occlusion cardiac arrest simulation model. These results indicate an opportunity, deployable at scale, for wearable-based detection of sudden loss of pulse while minimizing societal costs of excess false detections7. A study reports the development and validation of a wrist-worn, consumer wearable-based system that identifies sudden loss of pulse events with a performance profile suitable for societal-scale use.",

    "abstract": "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), vital for northwards heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean, is projected to weaken owing to global warming1, with significant global climate impacts2. However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain with wide variation across climate models1,3,4 and some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse5. Here we show that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings across 34 climate models. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC in all cases, preventing its complete collapse. As Southern Ocean upwelling must be balanced by downwelling in the Atlantic or Pacific, the AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops. Remarkably, a PMOC does emerge in almost all models, but it is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century. Our findings reveal AMOC-stabilizing mechanisms with implications for past and future AMOC changes, and hence for ecosystems and ocean biogeochemistry. They suggest that better understanding and estimates of the Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations are urgently needed to accurately predict future AMOC change. Climate models suggest that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is unlikely to collapse this century, owing to stabilization from wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean.",

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in wearable technologies1,2, barriers remain in achieving distributed computation located persistently on the human body. Here a textile fibre computer that monolithically combines analogue sensing, digital memory, processing and communication in a mass of less than 5 g is presented. Enabled by a foldable interposer, the two-dimensional pad architectures of microdevices were mapped to three-dimensional cylindrical layouts conforming to fibre geometry. Through connection with helical copper microwires, eight microdevices were thermally drawn into a machine-washable elastic fibre capable of more than 60% stretch. This programmable fibre, which incorporates a 32-bit floating-point microcontroller, independently performs edge computing tasks even when braided, woven, knitted or seam-sewn into garments. The universality of the assembly process allows for the integration of additional functions with simple modifications, including a rechargeable fibre power source that operates the computer for nearly 6 h. Finally, we surmount the perennial limitation of rigid interconnects by implementing two wireless communication schemes involving woven optical links and seam-inserted radio-frequency communications. To demonstrate its utility, we show that garments equipped with four fibre computers, one per limb, operating individually trained neural networks achieve, on average, 67% accuracy in classifying physical activity. However, when networked, inference accuracy increases to 95% using simple weighted voting. A textile fibre computer combining sensing, memory, processing and communication in a 5-g mass has been developed, enabling distributed computation on the human body through garments.",

    "abstract": "For nearly 450 million years, mycorrhizal fungi have constructed networks to collect and trade nutrient resources with plant roots1,2. Owing to their dependence on host-derived carbon, these fungi face conflicting trade-offs in building networks that balance construction costs against geographical coverage and long-distance resource transport to and from roots3. How they navigate these design challenges is unclear4. Here, to monitor the construction of living trade networks, we built a custom-designed robot for high-throughput time-lapse imaging that could track over 500,000 fungal nodes simultaneously. We then measured around 100,000 cytoplasmic flow trajectories inside the networks. We found that mycorrhizal fungi build networks as self-regulating travelling waves—pulses of growing tips pull an expanding wave of nutrient-absorbing mycelium, the density of which is self-regulated by fusion. This design offers a solution to conflicting trade demands because relatively small carbon investments fuel fungal range expansions beyond nutrient-depletion zones, fostering exploration for plant partners and nutrients. Over time, networks maintained highly constant transport efficiencies back to roots, while simultaneously adding loops that shorten paths to potential new trade partners. Fungi further enhance transport flux by both widening hyphal tubes and driving faster flows along ‘trunk routes’ of the network5. Our findings provide evidence that symbiotic fungi control network-level structure and flows to meet trade demands, and illuminate the design principles of a symbiotic supply-chain network shaped by millions of years of natural selection. Symbiotic fungi control network-level structure and flows to meet trade demands.",

    "abstract": "Pan-genomics and genome-editing technologies are revolutionizing breeding of global crops1,2. A transformative opportunity lies in exchanging genotype-to-phenotype knowledge between major crops (that is, those cultivated globally) and indigenous crops (that is, those locally cultivated within a circumscribed area)3–5 to enhance our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desirable natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between related crops6,7. Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum8 and integrating functional genomics and pan-genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, thousands of gene duplications, particularly within key domestication gene families, exhibited dynamic trajectories in sequence, expression and function. By augmenting our pan-genome with African eggplant cultivars9 and applying quantitative genetics and genome editing, we dissected an intricate history of paralogue evolution affecting fruit size. The loss of a redundant paralogue of the classical fruit size regulator CLAVATA3 (CLV3)10,11 was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy, followed by a large cultivar-specific deletion, created a single fused CLV3 allele that modulates fruit organ number alongside an enzymatic gene controlling the same trait. Our findings demonstrate that paralogue diversifications over short timescales are underexplored contingencies in trait evolvability. Exposing and navigating these contingencies is crucial for translating genotype-to-phenotype relationships across species. Gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability.",

    "abstract": "Many technological breakthroughs in electronics and photonics were made possible by downscaling—the process of making elementary devices smaller in size1–5. The downsizing of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on III–V semiconductors led to micro-LEDs5–12, an ‘ultimate technology’ for displays. However, micro-LEDs are costly to produce and they exhibit severe efficiency losses when the pixel sizes are reduced to about 10 μm or less, hindering their potential in commercial applications. Here we show the downscaling of an emerging class of LEDs based on perovskite semiconductors to below the conventional size limits. Micro- and nano-perovskite LEDs (micro-PeLEDs/nano-PeLEDs) with characteristic pixel lengths from hundreds of micrometres down to about 90 nm are demonstrated, through a localized contact fabrication scheme that prevents non-radiative losses at the pixel boundaries. For our near-infrared (NIR) and green micro-PeLEDs, average external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) are maintained at around 20% across a wide range of pixel lengths (650 to 3.5 μm), exhibiting minimum performance reduction on downsizing. Our nano-PeLEDs with characteristic pixel lengths down to about 90 nm represent the smallest LEDs reported, enabling a record-high pixel density of 127,000 pixels per inch (PPI) among all classes of LED arrays. Our demonstration showcases the strength of micro- and nano-PeLEDs as a next-generation light-source technology with unprecedented compactness and scalability. A process based on perovskite semiconductors is described to downscale micro-LEDs and nano-LEDs to below the conventional size limits, demonstrating average external quantum efficiencies maintained at around 20% across a wide range of pixel lengths.",

    "abstract": "The global spread of multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungi presents a serious threat to human health, necessitating the discovery of antifungals with unique modes of action1. However, conventional activity-based screening for previously undescribed antibiotics has been hampered by the high-frequency rediscovery of known compounds and the lack of new antifungal targets2. Here we report the discovery of a polyene antifungal antibiotic, mandimycin, using a phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery platform. Mandimycin is biosynthesized by the mand gene cluster, has evolved in a distinct manner from known polyene macrolide antibiotics and is modified with three deoxy sugars. It has demonstrated potent and broad-spectrum fungicidal activity against a wide range of multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In contrast to known polyene macrolide antibiotics that target ergosterol, mandimycin has a unique mode of action that involves targeting various phospholipids in fungal cell membranes, resulting in the release of essential ions from fungal cells. This unique ability to bind multiple targets gives it robust fungicidal activity as well as the capability to evade resistance. The identification of mandimycin using the phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery strategy represents an important advancement in uncovering antimicrobial compounds with distinct modes of action, which could be developed to combat multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens. Mandimycin, a polyene macrolide, exhibits strong antifungal activity and possesses a mode of action that is distinct from other compounds of this class.",

    "abstract": "Hardware implementations of artificial neural networks (ANNs)—the most advanced of which are made of millions of electronic neurons interconnected by hundreds of millions of electronic synapses—have achieved higher energy efficiency than classical computers in some small-scale data-intensive computing tasks1. State-of-the-art neuromorphic computers, such as Intel’s Loihi2 or IBM’s NorthPole3, implement ANNs using bio-inspired neuron- and synapse-mimicking circuits made of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, at least 18 per neuron and six per synapse. Simplifying the structure and size of these two building blocks would enable the construction of more sophisticated, larger and more energy-efficient ANNs. Here we show that a single CMOS transistor can exhibit neural and synaptic behaviours if biased in a specific (unconventional) manner. By connecting one additional CMOS transistor in series, we build a versatile 2-transistor-cell that exhibits adjustable neuro-synaptic response (which we named neuro-synaptic random access memory cell, or NS-RAM cell). This electronic performance comes with a yield of 100% and an ultra-low device-to-device variability, owing to the maturity of the silicon CMOS platform used—no materials or devices alien to the CMOS process are required. These results represent a short-term solution for the implementation of efficient ANNs and an opportunity in terms of CMOS circuit design and optimization for artificial intelligence applications. A standard commercial CMOS FET can exhibit synaptic-like long-term potentiation and depression or neuron-like leaky-integrate-and-fire and adaptive frequency-bursting behaviour when biased in a specific but unconventional way.",

Although various technologies have been deployed to degrade PFASs with a focus on non-polymeric functionalized compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid)2–4, a general PFAS destruction method coupled with fluorine recovery for upcycling is highly desirable. Here we disclose a protocol that converts multiple classes of PFAS, including the fluoroplastics polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride, into high-value fluorochemicals. To achieve this, PFASs were reacted with potassium phosphate salts under solvent-free mechanochemical conditions, a mineralization process enabling fluorine recovery as KF and K2PO3F for fluorination chemistry. The phosphate salts can be recovered for reuse, implying no detrimental impact on the phosphorus cycle. Therefore, PFASs are not only destructible but can now contribute to a sustainable circular fluorine economy. This study highlights a protocol that converts various perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), including fluoroplastics, into valuable fluorochemicals through a solvent-free mechanochemical process, thereby enabling fluorine recovery and contributing to a sustainable circular fluorine economy.",

We find that a single dose of psilocybin increases the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviourally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin’s ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin’s effects on stress-related behaviour and structural plasticity. Collectively, these results identify that a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex have essential roles in psilocybin’s long-term drug action. A pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex have essential roles in psilocybin’s long-term drug action.",

    "abstract": "Developing a general algorithm that learns to solve tasks across a wide range of applications has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Although current reinforcement-learning algorithms can be readily applied to tasks similar to what they have been developed for, configuring them for new application domains requires substantial human expertise and experimentation1,2. Here we present the third generation of Dreamer, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single configuration. Dreamer learns a model of the environment and improves its behaviour by imagining future scenarios. Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing and transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula. This achievement has been posed as a substantial challenge in artificial intelligence that requires exploring farsighted strategies from pixels and sparse rewards in an open world3. Our work allows solving challenging control problems without extensive experimentation, making reinforcement learning broadly applicable. A general reinforcement-learning algorithm, called Dreamer, outperforms specialized expert algorithms across diverse tasks by learning a model of the environment and improving its behaviour by imagining future scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian nucleus is compartmentalized by diverse subnuclear structures. These subnuclear structures, marked by nuclear bodies and histone modifications, are often cell-type specific and affect gene regulation and 3D genome organization1–3. Understanding their relationships rests on identifying the molecular constituents of subnuclear structures and mapping their associations with specific genomic loci and transcriptional levels in individual cells, all in complex tissues. Here, we introduce two-layer DNA seqFISH+, which enables simultaneous mapping of 100,049 genomic loci, together with the nascent transcriptome for 17,856 genes and subnuclear structures in single cells. These data enable imaging-based chromatin profiling of diverse subnuclear markers and can capture their changes at genomic scales ranging from 100–200 kilobases to approximately 1 megabase, depending on the marker and DNA locus. By using multi-omics datasets in the adult mouse cerebellum, we showed that repressive chromatin regions are more variable by cell type than are active regions across the genome. We also discovered that RNA polymerase II-enriched foci were locally associated with long, cell-type-specific genes (bigger than 200 kilobases) in a manner distinct from that of nuclear speckles. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that cell-type-specific regions of heterochromatin marked by histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and histone H4 trimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me3) are enriched at specific genes and gene clusters, respectively, and shape radial chromosomal positioning and inter-chromosomal interactions in neurons and glial cells. Together, our results provide a single-cell high-resolution multi-omics view of subnuclear structures, associated genomic loci and their effects on gene regulation, directly within complex tissues. A genomic barcoding scheme called two-layer DNA seqFISH+ enables the simultaneous mapping of more than 100,000 loci and has been used to identify cell-type-specific subnuclear compartments in the mouse brain.",

    "abstract": "Clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) involves the gradual expansion of mutant pre-leukaemic haematopoietic cells, which increases with age and confers a risk for multiple diseases, including leukaemia and immune-related conditions1. Although the absolute risk of leukaemic transformation in individuals with CHIP is very low, the strongest predictor of progression is the accumulation of mutant haematopoietic cells2. Despite the known associations between CHIP and increased all-cause mortality, our understanding of environmental and regulatory factors that underlie this process during ageing remains rudimentary. Here we show that intestinal alterations, which can occur with age, lead to systemic dissemination of a microbial metabolite that promotes pre-leukaemic cell expansion. Specifically, ADP-d-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose (ADP-heptose), a biosynthetic bi-product specific to Gram-negative bacteria3–5, is uniquely found in the circulation of older individuals and favours the expansion of pre-leukaemic cells. ADP-heptose is also associated with increased inflammation and cardiovascular risk in CHIP. Mechanistically, ADP-heptose binds to its receptor, ALPK1, triggering transcriptional reprogramming and NF-κB activation that endows pre-leukaemic cells with a competitive advantage due to excessive clonal proliferation. Collectively, we identify that the accumulation of ADP-heptose represents a direct link between ageing and expansion of rare pre-leukaemic cells, suggesting that the ADP-heptose–ALPK1 axis is a promising therapeutic target to prevent progression of CHIP to overt leukaemia and immune-related conditions. ADP-heptose binds to ALPK1, triggering transcriptional reprogramming and NF-κB activation, endowing pre-leukaemic cells with a competitive advantage due to excessive clonal proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) originates from differentiated hepatocytes undergoing compensatory proliferation in livers damaged by viruses or metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)1. While increasing HCC risk2, MASH triggers p53-dependent hepatocyte senescence3, which we found to parallel hypernutrition-induced DNA breaks. How this tumour-suppressive response is bypassed to license oncogenic mutagenesis and enable HCC evolution was previously unclear. Here we identified the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) as a p53 target that is elevated in senescent-like MASH hepatocytes but suppressed through promoter hypermethylation and proteasomal degradation in most human HCCs. FBP1 first declines in metabolically stressed premalignant disease-associated hepatocytes and HCC progenitor cells4,5, paralleling the protumorigenic activation of AKT and NRF2. By accelerating FBP1 and p53 degradation, AKT and NRF2 enhance the proliferation and metabolic activity of previously senescent HCC progenitors. The senescence-reversing and proliferation-supportive NRF2–FBP1–AKT–p53 metabolic switch, operative in mice and humans, also enhances the accumulation of DNA-damage-induced somatic mutations needed for MASH-to-HCC progression. The p53 target FBP1 is elevated in senescent-like metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis hepatocytes but suppressed through promoter hypermethylation and proteasomal degradation in most human hepatocellular carcinomas.",

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) last for milliseconds and arrive at Earth from cosmological distances. Although their origins and emission mechanisms are unknown, their signals bear similarities with the much less luminous radio emission generated by pulsars within our Miky Way Galaxy1, with properties suggesting neutron star origins2,3. However, unlike pulsars, FRBs typically show minimal variability in their linear polarization position angle (PA) curves4. Even when marked PA evolution is present, their curves deviate significantly from the canonical shape predicted by the rotating vector model (RVM) of pulsars5. Here we report on FRB 20221022A, detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst project (CHIME/FRB) and localized to a nearby host galaxy (about 65 Mpc), MCG+14-02-011. This FRB shows a notable approximately 130° PA rotation over its about 2.5 ms burst duration, resembling the characteristic S-shaped evolution seen in many pulsars and some radio magnetars. The observed PA evolution supports magnetospheric origins6–8 over models involving distant shocks9–11, echoing similar conclusions drawn from tempo-polarimetric studies of some repeating FRBs12,13. The PA evolution is well described by the RVM and, although we cannot determine the inclination and magnetic obliquity because of the unknown period or duty cycle of the source, we exclude very short-period pulsars (for example, recycled millisecond pulsars) as the progenitor. FRB 20221022A, detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst project, shows a pronounced change in polarization during the burst, providing important clues into the nature of the source.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal circuits in the brain enable two distinct cognitive functions: the construction of spatial maps for navigation, and the storage of sequential episodic memories1–5. Although there have been advances in modelling spatial representations in the hippocampus6–10, we lack good models of its role in episodic memory. Here we present a neocortical–entorhinal–hippocampal network model that implements a high-capacity general associative memory, spatial memory and episodic memory. By factoring content storage from the dynamics of generating error-correcting stable states, the circuit (which we call vector hippocampal scaffolded heteroassociative memory (Vector-HaSH)) avoids the memory cliff of prior memory models11,12, and instead exhibits a graceful trade-off between number of stored items and recall detail. A pre-structured internal scaffold based on grid cell states is essential for constructing even non-spatial episodic memory: it enables high-capacity sequence memorization by abstracting the chaining problem into one of learning low-dimensional transitions. Vector-HaSH reproduces several hippocampal experiments on spatial mapping and context-based representations, and provides a circuit model of the ‘memory palaces’ used by memory athletes13. Thus, this work provides a unified understanding of the spatial mapping and associative and episodic memory roles of the hippocampus. A neocortical–entorhinal–hippocampal network model based on grid cell states recapitulates experimental results and reconciles the spatial, associative and episodic memory roles of the hippocampus.",

However, methods for measuring the organization of effector proteins at CREs across the genome are limited, hampering efforts to connect CRE structure to their function in cell fate and disease. Here we developed PRINT, a computational method that identifies footprints of DNA–protein interactions from bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility data across multiple scales of protein size. Using these multiscale footprints, we created the seq2PRINT framework, which uses deep learning to allow precise inference of transcription factor and nucleosome binding and interprets regulatory logic at CREs. Applying seq2PRINT to single-cell chromatin accessibility data from human bone marrow, we observe sequential establishment and widening of CREs centred on pioneer factors across haematopoiesis. We further discover age-associated alterations in the structure of CREs in murine haematopoietic stem cells, including widespread reduction of nucleosome footprints and gain of de novo identified Ets composite motifs. Collectively, we establish a method for obtaining rich insights into DNA-binding protein dynamics from chromatin accessibility data, and reveal the architecture of regulatory elements across differentiation and ageing.

The pentalayer rhombohedral graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) moiré superlattice was shown to host fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) at approximately 400 mK (ref. 1), triggering discussions around the underlying mechanism and role of moiré effects2–6. In particular, new electron crystal states with non-trivial topology have been proposed3,4,7–15. Here we report electrical transport measurements in rhombohedral pentalayer and tetralayer graphene/hBN moiré superlattices at electronic temperatures down to below 40 mK. We observed two more fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states and smaller Rxx values in pentalayer devices than those previously reported. In the new tetralayer device, we observed FQAHE at moiré filling factors v = 3/5 and 2/3. With a small current at the base temperature, we observed a new extended quantum anomalous Hall (EQAH) state and magnetic hysteresis, where Rxy = h/e2 and vanishing Rxx spans a wide range of v from 0.5 to 1.3. At increased temperature or current, EQAH states disappear and partially transition into the FQAH liquid16–18. Furthermore, we observed displacement field-induced quantum phase transitions from the EQAH states to the Fermi liquid, FQAH liquid and the likely composite Fermi liquid. Our observations established a new topological phase of electrons with quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field and enriched the emergent quantum phenomena in materials with topological flat bands.  New topological states have been observed in rhombohedral graphene/hBN moiré superlattices, including fractional and extended quantum anomalous Hall effects, at ultra-low temperatures, demonstrating the rich quantum phenomena emerging from correlated electrons in topological flat bands.",

    "abstract": "The tetraploid genome and clonal propagation of the cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)1,2 dictate a slow, non-accumulative breeding mode of the most important tuber crop. Transitioning potato breeding to a seed-propagated hybrid system based on diploid inbred lines has the potential to greatly accelerate its improvement3. Crucially, the development of inbred lines is impeded by manifold deleterious variants; explaining their nature and finding ways to eliminate them is the current focus of hybrid potato research4–10. However, most published diploid potato genomes are unphased, concealing crucial information on haplotype diversity and heterozygosity11–13. Here we develop a phased potato pangenome graph of 60 haplotypes from cultivated diploids and the ancestral wild species, and find evidence for the prevalence of transposable elements in generating structural variants. Compared with the linear reference, the graph pangenome represents a broader diversity (3,076 Mb versus 742 Mb). Notably, we observe enhanced heterozygosity in cultivated diploids compared with wild ones (14.0% versus 9.5%), indicating extensive hybridization during potato domestication. Using conservative criteria, we identify 19,625 putatively deleterious structural variants (dSVs) and reveal a biased accumulation of deleterious single nucleotide polymorphisms (dSNPs) around dSVs in coupling phase. Based on the graph pangenome, we computationally design ideal potato haplotypes with minimal dSNPs and dSVs. These advances provide critical insights into the genomic basis of clonal propagation and will guide breeders to develop a suite of promising inbred lines. A phased pangenome of potato constructed from 60 wild and cultivated haplotypes shows that substantial hybridization occurred during domestication and enables identification of many putative deleterious variants, providing a basis for the design of improved inbred lines.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of research performance is widely seen as a vital tool in upholding the highest standards of quality, with selection and competition believed to drive progress. Academic institutions need to take critical decisions on hiring and promotion, while facing external pressure by also being subject to research assessment1–4. Here we present an outlook on research assessment for career progression with specific focus on promotion to full professorship, based on 314 policies from 190 academic institutions and 218 policies from 58 government agencies, covering 32 countries in the Global North and 89 countries in the Global South. We investigated how frequently various promotion criteria are mentioned and carried out a statistical analysis to infer commonalities and differences across policies. Although quantitative methods of assessment remain popular, in agreement with what is found in more geographically restricted studies5–9, they are not omnipresent. We find differences between the Global North and the Global South as well as between institutional and national policies, but less so between disciplines. A preference for bibliometric indicators is more marked in upper-middle-income countries. Although we see some variation, many promotion policies are based on the assumption of specific career paths that become normative rather than embracing diversity. In turn, this restricts opportunities for researchers. These results challenge current practice and have strategic implications for researchers, research managers and national governments. Analysis of policies for promotion criteria to full professor from academic institutions and government agencies worldwide reveals considerable variation in assessment practices, particularly between the Global North and South.",

    "abstract": "Expanding the performance of field-effect devices is a key challenge of the ever-growing chip industry at the core of current technologies1. Non-volatile multiferroic transistors that control atomic movements rather than purely electronic distribution are highly desired2. Recently, a field-effect control over structural transitions was achieved in commensurate stacking configurations of honeycomb van der Waals (vdW) polytypes by sliding boundary strips between oppositely polarized domains3–6. This ferroelectric hysteretic response, however, relied on pre-existing dislocation strips between relatively large micron-scale domains, severely limiting practical implementations3,7,8. Here we report the robust electric switching of single-domain polytypes in nanometre-scale islands embedded in super-lubricant vdW arrays. We etch cavities into a thin layered spacer and then encapsulate it with functional flakes. The flakes above/under the lattice-mismatched spacer sag and touch at each cavity to form islands of commensurate and metastable polytype configurations. By imaging the polarization of the polytypes, we observe nucleation and annihilation of boundary strips and geometry-adaptable ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Using mechanical stress, we further control the position of boundary strips, modify marginal twist angles and nucleate patterns of polar domain. This super-lubricant arrays of polytype (SLAP) concept suggests ‘slidetronics’ device applications such as elastic-coupled neuromorphic memory cells and non-volatile multiferroic tunnelling transistors and programmable response by designing the size, shape and symmetry of the islands and of the arrays9. By etching cavities into a thin lubricant spacer and encapsulating it with functional flakes, electric and mechanical switching of single-crystal, van der Waals stacking configurations is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of pulmonary fibrosis is the aberrant activation of lung fibroblasts into pathological fibroblasts that produce excessive extracellular matrix1–3. Thus, the identification of key regulators that promote the generation of pathological fibroblasts can inform the development of effective countermeasures against disease progression. Here we use two mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis to show that LEPR+ fibroblasts that arise during alveologenesis include SCUBE2+ alveolar fibroblasts as a major constituent. These alveolar fibroblasts in turn contribute substantially to CTHRC1+POSTN+ pathological fibroblasts. Genetic ablation of POSTN+ pathological fibroblasts attenuates fibrosis. Comprehensive analyses of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data reveal that RUNX2 is a key regulator of the expression of fibrotic genes. Consistently, conditional deletion of Runx2 with LeprcreERT2 or Scube2creERT2 reduces the generation of pathological fibroblasts, extracellular matrix deposition and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, LEPR+ cells that include SCUBE2+ alveolar fibroblasts are a key source of pathological fibroblasts, and targeting Runx2 provides a potential treatment option for pulmonary fibrosis. The use of two mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis helped the identification of the transcription factor RUNX2 as a regulator of the transition of alveolar fibroblasts to pathological fibroblasts.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic lethality exploits the genetic vulnerabilities of cancer cells to enable a targeted, precision approach to treat cancer1. Over the past 15 years, synthetic lethal cancer target discovery approaches have led to clinical successes of PARP inhibitors2 and ushered several next-generation therapeutic targets such as WRN3, USP14, PKMYT15, POLQ6 and PRMT57 into the clinic. Here we identify, in human cancer, a novel synthetic lethal interaction between the PELO–HBS1L and SKI complexes of the mRNA quality control pathway. In distinct genetic contexts, including 9p21.3-deleted and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) tumours, we found that phenotypically destabilized SKI complex leads to dependence on the PELO–HBS1L ribosomal rescue complex. PELO–HBS1L and SKI complex synthetic lethality alters the normal cell cycle and drives the unfolded protein response through the activation of IRE1, as well as robust tumour growth inhibition. Our results indicate that PELO and HBS1L represent novel therapeutic targets whose dependence converges upon SKI complex destabilization, a common phenotypic biomarker in diverse genetic contexts representing a significant population of patients with cancer.  PELO–HBS1L and SKI complexes in the human mRNA quality control pathway exhibit a synthetic lethal interaction and may represent novel targets for the development of cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moiré systems research, and it may provide an insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-critical-temperature superconductors. Here we use d.c. transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics to directly measure the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG through its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory. Rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions1 and recent experimental indications2 of quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power law, which contraindicates an isotropic Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) model. Instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted in the Fermi liquid framework or by considering the quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both d.c. and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with the Ginzburg–Landau theory. Taken together, our findings show that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined d.c.–microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors. Research on superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene reveals unconventional behaviour, an anisotropic gap and a significant role of quantum geometry, using combined d.c. transport and microwave measurements, suggesting new insights into superconductivity mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial compounds are essential for controlling bacterial infections. Stress-induced bacterial tolerance and persisters can undermine antimicrobial activities under laboratory conditions, but their quantitative effects under physiological conditions remain unclear1,2. Here we determined constraints on clearance of Salmonella by antimicrobials in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats. The antibiotics enrofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited poor anti-Salmonella activity under both conditions, primarily owing to severe nutrient starvation, which restricted Salmonella replication3–5. Other infection-associated conditions, such as acidic pH, glucose, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, antimicrobial peptides, osmolarity, oxygen limitation, carbon dioxide and carbonate, as well as drug efflux, toxin–antitoxin modules and cell size had limited effects. A subset of resilient Salmonella appeared as a key obstacle for clearance by enrofloxacin, based on the biphasic decline of Salmonella colony-forming units. However, these data were misleading, because colony formation was confounded by extensive post-exposure killing. More accurate single-cell, real-time assays showed uniformly slow damage, indicating high resilience across the entire Salmonella population. The resulting extensive survival of bulk bacteria minimized the effect of hyper-resilient persisters. Thus, starvation-induced general resilience of Salmonella was the main cause of poor antibiotic clearance. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying antibiotic activity with real-time, single-cell assays under physiological conditions. Experiments in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats show that resilience of Salmonella against antimicrobial compounds is largely a result of starvation-induced general resilience rather than survival of a small subset of hyper-resilient cells.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning and behaviour. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus1, but their algorithmic form and learning mechanisms remain obscure. Here we used large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different linear tracks in virtual reality. Throughout learning, both animal behaviour and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple stages, gradually revealing improved task representation that mirrored improved behavioural efficiency. The learning process involved progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. This decorrelation process was driven by individual neurons acquiring task-state-specific responses (that is, ‘state cells’). Although various standard artificial neural networks did not naturally capture these dynamics, the clone-structured causal graph, a hidden Markov model variant, uniquely reproduced both the final orthogonalized states and the learning trajectory seen in animals. The observed cellular and population dynamics constrain the mechanisms underlying cognitive map formation in the hippocampus, pointing to hidden state inference as a fundamental computational principle, with implications for both biological and artificial intelligence. Insight into the algorithmic form and learning principles underlying cognitive maps in the hippocampus is provided.",

    "abstract": "Globalization increasingly allows countries to externalize the environmental costs of land use, including biodiversity loss1. So far, we have a very incomplete understanding of how countries cause biodiversity loss outside their own borders through their demand for agricultural and forestry products grown in other countries2. Here we quantify the global range losses to forest vertebrates from 2001 to 2015 caused by deforestation attributable to 24 developed countries by means of their consumption of products obtained through global supply chains. We show that these driver countries are responsible for much greater cumulative range loss to species outside their own borders than within them. These international impacts were concentrated geographically, allowing us to map global hotspots of outsourced losses of biodiversity. Countries had the greatest external impacts on species occurring in nearby regions. However, in a few cases, developed countries also inflicted disproportionate harm on vertebrates in distant countries. An analysis of global deforestation linked to consumption of products in the supply chains of large economies finds greater losses for vertebrate species’ ranges outside these countries than in them.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors play crucial roles in plant immunity by sensing pathogen effectors1. In Arabidopsis, certain sensor NLRs function as NADases to catalyse the production of second messengers2,3, which can be recognized by enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) with its partner senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101), to activate helper NLR N requirement gene 1 (NRG1)4. A cryoelectron microscopy structure shows that second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101 mainly contacts the leucine-rich repeat domain of NRG1A to mediate the formation of an induced EDS1–SAG101–NRG1A complex. Structural comparisons show that binding of a second messenger induces conformational changes in EDS1–SAG101, which are recognized by NRG1A, leading to its allosteric activation. We further show that an inhibitory NRG1 family member, NRG1C, efficiently outcompetes NRG1A for binding to second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101. These findings uncover mechanisms for NRG1A activation through its recognition of a modified host EDS1–SAG101 complex, and NRG1A inhibition by NRG1C through sequestration of the activated EDS1–SAG101, thus shedding light on the activation and constraint of a central plant immune response system. In Arabidopsis, mechanisms for NRG1A activation by recognition of a modified host EDS1–SAG101 complex, and NRG1A inhibition by NRG1C through sequestration of activated EDS1–SAG101, show activation and constraint of a central plant immune response system.",

    "abstract": "SPO11 initiates meiotic recombination through the induction of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1,2, but this catalytic activity has never been reconstituted in vitro3,4. Here, using Mus musculus SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyses break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5′ broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization for the reconstitution of two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyses DNA cleavage with an activity similar to that of SPO11 alone. However, this complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role after cleavage. We propose a model in which additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11–TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage. Our work establishes SPO11 dimerization as the fundamental mechanism that controls the induction of meiotic DSBs. A biochemical system recapitulates the hallmarks of meiotic double-strand break formation, with mouse SPO11 catalysing break formation in the absence of any partners and remaining covalently attached to 5′ broken strands.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination starts with SPO11 generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1. SPO11 is critical for meiosis in most species, but it generates dangerous DSBs with mutagenic2 and gametocidal3 potential. Cells must therefore utilize the beneficial functions of SPO11 while minimizing its risks4—how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we report reconstitution of DNA cleavage in vitro with purified recombinant mouse SPO11 bound to TOP6BL. SPO11–TOP6BL complexes are monomeric (1:1) in solution and bind tightly to DNA, but dimeric (2:2) assemblies cleave DNA to form covalent 5′ attachments that require SPO11 active-site residues, divalent metal ions and SPO11 dimerization. SPO11 can also reseal DNA that it has nicked. Structure modelling with AlphaFold 3 suggests that DNA is bent prior to cleavage5. In vitro cleavage displays a sequence bias that partially explains DSB site preferences in vivo. Cleavage is inefficient on complex DNA substrates, partly because SPO11 is readily trapped in DSB-incompetent (presumably monomeric) binding states that exchange slowly. However, cleavage is improved with substrates that favour dimer assembly or by artificially dimerizing SPO11. Our results inform a model in which intrinsically weak dimerization restrains SPO11 activity in vivo, making it exquisitely dependent on accessory proteins that focus and control DSB formation. Reconstitution of recombinantly expressed SPO11–TOP6BL complex recapitulates its DNA cleavage function and together with structural modelling and biochemical experiments, provides insights into the regulation and mechanism of SPO11 activity.",

Although the function of Spo11 has been known for 27 years, previous efforts to reconstitute DSB formation in vitro have been unsuccessful. Here we biochemically characterize the mouse SPO11–TOP6BL protein complex, and show that this complex cleaves DNA and covalently attaches to the 5′ terminus of DNA breaks in vitro. Using a point-mutation strategy, we reveal that Mg2+ is essential for the DNA-cleavage activity of this complex in vitro, as confirmed by knock-in mice carrying a point mutation in SPO11 that disrupts its binding to Mg2+, thereby abolishing DSB formation. However, the activity of the SPO11 complex is ATP-independent. We also present evidence that the mouse SPO11 complex is biochemically distinct from the ancestral topoisomerase VI. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework for understanding the first steps of meiotic recombination. The in vitro characterization of a key event in the early stages of meiosis—the induction of double-strand DNA breaks by the SPO11–TOP6BL complex—provides insight into the catalytic mechanism and evolution of SPO11.",

    "abstract": "In advanced applications such as aerospace and space exploration, materials must balance lightness, functionality and extreme thermal fluctuation resistance1,2. Shape-memory alloys show promise with strength, toughness and substantial strain recovery due to superelasticity, but maintaining low mass and effective operation at cryogenic temperatures is challenging3–6. We hereby introduce a new shape-memory alloy that adheres to these stringent criteria. Predominantly composed of Ti and Al with a chemical composition of Ti75.25Al20Cr4.75, this alloy is characterized by a low density (4.36 × 103 kg m−3) and a high specific strength (185 × 103 Pa m3 per kg) at room temperature, while showing excellent superelasticity. The superelasticity, owing to a reversible stress-induced phase transformation from an ordered body-centred cubic parent phase to an ordered orthorhombic martensite, allows for a recoverable strain exceeding 7%. This functionality persists across a broad range of temperatures, from deep cryogenic 4.2 K to above room temperature, arising from an unconventional temperature dependence of transformation stresses. Below a certain threshold during cooling, the critical transformation stress inversely correlates with temperature. We interpret this behaviour from the perspective of a temperature-dependent anomalous lattice instability of the parent phase. This alloy holds potential in everyday appliances requiring flexible strain accommodation, as well as components designed for extreme environmental conditions such as deep space and liquefied gases. A Ti–Al-based shape-memory alloy adhering to the stringent criteria of lightness, functionality and extreme thermal fluctuation resistance is introduced, showing excellent superelasticity with a recoverable strain exceeding 7% and an ultra-wide temperature window from 4.2 K to 400 K.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a public health threat associated with increased morbidity, mortality and financial burden in nursing homes and other healthcare settings1. Residents of nursing homes are at increased risk of pathogen colonization and infection owing to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and fungi. Nursing homes act as reservoirs, amplifiers and disseminators of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare networks and across geographical regions2. Here we investigate the genomic epidemiology of the emerging, multidrug-resistant human fungal pathogen Candida auris in a ventilator-capable nursing home. Coupling strain-resolved metagenomics with isolate sequencing, we report skin colonization and clonal spread of C. auris on the skin of nursing home residents and throughout a metropolitan region. We also report that most Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Entobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens and other high-priority pathogens (including Escherichia coli, Providencia stuartii, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii) are shared in a nursing home. Integrating microbiome and clinical microbiology data, we detect carbapenemase genes at multiple skin sites on residents identified as carriers of these genes. We analyse publicly available shotgun metagenomic samples (stool and skin) collected from residents with varying medical conditions living in seven other nursing homes and provide additional evidence of previously unappreciated bacterial strain sharing. Taken together, our data suggest that skin is a reservoir for colonization by C. auris and ESKAPE pathogens and their associated antimicrobial-resistance genes. Analyses of strain-resolved metagenomics with isolate sequencing data of skin samples from residents at nursing homes suggest that skin is a reservoir for Candida auris and other multidrug-resistant bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "The phytohormone auxin (Aux) is a principal endogenous developmental signal in plants. It mediates transcriptional reprogramming by a well-established canonical signalling mechanism. TIR1/AFB auxin receptors are F-box subunits of an ubiquitin ligase complex; after auxin perception, they associate with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and ubiquitinate them for degradation, thus enabling the activation of auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors1–3. Here we revise this paradigm by showing that without TIR1 adenylate cyclase (AC) activity4, auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs is not sufficient to mediate the transcriptional auxin response. Abolishing the TIR1 AC activity does not affect auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs but renders TIR1 non-functional in mediating transcriptional reprogramming and auxin-regulated development, including shoot, root, root hair growth and lateral root formation. Transgenic plants show that local cAMP production in the vicinity of the Aux/IAA–ARF complex by unrelated AC enzymes bypasses the need for auxin perception and is sufficient to induce ARF-mediated transcription. These discoveries revise the canonical model of auxin signalling and establish TIR1/AFB-produced cAMP as a second messenger essential for transcriptional reprograming. cAMP produced by the TIR1/AFB receptors of the main endogenous developmental plant hormone auxin acts as a true second messenger, revising the established paradigm of transcriptional auxin signalling.",

    "abstract": "Crop production faces persistent threats from insect-vector-borne viral diseases1,2. Recent advancements have revealed the intricate immune mechanisms that plants deploy against viral pathogens3–8. However, the molecular mechanisms through which plant hosts recognize viral infections and initiate antiviral defence at disease onset have not been elucidated. Here, through the natural infection of rice by inoculation with insect vectors carrying the natural forms of viruses, we show that viral coat proteins are perceived by the RING1–IBR–RING2-type ubiquitin ligase (RBRL), initiating the first step of the natural antiviral response in rice. RBRL subsequently targets an adaptor protein of the transcriptional repression complex of the jasmonate pathway, NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ 3 (NINJA3), for degradation through the ubiquitination system, inducing jasmonate signalling and activating downstream antiviral defence. We further show that this phenomenon is a universal molecular mechanism used by rice plants to perceive viral infections and initiate antiviral signalling cascades. This approach is important not only for obtaining a deeper understanding of virus–host interactions but also for further disease resistance breeding. Viral coat proteins are perceived by the RING1–IBR–RING2-type ubiquitin ligase, initiating the first step of the natural antiviral response in rice.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase heavy rainfall with concomitant increases in flooding1. Causes of increased heavy rainfall include the higher water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns2, which may translate into future heavy rainfall increases in most of Europe3. However, gathering evidence on the time evolution of past changes has been hampered by data limitations and measurement uncertainties, in particular for short rainfall durations, such as 1 h. Here we show an 8% increase in daily and 15% increase in hourly heavy rainfall over the last four decades by analysing a new dataset comprising 883 stations in Austria from 1900 to 2023. These increases are fully consistent between two independent networks and occurred after a retarding phase between 1960 and 1980. Hourly heavy rainfall changes are aligned with temperature increases with the sensitivity of a 7% increase per 1 °C of warming, in line with Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Daily heavy rainfall changes, however, are aligned with atmospheric circulation indices with little correlation to air temperature, which suggests a bigger role of atmospheric circulation modes than previously thought. The daily heavy rainfall changes are remarkably consistent with observed flood increases of about 8% in large catchments. The hourly heavy rainfall changes are similarly consistent with flood changes in small catchments, although the flood increase is stronger (25% over the last four decades). Climate adaptation measures in flood management may therefore be more pressing for rivers draining smaller catchment areas than for large rivers. Long-term increases in heavy daily and hourly precipitation in Austria from different climatic mechanisms emphasize the need for flood management adaptation, especially in smaller catchments affected by the increased hourly rainfall.",

    "abstract": "Germinal centres are specialized microenvironments where B cells undergo affinity maturation. B cells expressing antibodies whose affinity is improved by somatic hypermutation are selected for expansion by limiting numbers of T follicular helper cells. Cell division is accompanied by mutation of the immunoglobulin genes, at what is believed to be a fixed rate of around 1 × 10−3 per base pair per cell division1. As mutagenesis is random, the probability of acquiring deleterious mutations outweighs the probability of acquiring affinity-enhancing mutations. This effect might be heightened, and even become counterproductive, in B cells that express high-affinity antibodies and undergo the greatest number of cell divisions2. Here we experimentally examine a theoretical model that explains how affinity maturation could be optimized by varying the rate of somatic hypermutation such that cells that express higher-affinity antibodies divide more but mutate less per division. Data obtained from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or a model antigen align with the theoretical model and show that cells producing high-affinity antibodies shorten the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle and reduce their mutation rates. We propose that these mechanisms safeguard high-affinity B cell lineages and enhance the outcomes of antibody affinity maturation. Germinal centre B cells modify their mutation rate to preserve high-affinity receptors, thereby safeguarding high-affinity B cell lineages and enhancing the outcomes of antibody affinity maturation.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly driven by systems orchestrating multiple large language models (LLMs) and other specialized tools, such as search engines and simulators. So far, these systems are primarily handcrafted by domain experts and tweaked through heuristics rather than being automatically optimized, presenting a substantial challenge to accelerating progress. The development of artificial neural networks faced a similar challenge until backpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making optimization turnkey. Analogously, here we introduce TextGrad, a versatile framework that performs optimization by backpropagating LLM-generated feedback to improve AI systems. By leveraging natural language feedback to critique and suggest improvements to any part of a system—from prompts to outputs such as molecules or treatment plans—TextGrad enables the automatic optimization of generative AI systems across diverse tasks. We demonstrate TextGrad’s generality and effectiveness through studies in solving PhD-level science problems, optimizing plans for radiotherapy treatments, designing molecules with specific properties, coding, and optimizing agentic systems. TextGrad empowers scientists and engineers to easily develop impactful generative AI systems. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems can be optimized using TextGrad, a framework that performs optimization by backpropagating large-language-model-generated feedback; TextGrad enables optimization across diverse tasks, including radiotherapy treatment plans and molecule generation.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus membrane protein (M) is the main organizer of coronavirus assembly1–3. Here, we report on an M-targeting molecule, CIM-834, that blocks the assembly of SARS-CoV-2. CIM-834 was obtained through high-throughput phenotypic antiviral screening followed by medicinal-chemistry efforts and target elucidation. CIM-834 inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (including a broad panel of variants) and SARS-CoV. In SCID mice and Syrian hamsters intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, oral treatment reduced lung viral titres to nearly undetectable levels, even (as shown in mice) when treatment was delayed until 24 h before the end point. Treatment of infected hamsters prevented transmission to untreated sentinels. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that virion assembly is completely absent in cells treated with CIM-834. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals that CIM-834 binds and stabilizes the M protein in its short form, thereby preventing the conformational switch to the long form, which is required for successful particle assembly. In conclusion, we have discovered a new druggable target in the replication cycle of coronaviruses and a small molecule that potently inhibits it. High-throughput screening and hit optimization have led to the development of a small molecule, CIM-834, that targets the SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein and blocks assembly of the virus.",

    "abstract": "Recently the quest for post-silicon semiconductors has escalated owing to the inherent limitations of conventional bulk semiconductors, which are plagued by issues such as drain-induced barrier lowering, interfacial-scattering-induced mobility degradation and a constrained current on/off ratio determined by semiconductor bandwidth. These challenges have prompted the search for more advanced materials, with atomic-layer-thick two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors emerging as a potential solution. Following over a decade of research advances, recent developments1–3 in wafer-scale growth and device fabrication have led to breakthroughs in 2D semiconductor electronics. However, the level of integration remains constrained to a few hundred transistors. We describe a reduced instruction set computing architecture (RISC-V) microprocessor capable of executing standard 32-bit instructions on 5,900 MoS2 transistors and a complete standard cell library based on 2D semiconductor technology. The library contains 25 types of logic units. In alignment with advances in silicon integrated circuits, we also co-optimized the process flow and design of the 2D logic circuits. Our combined manufacturing and design methodology has overcome the significant challenges associated with wafer-scale integration of 2D circuits and enabled a pioneering prototype of an MoS2 microprocessor that exemplifies the potential of 2D integrated-circuit technology beyond silicon. A RISC-V microprocessor capable of executing standard 32-bit instructions has been designed with 5,900 MoS2 transistors and a complete standard cell library based on 2D semiconductor technology.",

The resulting conformational motion can create challenges in obtaining single crystals and thus determining their molecular structures by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD)1–11. Here we demonstrate that by using pillar[5]arene-incorporated metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and taking advantage of pillar[5]arene−alkyl chain host−guest recognition12–15, it is possible to reduce this motion and bring order to alkyl-chain-containing molecules as the result of docking within accessible pillar[5]arene units present in an overall MOF. This has allowed the single-crystal structures of 48 alkyl-chain-containing molecules, including 6 natural products, 2 approved drugs and 18 custom-made compounds collected from 16 research groups, to be determined using standard SCXRD instrumentation. The structures of alkyl-chain-containing molecules derived from crude reaction products can also be determined directly by SCXRD analyses without further purification. The simplicity, high efficiency and apparent generality of the present pillar[5]arene-incorporated MOF-based supramolecular docking approach suggest that it could emerge as a new tool for the analyses of natural products and drugs that might not be amenable to traditional SCXRD-based structure determination. A metal–organic framework (MOF)–pillar[5]arene hybrid can bind small molecules with long alkyl chains, such that single-crystal structures of the host–guest complexes can be obtained and therefore small molecular structures determined.",

Second, we found that SMARCAL1 and FANCM directly unwind TA-rich DNA cruciforms, preventing catastrophic chromosome breakage by the ERCC1–ERCC4 complex. Our data yield fundamental insights into genome maintenance, provide a springboard for mechanistic investigations into new connections between DDR factors and pinpoint synthetic vulnerabilities that could be exploited in cancer therapy. Combinatorial CRISPRi screening was used to map genetic interactions in DNA damage response pathways, revealing known and new connections, including the roles of WDR48 and USP1 in preventing under-replication and SMARCAL1 and FANCM in remodelling persistent cruciform DNA structures.",

    "abstract": "Metamaterials with multimodal deformation mechanisms resemble machines1,2, especially when endowed with autonomous functionality. A representative architected assembly, with tunable chirality, converts linear motion into rotation3. These chiral metamaterials with a machine-like dual modality have potential use in areas such as wave manipulation4, optical activity related to circular polarization5 and chiral active fluids6. However, the dual motions are essentially coupled and cannot be independently controlled. Moreover, they are restricted to small deformation, that is, strain ≤2%, which limits their applications. Here we establish modular chiral metamaterials, consisting of auxetic planar tessellations and origami-inspired columnar arrays, with decoupled actuation. Under single-degree-of-freedom actuation, the assembly twists between 0° and 90°, contracts in-plane up to 25% and shrinks out-of-plane more than 50%. Using experiments and simulations, we show that the deformation of the assembly involves in-plane twist and contraction dominated by the rotating-square tessellations and out-of-plane shrinkage dominated by the tubular Kresling origami arrays. Moreover, we demonstrate two distinct actuation conditions: twist with free translation and linear displacement with free rotation. Our metamaterial is built on a highly modular assembly, which enables reprogrammable instability, local chirality control, tunable loading capacity and scalability. Our concept provides routes towards multimodal, multistable and reprogrammable machines, with applications in robotic transformers, thermoregulation, mechanical memories in hysteresis loops, non-commutative state transition and plug-and-play functional assemblies for energy absorption and information encryption. A versatile origami-inspired modular chiral mechanical metamaterial structure facilitates dual-mode actuation, converting compression into rotational motion and torsion into extension or compression.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimmune interactions—signals transmitted between immune and brain cells—regulate many aspects of tissue physiology1, including responses to psychological stress2–5, which can predispose individuals to develop neuropsychiatric diseases6–9. Still, the interactions between haematopoietic and brain-resident cells that influence complex behaviours are poorly understood. Here, we use a combination of genomic and behavioural screens to show that astrocytes in the amygdala limit stress-induced fear behaviour through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Mechanistically, EGFR expression in amygdala astrocytes inhibits a stress-induced, pro-inflammatory signal-transduction cascade that facilitates neuron–glial crosstalk and stress-induced fear behaviour through the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F2 in amygdala neurons. In turn, decreased EGFR signalling and fear behaviour are associated with the recruitment of meningeal monocytes during chronic stress. This set of neuroimmune interactions is therapeutically targetable through the administration of psychedelic compounds, which reversed the accumulation of monocytes in the brain meninges along with fear behaviour. Together with validation in clinical samples, these data suggest that psychedelics can be used to target neuroimmune interactions relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and potentially other inflammatory diseases. Inflammatory monocytes in the brain meninges promote stress-induced fear behaviour, and the pathways involved can be modulated using psychedelic compounds.",

    "abstract": "Marine plastic pollution is a global issue, with microplastics (1 µm–5 mm) dominating the measured plastic count1,2. Although microplastics can be found throughout the oceanic water column3,4, most studies collect microplastics from surface waters (less than about 50-cm depth) using net tows5. Consequently, our understanding of the microplastics distribution across ocean depths is more limited. Here we synthesize depth-profile data from 1,885 stations collected between 2014 and 2024 to provide insights into the distribution and potential transport mechanisms of subsurface (below about 50-cm depth, which is not usually sampled by traditional practices3,6) microplastics throughout the oceanic water column. We find that the abundances of microplastics range from 10−4 to 104 particles per cubic metre. Microplastic size affects their distribution; the abundance of small microplastics (1 µm to 100 µm) decreases gradually with depth, indicating a more even distribution and longer lifespan in the water column compared with larger microplastics (100 µm to 5,000 µm) that tend to concentrate at the stratified layers. Mid-gyre accumulation zones extend into the subsurface ocean but are concentrated in the top 100 m and predominantly consist of larger microplastics. Our analysis suggests that microplastics constitute a measurable fraction of the total particulate organic carbon, increasing from 0.1% at 30 m to 5% at 2,000 m. Although our study establishes a global benchmark, our findings underscore that the lack of standardization creates substantial uncertainties, making it challenging to advance our comprehension of the distribution of microplastics and its impact on the oceanic environment. Global data collected between 2014 and 2024 provide insights into the distribution and potential transport mechanisms of subsurface microplastics throughout the oceanic water column.",

    "abstract": "Different theories explain how subjective experience arises from brain activity1,2. These theories have independently accrued evidence, but have not been directly compared3. Here we present an open science adversarial collaboration directly juxtaposing integrated information theory (IIT)4,5 and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT)6–10 via a theory-neutral consortium11–13. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes and interpretation thereof12. Human participants (n = 256) viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography. We found information about conscious content in visual, ventrotemporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results align with some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging key tenets of both theories. For IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within the posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in the prefrontal cortex. These challenges extend to other theories of consciousness that share some of the predictions tested here14–17. Beyond challenging the theories, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through principled, theory-driven, collaborative research and highlight the need for a quantitative framework for systematic theory testing and building. Multimodal results (iEEG, fMRI and MEG) of predictions from integrated information theory and global neuronal workspace theory align with some predictions of both theories on visual consciousness, but also critically challenge key tenets of both theories.",

    "abstract": "Drought is one of the most common and complex natural hazards affecting the environment, economies and populations globally1–4. However, there are significant uncertainties in global drought trends4–6, and a limited understanding of the extent to which a key driver, atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), impacts the recent evolution of the magnitude, frequency, duration and areal extent of droughts. Here, by developing an ensemble of high-resolution global drought datasets for 1901–2022, we find an increasing trend in drought severity worldwide. Our findings suggest that AED has increased drought severity by an average of 40% globally. Not only are typically dry regions becoming drier but also wet areas are experiencing drying trends. During the past 5 years (2018–2022), the areas in drought have expanded by 74% on average compared with 1981–2017, with AED contributing to 58% of this increase. The year 2022 was record-breaking, with 30% of the global land area affected by moderate and extreme droughts, 42% of which was attributed to increased AED. Our findings indicate that AED has an increasingly important role in driving severe droughts and that this tendency will likely continue under future warming scenarios. Increased atmospheric evaporative demand in recent years has increased drought severity by an average of 40% globally across both dry and wet regions, and the trend is likely to continue under future warming scenarios.",

BCIs have been used to translate the neural correlates of attempted speech into text1–3. However, text communication fails to capture the nuances of human speech, such as prosody and immediately hearing one’s own voice. Here we demonstrate a brain-to-voice neuroprosthesis that instantaneously synthesizes voice with closed-loop audio feedback by decoding neural activity from 256 microelectrodes implanted into the ventral precentral gyrus of a man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and severe dysarthria. We overcame the challenge of lacking ground-truth speech for training the neural decoder and were able to accurately synthesize his voice. Along with phonemic content, we were also able to decode paralinguistic features from intracortical activity, enabling the participant to modulate his BCI-synthesized voice in real time to change intonation and sing short melodies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of enabling people with paralysis to speak intelligibly and expressively through a BCI. A brain-to-voice neuroprosthesis enables a man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to synthesize his voice in real time by decoding neural activity, demonstrating the potential of brain–computer interfaces to enable people with paralysis to speak intelligibly and expressively.",

Lattice models6 of non-Abelian gauge fields allow us to understand their physical implications in extended systems. The theoretical importance of non-Abelian lattice gauge fields motivates their experimental synthesis and explorations7–9. Photons are fundamental particles for which artificial gauge fields can be synthesized10–30, yet the demonstration of non-Abelian lattice gauge fields for photons has not been achieved. Here we demonstrate SU(2) lattice gauge fields for photons in the synthetic frequency dimensions31,32, a playground to study lattice physics in a scalable and programmable way. In our lattice model, we theoretically observe that homogeneous non-Abelian lattice gauge potentials induce Dirac cones at time-reversal-invariant momenta in the Brillouin zone. We experimentally confirm the presence of non-Abelian lattice gauge fields by two signatures: linear band crossings at the Dirac cones, and the associated direction reversal of eigenstate trajectories. We further demonstrate a non-Abelian scalar lattice gauge potential that lifts the degeneracies of the Dirac cones. Our results highlight the implications of non-Abelian lattice gauge fields in topological physics, and provide a starting point for demonstrations of emerging non-Abelian physics in the photonic synthetic dimensions. Our results may also benefit photonic technologies by providing controls of photon spins and pseudo-spins in topologically non-trivial ways33.

    "abstract": "Accurate goal-directed behaviour requires the sense of touch to be integrated with information about body position and ongoing motion1,2. Behaviours such as chewing, swallowing and speech critically depend on precise tactile events on a rapidly moving tongue3, but neural circuits for dynamic touch-guided tongue control are unknown. Here, using high-speed videography, we examined three-dimensional lingual kinematics as mice drank from a water spout that unexpectedly changed position during licking, requiring re-aiming in response to subtle contact events on the left, centre or right surface of the tongue. Mice integrated information about both precise touch events and tongue position to re-aim ensuing licks. Touch-guided re-aiming was unaffected by photoinactivation of tongue sensory, premotor and motor cortices, but was impaired by photoinactivation of the lateral superior colliculus (latSC). Electrophysiological recordings identified latSC neurons with mechanosensory receptive fields for precise touch events that were anchored in tongue-centred, head-centred or conjunctive reference frames. Notably, latSC neurons also encoded tongue position before contact, information that is important for tongue-to-head-based coordinate transformations underlying accurate touch-guided aiming. Viral tracing revealed tongue sensory inputs to the latSC from the lingual trigeminal nucleus, and optical microstimulation in the latSC revealed a topographic map for aiming licks. These findings demonstrate that touch-guided tongue control relies on a collicular mechanosensorimotor map, analogous to collicular visuomotor maps associated with visually guided orienting across many species. Touch-guided tongue control in mice relies on a collicular mechanosensorimotor map, analogous to collicular visuomotor maps associated with visually guided orienting across many species.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease whose prognosis and treatment as defined by the expression of three receptors—oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; encoded by ERBB2)—is insufficient to capture the full spectrum of clinical outcomes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Previously, we demonstrated that transcriptional and genomic profiles define eleven integrative subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes, including four ER+ subtypes with increased risk of relapse decades after diagnosis1,2. Here, to determine whether these subtypes reflect distinct evolutionary histories, interactions with the immune system and pathway dependencies, we established a meta-cohort of 1,828 breast tumours spanning pre-invasive, primary invasive and metastatic disease with whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing. We demonstrate that breast tumours fall along a continuum constrained by three genomic archetypes. The ER+ high-risk integrative subgroup is characterized by complex focal amplifications, similar to HER2+ tumours, including cyclic extrachromosomal DNA amplifications induced by ER through R-loop formation and APOBEC3B-editing, which arise in pre-invasive lesions. By contrast, triple-negative tumours exhibit genome-wide instability and tandem duplications and are enriched for homologous repair deficiency-like signatures, whereas ER+ typical-risk tumours are largely genomically stable. These genomic archetypes, which replicate in an independent cohort of 2,659 primary tumours, are established early during tumorigenesis, sculpt the tumour microenvironment and are conserved in metastatic disease. These complex structural alterations contribute to replication stress and immune evasion, and persist throughout tumour evolution, unveiling potential vulnerabilities. A study identifies three dominant genomic archetypes of breast cancer induced by discrete mutational processes, describing a continuum of genomic profiles and detailing the mechanisms underlying the progression of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing-based genetic tests have uncovered a vast array of BRCA2 sequence variants1. Owing to limited clinical, familial and epidemiological data, thousands of variants are considered to be variants of uncertain significance2–4 (VUS). Here we have utilized CRISPR–Cas9-based saturation genome editing in a humanized mouse embryonic stem cell line to determine the functional effect of VUS. We have categorized nearly all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the region that encodes the carboxylate-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. We have generated function scores for 6,551 SNVs, covering 96.4% of possible SNVs in exons 15–26 spanning BRCA2 residues 2479–3216. These variants include 1,282 SNVs that are categorized as missense VUS in the clinical variant database ClinVar, with 77.2% of these classified as benign and 20.4% classified as pathogenic using our functional score. Our assay provides evidence that 3,384 of the SNVs in the region are benign and 776 are pathogenic. Our classification aligns closely with pathogenicity data from ClinVar, orthogonal functional assays and computational meta predictors. We have integrated our embryonic stem cell-based BRCA2-saturation genome editing dataset with other available evidence and utilized the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines for clinical classification of all possible SNVs. This classification is available as a sequence–function map and serves as a valuable resource for interpreting unidentified variants in the population and for physicians and genetic counsellors to assess BRCA2 VUS in patients. CRISPR–Cas9-based saturation genome editing in a humanized mouse embryonic stem cell line was used for comprehensive functional characterization of single nucleotide variants in a region of BRCA2, and shows good agreement with existing variant classifications and high predictive power.",

    "abstract": "Germline BRCA2 loss-of function variants, which can be identified through clinical genetic testing, predispose to several cancers1–5. However, variants of uncertain significance limit the clinical utility of test results. Thus, there is a need for functional characterization and clinical classification of all BRCA2 variants to facilitate the clinical management of individuals with these variants. Here we analysed all possible single-nucleotide variants from exons 15 to 26 that encode the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain hotspot for pathogenic missense variants. To enable this, we used saturation genome editing CRISPR–Cas9-based knock-in endogenous targeting of human haploid HAP1 cells6. The assay was calibrated relative to nonsense and silent variants and was validated using pathogenic and benign standards from ClinVar and results from a homology-directed repair functional assay7. Variants (6,959 out of 6,960 evaluated) were assigned to seven categories of pathogenicity based on a VarCall Bayesian model8. Single-nucleotide variants that encode loss-of-function missense variants were associated with increased risks of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The functional assay results were integrated into models from ClinGen, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Association for Molecular Pathology9 for clinical classification of BRCA2 variants. Using this approach, 91% were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic or as benign or likely benign. These classified variants can be used to improve clinical management of individuals with a BRCA2 variant. Results from a comprehensive evaluation of the function of BRCA2 variants, particularly variants of uncertain significance, provide a useful resource to improve the clinical management of individuals who carry such genetic variants.",

    "abstract": "DNA is subject to continual damage, leaving each cell with thousands of individual DNA lesions at any given moment1–3. The efficiency of DNA repair means that most known classes of lesion have a half-life of minutes to hours3,4, but the extent to which DNA damage can persist for longer durations remains unknown. Here, using high-resolution phylogenetic trees from 89 donors, we identified mutations arising from 818 DNA lesions that persisted across multiple cell cycles in normal human stem cells from blood, liver and bronchial epithelium5–12. Persistent DNA lesions occurred at increased rates, with distinctive mutational signatures, in donors exposed to tobacco or chemotherapy, suggesting that they can arise from exogenous mutagens. In haematopoietic stem cells, persistent DNA lesions, probably from endogenous sources, generated the characteristic mutational signature SBS1913; occurred steadily throughout life, including in utero; and endured for 2.2 years on average, with 15–25% of lesions lasting at least 3 years. We estimate that on average, a haematopoietic stem cell has approximately eight such lesions at any moment in time, half of which will generate a mutation with each cell cycle. Overall, 16% of mutations in blood cells are attributable to SBS19, and similar proportions of driver mutations in blood cancers exhibit this signature. These data indicate the existence of a family of DNA lesions that arise from endogenous and exogenous mutagens, are present in low numbers per genome, persist for months to years, and can generate a substantial fraction of the mutation burden of somatic cells. Persistent DNA lesions can occur throughout the human lifespan and can remain in the genome of affected cells for several years and generate a substantial proportion of the mutational burden.",

    "abstract": "In a dilute two-dimensional electron gas, Coulomb interactions can stabilize the formation of a Wigner crystal1–3. Although Wigner crystals are topologically trivial, it has been predicted that electrons in a partially filled band can break continuous translational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry spontaneously, resulting in a type of topological electron crystal known as an anomalous Hall crystal4–11. Here we report signatures of a generalized version of the anomalous Hall crystal in twisted bilayer–trilayer graphene, whose formation is driven by the moiré potential. The crystal forms at a band filling of one electron per four moiré unit cells (ν = 1/4) and quadruples the unit-cell area, coinciding with an integer quantum anomalous Hall effect. The Chern number of the state is exceptionally tunable, and it can be switched reversibly between +1 and −1 by electric and magnetic fields. Several other topological electronic crystals arise in a modest magnetic field, originating from ν = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3 and 3/2. The quantum geometry of the interaction-modified bands is likely to be very different from that of the original parent band, which enables possible future discoveries of correlation-driven topological phenomena. We report signatures of a generalized version of the anomalous Hall crystal in twisted bilayer–trilayer graphene, whose formation is driven by the moiré potential.",

    "abstract": "Extreme droughts generally decrease productivity in grassland ecosystems1–3 with negative consequences for nature’s contribution to people4–7. The extent to which this negative effect varies among grassland types and over time in response to multi-year extreme drought remains unclear. Here, using a coordinated distributed experiment that simulated four years of growing-season drought (around 66% rainfall reduction), we compared drought sensitivity within and among six representative grasslands spanning broad precipitation gradients in each of Eurasia and North America—two of the Northern Hemisphere’s largest grass-dominated regions. Aboveground plant production declined substantially with drought in the Eurasian grasslands and the effects accumulated over time, while the declines were less severe and more muted over time in the North American grasslands. Drought effects on species richness shifted from positive to negative in Eurasia, but from negative to positive in North America over time. The differing responses of plant production in these grasslands were accompanied by less common (subordinate) plant species declining in Eurasian grasslands but increasing in North American grasslands. Our findings demonstrate the high production sensitivity of Eurasian compared with North American grasslands to extreme drought (43.6% versus 25.2% reduction), and the key role of subordinate species in determining impacts of extreme drought on grassland productivity. Eurasian grasslands have high production sensitivity to extreme drought compared with North American grasslands.",

    "abstract": "During normal cellular homeostasis, unfolded and mislocalized proteins are recognized and removed, preventing the build-up of toxic byproducts1. When protein homeostasis is perturbed during ageing, neurodegeneration or cellular stress, proteins can accumulate several forms of chemical damage through reactive metabolites2,3. Such modifications have been proposed to trigger the selective removal of chemically marked proteins3–6; however, identifying modifications that are sufficient to induce protein degradation has remained challenging. Here, using a semi-synthetic chemical biology approach coupled to cellular assays, we found that C-terminal amide-bearing proteins (CTAPs) are rapidly cleared from human cells. A CRISPR screen identified FBXO31 as a reader of C-terminal amides. FBXO31 is a substrate receptor for the SKP1–CUL1–F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase SCF–FBXO31, which ubiquitylates CTAPs for subsequent proteasomal degradation. A conserved binding pocket enables FBXO31 to bind to almost any C-terminal peptide bearing an amide while retaining exquisite selectivity over non-modified clients. This mechanism facilitates binding and turnover of endogenous CTAPs that are formed after oxidative stress. A dominant human mutation found in neurodevelopmental disorders reverses CTAP recognition, such that non-amidated neosubstrates are now degraded and FBXO31 becomes markedly toxic. We propose that CTAPs may represent the vanguard of a largely unexplored class of modified amino acid degrons that could provide a general strategy for selective yet broad surveillance of chemically damaged proteins. SCF–FBXO31 scans proteins for C-terminal amidation and marks them for subsequent proteasomal degradation.",

    "abstract": "Crosslinked thermosets are highly durable materials, but overcoming their petrochemical origins and inability to be recycled poses a grand challenge1–3. Many strategies to access crosslinked polymers that are bioderived or degradable-by-design have been proposed, but they require several resource-intensive synthesis and purification steps and are not yet feasible alternatives to conventional consumer materials4–8. Here we present a modular, one-pot synthesis of degradable thermosets from the commercially available, biosourced monomer 2,3-dihydrofuran (DHF)9. In the presence of a ruthenium catalyst and photoacid generator, DHF undergoes slow ring-opening metathesis polymerization to give a soft polymer; then, exposure to light triggers strong acid generation and promotes the cationic polymerization of the same DHF monomer to spatially crosslink and strengthen the material10–12. By manipulating catalyst loading and light exposure, we can access materials with physical properties spanning orders of magnitude and achieve spatially resolved material domains. Importantly, the DHF-based thermosets undergo stimuli-selective degradation and can be recycled to the monomer under mild heating. The use of two distinct polymerization mechanisms on a single functional group allows the synthesis of degradable and recyclable thermoset materials with precisely controlled properties. Degradable thermoset multimaterials can be synthesized from a commercially accessible, biosourced monomer using orthogonal polymerizations in a single pot; after selective degredation, the resulting small molecules can be repolymerized.",

    "abstract": "Place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are elements of a neural map of self position1–5. For these cells to benefit navigation, their representation must be dynamically related to the surrounding locations2. A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal’s path has been described for place cells, in which the sequence of spikes in each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal’s current location towards upcoming locations6–8. In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms when the animal approaches the choice point9,10, raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials10. However, to bridge the animal’s path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats that in individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal’s location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps are accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells that have putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive grid × direction cells. Sweeps extend into never-visited locations that are inaccessible to the animal. Sweeps persist during REM sleep. The sweep directions can be explained by an algorithm that maximizes the cumulative coverage of the surrounding manifold space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left–right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal–hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient ‘look around’ mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path. A study in rats proposes a mechanism for how the brain maps the surrounding environment, including places it has never seen, by alternating left and right forward sweeps in successive theta cycles.",

    "abstract": "Greenlandic Inuit and other indigenous populations are underrepresented in genetic research1,2, leading to inequity in healthcare opportunities. To address this, we performed analyses of sequenced or imputed genomes of 5,996 Greenlanders with extensive phenotypes. We quantified their historical population bottleneck and how it has shaped their genetic architecture to have fewer, but more common, variable sites. Consequently, we find twice as many high-impact genome-wide associations to metabolic traits in Greenland compared with Europe. We infer that the high-impact variants arose after the population split from Native Americans and thus are Arctic-specific, and show that some of them are common due to not only genetic drift but also selection. We also find that European-derived polygenic scores for metabolic traits are only half as accurate in Greenlanders as in Europeans, and that adding Arctic-specific variants improves the overall accuracy to the same level as in Europeans. Similarly, lack of representation in public genetic databases makes genetic clinical screening harder in Greenlandic Inuit, but inclusion of Greenlandic data remedies this by reducing the number of non-causal candidate variants by sixfold. Finally, we identify pronounced genetic fine structure that explains differences in prevalence of monogenic diseases in Greenland and, together with recent changes in mobility, leads to a predicted future reduction in risk for certain recessive diseases. These results illustrate how including data from Greenlanders can greatly reduce inequity in genomic-based healthcare. We illustrate that including data from Greenlandic Inuit can greatly reduce inequity in genomic-based healthcare in Greenland and other indigenous Arctic populations.",

    "abstract": "Most current strategies for carbon management require CO2 removal (CDR) from the atmosphere on the multi-hundred gigatonne (Gt) scale by 2100 (refs. 1–5). Mg-rich silicate minerals can remove >105 Gt CO2 and sequester it as stable and innocuous carbonate minerals or dissolved bicarbonate ions3,6,7. However, the reaction rates of these minerals under ambient conditions are far too slow for practical use. Here we show that CaCO3 and CaSO4 react quantitatively with diverse Mg-rich silicates (for example, olivine, serpentine and augite) under thermochemical conditions to form Ca2SiO4 and MgO. On exposure to ambient air under wet conditions, Ca2SiO4 is converted to CaCO3 and silicic acid, and MgO is partially converted into a Mg carbonate within weeks, whereas the input Mg silicate shows no reactivity over 6 months. Alternatively, Ca2SiO4 and MgO can be completely carbonated to CaCO3 and Mg(HCO3)2 under 1 atm CO2 at ambient temperature within hours. Using CaCO3 as the Ca source, this chemistry enables a CDR process in which the output Ca2SiO4/MgO material is used to remove CO2 from air or soil and the CO2 process emissions are sequestered. Analysis of the energy requirements indicates that this process could require less than 1 MWh per tonne CO2 removed, approximately half the energy of CO2 capture with leading direct air capture technologies. The chemistry described here could unlock Mg-rich silicates as a vast resource for safe and permanent CDR. Reactions of Mg-rich silicates with calcium carbonates/sulfates result in the formation of materials that could potentially be used for low-cost carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "Substantial epigenetic resetting during early embryo development from fertilization to blastocyst formation ensures zygotic genome activation and leads to progressive cellular heterogeneities1–3. Mapping single-cell epigenomic profiles of core histone modifications that cover each individual cell is a fundamental goal in developmental biology. Here we develop target chromatin indexing and tagmentation (TACIT), a method that enabled genome-coverage single-cell profiling of seven histone modifications across mouse early embryos. We integrated these single-cell histone modifications with single-cell RNA sequencing data to chart a single-cell resolution epigenetic landscape. Multimodal chromatin-state annotations showed that the onset of zygotic genome activation at the early two-cell stage already primes heterogeneities in totipotency. We used machine learning to identify totipotency gene regulatory networks, including stage-specific transposable elements and putative transcription factors. CRISPR activation of a combination of these identified transcription factors induced totipotency activation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together with single-cell co-profiles of multiple histone modifications, we developed a model that predicts the earliest cell branching towards the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm in latent multimodal space and identifies regulatory elements and previously unknown lineage-specifying transcription factors. Our work provides insights into single-cell epigenetic reprogramming, multimodal regulation of cellular lineages and cell-fate priming during mouse pre-implantation development. Two new methods, target chromatin indexing and tagmentation (TACIT) and combined TACIT (CoTACIT), enabled single-cell profiling of the epigenome and lineage tracing from mouse zygotes to blastocysts.",

    "abstract": "The current opioid overdose epidemic highlights the urgent need to develop safer and more effective treatments for chronic pain1. Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is a promising non-opioid target for pain relief, but its clinical use has been limited by centrally mediated psychoactivity and tolerance. We overcame both issues by designing peripherally restricted CB1 agonists that minimize arrestin recruitment. We achieved these goals by computationally designing positively charged derivatives of the potent CB1 agonist MDMB-Fubinaca2. We designed these ligands to occupy a cryptic pocket identified through molecular dynamics simulations—an extended binding pocket that opens rarely and leads to the conserved signalling residue D2.50 (ref. 3). We used structure determination, pharmacological assays and molecular dynamics simulations to verify the binding modes of these ligands and to determine the molecular mechanism by which they achieve this dampening of arrestin recruitment. Our lead ligand, VIP36, is highly peripherally restricted and demonstrates notable efficacy in three mouse pain models, with 100-fold dose separation between analgesic efficacy and centrally mediated side effects. VIP36 exerts analgesic efficacy through peripheral CB1 receptors and shows limited analgesic tolerance. These results show how targeting a cryptic pocket in a G-protein-coupled receptor can lead to enhanced peripheral selectivity, biased signalling, desired in vivo pharmacology and reduced adverse effects. This has substantial implications for chronic pain treatment but could also revolutionize the design of drugs targeting other G-protein-coupled receptors. A peripherally restricted CB1 agonist (VIP36) targeting a cryptic receptor pocket was developed, showing high efficacy in mouse pain models with minimal side effects and tolerance, potentially revolutionizing chronic pain treatment and GPCR drug design.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art climate models project a substantial decline in precipitation for the Mediterranean region in the future1. Supporting this notion, several studies based on observed precipitation data spanning recent decades have suggested a decrease in Mediterranean precipitation2–4, with some attributing a large fraction of this change to anthropogenic influences3,5. Conversely, certain researchers have underlined that Mediterranean precipitation exhibits considerable spatiotemporal variability driven by atmospheric circulation patterns6,7 maintaining stationarity over the long term8,9. These conflicting perspectives underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes in this region, given the profound social, economic and environmental implications. Here we show that Mediterranean precipitation has largely remained stationary from 1871 to 2020, albeit with significant multi-decadal and interannual variability. This conclusion is based on the most comprehensive dataset available for the region, encompassing over 23,000 stations across 27 countries. While trends can be identified for some periods and subregions, our findings attribute these trends primarily to atmospheric dynamics, which would be mostly linked to internal variability. Furthermore, our assessment reconciles the observed precipitation trends with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model simulations, neither of which indicate a prevailing past precipitation trend in the region. The implications of our results extend to environmental, agricultural and water resources planning in one of the world’s prominent climate change hotspots10. Our assessment of a 27-country weather station dataset in the Mediterranean region revealed long-term stability in precipitation over 150 years, along with substantial short-term variability on annual to decadal scales driven by atmospheric circulation; these findings align with the precipitation trends seen in CMIP6 models.",

    "abstract": "Trees are an important carbon sink as they accumulate biomass through photosynthesis1. Identifying tree species that grow fast is therefore commonly considered to be essential for effective climate change mitigation through forest planting. Although species characteristics are key information for plantation design and forest management, field studies often fail to detect clear relationships between species functional traits and tree growth2. Here, by consolidating four independent datasets and classifying the acquisitive and conservative species based on their functional trait values, we show that acquisitive tree species, which are supposedly fast-growing species, generally grow slowly in field conditions. This discrepancy between the current paradigm and field observations is explained by the interactions with environmental conditions that influence growth. Acquisitive species require moist mild climates and fertile soils, conditions that are generally not met in the field. By contrast, conservative species, which are supposedly slow-growing species, show generally higher realized growth due to their ability to tolerate unfavourable environmental conditions. In general, conservative tree species grow more steadily than acquisitive tree species in non-tropical forests. We recommend planting acquisitive tree species in areas where they can realize their fast-growing potential. In other regions, where environmental stress is higher, conservative tree species have a larger potential to fix carbon in their biomass. Under field conditions, acquisitive tree species generally grow slowly, whereas conservative species show generally higher realized growth, owing to their ability to tolerate unfavourable environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Depicting spatial distributions of disease-relevant cells is crucial for understanding disease pathology1,2. Here we present genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits (gsMap), a method that integrates spatial transcriptomics data with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to map cells to human complex traits, including diseases, in a spatially resolved manner. Using embryonic spatial transcriptomics datasets covering 25 organs, we benchmarked gsMap through simulation and by corroborating known trait-associated cells or regions in various organs. Applying gsMap to brain spatial transcriptomics data, we reveal that the spatial distribution of glutamatergic neurons associated with schizophrenia more closely resembles that for cognitive traits than that for mood traits such as depression. The schizophrenia-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the dorsal hippocampus, with upregulated expression of calcium signalling and regulation genes, whereas depression-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the deep medial prefrontal cortex, with upregulated expression of neuroplasticity and psychiatric drug target genes. Our study provides a method for spatially resolved mapping of trait-associated cells and demonstrates the gain of biological insights (such as the spatial distribution of trait-relevant cells and related signature genes) through these maps. Integration of spatial transcriptomics data with data from genome-wide association studies enables spatially resolved mapping of cells associated with human diseases and other complex traits.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O system (the cuprate) in the 30 K range marked a significant breakthrough, which inspired extensive exploration of oxide-based, layered superconductors to identify electron pairing with higher critical temperatures (Tc)1. Despite recent observations of superconductivity in nickel oxide-based compounds (the nickelates), evidence of Cooper pairing above 30 K in a system that is isostructural to the cuprates, but without copper, at ambient pressure and without lattice compression has remained elusive2–5. Here we report superconductivity with a Tc approaching 40 K under ambient pressure in d9−x hole-doped, late rare earth, infinite-layer nickel oxide (Sm-Eu-Ca-Sr)NiO2 thin films with negligible lattice compression, supported by observations of a zero-resistance state at 31 K and the Meissner effect. The material can be synthesized with essentially no Ruddlesden–Popper-type structural defects, exhibiting ultralow resistivity of approximately 0.01 mΩ cm, and with a residual resistivity ratio of up to 10. Our findings demonstrate the potential for achieving high-temperature superconductivity using strongly correlated d-electron metal oxides beyond copper as the building blocks for superconductivity, and offering a promising platform for further exploration and understanding of high-temperature Cooper pairing. Superconductivity at temperatures approaching 40 K for a hole-doped nickel oxide that is isostructural with cuprate superconductors demonstrates the existence of a broader family of materials and potential for achieving higher-temperature superconductivity.",

    "abstract": "Although quantum computers can perform a wide range of practically important tasks beyond the abilities of classical computers1,2, realizing this potential remains a challenge. An example is to use an untrusted remote device to generate random bits that can be certified to contain a certain amount of entropy3. Certified randomness has many applications but is impossible to achieve solely by classical computation. Here we demonstrate the generation of certifiably random bits using the 56-qubit Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessed over the Internet. Our protocol leverages the classical hardness of recent random circuit sampling demonstrations4,5: a client generates quantum ‘challenge’ circuits using a small randomness seed, sends them to an untrusted quantum server to execute and verifies the results of the server. We analyse the security of our protocol against a restricted class of realistic near-term adversaries. Using classical verification with measured combined sustained performance of 1.1 × 1018 floating-point operations per second across multiple supercomputers, we certify 71,313 bits of entropy under this restricted adversary and additional assumptions. Our results demonstrate a step towards the practical applicability of present-day quantum computers. Certifiably random bits can be generated using the 56-qubit Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessed over the Internet.",

    "abstract": "Liver regeneration after hepatectomy follows accurate coordination with the body’s specific requirements1–3. However, the molecular mechanisms, factors and particular hepatocyte population influencing its efficiency remain unclear. Here we report on a unique regeneration mechanism involving unconventional RPB5 prefoldin interactor 1 (URI1), which exclusively colocalizes with, binds to and activates glutamine synthase (GS) in pericentral hepatocytes. Genetic GS or URI1 depletion in mouse pericentral hepatocytes increases circulating glutamate levels, accelerating liver regeneration after two-third hepatectomy. Conversely, mouse hepatocytic URI1 overexpression hinders liver restoration, which can be reversed by elevating glutamate through supplementation or genetic GS depletion. Glutamate metabolically reprograms bone-marrow-derived macrophages, stabilizing HIF1α, which transcriptionally activates WNT3 to promote YAP1-dependent hepatocyte proliferation, boosting liver regeneration. GS regulation by URI1 is a mechanism that maintains optimal glutamate levels, probably to spatiotemporally fine-tune liver growth in accordance with the body’s homeostasis and nutrient supply. Accordingly, in acute and chronic injury models, including in cirrhotic mice with low glutamate levels and in early mortality after liver resection, as well as in mice undergoing 90% hepatectomy, glutamate addition enhances hepatocyte proliferation and survival. Furthermore, URI1 and GS expression co-localize in human hepatocytes and correlate with WNT3 in immune cells across liver disease stages. Glutamate supplementation may therefore support liver regeneration, benefiting patients awaiting transplants or recovering from hepatectomy. Glutamate metabolically reprograms bone-marrow-derived macrophages, stabilizing HIF1α, which transcriptionally activates WNT3 to promote YAP1-dependent hepatocyte proliferation, boosting liver regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Deracemization is an emerging strategy for generating enantioenriched compounds wherein the two enantiomers of a readily available racemic starting material are transformed into a single enantiomer, typically through the action of a light-induced catalyst1,2. Excellent proof of principle for this potentially powerful approach to asymmetric catalysis has been described3–8; nevertheless, substantial challenges have not yet been addressed, including the exploitation of carbon–heteroatom (rather than only carbon–hydrogen and carbon–carbon) bond cleavage to achieve deracemization, as well as the development of processes that provide broad classes of useful enantioenriched compounds and tetrasubstituted stereocentres. Here we describe a straightforward method that addresses these challenges, using a chiral copper catalyst, generated in situ from commercially available components, to achieve the photoinduced deracemization of tertiary (and secondary) alkyl halides through carbon–halogen bond cleavage. Mechanistic studies (including the independent synthesis of postulated intermediates, photophysical, spectroscopic and reactivity studies, and density functional theory calculations) provide support for the key steps and intermediates in our proposed catalytic cycle, as well as insight into the origin of enantioselectivity. A chiral copper catalyst, generated in situ from commercially available components, can be used to achieve photoinduced deracemization of alkyl halides through carbon–halogen bond cleavage.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuit function is shaped both by the cell types that comprise the circuit and the connections between them1. Neural cell types have previously been defined by morphology2,3, electrophysiology4, transcriptomic expression5,6, connectivity7–9 or a combination of such modalities10–12. The Patch-seq technique enables the characterization of morphology, electrophysiology and transcriptomic properties from individual cells13–15. These properties were integrated to define 28 inhibitory, morpho-electric-transcriptomic (MET) cell types in mouse visual cortex16, which do not include synaptic connectivity. Conversely, large-scale electron microscopy (EM) enables morphological reconstruction and a near-complete description of a neuron’s local synaptic connectivity, but does not include transcriptomic or electrophysiological information. Here, we leveraged morphological information from Patch-seq to predict the transcriptomically defined cell subclass and/or MET-type of inhibitory neurons within a large-scale EM dataset. We further analysed Martinotti cells—a somatostatin (Sst)-positive17 morphological cell type18,19—which were classified successfully into Sst MET-types with distinct axon myelination and synaptic output connectivity patterns. We demonstrate that morphological features can be used to link cell types across experimental modalities, enabling further comparison of connectivity to gene expression and electrophysiology. We observe unique connectivity rules for predicted Sst cell types. The authors use Patch-seq and electron microscopy datasets to relate synaptic connectivity to the transcriptomic cell type of different types of inhibitory neuron.",

    "abstract": "We are in the era of millimetre-scale electron microscopy volumes collected at nanometre resolution1,2. Dense reconstruction of cellular compartments in these electron microscopy volumes has been enabled by recent advances in machine learning3–6. Automated segmentation methods produce exceptionally accurate reconstructions of cells, but post hoc proofreading is still required to generate large connectomes that are free of merge and split errors. The elaborate 3D meshes of neurons in these volumes contain detailed morphological information at multiple scales, from the diameter, shape and branching patterns of axons and dendrites, down to the fine-scale structure of dendritic spines. However, extracting these features can require substantial effort to piece together existing tools into custom workflows. Here, building on existing open source software for mesh manipulation, we present Neural Decomposition (NEURD), a software package that decomposes meshed neurons into compact and extensively annotated graph representations. With these feature-rich graphs, we automate a variety of tasks such as state-of-the-art automated proofreading of merge errors, cell classification, spine detection, axonal-dendritic proximities and other annotations. These features enable many downstream analyses of neural morphology and connectivity, making these massive and complex datasets more accessible to neuroscience researchers. Neural Decomposition (NEURD) is a software package that decomposes neuronal data from high-resolution electron microscopy volumes into feature-rich graph representations to facilitate analysis for neuroscience research.",

    "abstract": "The axion is a hypothetical fundamental particle that is conjectured to correspond to the coherent oscillation of the θ field in quantum chromodynamics1,2. Its existence would solve multiple fundamental questions, including the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics and dark matter, but the axion has never been detected. Electrodynamics of condensed-matter systems can also give rise to a similar θ, so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize the topology of materials3–5. Coherent oscillation of θ in condensed matter has been proposed to lead to physics directly analogous to the high-energy axion particle—the dynamical axion quasiparticle (DAQ)6–23. Here we report the observation of the DAQ in MnBi2Te4. By combining a two-dimensional electronic device with ultrafast pump–probe optics, we observe a coherent oscillation of θ at about 44 gigahertz, which is uniquely induced by its out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. This represents direct evidence for the presence of the DAQ, which in two-dimensional MnBi2Te4 is found to arise from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of the Berry curvature. The DAQ also has implications in light–matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics24, as it might lead to axion polaritons and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization6,15–20. Finally, the DAQ could be used to detect axion particles21–23. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the millielectronvolt regime, which has so far been poorly explored. The dynamical axion quasiparticle, which is directly analogous to the hypothetical fundamental axion particle, is observed in two-dimensional MnBi2Te4, and has implications for quantum chromodynamics, cosmology and string theory.",

    "abstract": "Clonal haematopoiesis arises when a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) acquires a mutation that confers a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in its clonal expansion. Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses1–4. Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot1–3,5–7. Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3aR878H/+ mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3AR882H/+, have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration8, reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3AR882H HSPCs generated by prime editing. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for investigating metformin as a preventive intervention against DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis in humans. Dnmt3a mutations in mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells equivalent to R882 mutations in human cause increased mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that this is a mechanism of clonal haematopoiesis and a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Mendel1 studied in detail seven pairs of contrasting traits in pea (Pisum sativum), establishing the foundational principles of genetic inheritance. Here we investigate the genetic architecture that underlies these traits and uncover previously undescribed alleles for the four characterized Mendelian genes2–7, including a rare revertant of Mendel’s white-flowered a allele. Primarily, we focus on the three remaining uncharacterized traits and find that (1) an approximately 100-kb genomic deletion upstream of the Chlorophyll synthase (ChlG) gene disrupts chlorophyll biosynthesis through the generation of intergenic transcriptional fusion products, conferring the yellow pod phenotype of gp mutants; (2) a MYB gene with an upstream Ogre element insertion and a CLE peptide-encoding gene with an in-frame premature stop codon explain the v and p alleles, which disrupt secondary cell wall thickening and lignification, resulting in the parchmentless, edible-pod phenotype; and (3) a 5-bp exonic deletion in a CIK-like co-receptor kinase gene, in combination with a genetic modifier locus, is associated with the fasciated stem (fa) phenotype. Furthermore, we characterize genes and alleles associated with diverse agronomic traits, such as axil ring anthocyanin pigmentation, seed size and the ‘semi-leafless’ form. This study establishes a foundation for fundamental research, education in biology and genetics, and pea breeding practices. Characterization of the genetic architecture underlying the 7 pairs of contrasting traits studied by Mendel and the over 70 additional agronomic traits in pea (Pisum sativum) reveals their molecular details and provides tools for further studies in pea genetics, functional genomics and crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide1. Clinical studies have shown that the severity of cardiac injury after myocardial infarction exhibits a circadian pattern, with larger infarcts and poorer outcomes in patients experiencing morning-onset events2–7. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diurnal variations remain unclear. Here we show that the core circadian transcription factor BMAL17–11 regulates circadian-dependent myocardial injury by forming a transcriptionally active heterodimer with a non-canonical partner—hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2A)12–16—in a diurnal manner. To substantiate this finding, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex, revealing structural rearrangements within BMAL1 that enable cross-talk between circadian rhythms and hypoxia signalling. BMAL1 modulates the circadian hypoxic response by enhancing the transcriptional activity of HIF2A and stabilizing the HIF2A protein. We further identified amphiregulin (AREG)16,17 as a rhythmic target of the BMAL1–HIF2A complex, critical for regulating daytime variations of myocardial injury. Pharmacologically targeting the BMAL1–HIF2A–AREG pathway provides cardioprotection, with maximum efficacy when aligned with the pathway’s circadian phase. These findings identify a mechanism governing circadian variations of myocardial injury and highlight the therapeutic potential of clock-based pharmacological interventions for treating ischaemic heart disease. The core circadian transcription factor BMAL1 regulates circadian-dependent myocardial injury.",

    "abstract": "A high-fat, low-fibre Western-style diet (WD) induces microbiome dysbiosis characterized by reduced taxonomic diversity and metabolic breadth1,2, which in turn increases risk for a wide array of metabolic3–5, immune6 and systemic pathologies. Recent work has established that WD can impair microbiome resilience to acute perturbations such as antibiotic treatment7,8, although little is known about the mechanism of impairment and the specific consequences for the host of prolonged post-antibiotic dysbiosis. Here we characterize the trajectory by which the gut microbiome recovers its taxonomic and functional profile after antibiotic treatment in mice on regular chow (RC) or WD, and find that only mice on RC undergo a rapid successional process of recovery. Metabolic modelling indicates that a RC diet promotes the development of syntrophic cross-feeding interactions, whereas in mice on WD, a dominant taxon monopolizes readily available resources without releasing syntrophic byproducts. Intervention experiments reveal that an appropriate dietary resource environment is both necessary and sufficient for rapid and robust microbiome recovery, whereas microbial transplant is neither. Furthermore, prolonged post-antibiotic dysbiosis in mice on WD renders them susceptible to infection by the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Our data challenge widespread enthusiasm for faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) as a strategy to address dysbiosis, and demonstrate that specific dietary interventions are, at a minimum, an essential prerequisite for effective FMT, and may afford a safer, more natural and less invasive alternative. Experiments in mouse models show that proper recovery of the intestinal microbiota following depletion, with or without faecal microbiota transplant therapy, is dependent on syntrophic interactions that occur only with specific dietary interventions.",

The use of microorganisms in bioremediation has been constrained by the complexity of organic pollutants and limited tolerance to saline stress2. In this study, we used synthetic biology to engineer Vibrio natriegens into a strain capable of bioremediating complex organic pollutants in saline wastewater and soils. The competence master regulator gene tfoX was inserted into chromosome 1 of the V. natriegens strain Vmax and overexpressed to enhance DNA uptake and integration. Degradation gene clusters were chemically synthesized and assembled in yeast. We developed a genome engineering method (iterative natural transformation based on Vmax with amplified tfoX effect) to transfer five gene clusters (43 kb total) into Vmax. The engineered strain has the ability to bioremediate five organic pollutants (biphenyl, phenol, naphthalene, dibenzofuran and toluene) covering a broad substrate range, from monocyclic to multicyclic compounds, in industrial wastewater samples from a chlor–alkali plant and a petroleum refinery. A synthetic biology approach was used to engineer Vibrio natriegens into a strain capable of bioremediating complex organic pollutants in saline wastewater and soils, thereby addressing notable threats to marine biosecurity.",

However, the identification of such lineages and estimation of associated fitness remain challenging, and is rarely done outside densely sampled systems1,2. Here we present phylowave, a scalable approach that summarizes changes in population composition in phylogenetic trees, enabling the automatic detection of lineages based on shared fitness and evolutionary relationships. We use our approach on a broad set of viruses and bacteria (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A subtype H3N2, Bordetella pertussis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), which include both well-studied and understudied threats to human health. We show that phylowave recovers the main known circulating lineages for each pathogen and that it can detect specific amino acid changes linked to fitness changes. Furthermore, phylowave identifies previously undetected lineages with increased fitness, including three co-circulating B. pertussis lineages. Inference using phylowave is robust to uneven and limited observations. This widely applicable approach provides an avenue to monitor evolution in real time to support public-health action and explore fundamental drivers of pathogen fitness. Phylowave, an innovative phylogenetic approach, can identify the main circulating pathogen lineages with increased fitness and the associated genetic changes, enabling the timely identification of emergent strains and deployment of targeted interventions.",

    "abstract": "The abundance and sequence of satellite DNA at and around centromeres is evolving rapidly despite the highly conserved and essential process through which the centromere directs chromosome inheritance1–3. The impact of such rapid evolution is unclear. Here we find that sequence-dependent DNA shape dictates packaging of pericentromeric satellites in female meiosis through a conserved DNA-shape-recognizing chromatin architectural protein, high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1)4,5. Pericentromeric heterochromatin in two closely related mouse species, M. musculus and M. spretus, forms on divergent satellites that differ by both density of narrow DNA minor grooves and HMGA1 recruitment. HMGA1 binds preferentially to M. musculus satellites, and depletion in M. musculus oocytes causes massive stretching of pericentromeric satellites, disruption of kinetochore organization and delays in bipolar spindle assembly. In M. musculus × spretus hybrid oocytes, HMGA1 depletion disproportionately impairs M. musculus pericentromeres and microtubule attachment to their kinetochores. Thus, DNA shape affects both pericentromere packaging and the segregation machinery. We propose that rapid evolution of centromere and pericentromere DNA does not disrupt these essential processes when the satellites adopt DNA shapes recognized by conserved architectural proteins (such as HMGA1). By packaging these satellites, architectural proteins become part of the centromeric and pericentromeric chromatin, suggesting an evolutionary strategy that lowers the cost of megabase-scale satellite expansion. Divergent satellite DNA shapes influence architectural protein binding and chromatin organization in two mouse species so that the satellites can be packaged and centromere function maintained, mitigating the evolutionary cost of satellite DNA expansion.",

Several recent books and academic papers have outlined the ethical concerns raised by germline genome editing and the opportunities that it may present1–3. To date, no attempts have been made to predict the consequences of altering specific variants associated with polygenic diseases. In this Analysis, we show that polygenic genome editing could theoretically yield extreme reductions in disease susceptibility. For example, editing a relatively small number of genomic variants could make a substantial difference to an individual’s risk of developing coronary artery disease, Alzheimer’s disease, major depressive disorder, diabetes and schizophrenia. Similarly, large changes in risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure, could, in theory, be achieved by polygenic editing. Although heritable polygenic editing (HPE) is still speculative, we completed calculations to discuss the underlying ethical issues. Our modelling demonstrates how the putatively positive consequences of gene editing at an individual level may deepen health inequalities. Further, as single or multiple gene variants can increase the risk of some diseases while decreasing that of others, HPE raises ethical challenges related to pleiotropy and genetic diversity. We conclude by arguing for a collectivist perspective on the ethical issues raised by HPE, which accounts for its effects on individuals, their families, communities and society4. We discuss the potential consequences and ethical concerns of polygenic genome editing of human embryos to alter specific variants associated with polygenic diseases, highlighting the possibility of reducing disease susceptibility while exacerbating health inequalities.",

    "abstract": "The low reduction potentials required for the reduction of dinitrogen (N2) render metal-based nitrogen-fixation catalysts vulnerable to irreversible damage by dioxygen (O2)1–3. Such O2 sensitivity represents a major conundrum for the enzyme nitrogenase, as a large fraction of nitrogen-fixing organisms are either obligate aerobes or closely associated with O2-respiring organisms to support the high energy demand of catalytic N2 reduction4. To counter O2 damage to nitrogenase, diazotrophs use O2 scavengers, exploit compartmentalization or maintain high respiration rates to minimize intracellular O2 concentrations4–8. A last line of damage control is provided by the ‘conformational protection’ mechanism9, in which a [2Fe:2S] ferredoxin-family protein termed FeSII (ref. 10) is activated under O2 stress to form an O2-resistant complex with the nitrogenase component proteins11,12. Despite previous insights, the molecular basis for the conformational O2 protection of nitrogenase and the mechanism of FeSII activation are not understood. Here we report the structural characterization of the Azotobacter vinelandii FeSII–nitrogenase complex by cryo-electron microscopy. Our studies reveal a core complex consisting of two molybdenum–iron proteins (MoFePs), two iron proteins (FePs) and one FeSII homodimer, which polymerize into extended filaments. In this three-protein complex, FeSII mediates an extensive network of interactions with MoFeP and FeP to position their iron–sulphur clusters in catalytically inactive but O2-protected states. The architecture of the FeSII–nitrogenase complex is confirmed by solution studies, which further indicate that the activation of FeSII involves an oxidation-induced conformational change. Cryo-electron microscopy of Azotobacter vinelandii FeSII–nitrogenase reveals a core complex of molybdenum–iron proteins (MoFePs), iron proteins (FePs) and FeSII, in which FeSII mediates interactions with MoFeP and FeP to position their FeS clusters in catalytically inactive but O2-protected states.",

However, application of HTE in electrosynthesis—an enabling tool for chemical synthesis—has been limited by a dearth of suitable standardized reactors3–7. Here we report the development of microelectronic devices, which are produced using standard nanofabrication techniques, to enable wireless electrosynthesis on the microlitre scale. These robust and inexpensive devices are powered by visible light and convert any traditional 96-well or 384-well plate into an electrochemical reactor. We validate the devices in oxidative, reductive and paired electrolysis and further apply them to achieve the library synthesis of biologically active compounds and accelerate the development of two electrosynthetic methodologies. We anticipate that, by simplifying the way electrochemical reactions are set up, this user-friendly solution will not only enhance the experience and efficiency of current practitioners but also substantially reduce the barrier for nonspecialists to enter the field of electrosynthesis, thus allowing the broader community of synthetic chemists to explore and benefit from new reactivities and synthetic strategies enabled by electrochemistry8–12. A method to produce wireless microelectronic devices powered by light using standard nanofabrication techniques is described to convert any traditional 96-well or 384-well plate into an electrochemical reactor that can drive reactions in high throughput.",

    "abstract": "Human recombination maps are a valuable resource for association and linkage studies and crucial for many inferences of population history and natural selection. Existing maps1–5 are based solely on cross-over (CO) recombination, omitting non-cross-overs (NCOs)—the more common form of recombination6—owing to the difficulty in detecting them. Using whole-genome sequence data in families, we estimate the number of NCOs transmitted from parent to offspring and derive complete, sex-specific recombination maps including both NCOs and COs. Mothers have fewer but longer NCOs than fathers, and oocytes accumulate NCOs in a non-regulated fashion with maternal age. Recombination, primarily NCO, is responsible for 1.8% (95% confidence interval: 1.3–2.3) and 11.3% (95% confidence interval: 9.0–13.6) of paternal and maternal de novo mutations, respectively, and may drive the increase in de novo mutations with maternal age. NCOs are substantially more prominent than COs in centromeres, possibly to avoid large-scale genomic changes that may cause aneuploidy. Our results demonstrate that NCOs highlight to a much greater extent than COs the differences in the meiotic process between the sexes, in which maternal NCOs may reflect the safeguarding of oocytes from infancy until ovulation. Complete human recombination maps are presented that enable exploration of both cross-over and non-cross-over events during meiosis, with the potential to provide insight into the causes of aneuploidies and pregnancy loss.",

    "abstract": "Female mammalian cells have two X chromosomes, one of maternal origin and one of paternal origin. During development, one X chromosome randomly becomes inactivated1–4. This renders either the maternal X (Xm) chromosome or the paternal X (Xp) chromosome inactive, causing X mosaicism that varies between female individuals, with some showing considerable or complete skew of the X chromosome that remains active5–7. Parent-of-X origin can modify epigenetics through DNA methylation8,9 and possibly gene expression; thus, mosaicism could buffer dysregulated processes in ageing and disease. However, whether X skew or its mosaicism alters functions in female individuals is largely unknown. Here we tested whether skew towards an active Xm chromosome influences the brain and body—and then delineated unique features of Xm neurons and Xp neurons. An active Xm chromosome impaired cognition in female mice throughout the lifespan and led to worsened cognition with age. Cognitive deficits were accompanied by Xm-mediated acceleration of biological or epigenetic ageing of the hippocampus, a key centre for learning and memory, in female mice. Several genes were imprinted on the Xm chromosome of hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. CRISPR-mediated activation of Xm-imprinted genes improved cognition in ageing female mice. Thus, the Xm chromosome impaired cognition, accelerated brain ageing and silenced genes that contribute to cognition in ageing. Understanding how Xm impairs brain function could lead to an improved understanding of heterogeneity in cognitive health in female individuals and to X-chromosome-derived pathways that protect against cognitive deficits and brain ageing. The maternal X chromosome in female mice impairs cognition through the silencing of certain genes and accelerates ageing of the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Type A GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) receptors (GABAA receptors) mediate most fast inhibitory signalling in the brain and are targets for drugs that treat epilepsy, anxiety, depression and insomnia and for anaesthetics1,2. These receptors comprise a complex array of 19 related subunits, which form pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The composition and structure of native GABAA receptors in the human brain have been inferred from subunit localization in tissue1,3, functional measurements and structural analysis from recombinant expression4–7 and in mice8. However, the arrangements of subunits that co-assemble physiologically in native human GABAA receptors remain unknown. Here we isolated α1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors from human patients with epilepsy. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we defined a set of 12 native subunit assemblies and their 3D structures. We address inconsistencies between previous native and recombinant approaches, and reveal details of previously undefined subunit interfaces. Drug-like densities in a subset of these interfaces led us to uncover unexpected activity on the GABAA receptor of antiepileptic drugs and resulted in localization of one of these drugs to the benzodiazepine-binding site. Proteomics and further structural analysis suggest interactions with the auxiliary subunits neuroligin 2 and GARLH4, which localize and modulate GABAA receptors at inhibitory synapses. This work provides a structural foundation for understanding GABAA receptor signalling and targeted pharmacology in the human brain. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of native type A GABA receptors from human brain reveal diverse subunit compositions, protein binding partners and binding sites for antiepileptic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bonds are the foundation of essentially every organic molecule, making them an ideal place to do chemical synthesis. The key challenge is achieving selectivity for one particular C(sp3)−H bond1–3. In recent years, metalloenzymes have been found to perform C(sp3)−H bond functionalization4,5. Despite substantial progresses in the past two decades6,7, enzymatic halogenation and pseudohalogenation of unactivated C(sp3)−H—providing a functional handle for further modification—have been achieved with only non-haem iron/α-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases, and are therefore limited by the chemistry possible with these enzymes8. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a previously unknown halogenase ApnU, part of a protein family containing domain of unknown function 3328 (DUF3328). ApnU uses copper in its active site to catalyse iterative chlorinations on multiple unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds. By taking advantage of the softer copper centre, we demonstrate that ApnU can catalyse unprecedented enzymatic C(sp3)−H bond functionalization such as iodination and thiocyanation. Using biochemical characterization and proteomics analysis, we identified the functional oligomeric state of ApnU as a covalently linked homodimer, which contains three essential pairs—one interchain and two intrachain—of disulfide bonds. The metal-coordination active site in ApnU consists of binuclear type II copper centres, as revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This discovery expands the enzymatic capability of C(sp3)−H halogenases and provides a foundational understanding of this family of binuclear copper-dependent oxidative enzymes. A halogenase enzyme uses the copper in its active site to catalyse iterative chlorinations on multiple unactivated carbon−hydrogen bonds, enabling carbon−hydrogen functionalization that is not achievable with an iron-based halogenase.",

    "abstract": "Elevated or ectopic expression of neuronal receptors promotes tumour progression in many cancer types1,2; neuroendocrine (NE) transformation of adenocarcinomas has also been associated with increased aggressiveness3. Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells4,5. Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte–neuron metabolite shuttle6. Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential. Electrical excitability in neuroendocrine SCLC cells promotes tumour progression through action potential firing, increasing ATP demand and oxidative phosphorylation dependency, whereas non-neuroendocrine cells provide metabolic support, driving a tumour-autonomous cycle that enhances tumorigenesis and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-degenerating disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein1,2. Utrophin (UTRN), the genetic and functional paralogue of DMD, is upregulated in some DMD patients3–5. To further investigate this UTRN upregulation, we first developed an inducible messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation system for DMD by introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in one of its alternatively spliced exons. Inclusion of the PTC-containing exon triggers DMD mutant mRNA decay and UTRN upregulation. Notably, blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay results in the reversal of UTRN upregulation, whereas overexpressing DMD does not. Furthermore, overexpressing DMDPTC minigenes in wild-type cells causes UTRN upregulation, as does a wild-type DMD minigene containing a self-cleaving ribozyme. To place these findings in a therapeutic context, we used splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of DMD, aiming to introduce PTCs. We found that these ASOs cause UTRN upregulation. In addition, when using an ASO to restore the DMD reading frame in myotubes derived from a DMDΔE52 patient, an actual DMD treatment, UTRN upregulation was reduced. Altogether, these results indicate that an mRNA decay-based mechanism called transcriptional adaptation6–8 plays a key role in UTRN upregulation in DMDPTC patients, and they highlight an unexplored therapeutic application of ASOs, as well as ribozymes, in inducing genetic compensation via transcriptional adaptation.  Transcriptional adaptation upregulates UTRN in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, as supported by several lines of evidence, including the use of splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of the DMD gene.",

    "abstract": "Gas samples relevant to health1–3 and the environment4–6 typically contain many molecular species that span a huge concentration dynamic range. Mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy with high-finesse cavity enhancement has allowed the most sensitive multispecies trace-gas detections so far2,7–13. However, the robust performance of this technique depends critically on ensuring absorption-path-length enhancement over a broad spectral coverage, which is severely limited by comb–cavity frequency mismatch if strongly absorbing compounds are present. Here we introduce modulated ringdown comb interferometry, a technique that resolves the vulnerability of comb–cavity enhancement to strong intracavity absorption or dispersion. This technique works by measuring ringdown dynamics carried by massively parallel comb lines transmitted through a length-modulated cavity, making use of both the periodicity of the field dynamics and the Doppler frequency shifts introduced from a Michelson interferometer. As a demonstration, we measure highly dispersive exhaled human breath samples and ambient air in the mid-infrared with finesse improved to 23,000 and coverage to 1,010 cm−1. Such a product of finesse and spectral coverage is orders of magnitude better than all previous demonstrations2,7–20, enabling us to simultaneously quantify 20 distinct molecular species at above 1-part-per-trillion sensitivity varying in concentrations by seven orders of magnitude. This technique unlocks next-generation sensing performance for complex and dynamic molecular compositions, with scalable improvement to both finesse and spectral coverage. A new optical technique, modulated ringdown comb interferometry, is introduced for measuring the concentration of gas species in a complex sample and its efficacy demonstrated using exhaled human breath and ambient air in the mid-infrared.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions3. Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons4–9 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL. D1- and D2-expressing striatal neurons encode separate parts of a learned reward distribution, paralleling modern approaches in machine learning.",

    "abstract": "The generation of large-scale entangled states is crucial for quantum technologies, such as quantum computation1, communication2 and metrology3. Integrated quantum photonics that enables on-chip encoding, processing and detection of quantum light states offers a promising platform for the generation and manipulation of large-scale entangled states4,5. Generating entanglement between qubits encoded in discrete variables within single photons is challenging, owing to the difficulty of making single photons interact on photonic chips6–11. Devices that operate with continuous variables are more promising, as they enable the deterministic generation and entanglement of qumodes, in which information is encoded in light quadratures. Demonstrations so far have been limited to entanglement between two qumodes12–20. Here we report the deterministic generation of a continuous-variable eight-mode entanglement on an integrated optical chip. The chip delivers a quantum microcomb that produces multimode squeezed-vacuum optical frequency combs below the threshold. We verify the inseparability of our eight-mode state and demonstrate supermode multipartite entanglement over hundreds of megahertz sideband frequencies through violation of the van Loock–Furusawa criteria. By measuring the full matrices of nullifier correlations with sufficiently low off-diagonal noises, we characterize multipartite entanglement structures, which are approximate to the expected cluster-type structures for finite squeezing. This work shows the potential of continuous-variable integrated photonic quantum devices for facilitating quantum computing, networking and sensing. Deterministic generation of a continuous-variable eight-mode entanglement on an integrated optical chip is reported.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress can change how we learn and, thus, how we make decisions1–5. Here we investigated the neuronal circuit mechanisms that enable this. Using a multifaceted systems neuroscience approach in male and female mice, we reveal a dual-pathway, amygdala–striatal neuronal circuit architecture by which a recent history of chronic stress disrupts the action–outcome learning underlying adaptive agency and promotes the formation of inflexible habits. We found that the projection from the basolateral amygdala to the dorsomedial striatum is activated by rewarding events to support the action–outcome learning needed for flexible, goal-directed decision-making. Chronic stress attenuates this to disrupt action–outcome learning and, therefore, agency. Conversely, the projection from the central amygdala to the dorsomedial striatum mediates habit formation. Following stress, this pathway is progressively recruited to learning to promote the premature formation of inflexible habits. Thus, stress exerts opposing effects on two amygdala–striatal pathways to disrupt agency and promote habit. These data provide neuronal circuit insights into how chronic stress shapes learning and decision-making, and help understanding of how stress can lead to the disrupted decision-making and pathological habits that characterize substance use disorders and mental health conditions. Adaptive decision-making often requires an understanding of our agency in a situation; however, chronic stress can disrupt agency and promote inflexible, habitual behaviour by turning off a brain pathway needed for agency and activating one that promotes habit.",

    "abstract": "Quantum networks that distribute entanglement among remote nodes will unlock transformational technologies in quantum computing, communication and sensing1–4. However, state-of-the-art networks5–14 use only a single optically addressed qubit per node; this constrains both the quantum communication bandwidth and memory resources, greatly impeding scalability. Solid-state platforms15–24 provide a valuable resource for multiplexed quantum networking in which multiple spectrally distinguishable qubits can be hosted in nano-scale volumes. Here we harness this resource by implementing a two-node network consisting of several rare-earth ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities25–31. This is accomplished with a protocol that entangles distinguishable 171Yb ions through frequency-erasing photon detection combined with real-time quantum feedforward. This method is robust to slow optical frequency fluctuations occurring on timescales longer than a single entanglement attempt: a universal challenge amongst solid-state emitters. We demonstrate the enhanced functionality of these multi-emitter nodes in two ways. First, we mitigate the bottlenecks to the entanglement distribution rate through multiplexed entanglement of two remote ion pairs32,33. Second, we prepare multipartite W-states comprising three distinguishable ions as a resource for advanced quantum networking protocols34,35. These results lay the groundwork for scalable quantum networking based on rare-earth ions. Multiplexed entanglement distribution in a quantum network, with each node comprising multiple solid-state emitters in nanophotonic cavities, enables scalable quantum communication.",

    "abstract": "Tropical deforestation was found to cause large reductions in precipitation using a range of observation-based datasets1. However, the limitations of satellite-based space-for-time statistical analysis have hindered understanding of the roles of reshaped mesoscale atmospheric circulation and regional precipitation recycling at different scales. These effects are considered nonlocal effects, which are distinct from the local effects governed by deforestation-induced reductions in evapotranspiration (ET). Here we show reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation across wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, deforested grids experienced a noteworthy increase in precipitation (0.96 mm month−1 per percentage point forest loss), primarily attributed to enhanced mesoscale atmospheric circulation (that is, nonlocal effect). These nonlocal increases weaken with distance from deforested grids, leading to significant precipitation reductions in buffers beyond 60 km. Conversely, during the dry season, precipitation decreases in deforested grids and throughout all analysis buffers, with local effects from reduced ET dominating. Our findings highlight the intricate balance between local effects and nonlocal effects in driving deforestation–precipitation responses across different seasons and scales and emphasize the urgent need to address the rapid and extensive loss of forest in the Amazon region. Reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation show that deforestation leads to precipitation increases in the wet season and decreases in the dry season.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian behaviour and physiology undergo major changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their needs and start showing nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions at weaning and puberty, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviours develop during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioural control have been identified1–6. These data show a marked diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioural or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including early diversification, perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and refinement of signalling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide new insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviours and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life. Paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling are used to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, including cell types with key roles in physiological and social behaviour functions have been identified.",

    "abstract": "More than ten ergot alkaloids comprising both natural and semi-synthetic products are used to treat various diseases1,2. The central C ring forms the core pharmacophore for ergot alkaloids, giving them structural similarity to neurotransmitters, thus enabling their modulation of neurotransmitter receptors3. The haem catalase chanoclavine synthase (EasC) catalyses the construction of this ring through complex radical oxidative cyclization4. Unlike canonical catalases, which catalyse H2O2 disproportionation5,6, EasC and its homologues represent a broader class of catalases that catalyse O2-dependent radical reactions4,7. We have elucidated the structure of EasC by cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH)-binding pocket and a haem pocket common to all haem catalases, with a unique homodimeric architecture that is, to our knowledge, previously unobserved. The substrate prechanoclavine unprecedentedly binds in the NADPH-binding pocket, instead of the previously suspected haem-binding pocket, and two pockets were connected by a slender tunnel. Contrary to the established mechanisms, EasC uses superoxide rather than the more generally used transient haem iron–oxygen complexes (such as compounds I, II and III)8,9, to mediate substrate transformation through superoxide-mediated cooperative catalysis of the two distant pockets. We propose that this reactive oxygen species mechanism could be widespread in metalloenzyme-catalysed reactions. The unique structure and mechanism of chanoclavine synthase (EasC), a haem catalase that uses superoxide for substrate transformation in ergot alkaloid biosynthesis, are revealed in this study, challenging established catalase mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics1–6. Experimental efforts so far have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials—typically amorphous metals—and semiconducting quantum Hall7–11 or quantum anomalous Hall12,13 systems. However, the strong interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes14–17. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials in which the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling ν = −1 as well as a superconducting state at ν ≈ −3.5 at zero magnetic field. Gate voltage can also be used to actuate non-volatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state18, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further show a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at ν = 2/3 (ref. 19)—also stable at zero magnetic field—enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers20–22, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket20–24, while leaving the topology of the ν = −1 quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for a new generation of hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low disorder limit. Rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts gate-tunable superconductivity and quantized anomalous Hall states, and thermodynamic compressibility measurements further show a fractional Chern insulator at zero magnetic field, paving the way for new hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states.",

    "abstract": "Peptide hormones, a class of pharmacologically active molecules, have a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis. Prohormone convertase 1/3 (also known as PCSK1/3) represents a key enzymatic mechanism in peptide processing, as exemplified with the therapeutic target glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)1,2. However, the full spectrum of peptides generated by PCSK1 and their functional roles remain largely unknown. Here we use computational drug discovery to systematically map more than 2,600 previously uncharacterized human proteolytic peptide fragments cleaved by prohormone convertases, enabling the identification of novel bioactive peptides. Using this approach, we identified a 12-mer peptide, BRINP2-related peptide (BRP). When administered pharmacologically, BRP reduces food intake and exhibits anti-obesity effects in mice and pigs without inducing nausea or aversion. Mechanistically, BRP administration triggers central FOS activation and acts independently of leptin, GLP-1 receptor and melanocortin 4 receptor. Together, these data introduce a method to identify new bioactive peptides and establish pharmacologically that BRP may be useful for therapeutic modulation of body weight. Computational drug discovery is used to identify a 12-mer peptide derived from BRINP2 with potent anti-obesity effects that are independent of leptin, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and melanocortin 4 receptor.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal plasticity has been extensively described in advanced epithelial cancers; however, its functional role in malignant progression is controversial1–5. The function of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell plasticity in tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution is poorly understood. Here we clarify the contribution of EMT to malignant progression in pancreatic cancer. We used somatic mosaic genome engineering technologies to trace and ablate malignant mesenchymal lineages along the EMT continuum. The experimental evidence clarifies the essential contribution of mesenchymal lineages to pancreatic cancer evolution. Spatial genomic analysis, single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of EMT clarifies its contribution to the emergence of genomic instability, including events of chromothripsis. Genetic ablation of mesenchymal lineages robustly abolished these mutational processes and evolutionary patterns, as confirmed by cross-species analysis of pancreatic and other human solid tumours. Mechanistically, we identified that malignant cells with mesenchymal features display increased chromatin accessibility, particularly in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions, in turn resulting in delayed mitosis and catastrophic cell division. Thus, EMT favours the emergence of genomic-unstable, highly fit tumour cells, which strongly supports the concept of cell-state-restricted patterns of evolution, whereby cancer cell speciation is propagated to progeny within restricted functional compartments. Restraining the evolutionary routes through ablation of clones capable of mesenchymal plasticity, and extinction of the derived lineages, halts the malignant potential of one of the most aggressive forms of human cancer. Malignant cells with mesenchymal features display increased chromatin accessibility, particularly in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions, in turn resulting in delayed mitosis and catastrophic cell division.",

    "abstract": "Lymphatic capillaries continuously take up interstitial fluid and adapt to resulting changes in vessel calibre1–3. The mechanisms by which the permeable monolayer of loosely connected lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)4 maintains mechanical stability remain elusive. Here we identify dynamic cytoskeletal regulation of LEC shape, induced by isotropic stretch, as crucial for the integrity and function of dermal lymphatic capillaries. We found that the oak leaf-shaped LECs showed a spectrum of VE-cadherin-based junctional configurations at the lobular intercellular interface and a unique cytoskeletal organization, with microtubules at concave regions and F-actin at convex lobes. Multispectral and longitudinal intravital imaging of capillary LEC shape and actin revealed dynamic remodelling of cellular overlaps in vivo during homeostasis and in response to interstitial fluid volume increase. Akin to puzzle cells of the plant epidermis5,6, LEC shape was controlled by Rho GTPase CDC42-regulated cytoskeletal dynamics, enhancing monolayer stability. Moreover, cyclic isotropic stretch increased cellular overlaps and junction curvature in primary LECs. Our findings indicate that capillary LEC shape results from continuous remodelling of cellular overlaps that maintain vessel integrity while preserving permeable cell–cell contacts compatible with vessel expansion and fluid uptake. We propose a bellows-like fluid propulsion mechanism, in which fluid-induced lumen expansion and shrinkage of LEC overlaps are countered by actin-based lamellipodia-like overlap extension to aid vessel constriction. Dynamic cytoskeletal regulation of lymphatic endothelial cell shape, induced by isotropic stretch and crucial for dermal lymphatic capillary function, is identified and found to result from continuous remodelling of cellular overlaps that maintain vessel integrity.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress remodels brain homeostasis, in which persistent change leads to depressive disorders1. As a key modulator of brain homeostasis2, it remains elusive whether and how brain autophagy is engaged in stress dynamics. Here we discover that acute stress activates, whereas chronic stress suppresses, autophagy mainly in the lateral habenula (LHb). Systemic administration of distinct antidepressant drugs similarly restores autophagy function in the LHb, suggesting LHb autophagy as a common antidepressant target. Genetic ablation of LHb neuronal autophagy promotes stress susceptibility, whereas enhancing LHb autophagy exerts rapid antidepressant-like effects. LHb autophagy controls neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity by means of on-demand degradation of glutamate receptors. Collectively, this study shows a causal role of LHb autophagy in maintaining emotional homeostasis against stress. Disrupted LHb autophagy is implicated in the maladaptation to chronic stress, and its reversal by autophagy enhancers provides a new antidepressant strategy. Acute stress activates autophagy in the lateral habenula, whereas chronic stress suppresses it, with this autophagy having a causal role in maintaining emotional homeostasis against stress, and its restoration through autophagy enhancers offers a novel antidepressant strategy.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of neural circuits makes it challenging to decipher the brain’s algorithms of intelligence. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have produced models that accurately simulate brain activity, enhancing our understanding of the brain’s computational objectives and neural coding. However, it is difficult for such models to generalize beyond their training distribution, limiting their utility. The emergence of foundation models1 trained on vast datasets has introduced a new artificial intelligence paradigm with remarkable generalization capabilities. Here we collected large amounts of neural activity from visual cortices of multiple mice and trained a foundation model to accurately predict neuronal responses to arbitrary natural videos. This model generalized to new mice with minimal training and successfully predicted responses across various new stimulus domains, such as coherent motion and noise patterns. Beyond neural response prediction, the model also accurately predicted anatomical cell types, dendritic features and neuronal connectivity within the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset2. Our work is a crucial step towards building foundation models of the brain. As neuroscience accumulates larger, multimodal datasets, foundation models will reveal statistical regularities, enable rapid adaptation to new tasks and accelerate research. A foundation model trained on neural activity of visual cortex from multiple mice accurately predicts responses to video stimuli and cell types, dendritic features and connectivity within the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset.",

    "abstract": "Existing wearable technologies rely on physical coupling to the body to establish optical1,2, fluidic3,4, thermal5,6 and/or mechanical7,8 measurement interfaces. Here we present a class of wearable device platforms that instead relies on physical decoupling to define an enclosed chamber immediately adjacent to the skin surface. Streams of vapourized molecular substances that pass out of or into the skin alter the properties of the microclimate defined in this chamber in ways that can be precisely quantified using an integrated collection of wireless sensors. A programmable, bistable valve dynamically controls access to the surrounding environment, thereby creating a transient response that can be quantitatively related to the inward and outward fluxes of the targeted species by analysing the time-dependent readings from the sensors. The systems reported here offer unique capabilities in measuring the flux of water vapour, volatile organic compounds and carbon dioxide from various locations on the body, each with distinct relevance to clinical care and/or exposure to hazardous vapours. Studies of healing processes associated with dermal wounds in models of healthy and diabetic mice and of responses in models using infected wounds reveal characteristic flux variations that provide important insights, particularly in scenarios in which the non-contact operation of the devices avoids potential damage to fragile tissues. A non-contact wearable device that defines and modulates a microclimate adjacent to the skin can measure incoming and outgoing streams of vapourized substances, offering valuable insights into physiological health, wound healing and environmental exposures.",

    "abstract": "Ceria nanoparticles supported on alumina are widely used in various catalytic reactions, particularly in conjunction with platinum group metals (PGMs)1–9. Here we found that treating these catalysts at temperatures between 750 and about 1,000 °C in the presence of CO and NO in steam (reactive treatment under reducing atmosphere) leads to the dispersion of ceria nanoparticles into high-density 2D (roughly one atomic layer thin) CexOy domains, as confirmed by microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These domains, which densely cover the alumina, exhibit substantially enhanced oxygen mobility and storage capacity, facilitating easier extraction of oxygen and the formation of Ce3+ sites and oxygen vacancies. As a result, these catalysts—whether with or without PGMs, such as Rh and Pt—show improved activity for several industrially important catalytic reactions, including NO and N2O reduction, as well as CO and NO oxidation, even after exposure to harsh ageing conditions. This study shows a catalyst architecture with superior redox properties under conditions that typically cause sintering, offering a pathway to more efficient metal–ceria catalysts for enhanced general catalysis.  Treatment of supported ceria nanoparticles at high temperature in gasoline vehicle exhaust/steam results in their dispersion into atomically thin oxide domains with enhanced oxygen mobility and storage capacity.",

    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to foreign antigens in food and commensal microorganisms with potential to induce adaptive immune responses. Peripherally induced T regulatory (pTreg) cells are essential for mitigating inflammatory responses to these agents1–4. Although RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have been shown to programme gut microbiota-specific pTreg cells5–7, their definition remains incomplete, and the APC responsible for food tolerance has remained unknown. Here we identify an APC subset that is required for differentiation of both food- and microbiota-specific pTreg cells and for establishment of oral tolerance. Development and function of these APCs require expression of the transcription factors PRDM16 and RORγt, as well as a unique Rorc(t) cis-regulatory element. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and surface marker analysis establish the pTreg-inducing APCs as myeloid in origin, distinct from type 3 innate lymphoid cells, and sharing epigenetic profiles with classical dendritic cells, and designate them PRDM16+RORγt+ tolerizing dendritic cells (tolDCs). Upon genetic perturbation of tolDCs, we observe a substantial increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 cells in lieu of pTreg cells, leading to compromised tolerance in mouse models of asthma and food allergy. Single-cell analyses of freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, as well as multiple specimens of human intestine and tonsil, reveal candidate tolDCs with co-expression of PRDM16 and RORC and an extensive transcriptome shared with tolDCs from mice, highlighting an evolutionarily conserved role across species. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of how tolDCs develop and how they regulate T cell responses to food and microbial antigens could offer new insights into developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as organ transplant tolerance. A subset of antigen-presenting cells of myeloid origin that require PRDM16 and RORγt regulates T cell function to enable immune tolerance of food and commensal gut microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Sensitive methods for detection of cell-free RNA (cfRNA) could facilitate non-invasive gene expression profiling and monitoring of diseases1–6. Here we describe RARE-seq (random priming and affinity capture of cfRNA fragments for enrichment analysis by sequencing), a method optimized for cfRNA analysis. We demonstrate that platelet contamination can substantially confound cfRNA analyses and develop an approach to overcome it. In analytical validations, we find RARE-seq to be approximately 50-fold more sensitive for detecting tumour-derived cfRNA than whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with a limit of detection of 0.05%. To explore clinical utility, we profiled 437 plasma samples from 369 individuals with cancer or non-malignant conditions and controls. Detection of non-small-cell lung cancer expression signatures in cfRNA increased with stage (6 out of 20 (30%) in stage I; 5 out of 8 (63%) in stage II; 10 out of 15 (67%) in stage III; 80 out of 96 (83% sensitivity) in stage IV at 95% specificity) and RARE-seq was more sensitive than tumour-naive circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis. In patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer who developed resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we detected both histological transformation and mutation-based resistance mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the potential utility of RARE-seq for determination of tissue of origin, assessing benign pulmonary conditions and tracking response to mRNA vaccines. These results highlight the potential value of ultrasensitive cfRNA analysis and provide proof of concept for diverse clinical applications. A method, RARE-seq, for sensitive detection of cell-free RNAs in blood is demonstrated to have diverse clinical applications including diagnosing and characterizing human cancers, and tracking response to RNA therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of ferrocene1 heralded the advent of modern organometallic chemistry. Characterized by the π-coordination of a metal by one or two planar annulene anions, ferrocenes and their analogues2–4 exemplify the archetype of out-of-plane annulene metal complexes. By contrast, the integration of metal within the annulene core to form in-plane annulene metal complexes featuring metal–carbon σ bonds has been obstructed not only by the synthetic difficulty and the non-planarity of annulenes with appropriate internal dimensions, but also by the difficulty of embedding the metal. These challenges have prevented the isolation of such in-plane annulene metal complexes. Here we report the preparation of three metal-centred planar [15]annulene frameworks. The most symmetrical fragment has D5h symmetry, with the metal centre shared by five identical five-membered rings. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that metal d orbitals participate in conjugation with these five-membered rings, rendering all of them aromatic. The overall framework bears a loose structural and spectroscopic analogy to metallo-expanded porphyrins with multiple aza donors5, which thus provides a nexus between annulene chemistry and classic heteroatom-based coordination chemistry. The present systems display high stability and are easily functionalized. We thus suggest that metal-centred planar annulenes could emerge as promising building blocks for materials science. An aromatic metallo-annulene, comprising a 15-carbon macrocycle enclosing an osmium complex, with the metal residing within the plane of the macrocycle is reported.",

    "abstract": "Matrix-derived biophysical cues are known to regulate the activation of fibroblasts and their subsequent transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts1–6, but whether modulation of these signals can suppress fibrosis in intact tissues remains unclear, particularly in the cardiovascular system7–10. Here we demonstrate across multiple scales that inhibition of matrix mechanosensing in persistently activated cardiac fibroblasts potentiates—in concert with soluble regulators of the TGFβ pathway—a robust transcriptomic, morphological and metabolic shift towards quiescence. By conducting a meta-analysis of public human and mouse single-cell sequencing datasets, we identify the focal-adhesion-associated tyrosine kinase SRC as a fibroblast-enriched mechanosensor that can be targeted selectively in stromal cells to mimic the effects of matrix softening in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of SRC by saracatinib, coupled with TGFβ suppression, induces synergistic repression of key profibrotic gene programs in fibroblasts, characterized by a marked inhibition of the MRTF–SRF pathway, which is not seen after treatment with either drug alone. Importantly, the dual treatment alleviates contractile dysfunction in fibrotic engineered heart tissues and in a mouse model of heart failure. Our findings point to joint inhibition of SRC-mediated stromal mechanosensing and TGFβ signalling as a potential mechanotherapeutic strategy for treating cardiovascular fibrosis. Inhibition of a cardiac stroma-enriched mechanosensor, SRC—in concert with suppression of the TGFβ pathway—potentiates the reversal of fibroblast activation and alleviates contractile dysfunction in fibrotic hearts.",

Root systems can adapt to contrasting soil conditions and stresses, yet how their responses are programmed at the individual cell scale remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic approaches, we showed major expression changes in outer root cell types when comparing the single-cell transcriptomes of rice roots grown in gel versus soil conditions. These tissue-specific transcriptional responses are related to nutrient homeostasis, cell wall integrity and defence in response to heterogeneous soil versus homogeneous gel growth conditions. We also demonstrate how the model soil stress, termed compaction, triggers expression changes in cell wall remodelling and barrier formation in outer and inner root tissues, regulated by abscisic acid released from phloem cells. Our study reveals how root tissues communicate and adapt to contrasting soil conditions at single-cell resolution.

    "abstract": "Climate extremes are escalating under anthropogenic climate change1. Yet, how this translates into unprecedented cumulative extreme event exposure in a person’s lifetime remains unclear. Here we use climate models, impact models and demographic data to project the number of people experiencing cumulative lifetime exposure to climate extremes above the 99.99th percentile of exposure expected in a pre-industrial climate. We project that the birth cohort fraction facing this unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves, crop failures, river floods, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones will at least double from 1960 to 2020 under current mitigation policies aligned with a global warming pathway reaching 2.7 °C above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100. Under a 1.5 °C pathway, 52% of people born in 2020 will experience unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves. If global warming reaches 3.5 °C by 2100, this fraction rises to 92% for heatwaves, 29% for crop failures and 14% for river floods. The chance of facing unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves is substantially larger among population groups characterized by high socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Our results call for deep and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reductions to lower the burden of climate change on current young generations. Climate models, impact models and demographic data are used to estimate the number of people projected to experience unprecedented lifetime exposure to extreme climate events across multiple dimensions, including birth year, warming scenario and vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "High-capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a critical role as power sources across diverse applications, including portable electronics, electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable-energy-storage systems1. However, there is growing concern about the safety of integrated LIB systems, with reports of up to 9,486 incidents between 2020 and 2024 (ref. 2). To ensure the safe application of commercial LIBs, it is essential to capture internal signals that enable early failure diagnosis and warning. Monitoring non-uniform temperature and strain distributions within the jelly-roll structures of the battery provides a promising approach to achieving this goal3,4. Here we propose a miniaturized and low-power-consumption system capable of accurate sensing and wireless transmission of internal temperature and strain signals inside LIBs, with negligible influence on its performance. The acquisition of internal temperature signals and the area ratio between initial internal-short-circuited regions and battery electrodes enables quantitative analysis of thermal fusing and thermal runaway phenomena, leading to the evaluation of the intensity of battery thermal runaway and recognition of thermal abuse behaviours. This work provides a foundation for designing next-generation smart LIBs with safety warning and failure positioning capabilities. A miniaturized and low-power-consumption system is designed to allow the accurate sensing and wireless transmission of internal temperature and strain signals inside lithium-ion batteries with negligible influence on their performance, improving their safety.",

    "abstract": "The anti-tumour effect of radiotherapy beyond the treatment field—the abscopal effect—has garnered much interest1. However, the potentially deleterious effect of radiation in promoting metastasis is less well studied. Here we show that radiotherapy induces the expression of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin in tumour cells, which reprogrammes EGFR-expressing myeloid cells toward an immunosuppressive phenotype and reduces phagocytosis. This stimulates distant metastasis growth in human patients and in pre-clinical mouse tumour models. The inhibition of these tumour-promoting factors induced by radiotherapy may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve patient outcomes. Radiotherapy induces expression of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin, which promotes metastasis growth at remote sites in mouse models and human patients by shifting myeloid cells towards an immunosuppressive state.",

    "abstract": "When two massive objects (black holes, neutron stars or stars) in our universe fly past each other, their gravitational interactions deflect their trajectories1,2. The gravitational waves emitted in the related bound-orbit system—the binary inspiral—are now routinely detected by gravitational-wave observatories3. Theoretical physics needs to provide high-precision templates to make use of unprecedented sensitivity and precision of the data from upcoming gravitational-wave observatories4. Motivated by this challenge, several analytical and numerical techniques have been developed to approximately solve this gravitational two-body problem. Although numerical relativity is accurate5–7, it is too time-consuming to rapidly produce large numbers of gravitational-wave templates. For this, approximate analytical results are also required8–15. Here we report on a new, highest-precision analytical result for the scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a black hole or neutron star scattering encounter at the fifth order in Newton’s gravitational coupling G, assuming a hierarchy in the two masses. This is achieved by modifying state-of-the-art techniques for the scattering of elementary particles in colliders to this classical physics problem in our universe. Our results show that mathematical functions related to Calabi–Yau (CY) manifolds, 2n-dimensional generalizations of tori, appear in the solution to the radiated energy in these scatterings. We anticipate that our analytical results will allow the development of a new generation of gravitational-wave models, for which the transition to the bound-state problem through analytic continuation and strong-field resummation will need to be performed. A new, highest-precision analytical result for solving the gravitational two-body problem of black hole or neutron star scattering reveals the emergence of Calabi–Yau manifolds in the solution to the radiated energy in these encounters.",

    "abstract": "Five years before the 2022 multi-country mpox outbreak, Nigeria and Cameroon reported their first cases in more than three decades1,2. Whereas the outbreak in Nigeria is recognized as an ongoing human epidemic, the drivers of the resurgence in Cameroon remain unclear3,4. The rate of zoonoses remains uncertain in both countries, and gaps in genomic data obscure the timing and zoonotic and geographic origin of monkeypox virus (MPXV) emergence in humans. Here, to address these uncertainties, we sequenced 118 MPXV genomes isolated from cases in Nigeria and Cameroon between 2018 and 2023. We show that in contrast to cases in Nigeria, cases in Cameroon are the result of repeated zoonoses, with two distinct zoonotic lineages circulating across the Nigeria–Cameroon border. Our findings suggest that shared animal populations in the cross-border forest ecosystems drive the emergence and spread of the virus. Accordingly, we identify the closest zoonotic outgroup to the Nigerian human epidemic lineage (hMPXV-1) in a southern Nigerian border state. We estimate that the shared ancestor of the zoonotic outgroup and hMPXV-1 circulated in animals in southern Nigeria in late 2013. We find that hMPXV-1 emerged in humans in August 2014 in the southern Rivers State and circulated undetected for three years. Rivers State was the main source of viral spread during the human epidemic. Our study sheds light on the recent establishment of MPXV in the human population and highlights the risk of persistent zoonotic emergence of MPXV in the complex border regions of Cameroon and Nigeria. Monkeypox virus genomic data from Nigeria and Cameroon, sampled between 2018 and 2023, indicate that the virus spread through repeated zoonoses in Cameroon, whereas in Nigeria, it spread mainly through human–human transmission, predominantly originating in Rivers State.",

    "abstract": "Specialized immune cells that reside in tissues orchestrate diverse biological functions by communicating with parenchymal cells1. The contribution of the innate immune compartment in the meninges and the central nervous system (CNS) is well-characterized; however, whether cells of the adaptive immune system reside in the brain and are involved in maintaining homeostasis is unclear2–4. Here we show that the subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain is a nucleus for parenchymal αβ T cells in the steady-state brain in both mice and humans. Using unbiased transcriptomics, we show that these extravascular T cells in the brain are distinct from meningeal T cells: they secrete IFNγ robustly and express tissue-residence proteins such as CXCR6, which are required for their retention in the brain and for normal adaptive behaviour. These T cells are primed in the periphery by the microbiome, and traffic from the white adipose and gastrointestinal tissues to the brain. Once established, their numbers can be modulated by alterations to either the gut microbiota or the composition of adipose tissue. In summary, we find that CD4 T cells reside in the brain at steady state and are anatomically concentrated in the SFO in mice and humans; that they are transcriptionally and functionally distinct from meningeal T cells; and that they secrete IFNγ to maintain CNS homeostasis through homeostatic fat–brain and gut–brain axes. A distinct population of CD4 T cells resides in specific regions of the steady-state brain, and these T cells are programmed in the periphery by the microbiome to coordinate adaptive behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Lattice gauge theories (LGTs)1–4 can be used to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials5–7. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging, as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits8–10. Here we investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${{\\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$\n                \n               LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit that prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics by means of a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT, from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement, the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, whereas for strong confinement, transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen11,12. We also demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a new set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics. In a quantum simulation of a (2+1)D lattice gauge theory using a superconducting quantum processor, the dynamics of strings reveal the transition from deconfined to confined excitations as the effective electric field is increased.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the causes of past atmospheric methane (CH4) variability is important for characterizing the relationship between CH4, global climate and terrestrial biogeochemical cycling. Ice core records of atmospheric CH4 contain rapid variations linked to abrupt climate changes of the last glacial period known as Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) events and Heinrich events (HE)1,2. The drivers of these CH4 variations remain unknown but can be constrained with ice core measurements of the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric CH4, which is sensitive to the strength of different isotopically distinguishable emission categories (microbial, pyrogenic and geologic)3–5. Here we present multi-decadal-scale measurements of δ13C–CH4 and δD–CH4 from the WAIS Divide and Talos Dome ice cores and identify abrupt 1‰ enrichments in δ13C–CH4 synchronous with HE CH4 pulses and 0.5‰ δ13C–CH4 enrichments synchronous with DO CH4 increases. δD–CH4 varied little across the abrupt CH4 changes. Using box models to interpret these isotopic shifts6 and assuming a constant δ13C–CH4 of microbial emissions, we propose that abrupt shifts in tropical rainfall associated with HEs and DO events enhanced 13C-enriched pyrogenic CH4 emissions, and by extension global wildfire extent, by 90–150%. Carbon cycle box modelling experiments7 suggest that the resulting released terrestrial carbon could have caused from one-third to all of the abrupt CO2 increases associated with HEs. These findings suggest that fire regimes and the terrestrial carbon cycle varied contemporaneously and substantially with past abrupt climate changes of the last glacial period. An increase in wildfire extent and related greenhouse gas emissions can be linked to abrupt climatic changes during the last glacial period.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments, termed niches, at several different locations in tissues1–3. The differential functions of heterogeneous stem cells and niches are important given the increasing clinical applications of stem-cell transplantation and immunotherapy. Whether hierarchical structures among stem cells at distinct niches exist and further control aspects of immune tolerance is unknown. Here we describe previously unknown new hierarchical arrangements in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow niches that dictate both regenerative potential and immune privilege. High-level nitric oxide-generating (NOhi) HSCs are refractory to immune attack and exhibit delayed albeit robust long-term reconstitution. Such highly immune-privileged, primitive NOhi HSCs co-localize with distinctive capillaries characterized by primary ciliated endothelium and high levels of the immune-checkpoint molecule CD200. These capillaries regulate the regenerative functions of NOhi HSCs through the ciliary protein IFT20 together with CD200, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and autophagy signals, which further mediate immunoprotection. Notably, previously described niche constituents, sinusoidal cells and type-H vessels2–10 co-localize with less immune-privileged and less potent NOlow HSCs. Together, we identify highly immune-privileged, late-rising primitive HSCs and characterize their immunoprotective niches comprising specialized vascular domains. Our results indicate that the niche orchestrates hierarchy in stem cells and immune tolerance, and highlight future immunotherapeutic targets. Previously undescribed hierarchical arrangements in haematopoietic stem cells and their niches that mediate both regenerative potential and immune privilege are identified.",

    "abstract": "Proximity ferroelectricity is an interface-associated phenomenon in electric-field-driven polarization reversal in a non-ferroelectric polar material induced by one or more adjacent ferroelectric materials. Here we report proximity ferroelectricity in wurtzite ferroelectric heterostructures. In the present case, the non-ferroelectric layers are AlN and ZnO, whereas the ferroelectric layers are Al1−xBxN, Al1−xScxN and Zn1−xMgxO. The layered structures include nitride–nitride, oxide–oxide and nitride–oxide stacks that feature two-layer (asymmetric) and three-layer (symmetric) configurations1–3. Ferroelectric switching in both layers is validated by multimodal characterization methods, including polarization hysteresis, anisotropic chemical etching, second harmonic generation, piezo response force microscopy, electromechanical testing and atomic resolution polarization orientation imaging in real space by scanning transmission electron microscopy. We present a physical switching model in which antipolar nuclei originate in the ferroelectric layer and propagate towards the internal non-ferroelectric interface. The domain wall leading edge produces elastic and electric fields that extend beyond the interface at close proximity, reducing the switching barrier in the non-ferroelectric layer, and allowing complete domain propagation without breakdown. Density functional theory calculations of polymorph energies, reversal barriers and domain wall energies support this model. Proximity ferroelectricity enables polarization reversal in wurtzites without the chemical or structural disorder that accompanies elemental substitution, opening new questions and opportunities regarding interface-based ferroelectricity. Proximity ferroelectricity is reported in wurtzite heterostructures, which enables polarization reversal in wurtzites without the chemical or structural disorder that accompanies elemental substitution.",

    "abstract": "The oxygen-sensitive molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase of Azotobacter vinelandii is protected from oxidative damage by a reversible ‘switch-off’ mechanism1. It forms a complex with a small ferredoxin, FeSII (ref. 2) or the ‘Shethna protein II’3, which acts as an O2 sensor and associates with the two component proteins of nitrogenase when its [2Fe:2S] cluster becomes oxidized4,5. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the protective ternary complex of the catalytic subunit of Mo-nitrogenase, its cognate reductase and the FeSII protein, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The dimeric FeSII protein associates with two copies of each component to assemble a 620 kDa core complex that then polymerizes into large, filamentous structures. This complex is catalytically inactive, but the enzyme components are quickly released and reactivated upon oxygen depletion. The first step in complex formation is the association of FeSII with the more O2-sensitive Fe protein component of nitrogenase during sudden oxidative stress. The action of this small ferredoxin represents a straightforward means of protection from O2 that may be crucial for the maintenance of recombinant nitrogenase in food crops. A small ferredoxin (Shethna protein II) of Azotobacter vinelandii can provide protection from O2 stress that may be crucial for the maintenance of recombinant nitrogenase in food crops.",

In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside two dimensions, has been considered6 but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons7–9. Here we show that non-trivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particle obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles that naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions, in which free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and are notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems and—more speculatively—the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particle. By developing a second quantization of paraparticles and constructing exactly solvable quantum spin models with emergent paraparticles, new theoretical evidence shows that non-trivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems.",

    "abstract": "Roman writers found the relative empowerment of Celtic women remarkable1. In southern Britain, the Late Iron Age Durotriges tribe often buried women with substantial grave goods2. Here we analyse 57 ancient genomes from Durotrigian burial sites and find an extended kin group centred around a single maternal lineage, with unrelated (presumably inward migrating) burials being predominantly male. Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines. Patterns of haplotype sharing reveal that British Iron Age populations form fine-grained geographical clusters with southern links extending across the channel to the continent. Indeed, whereas most of Britain shows majority genomic continuity from the Early Bronze Age to the Iron Age, this is markedly reduced in a southern coastal core region with persistent cross-channel cultural exchange3. This southern core has evidence of population influx in the Middle Bronze Age but also during the Iron Age. This is asynchronous with the rest of the island and points towards a staged, geographically granular absorption of continental influence, possibly including the acquisition of Celtic languages. An analysis of ancient mitochondrial and nuclear DNA shows evidence of matrilocal communities in Iron Age Britain.",

    "abstract": "Argonaute proteins are categorized into AGO and PIWI clades. Across most animal species, AGO-clade proteins are widely expressed in various cell types, and regulate normal gene expression1. By contrast, PIWI-clade proteins predominantly function during gametogenesis to suppress transposons and ensure fertility1,2. Both clades use nucleic acid guides for target recognition by means of base pairing, crucial for initiating target silencing, often through direct cleavage. AGO-clade proteins use a narrow channel to secure a tight guide–target interaction3. By contrast, PIWI proteins feature a wider channel that potentially allows mismatches during pairing, broadening target silencing capability4,5. However, the mechanism of PIWI-mediated target cleavage remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that after target binding, PIWI proteins undergo a conformational change from an ‘open’ state to a ‘locked’ state, facilitating base pairing and enhancing target cleavage efficiency. This transition involves narrowing of the binding channel and repositioning of the PIWI-interacting RNA–target duplex towards the MID-PIWI lobe, establishing extensive contacts for duplex stabilization. During this transition, we also identify an intermediate ‘comma-shaped’ conformation, which might recruit GTSF1, a known auxiliary protein that enhances PIWI cleavage activity6. GTSF1 facilitates the transition to the locked state by linking the PIWI domain to the RNA duplex, thereby expediting the conformational change critical for efficient target cleavage. These findings explain the molecular mechanisms underlying PIWI–PIWI-interacting RNA complex function in target RNA cleavage, providing insights into how dynamic conformational changes from PIWI proteins coordinate cofactors to safeguard gametogenesis. After target binding, PIWI proteins undergo a conformational change from ‘open’ to ‘locked’, facilitating base pairing and enhancing target cleavage efficiency, providing insights into how dynamic conformational changes from PIWI coordinate cofactors to safeguard gametogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient acquisition is crucial for sustaining life. Plants develop beneficial intracellular partnerships with arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria to surmount the scarcity of soil nutrients and tap into atmospheric dinitrogen, respectively1,2. Initiation of these root endosymbioses requires symbiont-induced oscillations in nuclear calcium (Ca2+) concentrations in root cells3. How the nuclear-localized ion channels, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) 15 and DOESN’T MAKE INFECTIONS1 (DMI1)4 are coordinated to specify symbiotic-induced nuclear Ca2+ oscillations remains unknown. Here we discovered an autoactive CNGC15 mutant that generates spontaneous low-frequency Ca2+ oscillations. While CNGC15 produces nuclear Ca2+ oscillations via a gating mechanism involving its helix 1, DMI1 acts as a pacemaker to specify the frequency of the oscillations. We demonstrate that the specificity of symbiotic-induced nuclear Ca2+ oscillations is encoded in its frequency. A high frequency activates endosymbiosis programmes, whereas a low frequency modulates phenylpropanoid pathways. Consequently, the autoactive cngc15 mutant, which is capable of generating both frequencies, has increased flavonoids that enhance AM, root nodule symbiosis and nutrient acquisition. We transferred this trait to wheat, resulting in field-grown wheat with increased AM colonization and nutrient acquisition. Our findings reveal a new strategy to boost endosymbiosis in the field and reduce inorganic fertilizer use while sustaining plant growth. Nuclear calcium oscillations initiate plant–arbuscular mycorrhiza and nitrogen-fixing bacteria symbioses for nutrient acquisition, with a newly discovered autoactive CNGC15 mutant enhancing these partnerships, potentially improving crop nutrition and reducing inorganic fertilizer dependence.",

    "abstract": "Realizing quantum control and entanglement of particles is crucial for advancing both quantum technologies and fundamental science. Substantial developments in this domain have been achieved in a variety of systems1–5. In this context, ultracold polar molecules offer new and unique opportunities because of their more complex internal structure associated with vibration and rotation, coupled with the existence of long-range interactions6,7. However, the same properties make molecules highly sensitive to their environment8–10, affecting their coherence and utility in some applications. Here we show that by engineering an exceptionally controlled environment using rotationally magic11,12 optical tweezers, we can achieve long-lived entanglement between pairs of molecules using detectable hertz-scale interactions.

The extension of precise quantum control to complex molecular systems will enable their additional degrees of freedom to be exploited across many domains of quantum science15–17.

Although chorus waves have attracted extreme interest and been intensively studied for decades4–7, their generation and evolution remain highly debated7. Here, in contrast to the conventional expectation that chorus waves are governed by planetary magnetic dipolar fields5,7, we report observations of repetitive, rising-tone chorus waves in the terrestrial neutral sheet, where the effects of the magnetic dipole are absent. Using high-cadence data from NASA’s MMS mission, we present ultrafast measurements of the wave fields and three-dimensional electron distributions within the waves, which provides evidence for chorus–electron interactions and the development of electron holes in the wave phase space. We found that the waves are associated with resonant currents antiparallel to the wave magnetic field, as predicted by nonlinear wave theory. We estimated the nonlinear field–particle energy transfer inside the waves, finding that the waves extract energy from local thermal electrons, in line with the positive growth rate of the waves derived from an instability analysis. Our observations may help to resolve long-standing controversies regarding chorus emissions and in gaining an understanding of the energy transport observed in space and astrophysical environments. Whistler-mode chorus waves have been observed in the tail region of the terrestrial magnetosphere, where the magnetic field is not dipolar so that chorus waves were not expected, and their generation mechanisms have been tested with state-of-the-art observations.",

    "abstract": "In subsurface methanogenic ecosystems, the ubiquity of methylated-compound-using archaea—methylotrophic methanogens1–4—implies that methylated compounds have an important role in the ecology and carbon cycling of such habitats. However, the origin of these chemicals remains unclear5,6 as there are no known energy metabolisms that generate methylated compounds de novo as a major product. Here we identified an energy metabolism in the subsurface-derived thermophilic anaerobe Zhaonella formicivorans7 that catalyses the conversion of formate to methanol, thereby producing methanol without requiring methylated compounds as an input. Cultivation experiments showed that formate-driven methanologenesis is inhibited by the accumulation of methanol. However, this limitation can be overcome through methanol consumption by a methylotrophic partner methanogen, Methermicoccus shengliensis. This symbiosis represents a fourth mode of mutualistic cross-feeding driven by thermodynamic necessity (syntrophy), previously thought to rely on transfer of hydrogen, formate or electrons8–10. The unusual metabolism and syntrophy provide insights into the enigmatic presence of methylated compounds in subsurface methanogenic ecosystems and demonstrate how organisms survive at the thermodynamic limit through metabolic symbiosis. Zhaonella formicivorans produces methanol, for a novel syntrophic interaction, without requiring methylated compounds as an input.",

    "abstract": "The North Pontic Region was the meeting point of the farmers of Old Europe and the foragers and pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe1,2, and the source of migrations deep into Europe3–5. Here we report genome-wide data from 81 prehistoric North Pontic individuals to understand the genetic makeup of its people. North Pontic foragers had ancestry from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 as well as European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. During the Eneolithic period, a wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga area7 bypassed local foragers to mix in equal parts with Trypillian farmers, forming the people of the Usatove culture around 4500 bce. A temporally overlapping wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga blended with foragers instead of farmers to form Serednii Stih people7. The third wave was the Yamna—descendants of the Serednii Stih who formed by mixture around 4000 bce and expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 bce). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka, Ukraine (3635–3383 bce), a site of archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic–Bronze Age transition and a likely epicentre of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves of migration propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders, a flexible strategy that may explain the success of the peoples of the North Pontic in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3–5,8–10. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of 81 prehistoric individuals reveals how the genetic makeup of people from the North Pontic region was influenced by waves of migration during the Eneolithic period and Early Bronze Age.",

    "abstract": "Galaxy clusters contain vast amounts of hot ionized gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the radiative cooling time of the ICM is shorter than the age of the cluster. However, the absence of line emission associated with cooling suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source1,2. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (‘sloshing’) motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for heat distribution from the outside of the core3,4. Here we present X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite. We find that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy, with velocities from 130 km s−1 to 310 km s−1 within about 30 kpc of the centre. This indicates bulk flow consistent with core gas sloshing. Although the bulk flow may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre, it could distribute the heat injected by the AGN and bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM. The velocity dispersion of the gas is found to be only ≲120 km s−1 in the core, even within about 10 kpc of the AGN. This suggests that the influence of the AGN on the surrounding ICM motion is limited in the cluster. X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite show that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy.",

    "abstract": "The crypt–villus structure of the small intestine serves as an essential protective barrier. The integrity of this barrier is monitored by the complex sensory system of the gut, in which serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells play an important part1,2. These rare sensory epithelial cells surveil the mucosal environment for luminal stimuli and transmit signals both within and outside the gut3–6. However, whether EC cells in crypts and villi detect different stimuli or produce distinct physiological responses is unknown. Here we address these questions by developing a reporter mouse model to quantitatively measure the release and propagation of serotonin from EC cells in live intestines. Crypt EC cells exhibit a tonic low-level mode that activates epithelial serotonin 5-HT4 receptors to modulate basal ion secretion and a stimulus-induced high-level mode that activates 5-HT3 receptors on sensory nerve fibres. Both these modes can be initiated by the irritant receptor TRPA1, which is confined to crypt EC cells. The activation of TRPA1 by luminal irritants is enhanced when the protective mucus layer is compromised. Villus EC cells also signal damage through a distinct mechanism, whereby oxidative stress activates TRPM2 channels, which leads to the release of both serotonin and ATP and consequent excitation of sensory nerve fibres. This topological segregation of EC cell functionality along the mucosal architecture constitutes a mechanism for the surveillance, maintenance and protection of gut integrity under diverse physiological conditions. Serotonergic enterochromaffin cells of the intestine exhibit distinct sensory, secretory and physiological properties depending on their location within the complex crypt–villus architecture of the gut.",

    "abstract": "Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors sense pathogen effectors and form resistosomes to confer immunity1. Some sensor NLR resistosomes produce small molecules to induce formation of a heterotrimer complex with two lipase-like proteins, EDS1 and SAG101, and a helper NLR called NRG1 (refs. 2,3). Activation of sensor NLR resistosomes also triggers NRG1 oligomerization and resistosome formation at the plasma membrane4,5. We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A heterotrimer formation is stabilized by the AtNRG1A loss-of-oligomerization mutant L134E5,6. We report structures of AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A L134E and AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1C heterotrimers with similar assembly mechanisms. AtNRG1A signalling is activated by the interaction with the AtEDS1–AtSAG101 heterodimer in complex with their small-molecule ligand. The truncated AtNRG1C maintains core interacting domains of AtNRG1A but develops further interactions with AtEDS1–AtSAG101 to outcompete AtNRG1A. Moreover, AtNRG1C lacks an N-terminal signalling domain and shows nucleocytoplasmic localization, facilitating its sequestration of AtEDS1–AtSAG101, which is also nucleocytoplasmic. Our study shows the activation and inhibition mechanisms of a plant helper NLR. In plant immunity, sensor NLR resistosomes can generate heterotrimer complexes comprising the helper NLR NRG1, and investigation of cryo-EM structures shows the mechanisms of these heterotrimers in immune activation and suppression.",

    "abstract": "Recent macroevolutionary studies predict a diversification of early birds during the Jurassic period1–4, but the unquestionable Jurassic bird fossil record is limited to Archaeopteryx1,5,6, which has also been referred to deinonychosaurian dinosaurs by some analyses7,8. Although they have feathered wings, the known Jurassic birds are more similar to non-avialan theropods in having the ancestral long reptilian tail9–11. This is in stark contrast to most Cretaceous and crownward taxa, which have a short tail that terminates in a compound bone called the pygostyle12–14. Here we report on the oldest short-tailed avialan, Baminornis zhenghensis gen. et sp. nov., from the recently discovered Late Jurassic Zhenghe Fauna15, which fills a noticeable spatio-temporal gap in the earliest branching avialan fossil record. B. zhenghensis exhibits a unique combination of derived ornithothoracine-like pectoral and pelvic girdles and plesiomorphic non-avialan maniraptoran hand, demonstrating mosaic evolution along stem avialan line. An avialan furcula collected from the same locality is referrable to ornithuromorphs on the basis of our morphometric and phylogenetic analyses. These newly discovered fossils demonstrate the early appearance of highly derived bird features, and together with an anchiornithine fossil from the same locality, they suggest an earlier origin of birds and a radiation of early birds in the Jurassic. Two recently discovered bird fossils from the Late Jurassic Zhenghe Fauna demonstrate that highly derived bird-like features and the origin of birds appeared much earlier in the Jurassic period than previously estimated.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) disrupt the continuity of the genome, with consequences for malignant transformation. Massive DNA damage can elicit a cellular checkpoint response that prevents cell proliferation1,2. However, how highly aggressive cancer cells, which can tolerate widespread DNA damage, respond to DSBs alongside continuous chromosome duplication is unknown. Here we show that DSBs induce a local genome maintenance mechanism that inhibits replication initiation in DSB-containing topologically associating domains (TADs) without affecting DNA synthesis at other genomic locations. This process is facilitated by mediators of replication and DSBs (MRDs). In normal and cancer cells, MRDs include the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex and the WEE1 kinase, which actively dislodges the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex from replication origins adjacent to DSBs and prevents initiation of DNA synthesis at DSB-containing TADs. Dysregulation of MRDs, or disruption of 3D chromatin architecture by dissolving TADs, results in inadvertent replication in damaged chromatin and increased DNA damage in cancer cells. We propose that the intact MRD cascade precedes DSB repair to prevent genomic instability, which is otherwise observed when replication is forced, or when genome architecture is challenged, in the presence of DSBs3–5. These observations reveal a previously unknown vulnerability in the DNA replication machinery that may be exploited to therapeutically target cancer cells. DNA double-strand breaks induce local genome maintenance and inhibition of replication initiation at nearby topologically associating domains without affecting global DNA synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide1,2. HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that accumulate progressive driver mutations3, with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin2. However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is broadly independent of the underlying aetiologies4. Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC, outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations5,6. Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC7. Here we generated a suite of genetically driven immunocompetent in vivo and matched in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance and metastasis. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human–mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with the human histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard-of-care treatment and used a linked in vitro–in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not previously been linked to HCC treatment. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy. As proof of principle, an analysis using a suite of human-aligned immunocompetent mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma identifies a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, which acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy.",

However, the limited cooling power of existing devices (≤300 W) hampers the commercialization of this technology3,4. Here we constructed a kilowatt-scale elastocaloric cooling device using compressive tubular NiTi in an ‘SMAs in series–fluid in parallel’ architecture, referred to as the multi-cell architecture. A large specific cooling power of 12.3 W g−1 was achieved by the large surface-area-to-volume ratio of thin-walled tubular NiTi at high-frequency operation (3.5 Hz), complemented by graphene nanofluid as an efficient heat transfer agent. Furthermore, the multi-cell architecture ensures a sufficient elastocaloric mass for tight assembly while maintaining a low system fluid pressure. Our device achieves a cooling power of 1,284 W on the fluid side at zero temperature lift during the initial 500,000 cycles, demonstrating the potential of this green cooling technology for a decarbonized future5,6. An elastocaloric cooling platform is constructed based on shape memory alloys with a cellular architecture that enables cooling powers above 1 kW.",

    "abstract": "Hofstadter’s butterfly, the predicted energy spectrum for non-interacting electrons confined to a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, is one of the most remarkable fractal structures in nature1. At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unit cell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levels that reflect its recursive construction. For most materials, Hofstadter’s butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions that are unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields1–3. More recently, electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter’s butterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large lattice constants4–6, such as those with moiré superlattices7–10. Yet, so far, direct spectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadter nearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to investigate the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the predicted second magic angle11,12, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studies of Hofstadter’s spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flat moiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimental signatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, our measurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electron density, showing phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter’s original model owing to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulomb interactions and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in TBG. High-resolution STM/STS visualizes the fractionalization of flat moiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands in moiré graphene near the predicted second magic angle, and experimentally establishes several fundamental properties of the fractal Hofstadter energy spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that the emergence of stone tool technology occurred before the appearance of the genus Homo1 and may potentially be traced back deep into the primate evolutionary line2. Conversely, osseous technologies are apparently exclusive of later hominins from approximately 2 million years ago (Ma)3,4, whereas the earliest systematic production of bone tools is currently restricted to European Acheulean sites 400–250 thousand years ago5,6. Here we document an assemblage of bone tools shaped by knapping found within a single stratigraphic horizon at Olduvai Gorge dated to 1.5 Ma. Large mammal limb bone fragments, mostly from hippopotamus and elephant, were shaped to produce various tools, including massive elongated implements. Before our discovery, bone artefact production in pre-Middle Stone Age African contexts was widely considered as episodic, expedient and unrepresentative of early Homo toolkits. However, our results demonstrate that at the transition between the Oldowan and the early Acheulean, East African hominins developed an original cultural innovation that entailed a transfer and adaptation of knapping skills from stone to bone. By producing technologically and morphologically standardized bone tools, early Acheulean toolmakers unravelled technological repertoires that were previously thought to have appeared routinely more than 1 million years later. Bone tools shaped by knapping found within Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania precede any other evidence of systematic bone tool production by more than 1 million years.",

    "abstract": "Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrates, yet their resilience to rising temperatures remains poorly understood1,2. This is primarily because knowledge of thermal tolerance is taxonomically and geographically biased3, compromising global climate vulnerability assessments. Here we used a phylogenetically informed data-imputation approach to predict the heat tolerance of 60% of amphibian species and assessed their vulnerability to daily temperature variations in thermal refugia. We found that 104 out of 5,203 species (2%) are currently exposed to overheating events in shaded terrestrial conditions. Despite accounting for heat-tolerance plasticity, a 4 °C global temperature increase would create a step change in impact severity, pushing 7.5% of species beyond their physiological limits. In the Southern Hemisphere, tropical species encounter disproportionally more overheating events, while non-tropical species are more susceptible in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings challenge evidence for a general latitudinal gradient in overheating risk4–6 and underscore the importance of considering climatic variability in vulnerability assessments. We provide conservative estimates assuming access to cool shaded microenvironments. Thus, the impacts of global warming will probably exceed our projections. Our microclimate-explicit analyses demonstrate that vegetation and water bodies are critical in buffering amphibians during heat waves. Immediate action is needed to preserve and manage these microhabitat features. A 4 °C global temperature increase would push 7.5% of amphibian species beyond their physiological limits.",

    "abstract": "The preference for a particular thermal range is a key determinant of the distribution of animal species. However, we know little on how temperature preference behaviour evolves during the colonization of new environments. Here we show that at least two distinct neurobiological mechanisms drive the evolution of temperature preference in flies of the genus Drosophila. Fly species from mild climates (D. melanogaster and D. persimilis) avoid both innocuous and noxious heat, and we show that the thermal activation threshold of the molecular heat receptor Gr28b.d precisely matches species-specific thresholds of behavioural heat avoidance. We find that desert-dwelling D. mojavensis are instead actively attracted to innocuous heat. Notably, heat attraction is also mediated by Gr28b.d (and by the antennal neurons that express it) and matches its threshold of heat activation. Rather, the switch in valence from heat aversion to attraction correlates with specific changes in thermosensory input to the lateral horn, the main target of central thermosensory pathways and a region of the fly brain implicated in the processing of innate valence1–5. Together, our results demonstrate that, in Drosophila, the adaptation to different thermal niches involves changes in thermal preference behaviour, and that this can be accomplished using distinct neurobiological solutions, ranging from shifts in the activation threshold of peripheral thermosensory receptor proteins to a substantial change in the way temperature valence is processed in the brain. A study using flies of the genus Drosophila adapted to life in diverse thermal environments shows how evolution has shaped temperature preference by acting on both molecular heat receptors and thermosensory circuits in the flies.",

    "abstract": "In a subset of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a severe acute hyperinflammatory shock1 termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at four to eight weeks after infection. MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion2 and systemic hyperinflammation3. The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection results from increased serum levels of TGFβ, which impairs the reactivation of virus-specific T cells.",

    "abstract": "The goal of future quantum networks is to enable new internet applications that are impossible to achieve using only classical communication1–3. Up to now, demonstrations of quantum network applications4–6 and functionalities7–12 on quantum processors have been performed in ad hoc software that was specific to the experimental setup, programmed to perform one single task (the application experiment) directly into low-level control devices using expertise in experimental physics. Here we report on the design and implementation of an architecture capable of executing quantum network applications on quantum processors in platform-independent high-level software. We demonstrate the capability of the architecture to execute applications in high-level software by implementing it as a quantum network operating system—QNodeOS—and executing test programs, including a delegated computation from a client to a server13 on two quantum network nodes based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond14,15. We show how our architecture allows us to maximize the use of quantum network hardware by multitasking different applications. Our architecture can be used to execute programs on any quantum processor platform corresponding to our system model, which we illustrate by demonstrating an extra driver for QNodeOS for a trapped-ion quantum network node based on a single 40Ca+ atom16. Our architecture lays the groundwork for computer science research in quantum network programming and paves the way for the development of software that can bring quantum network technology to society. A new quantum operating system architecture is described that is capable of executing applications on quantum networks in high-level software, which is a step towards bringing quantum network technology to society.",

    "abstract": "Active systems composed of energy-generating microscopic constituents are a promising platform to create autonomous functional materials1–16 that can, for example, locomote through complex and unpredictable environments. Yet coaxing these energy sources into useful mechanical work has proved challenging. Here we engineer active solids based on centimetre-scale building blocks that perform adaptive locomotion. These prototypes exhibit a non-variational form of elasticity characterized by odd moduli8,12,17, whose magnitude we predict from microscopics using coarse-grained theories and which we validate experimentally. When interacting with an external environment, these active solids spontaneously undergo limit cycles of shape changes, which naturally lead to locomotion such as rolling and crawling. The robustness of the locomotion is rooted in an emergent feedback loop between the active solid and the environment, which is mediated by elastic deformations and stresses. As a result, our active solids are able to accelerate, adjust their gaits and locomote through a variety of terrains with a similar performance to more complex control strategies implemented by neural networks. Our work establishes active solids as a bridge between materials and robots and suggests decentralized strategies to control the nonlinear dynamics of biological systems8,18–22, soft materials5,6,9,11,12,23–25 and driven nanomechanical devices7,26–30. The development of active solids based on centimetre-scale building blocks incorporating odd elasticity shows that they can spontaneously undergo limit cycles of shape changes, leading to adaptive locomotion such as rolling and crawling.",

    "abstract": "Tumour cells often evade immune pressure exerted by CD8+ T cells or immunotherapies through mechanisms that are largely unclear1,2. Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screens to target metabolic factors, we established voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) as an immune signal-dependent checkpoint that curtails interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated tumour destruction and inflammatory reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment. Targeting VDAC2 in tumour cells enabled IFNγ-induced cell death and cGAS–STING activation, and markedly improved anti-tumour effects and immunotherapeutic responses. Using a genome-scale genetic interaction screen, we identified BAK as the mediator of VDAC2-deficiency-induced effects. Mechanistically, IFNγ stimulation increased BIM, BID and BAK expression, with VDAC2 deficiency eliciting uncontrolled IFNγ-induced BAK activation and mitochondrial damage. Consequently, mitochondrial DNA was aberrantly released into the cytosol and triggered robust activation of cGAS–STING signalling and type I IFN response. Importantly, co-deletion of STING signalling components dampened the therapeutic effects of VDAC2 depletion in tumour cells, suggesting that targeting VDAC2 integrates CD8+ T cell- and IFNγ-mediated adaptive immunity with a tumour-intrinsic innate immune-like response. Together, our findings reveal VDAC2 as a dual-action target to overcome tumour immune evasion and establish the importance of coordinately destructing and inflaming tumours to enable efficacious cancer immunotherapy. VDAC2 deficiency elicits uncontrolled IFNγ-induced BAK activation and mitochondrial damage for improved cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels contain cytoplasmically exposed β-subunits1–5 whose aldo-keto reductase activity6–8 is required for the homeostatic regulation of sleep9. Here we show that Hyperkinetic, the β-subunit of the KV1 channel Shaker in Drosophila7, forms a dynamic lipid peroxidation memory. Information is stored in the oxidation state of Hyperkinetic’s nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor, which changes when lipid-derived carbonyls10–13, such as 4-oxo-2-nonenal or an endogenous analogue generated by illuminating a membrane-bound photosensitizer9,14, abstract an electron pair. NADP+ remains locked in the active site of KVβ until membrane depolarization permits its release and replacement with NADPH. Sleep-inducing neurons15–17 use this voltage-gated oxidoreductase cycle to encode their recent lipid peroxidation history in the collective binary states of their KVβ subunits; this biochemical memory influences—and is erased by—spike discharges driving sleep. The presence of a lipid peroxidation sensor at the core of homeostatic sleep control16,17 suggests that sleep protects neuronal membranes against oxidative damage. Indeed, brain phospholipids are depleted of vulnerable polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains after enforced waking, and slowing the removal of their carbonylic breakdown products increases the demand for sleep. Sleep-inducing neurons in Drosophila rely on Hyperkinetic, the β-subunit of the KV1 channel Shaker, to monitor sleep need by translating lipid peroxidation events into changes in the oxidation state of a stably bound NADPH cofactor.",

    "abstract": "Rates of relative sea-level rise during the final stage of the last deglaciation, the early Holocene, are key to understanding future ice melt and sea-level change under a warming climate1. Data about these rates are scarce2, and this limits insight into the relative contributions of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets to global sea-level rise during the early Holocene. Here we present an early Holocene sea-level curve based on 88 sea-level data points (13.7–6.2 thousand years ago (ka)) from the North Sea (Doggerland3,4). After removing the pattern of regional glacial isostatic adjustment caused by the melting of the Eurasian Ice Sheet, the residual sea-level signal highlights two phases of accelerated sea-level rise. Meltwater sourced from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets drove these two phases, peaking around 10.3 ka and 8.3 ka with rates between 8 mm yr−1 and 9 mm yr−1. Our results also show that global mean sea-level rise between 11 ka and 3 ka amounted to 37.7 m (2σ range, 29.3–42.2 m), reconciling the mismatch that existed between estimates of global mean sea-level rise based on ice-sheet reconstructions and previously limited early Holocene sea-level data. With its broad spatiotemporal coverage, the North Sea dataset provides critical constraints on the patterns and rates of the late-stage deglaciation of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets, improving our understanding of the Earth-system response to climate change. An early Holocene sea-level curve based on data from the North Sea reveals two phases of accelerated sea-level rise owing to meltwater from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets.",

    "abstract": "The landscapes of somatic mutation in normal cells inform us about the processes of mutation and selection operative throughout life, providing insight into normal ageing and the earliest stages of cancer development1. Here, by whole-genome sequencing of 238 microdissections2 from 30 individuals, including 18 with gastric cancer, we elucidate the developmental trajectories of normal and malignant gastric epithelium. We find that gastric glands are units of monoclonal cell populations that accrue roughly 28 somatic single-nucleotide variants per year, predominantly attributable to endogenous mutational processes. In individuals with gastric cancer, metaplastic glands often show elevated mutation burdens due to acceleration of mutational processes linked to proliferation and oxidative damage. Unusually for normal cells, gastric epithelial cells often carry recurrent trisomies of specific chromosomes, which are highly enriched in a subset of individuals. Surveying 829 polyclonal gastric microbiopsies by targeted sequencing, we find somatic ‘driver’ mutations in a distinctive repertoire of known cancer genes, including ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, CTNNB1 and KDM6A. The prevalence of mutant clones increases with age to occupy roughly 8% of the gastric epithelial lining by age 60 years and is significantly increased by the presence of severe chronic inflammation. Our findings provide insights into intrinsic and extrinsic influences on somatic evolution in the gastric epithelium in healthy, precancerous and malignant states. Whole-gene sequencing of microdissected gastric glands from individuals with and without gastric cancer reveals distinct patterns of somatic mutations and provides insights into influences on the somatic evolution of the gastric epithelium.",

    "abstract": "With the near eradication of poliovirus due to global vaccination campaigns, attention has shifted to other enteroviruses that can cause polio-like paralysis syndrome (now termed acute flaccid myelitis)1–3. In particular, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is believed to be the main driver of epidemic outbreaks of acute flaccid myelitis in recent years4, yet not much is known about EV-D68 host interactions. EV-D68 is a respiratory virus5 but, in rare cases, can spread to the central nervous system to cause severe neuropathogenesis. Here we use genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify the poorly characterized multipass membrane transporter MFSD6 as a host entry factor for EV-D68. Knockout of MFSD6 expression abrogated EV-D68 infection in cell lines and primary cells corresponding to respiratory and neural cells. MFSD6 localized to the plasma membrane and was required for viral entry into host cells. MFSD6 bound directly to EV-D68 particles through its extracellular, third loop (L3). We determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of EV-D68 in a complex with MFSD6 L3, revealing the interaction interface. A decoy receptor, engineered by fusing MFSD6 L3 to Fc, blocked EV-D68 infection of human primary lung epithelial cells and provided near-complete protection in a lethal mouse model of EV-D68 infection. Collectively, our results reveal MFSD6 as an entry receptor for EV-D68, and support the targeting of MFSD6 as a potential mechanism to combat infections by this emerging pathogen with pandemic potential. The multipass membrane transporter MFSD6 localizes to the plasma membrane and acts as a host entry factor for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) by binding directly to EV-D68 particles through its extracellular, third loop, offering a potential target to combat infections by this emerging pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The membrane (M) protein of betacoronaviruses is well conserved and has a key role in viral assembly1,2. Here we describe the identification of JNJ-9676, a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the coronavirus M protein. JNJ-9676 demonstrates in vitro nanomolar antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and sarbecovirus strains from bat and pangolin zoonotic origin. Using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined a binding pocket of JNJ-9676 formed by the transmembrane domains of the M protein dimer. Compound binding stabilized the M protein dimer in an altered conformational state between its long and short forms, preventing the release of infectious virus. In a pre-exposure Syrian golden hamster model, JNJ-9676 (25 mg per kg twice per day) showed excellent efficacy, illustrated by a significant reduction in viral load and infectious virus in the lung by 3.5 and 4 log10-transformed RNA copies and 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per mg lung, respectively. Histopathology scores at this dose were reduced to the baseline. In a post-exposure hamster model, JNJ-9676 was efficacious at 75 mg per kg twice per day even when added at 48 h after infection, when peak viral loads were observed. The M protein is an attractive antiviral target to block coronavirus replication, and JNJ-9676 represents an interesting chemical series towards identifying clinical candidates addressing the current and future coronavirus pandemics. JNJ-9676—a small-molecule inhibitor targeting coronavirus M protein that shows excellent efficacy in Syrian golden hamster models—binds to and stabilizes the M protein dimer in an altered conformational state between its long and short forms, preventing the release of infectious virus.",

    "abstract": "Deep-sea polymetallic nodule mining is in the exploration phase at present with some groups proposing a move towards extraction within years1. Management of this industry requires evidence of the long-term effects on deep-sea ecosystems2, but the ability of seafloor ecosystems to recover from impacts over decadal scales is poorly understood3. Here we show that, four decades after a test mining experiment that removed nodules, the biological impacts in many groups of organisms are persistent, although populations of several organisms, including sediment macrofauna, mobile deposit feeders and even large-sized sessile fauna, have begun to re-establish despite persistent physical changes at the seafloor. We also reveal that areas affected by plumes from this small-scale test have limited detectable residual sedimentation impacts with some biological assemblages similar in abundance compared to control areas after 44 years. Although some aspects of the modern collector design may cause reduced physical impact compared to this test mining experiment, our results show that mining impacts in the abyssal ocean will be persistent over at least decadal timeframes and communities will remain altered in directly disturbed areas, despite some recolonization. The long-term effects seen in our study provide critical data for effective management of mining activities, if they occur, including minimizing direct impacts and setting aside an effective network of protected areas4,5. Four decades after a test mining experiment that removed nodules, the biological impacts in many groups of organisms persist, although populations of several organisms have begun to re-establish despite persistent physical changes at the seafloor.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic biodiversity decline threatens the functioning of ecosystems and the many benefits they provide to humanity1. As well as causing species losses in directly affected locations, human influence might also reduce biodiversity in relatively unmodified vegetation if far-reaching anthropogenic effects trigger local extinctions and hinder recolonization. Here we show that local plant diversity is globally negatively related to the level of anthropogenic activity in the surrounding region. Impoverishment of natural vegetation was evident only when we considered community completeness: the proportion of all suitable species in the region that are present at a site. To estimate community completeness, we compared the number of recorded species with the dark diversity—ecologically suitable species that are absent from a site but present in the surrounding region2. In the sampled regions with a minimal human footprint index, an average of 35% of suitable plant species were present locally, compared with less than 20% in highly affected regions. Besides having the potential to uncover overlooked threats to biodiversity, dark diversity also provides guidance for nature conservation. Species in the dark diversity remain regionally present, and their local populations might be restored through measures that improve connectivity between natural vegetation fragments and reduce threats to population persistence. A comparison of alpha diversity (number of plant species) and dark diversity (species that are currently absent from a site despite being ecologically suitable) demonstrates the negative effects of regional-scale anthropogenic activity on plant diversity.",

    "abstract": "Retroelements have a critical role in shaping eukaryotic genomes. For instance, site-specific non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons have spread widely through preferential integration into repetitive genomic sequences, such as microsatellite regions and ribosomal DNA genes1–6. Despite the widespread occurrence of these systems, their targeting constraints remain unclear. Here we use a computational pipeline to discover multiple new site-specific retrotransposon families, profile members both biochemically and in mammalian cells, find previously undescribed insertion preferences and chart potential evolutionary paths for retrotransposon retargeting. We identify R2Tg, an R2 retrotransposon from the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, as an orthologue that can be retargeted by payload engineering for target cleavage, reverse transcription and scarless insertion of heterologous payloads at new genomic sites. We enhance this activity by fusing R2Tg to CRISPR–Cas9 nickases for efficient insertion at new genomic sites. Through further screening of R2 orthologues, we select an orthologue, R2Tocc, with natural reprogrammability and minimal insertion at its natural 28S site, to engineer SpCas9H840A–R2Tocc, a system we name site-specific target-primed insertion through targeted CRISPR homing of retroelements (STITCHR). STITCHR enables the scarless, efficient installation of edits, ranging from a single base to 12.7 kilobases, gene replacement and use of in vitro transcribed or synthetic RNA templates. Inspired by the prevalence of nLTR retrotransposons across eukaryotic genomes, we anticipate that STITCHR will serve as a platform for scarless programmable integration in dividing and non-dividing cells, with both research and therapeutic applications. A study of retrotransposon activity repurposes a retroelement called R2Tocc to create a programmable system called STITCHR that enables diverse genome edits including efficient, scarless large payload insertions.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain and have pivotal roles in neurodevelopment and neuroinflammation1,2. This study investigates the function of the immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 (encoded by HAVCR2) in microglia. TIM-3 was recently identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease3, and it can induce T cell exhaustion4. However, its specific function in brain microglia remains unclear. We demonstrate in mouse models that TGFβ signalling induces TIM-3 expression in microglia. In turn, TIM-3 interacts with SMAD2 and TGFBR2 through its carboxy-terminal tail, which enhances TGFβ signalling by promoting TGFBR-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, and this process maintains microglial homeostasis. Genetic deletion of Havcr2 in microglia leads to increased phagocytic activity and a gene-expression profile consistent with the neurodegenerative microglial phenotype (MGnD), also referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). Furthermore, microglia-targeted deletion of Havcr2 ameliorates cognitive impairment and reduces amyloid-β pathology in 5×FAD mice (a transgenic model of Alzheimer’s disease). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a subpopulation of MGnD microglia in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice characterized by increased pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory gene expression alongside reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. These transcriptomic changes were corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing data across most microglial clusters in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice. Our findings reveal that TIM-3 mediates microglia homeostasis through TGFβ signalling and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial TIM-3 in Alzheimer’s disease. The immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 regulates microglial homeostasis, and its microglial-specific deletion reduced cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.",

    "abstract": "Myosins produce force and movement in cells through interactions with F-actin1. Generation of movement is thought to arise through actin-catalysed conversion of myosin from an ATP-generated primed (pre-powerstroke) state to a post-powerstroke state, accompanied by myosin lever swing2,3. However, the initial, primed actomyosin state has never been observed, and the mechanism by which actin catalyses myosin ATPase activity is unclear. Here, to address these issues, we performed time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)4 of a myosin-5 mutant having slow hydrolysis product release5,6. Primed actomyosin was predominantly captured 10 ms after mixing primed myosin with F-actin, whereas post-powerstroke actomyosin predominated at 120 ms, with no abundant intermediate states detected. For detailed interpretation, cryo-EM maps were fitted with pseudo-atomic models. Small but critical changes accompany the primed motor binding to actin through its lower 50-kDa subdomain, with the actin-binding cleft open and phosphate release prohibited. Amino-terminal actin interactions with myosin promote rotation of the upper 50-kDa subdomain, closing the actin-binding cleft, and enabling phosphate release. The formation of interactions between the upper 50-kDa subdomain and actin creates the strong-binding interface needed for effective force production. The myosin-5 lever swings through 93°, predominantly along the actin axis, with little twisting. The magnitude of lever swing matches the typical step length of myosin-5 along actin7. These time-resolved structures demonstrate the swinging lever mechanism, elucidate structural transitions of the power stroke, and resolve decades of conjecture on how myosins generate movement. A study using time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy reveals the swinging lever mechanism of myosin, providing information on the molecular basis behind the production of force and movement by myosin.",

    "abstract": "Proliferating hepatocytes often undergo ductal metaplasia to balance the energy trade-off between cellular functions and replication, hindering the expansion of human adult hepatocytes with functional competency1. Here we demonstrate that the combined activation of Wnt and STAT3 signalling enables long-term self-renewal of human adult hepatocyte organoids. YAP activation facilitates hepatocyte proliferation but commits it towards the biliary duct lineage. By contrast, STAT3 activation by oncostatin M induces hepatocyte proliferation while counteracting ductal metaplasia and maintaining the hepatic identity. Xenotransplanted hepatocyte organoids repopulate the recipient mouse liver and reconstitute the metabolic zonation structure. Upon niche factor removal and hormone supplementation, hepatocyte organoids form cord-like structures with bile canalicular networks and exhibit major liver metabolic functions comparable to those of in vivo hepatocytes. Hepatocyte organoids are amenable to gene editing, prompting functional modelling of inherent metabolic liver diseases. The new culture system offers a promising avenue for developing therapeutic strategies against human liver diseases. The combined activation of Wnt and STAT3 signalling enables long-term self-renewal of human hepatocyte organoids, maintaining hepatic identity, supporting gene editing and offering therapeutic potential for liver disease through enhanced functionality, structure and metabolic competency.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, little is known about the metabolism of therapeutic RNAs. Here we use nanopore sequencing1–3 to analyse individual therapeutic mRNA molecules, focusing on their poly(A) tails. We show that the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine4 has a poly(A) tail of around 100 nucleotides, followed by an mΨCmΨAG sequence. In cell lines, mRNA-1273 undergoes rapid degradation initiated by mΨCmΨAG removal, followed by CCR4–NOT-mediated deadenylation. However, in medically relevant preclinical models, particularly in macrophages, mRNA-1273 poly(A) tails are extended to up to 200 nucleotides by the TENT5A poly(A) polymerase5–7, which is induced by the vaccine. Re-adenylation, which stabilizes target mRNAs, is consistently observed in synthetic mRNAs that encode proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, such as ovalbumin or antigens from Zika virus8 or the malaria parasite9. The extent of re-adenylation varies: the BioNTech–Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine10 shows less potent re-adenylation than mRNA-1273, which correlates with a smaller proportion of membrane-associated BNT162b2. This highlights the crucial role of spatial accessibility to ER-resident TENT5A in determining re-adenylation efficiency. In vivo, TENT5A is expressed in immune cells that take up mRNA vaccine, and TENT5A deficiency reduces specific immunoglobulin production for mRNA vaccines after immunization in mice. Overall, our findings reveal a principle for enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic mRNAs, paving the way for improvement. Upon intramuscular administration, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are primarily taken up by macrophages, in which the cellular machinery extends their poly(A) tails, thereby increasing mRNA stability and translation, providing an explanation for the efficacy of these vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Distinct hepatocyte subpopulations are spatially segregated along the portal–central axis and are critical to understanding metabolic homeostasis and injury in the liver1. Although several bioactive molecules, including ascorbate and bilirubin, have been described as having a role in directing zonal fates, zonal liver architecture has not yet been replicated in vitro2,3. Here, to evaluate hepatic zonal polarity, we developed a self-assembling zone-specific liver organoid by co-culturing ascorbate- and bilirubin-enriched hepatic progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We found that preconditioned hepatocyte-like cells exhibited zone-specific functions associated with the urea cycle, glutathione synthesis and glutamate synthesis. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of these zonally patterned organoids identifies a hepatoblast differentiation trajectory that dictates periportal, interzonal and pericentral human hepatocytes. Epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis showed that zonal identity is orchestrated by ascorbate- or bilirubin-dependent binding of EP300 to TET1 or HIF1α. Transplantation of the self-assembled zonally patterned human organoids improved survival of immunodeficient rats who underwent bile duct ligation by ameliorating the hyperammonaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Overall, this multi-zonal organoid system serves as an in vitro human model to better recapitulate hepatic architecture relevant to liver development and disease. Liver organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells populations grown with ascorbate and bilirubin can be used to recapitulate differential zonal functions of human hepatocytes and for transplantation in animal models of liver dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Wurtzite ferroelectrics have transformative potential for next-generation microelectronics. A comprehensive understanding of their ferroelectric properties and domain energetics is crucial for tailoring their ferroelectric characteristics and exploiting their functional properties in practical devices. Despite burgeoning interest, the exact configurations and electronic structures of domain walls in wurtzite ferroelectrics remain elusive. Here we explain the atomic configurations and electronic properties of electric-field-induced domain walls in ferroelectric ScGaN. By combining transmission electron microscopy and theoretical calculations, a charged domain wall with a buckled two-dimensional hexagonal phase is revealed. Density functional theory calculations confirm that such domain-wall structures further give rise to unprecedented mid-gap states within the forbidden band. Quantitative analysis unveils a universal charge-compensation mechanism stabilizing antipolar domain walls in ferroelectric materials, in which the polarization discontinuity at the 180° domain wall is compensated by the unbonded valence electrons. Furthermore, the reconfigurable conductivity of these domain walls is experimentally demonstrated, showcasing their potential for ultrascaled device applications. Experimental and theoretical exploration of domain walls forming in wurtzite ferroelectrics following the application of electric fields demonstrates their reconfigurable conductivity as well as tunability, showing potential for use in ultrascaled devices.",

    "abstract": "Environmental thermal challenges trigger the brain to coordinate both autonomic and behavioural responses to maintain optimal body temperature1–4. It is unknown how temperature information is precisely stored and retrieved in the brain and how it is converted into a physiological response. Here we investigated whether memories could control whole-body metabolism by training mice to remember a thermal challenge. Mice were conditioned to associate a context with a specific temperature by combining thermoregulatory Pavlovian conditioning with engram-labelling technology, optogenetics and chemogenetics. We report that if mice are returned to an environment in which they previously experienced a 4 °C cold challenge, they increase their metabolic rates regardless of the actual environmental temperature. Furthermore, we show that mice have increased hypothalamic activity when they are exposed to the cold, and that a specific network emerges between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus during the recall of a cold memory. Both natural retrieval and artificial reactivation of cold-sensitive memory engrams in the hippocampus mimic the physiological responses that are seen during a cold challenge. These ensembles are necessary for cold-memory retrieval. These findings show that retrieval of a cold memory causes whole-body autonomic and behavioural responses that enable mice to maintain thermal homeostasis. Cold-sensitive engrams contribute to learned thermoregulation in mice that are returned to an environment in which they previously experienced a cold challenge, through a network formed between the hippocampus and hypothalamus that enables the recall of cold-related memories.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the human de novo mutation (DNM) rate requires complete sequence information1. Here using five complementary short-read and long-read sequencing technologies, we phased and assembled more than 95% of each diploid human genome in a four-generation, twenty-eight-member family (CEPH 1463). We estimate 98–206 DNMs per transmission, including 74.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants, 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 65.3 de novo indels or structural variants originating from tandem repeats, and 4.4 centromeric DNMs. Among male individuals, we find 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. Short tandem repeats and variable-number tandem repeats are the most mutable, with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75–81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 16% of de novo single-nucleotide variants are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias, including early germline mosaic mutations. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map (~3.4 kb breakpoint resolution) and find no correlation between meiotic crossover and de novo structural variants. These near-telomere-to-telomere familial genomes provide a truth set to understand the most fundamental processes underlying human genetic variation. Analysis of more than 95% of each diploid human genome of a four-generation, twenty-eight-member family using five complementary short-read and long-read sequencing technologies provides a truth set to understand the most fundamental processes underlying human genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subsists in a nutrient-deregulated microenvironment, making it particularly susceptible to treatments that interfere with cancer metabolism1,2. For example, PDAC uses, and is dependent on, high levels of autophagy and other lysosomal processes3–5. Although targeting these pathways has shown potential in preclinical studies, progress has been hampered by the difficulty in identifying and characterizing favourable targets for drug development6. Here, we characterize PIKfyve, a lipid kinase that is integral to lysosomal functioning7, as a targetable vulnerability in PDAC. Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we established that PIKfyve is essential to PDAC progression. Furthermore, through comprehensive metabolic analyses, we found that PIKfyve inhibition forces PDAC to upregulate a distinct transcriptional and metabolic program favouring de novo lipid synthesis. In PDAC, the KRAS–MAPK signalling pathway is a primary driver of de novo lipid synthesis. Accordingly, simultaneously targeting PIKfyve and KRAS–MAPK resulted in the elimination of the tumour burden in numerous preclinical human and mouse models. Taken together, these studies indicate that disrupting lipid metabolism through PIKfyve inhibition induces synthetic lethality in conjunction with KRAS–MAPK-directed therapies for PDAC. A study of human and mouse models of pancreatic cancer finds that inhibiting the lipid kinase PIKfyve interferes with the cancer’s lipid homeostasis, making it a potential target for drug development.",

    "abstract": "Patients with treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer often succumb to systemic metastases1–3; however, the transcriptomic heterogeneity that underlies therapeutic recalcitrance remains understudied, particularly in a spatial context. Here we construct high-resolution maps of lineage states, clonal architecture and the tumour microenvironment (TME) using spatially resolved transcriptomics from 55 samples of primary tumour and metastases (liver, lung and peritoneum) collected from rapid autopsies of 13 people. We observe discernible transcriptomic shifts in cancer-cell lineage states as tumours transition from primary sites to organ-specific metastases, with the most pronounced intra-patient distinctions between liver and lung. Phylogenetic trees constructed from inferred copy number variations in primary and metastatic loci in each patient highlight diverse patient-specific evolutionary trajectories and clonal dissemination. We show that multiple tumour lineage states co-exist in each tissue, including concurrent metastatic foci in the same organ. Agnostic to tissue site, lineage states correlate with distinct TME features, such as the spatial proximity of TGFB1-expressing myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) to aggressive ‘basal-like’ cancer cells, but not to cells in the ‘classical’ or ‘intermediate’ states. These findings were validated through orthogonal and cross-species analyses using mouse tissues and patient-derived organoids. Notably, basal-like cancer cells aligned with myCAFs correlate with plasma-cell exclusion from the tumour milieu, and neighbouring cell analyses suggest that CXCR4–CXCL12 signalling is the underlying basis for observed immune exclusion. Collectively, our findings underscore the profound transcriptomic heterogeneity and microenvironmental dynamics that characterize treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer. Spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling of primary tumours and metastases from patients with pancreatic cancer provides insight into the evolutionary progression to metastasis, and the variation in clonal architecture within and between individuals.",

    "abstract": "The information-processing capability of the brain’s cellular network depends on the physical wiring pattern between neurons and their molecular and functional characteristics. Mapping neurons and resolving their individual synaptic connections can be achieved by volumetric imaging at nanoscale resolution1,2 with dense cellular labelling. Light microscopy is uniquely positioned to visualize specific molecules, but dense, synapse-level circuit reconstruction by light microscopy has been out of reach, owing to limitations in resolution, contrast and volumetric imaging capability. Here we describe light-microscopy-based connectomics (LICONN). We integrated specifically engineered hydrogel embedding and expansion with comprehensive deep-learning-based segmentation and analysis of connectivity, thereby directly incorporating molecular information into synapse-level reconstructions of brain tissue. LICONN will allow synapse-level phenotyping of brain tissue in biological experiments in a readily adoptable manner. A technique called LICONN (light-microscopy-based connectomics) allows mapping of brain tissue at synapse level and simultaneous measurement of molecular information, thus enabling quantification of cellular properties and multimodal analysis of brain tissue.",

    "abstract": "Activating mutations in the rat sarcoma (RAS) genes HRAS, NRAS and KRAS collectively represent the most frequent oncogenic driver in human cancer1. They have previously been considered undruggable, but advances in the past few years have led to the clinical development of agents that target KRAS(G12C) and KRAS(G12D) mutants, yielding promises of therapeutic responses at tolerated doses2. However, clinical agents that selectively target NRAS(Q61*) mutants (* represents ‘any’), the second-most-frequent oncogenic driver in melanoma, are still lacking. Here we identify SHOC2, a component of the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C complex, as a dependency of RAS(Q61*) tumours in a nucleotide-state-dependent and isoform-agnostic manner. Mechanistically, we found that oncogenic NRAS(Q61R) forms a direct interaction with SHOC2, evidenced by X-ray co-crystal structure. In vitro high-throughput screening enabled the discovery of small molecules that bind to SHOC2 and disrupt the interaction with NRAS(Q61*). Structure-based optimization led to a cellularly active tool compound that shows inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and proliferation in RAS-mutant cancer models, most notably in NRAS(Q61*) settings. These findings provide evidence for a neomorph SHOC2–(canonical)RAS protein interaction that is pharmacologically actionable and relevant to cancer sustenance. Overall, this work provides the concept validation and foundation for developing new therapies at the core of the RAS signalling pathway. A study of dependencies associated with cancer-causing mutations has identified a small molecule that binds to SHOC2 and inhibits RAS signalling in cells carrying NRAS Q61 mutations, a common oncogenic driver in melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Metal-halide perovskites are promising light-emitter candidates for next-generation light-emitting diodes (LEDs)1–8. Achieving high brightness and efficiency simultaneously in pure-red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) is an ongoing goal9,10. Three-dimensional (3D) CsPbI3-xBrx emitters have excellent carrier transport capability and high colour purity, which could allow efficient and ultrabright pure-red PeLEDs. However, such devices are prone to efficiency roll-off, resulting in low efficiency and low brightness under high current density. Here, by using electrically excited transient absorption spectroscopy, we discovered the efficiency roll-off was induced by hole leakage. Therefore, we developed a CsPbI3-xBrx intragrain heterostructure containing narrow bandgap emitters and wide bandgap barriers to confine the injected carriers. The wide bandgap barrier was incorporated by introducing strongly bonding molecules into the [PbX6]4− framework to expand the 3D CsPbI3-xBrx lattice. This strategy resulted in bright and efficient pure-red PeLEDs, with a high brightness of 24,600 cd m−2, maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.2% and low efficiency roll-off, maintaining a 10.5% external quantum efficiency at a high luminance of 22,670 cd m−2. To increase the efficiency, brightness and stability of next-generation light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the microstructure of CsPbI3-xBrx metal-halide perovskite, a good pure-red emitter, was altered to fix hole leakage, which was identified as decreasing efficiencies in overworked LEDs.",

    "abstract": "Hilbert space dimension is a key resource for quantum information processing1,2. Not only is a large overall Hilbert space an essential requirement for quantum error correction, but a large local Hilbert space can also be advantageous for realizing gates and algorithms more efficiently3–7. As a result, there has been considerable experimental effort in recent years to develop quantum computing platforms using qudits (d-dimensional quantum systems with d > 2) as the fundamental unit of quantum information8–19. Just as with qubits, quantum error correction of these qudits will be necessary in the long run, but so far, error correction of logical qudits has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here we report the experimental realization of an error-corrected logical qutrit (d = 3) and ququart (d = 4), which was achieved with the Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill bosonic code20. Using a reinforcement learning agent21,22, we optimized the Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill qutrit (ququart) as a ternary (quaternary) quantum memory and achieved beyond break-even error correction with a gain of 1.82 ± 0.03 (1.87 ± 0.03). This work represents a novel way of leveraging the large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator to realize hardware-efficient quantum error correction. Quantum error correction of a logical qutrit and ququart were experimentally realized beyond the break-even point with the Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill bosonic code.",

    "abstract": "Signals from the microenvironment are known to be critical for development, stem cell self-renewal and oncogenic progression. Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified1–5, concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies6 to identify LSC–niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine–taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)-driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies. The taurine–taurine transporter axis is a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias.",

    "abstract": "The Moon undergoes periodic tidal forcing due to its eccentric and oblique orbit around the Earth1. The response to this tidal interaction drives temporal changes in the lunar gravity field and is sensitive to the satellite’s internal structure2–4. We use data from the NASA GRAIL spacecraft5–9 to recover the time-varying lunar gravity field, including a degree-3 gravitational tidal Love number, k3. Here, we report our estimated value of k3 = 0.0163 ± 0.0007, which is about 72% higher than that expected for a spherically symmetric moon10. Such a large k3 can be explained if the elastic shear modulus of the mantle varies by about 2–3% between the nearside and farside4, providing an observational demonstration of lateral heterogeneities in the deep lunar interior. This asymmetric structure suggests preservation of a predominantly thermal anomaly of roughly 100–200 K in the nearside mantle that formed surface mare regions 3–4 billion years ago11 and could influence the spatial distribution of deep moonquakes12. Data from the NASA GRAIL spacecraft recover the lunar gravity field suggesting preservation of a predominantly thermal anomaly in the nearside mantle, which could influence the spatial distribution of deep moonquakes.",

    "abstract": "Around 40% of the US population and 1 in 6 individuals worldwide have obesity, with the incidence surging globally1,2. Various dietary interventions, including carbohydrate, fat and, more recently, amino acid restriction, have been explored to combat this epidemic3–6. Here we investigated the impact of removing individual amino acids on the weight profiles of mice. We show that conditional cysteine restriction resulted in the most substantial weight loss when compared to essential amino acid restriction, amounting to 30% within 1 week, which was readily reversed. We found that cysteine deficiency activated the integrated stress response and oxidative stress response, which amplify each other, leading to the induction of GDF15 and FGF21, partly explaining the phenotype7–9. Notably, we observed lower levels of tissue coenzyme A (CoA), which has been considered to be extremely stable10, resulting in reduced mitochondrial functionality and metabolic rewiring. This results in energetically inefficient anaerobic glycolysis and defective tricarboxylic acid cycle, with sustained urinary excretion of pyruvate, orotate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, nitrogen-rich compounds and amino acids. In summary, our investigation reveals that cysteine restriction, by depleting GSH and CoA, exerts a maximal impact on weight loss, metabolism and stress signalling compared with other amino acid restrictions. These findings suggest strategies for addressing a range of metabolic diseases and the growing obesity crisis. Conditional cysteine restriction in mice causes substantial weight loss, exceeding that seen with essential amino acid restriction, by activating the integrated stress and oxidative stress responses, and by unexpectedly depleting coenzyme A, leading to metabolic inefficiency.",

    "abstract": "Lakes are crucial for ecosystems1, greenhouse gas emissions2 and water resources3, yet their surface-extent dynamics, particularly seasonality, remain poorly understood at continental to global scales owing to limitations in satellite observations4,5. Although previous studies have focused on long-term changes6–8, comprehensive assessments of seasonality have been constrained by trade-offs between spatial resolution and temporal resolution in single-source satellite data. Here we show that seasonality is the dominant driver of lake-surface-extent variations globally. By leveraging a deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS and Landsat-based datasets, combined with high-performance computing, we achieved monthly mapping of 1.4 million lakes (2001–2023). Our approach yielded basin-level median user’s and producer’s accuracies of 93% and 96%, respectively, when validated against the Global Surface Water dataset7. Seasonality-dominated lakes constitute 66% of the global lake area and approximately 60% of total lake counts, with over 90% of the world’s population residing in regions where such lakes prevail. During seasonality-induced extreme events, the impacts can exceed the combined magnitude of 23-year long-term changes and regular seasonal variations, doubling the contraction of 42% of shrinking lakes and fully offsetting the expansion of 45% of growing lakes. These results uncover previously hidden seasonal dynamics that are crucial for understanding hydrospheric responses to environmental changes9, protecting lacustrine systems10–12 and improving global climate models13,14. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating seasonality into future research and suggest that advancements in the fusion of multisource remote-sensing data offer a promising path forward. Monthly mapping of multisource remote-sensing data for 1.4 million lakes reveals that seasonality is the dominant driver of lake-surface-extent variations globally.",

    "abstract": "Scientists and inventors set the direction of their work amid evolving questions, opportunities and challenges, yet the understanding of pivots between research areas and their outcomes remains limited1–5. Theories of creative search highlight the potential benefits of exploration but also emphasize difficulties in moving beyond one’s expertise6–14. Here we introduce a measurement framework to quantify how far researchers move from their existing work, and apply it to millions of papers and patents. We find a pervasive ‘pivot penalty’, in which the impact of new research steeply declines the further a researcher moves from their previous work. The pivot penalty applies nearly universally across science and patenting, and has been growing in magnitude over the past five decades. Larger pivots further exhibit weak engagement with established mixtures of prior knowledge, lower publication success rates and less market impact. Unexpected shocks to the research landscape, which may push researchers away from existing areas or pull them into new ones, further demonstrate substantial pivot penalties, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pivot penalty generalizes across fields, career stage, productivity, collaboration and funding contexts, highlighting both the breadth and depth of the adaptive challenge. Overall, the findings point to large and increasing challenges in effectively adapting to new opportunities and threats, with implications for individual researchers, research organizations, science policy and the capacity of science and society as a whole to confront emergent demands. An analysis of millions of scientific papers and patents reveals a ‘pivot penalty’ when researchers shift direction, with the impact of studies decreasing rapidly the further they move from their previous work.",

    "abstract": "Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe a broad range of phenomena in condensed matter and particle physics. A prominent example is confinement, responsible for bounding quarks inside hadrons such as protons or neutrons1. When quark–antiquark pairs are separated, the energy stored in the string of gluon fields connecting them grows linearly with their distance, until there is enough energy to create new pairs from the vacuum and break the string. Although these phenomena are ubiquitous in LGTs, simulating the resulting dynamics is a challenging task2. Here we report the observation of string breaking in synthetic quantum matter using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays3–5. We show that a (2 + 1)-dimensional LGT with dynamical matter can be efficiently implemented when the atoms are placed on a Kagome geometry6, with a local U(1) symmetry emerging from the Rydberg blockade7. Long-range Rydberg interactions naturally give rise to a linear confining potential for a pair of charges, allowing us to tune both their masses and the string tension. We experimentally probe string breaking in equilibrium by adiabatically preparing the ground state of the atom array in the presence of defects, distinguishing regions within the confined phase dominated by fluctuating strings or by broken string configurations. Finally, by harnessing local control over the atomic detuning, we quench string states and observe string-breaking dynamics exhibiting a many-body resonance phenomenon. Our work provides opportunities for exploring phenomena in high-energy physics using programmable quantum simulators. A quantum simulation of a (2 + 1)-dimensional lattice gauge theory is carried out on a quantum computer working with neutral atoms trapped by optical tweezers in a Kagome geometry.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the hippocampus are correlated with different variables, including space, time, sensory cues, rewards and actions, in which the extent of tuning depends on ongoing task demands1–8. However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or whether a more generic computation can account for these observations9. Here, to disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice in which space, auditory tones, rewards and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans and modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans towards deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues. Using high-density electrophysiological recordings, how internally generated cell assemblies are updated by action plans to meet external goals is explored.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, which is strongly associated with obesity1, causing sensory loss and, in some patients, neuropathic pain2,3. Although the onset and progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is linked with dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia4, the contribution of inflammation to peripheral neuropathy pathogenesis has not been investigated. Here we used a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD), which induces obesity and prediabetic metabolic changes, to study the onset of peripheral neuropathy. Mice fed the HFHFD developed persistent heat hypoalgesia after 3 months, but a reduction in epidermal skin nerve fibre density manifested only at 6 months. Using single-cell sequencing, we found that CCR2+ macrophages infiltrate the sciatic nerves of HFHFD-fed mice well before axonal degeneration is detectable. These infiltrating macrophages share gene expression similarities with nerve-crush-induced macrophages5 and express neurodegeneration-associated microglial marker genes6, although there is no axon loss or demyelination. Inhibiting the macrophage recruitment by genetically or pharmacologically blocking CCR2 signalling resulted in more severe heat hypoalgesia and accelerated skin denervation, as did deletion of Lgals3, a gene expressed in recruited macrophages. Recruitment of macrophages into the peripheral nerves of obese prediabetic mice is, therefore, neuroprotective, delaying terminal sensory axon degeneration by means of galectin 3. Potentiating and sustaining early neuroprotective immune responses in patients could slow or prevent peripheral neuropathy. A study in a mouse model of obesity and prediabetes demonstrates that recruitment of macrophages to nerves has a protective role in diet-induced peripheral neuropathy.",

    "abstract": "The breakdown of cellulose is one of the most important reactions in nature1,2 and is central to biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals3. However, the microfibrillar organization of cellulose and its complex interactions with other components of the plant cell wall poses a major challenge for enzymatic conversion4. Here, by mining the metagenomic ‘dark matter’ (unclassified DNA with unknown function) of a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, we discovered a metalloenzyme that oxidatively cleaves cellulose. This metalloenzyme acts on cellulose through an exo-type mechanism with C1 regioselectivity, resulting exclusively in cellobionic acid as a product. The crystal structure reveals a catalytic copper buried in a compact jelly-roll scaffold that features a flattened cellulose binding site. This metalloenzyme exhibits a homodimeric configuration that enables in situ hydrogen peroxide generation by one subunit while the other is productively interacting with cellulose. The secretome of an engineered strain of the fungus Trichoderma reesei expressing this metalloenzyme boosted the glucose release from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass under industrially relevant conditions, demonstrating its biotechnological potential. This discovery modifies the current understanding of bacterial redox enzymatic systems devoted to overcoming biomass recalcitrance5–7. Furthermore, it enables the conversion of agro-industrial residues into value-added bioproducts, thereby contributing to the transition to a sustainable and bio-based economy. A metalloenzyme capable of oxidatively cleaving cellulose, found in a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, could enable sustainable biofuel production.",

    "abstract": "Haematopoietic stem cells maintain blood production throughout life1. Although extensively characterized using the laboratory mouse, little is known about clonal selection and population dynamics of the haematopoietic stem cell pool during murine ageing. We isolated stem cells and progenitors from young and old mice, identifying 221,890 somatic mutations genome-wide in 1,845 single-cell-derived colonies. Mouse stem cells and progenitors accrue approximately 45 somatic mutations per year, a rate only approximately threefold greater than human progenitors despite the vastly different organismal sizes and lifespans. Phylogenetic patterns show that stem and multipotent progenitor cell pools are established during embryogenesis, after which they independently self-renew in parallel over life, evenly contributing to differentiated progenitors and peripheral blood. The stem cell pool grows steadily over the mouse lifespan to about 70,000 cells, self-renewing about every 6 weeks. Aged mice did not display the profound loss of clonal diversity characteristic of human haematopoietic ageing. However, targeted sequencing showed small, expanded clones in the context of murine ageing, which were larger and more numerous following haematological perturbations, exhibiting a selection landscape similar to humans. Our data illustrate both conserved features of population dynamics of blood and distinct patterns of age-associated somatic evolution in the short-lived mouse. Isolating and studying haematopoietic stem cells in young and aged mice demonstrates evolutionary processes related to blood production and provides a framework for interpreting future work using laboratory mice to study stem cell ageing.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates nucleocytoplasmic exchange, catalysing a massive flux of protein and nucleic acid material in both directions1. Distinct trafficking pathways for import and export would be an elegant solution to avoid unproductive collisions and opposing movements. However, the three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale spatiotemporal dynamics of macromolecules traversing the NPC remains challenging to visualize on the timescale of millisecond-scale transport events. Here we used 3D MINFLUX2 to identify the nuclear pore scaffold and then to simultaneously monitor both nuclear import and nuclear export, thereby establishing that both transport processes occur in overlapping regions of the central pore. Whereas translocation-arrested import complexes bound at the pore periphery, tracks of translocating complexes within the central pore region revealed a preference for an approximately 40- to 50-nm diameter annulus with minimal circumferential movement, indicating activity-dependent confinement within the permeability barrier. Movement within the pore was approximately 1,000-fold slower than in solution and was interspersed with pauses, indicating a highly restricted environment with structural constraints and/or transient binding events during transport. These results demonstrate that high spatiotemporal precision with reduced photobleaching is a major advantage of MINFLUX tracking, and that the NPC permeability barrier is divided into annular rings with distinct functional properties. High spatiotemporal precision tracking using 3D MINFLUX shows that nuclear import and export occur in overlapping regions of the central pore, providing insight into transport across the nuclear pore complex.",

    "abstract": "Limited strategies exist for chemical recycling of commodity diene polymers, like those found in tyres1–3. Here we apply C–H amination and backbone rearrangement of polymers to deconstruct these materials into precursors for epoxy resins. Specifically, we develop a sulfur diimide reagent4,5 that enables up to about 35% allylic amination of diene polymers and rubber. Then, we apply the cationic 2-aza-Cope rearrangement to deconstruct aminated diene polymers. In a model system, we see molecular weight reduction from 58,100 to approximately 400 g mol−1, and aminated post-consumer rubber is deconstructed over 6 hours into soluble amine-functionalized polymers, which can be utilized to prepare epoxy thermosets with similar stiffnesses to commercial bisphenol A-derived resins6. Altogether, this work demonstrates the power of C–H amination and backbone rearrangement to enable chemical recycling of post-consumer materials. Deconstruction of rubber is achieved using C–H amination and aza-Cope rearrangement to provide precursors for epoxy resins.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is the third most rapidly growing health condition associated with disability, after dementia and diabetes1. By 2050, the total number of patients with osteoarthritis is estimated to reach 1 billion worldwide2. As no disease-modifying treatments exist for osteoarthritis, a better understanding of disease aetiopathology is urgently needed. Here we perform a genome-wide association study meta-analyses across up to 489,975 cases and 1,472,094 controls, establishing 962 independent associations, 513 of which have not been previously reported. Using single-cell multiomics data, we identify signal enrichment in embryonic skeletal development pathways. We integrate orthogonal lines of evidence, including transcriptome, proteome and epigenome profiles of primary joint tissues, and implicate 700 effector genes. Within these, we find rare coding-variant burden associations with effect sizes that are consistently higher than common frequency variant associations. We highlight eight biological processes in which we find convergent involvement of multiple effector genes, including the circadian clock, glial-cell-related processes and pathways with an established role in osteoarthritis (TGFβ, FGF, WNT, BMP and retinoic acid signalling, and extracellular matrix organization). We find that 10% of the effector genes express a protein that is the target of approved drugs, offering repurposing opportunities, which can accelerate translation. A genome-wide association study meta-analysis combined with multiomics data of osteoarthritis identifies 700 effector genes as well as biological processes with a convergent involvement of multiple effector genes; 10% of these genes express the target of approved drugs.",

    "abstract": "The amputation of a salamander limb triggers anterior and posterior connective tissue cells to form distinct signalling centres that together fuel regeneration1. Anterior and posterior identities are established during development and are thought to persist for the whole life in the form of positional memory2. However, the molecular basis of positional memory and whether positional memory can be altered remain unknown. Here, we identify a positive-feedback loop that is responsible for posterior identity in the limb of an axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). Posterior cells express residual Hand2 transcription factor from development, and this primes them to form a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh signalling is also upstream of Hand2 expression. After regeneration, Shh is shut down but Hand2 is sustained, safeguarding posterior memory. We used this regeneration circuitry to convert anterior cells to a posterior-cell memory state. Transient exposure of anterior cells to Shh during regeneration kick-started an ectopic Hand2–Shh loop, leading to stable Hand2 expression and lasting competence to express Shh. Our results implicate positive-feedback in the stability of positional memory and reveal that positional memory is reprogrammed more easily in one direction (anterior to posterior) than in the other. Modifying positional memory in regenerative cells changes their signalling outputs, which has implications for tissue engineering. A molecular analysis of axolotl limb regeneration has identified a positive genetic circuit that maintains posterior cell identity and can be used to reprogramme anterior cells into posterior cells.",

    "abstract": "Chiral superconductors are unconventional superconducting states that break time-reversal symmetry spontaneously and typically feature Cooper pairing at non-zero angular momentum. Such states may host Majorana fermions and provide an important platform for topological physics research and fault-tolerant quantum computing1–7. Despite intensive search and prolonged studies of several candidate systems8–26, chiral superconductivity has remained elusive so far. Here we report the discovery of robust unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer and pentalayer graphene without moiré superlattice effects. We observed two superconducting states in the gate-induced flat conduction bands with Tc up to 300 mK and charge density ne down to 2.4 × 1011 cm−2 in five devices. Spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking (TRSB) owing to orbital motion of the electron is found and several observations indicate the chiral nature of these superconducting states, including: (1) in the superconducting state, Rxx shows magnetic hysteresis in varying out-of-plane magnetic field B⊥—absent from all other superconductors; (2) the superconducting states are robust against in-plane magnetic field and are developed within a spin-polarized and valley-polarized quarter-metal (QM) phase; (3) the normal states show anomalous Hall signals at zero magnetic field and magnetic hysteresis. We also observed a critical B⊥ of 1.4 T, higher than any graphene superconductivity, which indicates a strong-coupling superconductivity close to the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS)–Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) crossover27. Our observations establish a pure carbon material for the study of topological superconductivity, with the promise to explore Majorana modes and topological quantum computing. Observations indicating the chiral nature of superconducting states in five rhombohedral tetralayer and pentalayer graphene devices without moiré superlattice effects are reported, establishing a pure carbon material for the study of topological superconductivity.",

    "abstract": "The rapid melting of mountain glaciers and the vanishing of their streams is emblematic of climate change1,2. Glacier-fed streams (GFSs) are cold, oligotrophic and unstable ecosystems in which life is dominated by microbial biofilms2,3. However, current knowledge on the GFS microbiome is scarce4,5, precluding an understanding of its response to glacier shrinkage. Here, by leveraging metabarcoding and metagenomics, we provide a comprehensive survey of bacteria in the benthic microbiome across 152 GFSs draining the Earth’s major mountain ranges. We find that the GFS bacterial microbiome is taxonomically and functionally distinct from other cryospheric microbiomes. GFS bacteria are diverse, with more than half being specific to a given mountain range, some unique to single GFSs and a few cosmopolitan and abundant. We show how geographic isolation and environmental selection shape their biogeography, which is characterized by distinct compositional patterns between mountain ranges and hemispheres. Phylogenetic analyses furthermore uncovered microdiverse clades resulting from environmental selection, probably promoting functional resilience and contributing to GFS bacterial biodiversity and biogeography. Climate-induced glacier shrinkage puts this unique microbiome at risk. Our study provides a global reference for future climate-change microbiology studies on the vanishing GFS ecosystem. Leveraging metabarcoding and metagenomics, a survey of bacteria in the benthic microbiome across 152 glacier-fed streams (GFSs) provides a global reference for future climate-change microbiology studies on the vanishing GFS ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "The oestrogen receptor (ER or ERα), a nuclear hormone receptor that drives most breast cancer1, is commonly activated by phosphorylation at serine 118 within its intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain2,3. Although this modification enables oestrogen-independent ER function, its mechanism has remained unclear despite ongoing clinical trials of kinase inhibitors targeting this region4–6. By integration of small-angle X-ray scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with functional studies, we show that serine 118 phosphorylation triggers an unexpected expansion of the disordered domain and disrupts specific hydrophobic clustering between two aromatic-rich regions. Mutations mimicking this disruption rescue ER transcriptional activity, target-gene expression and cell growth impaired by a phosphorylation-deficient S118A mutation. These findings, driven by hydrophobic interactions, extend beyond electrostatic models and provide mechanistic insights into intrinsically disordered proteins7, with implications for other nuclear receptors8. This fundamental sequence–structure–function relationship advances our understanding of intrinsic ER disorder, crucial for developing targeted breast cancer therapeutics. Serine 118 phosphorylation drives conformational changes through the disruption of hydrophobic interactions between aromatic-rich clusters, showing how hydrophobic mutations can restore oestrogen receptor-mediated transcription.",

    "abstract": "Clouds greatly influence the Earth’s energy balance1,2. Observationally constraining cloud radiative feedback, a notably uncertain climate feedback mechanism3–5, is crucial for improving predictions of climate change5–7 but, so far, remains an elusive objective, and the feedback may be different over the ocean versus over land8–10. Here we show a local negative surface longwave cloud feedback over land at the southern Great Plains site, constrained by direct long-term observation of spectrally resolved downwelling longwave radiance11. This negative cloud feedback at the southern Great Plains site causes a −1.77 ± 1.15 W m−2 per decade change in downwelling longwave radiation and suggests that cloud changes may partially modulate the warming effect of increased greenhouse gas concentrations and atmospheric temperatures over land. Specifically, our results are derived from an optimal spectral fingerprinting method12–15 designed to separate surface longwave cloud feedback from other surface forcings and feedbacks, by making use of their unique spectral signatures13–18 in the long-term record of spectrally resolved radiances. Furthermore, we show that the results are not site specific: negative surface longwave cloud feedbacks, primarily induced by decreasing low cloud cover in warming climates, are commonly observed over land in reanalysis and satellite datasets. Our findings establish a pivotal observational benchmark of radiative forcing and feedback needed for validating climate model performance over land. Results derived from an optimal spectral fingerprinting method applied to reanalysis and satellite datasets show that low cloud cover in warming climates caused a reduction in downwelling longwave radiation over land, which is not site specific.",

    "abstract": "The ventrolateral pallial (VLp) excitatory neurons in the claustro-amygdalar complex and piriform cortex (PIR; which forms part of the palaeocortex) form reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), integrating cognitive and sensory information that results in adaptive behaviours1–5. Early-life disruptions in these circuits are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders4–8, highlighting the importance of understanding their development. Here we reveal that the transcription factors SOX4, SOX11 and TFAP2D have a pivotal role in the development, identity and PFC connectivity of these excitatory neurons. The absence of SOX4 and SOX11 in post-mitotic excitatory neurons results in a marked reduction in the size of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), claustrum (CLA) and PIR. These transcription factors control BLC formation through direct regulation of Tfap2d expression. Cross-species analyses, including in humans, identified conserved Tfap2d expression in developing excitatory neurons of BLC, CLA, PIR and the associated transitional areas of the frontal, insular and temporal cortex. Although the loss and haploinsufficiency of Tfap2d yield similar alterations in learned threat-response behaviours, differences emerge in the phenotypes at different Tfap2d dosages, particularly in terms of changes observed in BLC size and BLC–PFC connectivity. This underscores the importance of Tfap2d dosage in orchestrating developmental shifts in BLC–PFC connectivity and behavioural modifications that resemble symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings reveal key elements of a conserved gene regulatory network that shapes the development and function of crucial VLp excitatory neurons and their PFC connectivity and offer insights into their evolution and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. A conserved gene regulatory network involving SOX4, SOX11 and TFAP2D shapes the development of excitatory neurons in ventrolateral pallium and their connectivity with the prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "The amount of methane released to the atmosphere from the Nord Stream subsea pipeline leaks remains uncertain, as reflected in a wide range of estimates1–18. A lack of information regarding the temporal variation in atmospheric emissions has made it challenging to reconcile pipeline volumetric (bottom-up) estimates1–8 with measurement-based (top-down) estimates8–18. Here we simulate pipeline rupture emission rates and integrate these with methane dissolution and sea-surface outgassing estimates9,10 to model the evolution of atmospheric emissions from the leaks. We verify our modelled atmospheric emissions by comparing them with top-down point-in-time emission-rate estimates and cumulative emission estimates derived from airborne11, satellite8,12–14 and tall tower data. We obtain consistency between our modelled atmospheric emissions and top-down estimates and find that 465 ± 20 thousand metric tons of methane were emitted to the atmosphere. Although, to our knowledge, this represents the largest recorded amount of methane released from a single transient event, it is equivalent to 0.1% of anthropogenic methane emissions for 2022. The impact of the leaks on the global atmospheric methane budget brings into focus the numerous other anthropogenic methane sources that require mitigation globally. Our analysis demonstrates that diverse, complementary measurement approaches are needed to quantify methane emissions in support of the Global Methane Pledge19. Modelling of the evolution of atmospheric methane emissions from the 2022 Nord Stream subsea pipeline leaks shows that the event emitted the largest recorded amount of methane from a single transient event.",

    "abstract": "Creating the Babel Fish, a tool that helps individuals translate speech between any two languages, requires advanced technological innovation and linguistic expertise. Although conventional speech-to-speech translation systems composed of multiple subsystems performing translation in a cascaded fashion exist1–3, scalable and high-performing unified systems4,5 remain underexplored. To address this gap, here we introduce SEAMLESSM4T–Massively Multilingual and Multimodal Machine Translation–a single model that supports speech-to-speech translation (101 to 36 languages), speech-to-text translation (from 101 to 96 languages), text-to-speech translation (from 96 to 36 languages), text-to-text translation (96 languages) and automatic speech recognition (96 languages). Built using a new multimodal corpus of automatically aligned speech translations and other publicly available data, SEAMLESSM4T is one of the first multilingual systems that can translate from and into English for both speech and text. Moreover, it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art cascaded systems, achieving up to 8% and 23% higher BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores in speech-to-text and speech-to-speech tasks, respectively. Beyond quality, when tested for robustness, our system is, on average, approximately 50% more resilient against background noise and speaker variations in speech-to-text tasks than the previous state-of-the-art systems. We evaluated SEAMLESSM4T on added toxicity and gender bias to assess translation safety. For the former, we included two strategies for added toxicity mitigation working at either training or inference time. Finally, all contributions in this work are publicly available for non-commercial use to propel further research on inclusive speech translation technologies. SEAMLESSM4T is a single machine translation tool that supports speech-to-speech translation, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech translation, text-to-text translation and automatic speech recognition between up to 100 languages.",

    "abstract": "Tolerance to dietary antigens is critical for avoiding deleterious type 2 immune responses resulting in food allergy (FA) and anaphylaxis1,2. However, the mechanisms resulting in both the maintenance and failure of tolerance to food antigens are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the goblet-cell-derived resistin-like molecule β (RELMβ)3,4 is a critical regulator of oral tolerance. RELMβ is abundant in the sera of both patients with FA and mouse models of FA. Deletion of RELMβ protects mice from FA and the development of food-antigen-specific IgE and anaphylaxis. RELMβ disrupts food tolerance through the modulation of the gut microbiome and depletion of indole-metabolite-producing Lactobacilli and Alistipes. Tolerance is maintained by the local production of indole derivatives driving FA protective RORγt+ regulatory T (Treg) cells5 through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. RELMβ antagonism in the peri-weaning period restores oral tolerance and protects genetically prone offspring from developing FA later in life. Together, we show that RELMβ mediates a gut immune–epithelial circuit regulating tolerance to food antigens—a novel mode of innate control of adaptive immunity through microbiome editing—and identify targetable candidates in this circuit for prevention and treatment of FA. RELMβ mediates a gut immune–epithelial circuit regulating tolerance to food antigens, offering targetable candidates for the prevention and treatment of food allergies.",

Following pathogen recognition by nucleotide binding-domain, leucine-rich, repeat-containing (NLR) proteins, CARDs recruit and activate caspases, which, in turn, activate gasdermin pore-forming proteins to induce pyroptotic cell death2. Here we show that CARD domains are present in defence systems that protect bacteria against phage. The bacterial CARD domain is essential for protease-mediated activation of certain bacterial gasdermins, which promote cell death once phage infection is recognized. We further show that multiple anti-phage defence systems use CARD domains to activate a variety of cell death effectors, and that CARD domains mediate protein–protein interactions in these systems. We find that these systems are triggered by a conserved immune-evasion protein used by phages to overcome the bacterial defence system RexAB3, demonstrating that phage proteins inhibiting one defence system can activate another. Our results suggest that CARD domains represent an ancient component of innate immune systems conserved from bacteria to humans, and that CARD-dependent activation of gasdermins is shared in organisms across the tree of life. Caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) are present in defence systems that protect bacteria against phage, where the bacterial CARD domain is essential for protease-mediated activation of bacterial gasdermins that promote cell death.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that migratory animals exploit the magnetic field of the Earth for navigation, both as a compass to determine direction and as a map to determine geographical position1. It has long been proposed that, to navigate using a magnetic map, animals must learn the magnetic coordinates of the destination2,3, yet the pivotal hypothesis that animals can learn magnetic signatures of geographical areas has, to our knowledge, yet to be tested. Here we report that an iconic navigating species, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), can learn such information. When fed repeatedly in magnetic fields replicating those that exist in particular oceanic locations, juvenile turtles learned to distinguish magnetic fields in which they encountered food from magnetic fields that exist elsewhere, an ability that might underlie foraging site fidelity. Conditioned responses in this new magnetic map assay were unaffected by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields, a treatment expected to disrupt radical-pair-based chemical magnetoreception4–6, suggesting that the magnetic map sense of the turtle does not rely on this mechanism. By contrast, orientation behaviour that required use of the magnetic compass was disrupted by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields. The findings provide evidence that two different mechanisms of magnetoreception underlie the magnetic map and magnetic compass in sea turtles. Loggerhead sea turtles, which undergo long-distance migrations, can learn magnetic signatures associated with different geographic areas and have two different magnetic senses, each based on a different underlying mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genomes are folded through the distinct actions of structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complexes, which include the chromatin loop-extruding cohesin (extrusive cohesin), the sister chromatid cohesive cohesin and the mitotic chromosome-associated condensins1–3. Although these complexes function at different stages of the cell cycle, they exist together on chromatin during the G2-to-M phase transition, when the genome structure undergoes substantial reorganization1,2. Yet, how the different SMC complexes affect each other and how their interactions orchestrate the dynamic folding of the three-dimensional genome remain unclear. Here we engineered all possible cohesin and condensin configurations on mitotic chromosomes to delineate the concerted, mutually influential action of SMC complexes. We show that condensin disrupts the binding of extrusive cohesin at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites, thereby promoting the disassembly of interphase topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops during mitotic progression. Conversely, extrusive cohesin impedes condensin-mediated mitotic chromosome spiralization. Condensin reduces peaks of cohesive cohesin, whereas cohesive cohesin antagonizes condensin-mediated longitudinal shortening of mitotic chromosomes. The presence of both extrusive and cohesive cohesin synergizes these effects and inhibits mitotic chromosome condensation. Extrusive cohesin positions cohesive cohesin at CTCF-binding sites. However, cohesive cohesin by itself cannot be arrested by CTCF molecules and is insufficient to establish TADs or loops. Moreover, it lacks loop-extrusion capacity, which indicates that cohesive cohesin has nonoverlapping functions with extrusive cohesin. Finally, cohesive cohesin restricts chromatin loop expansion mediated by extrusive cohesin. Collectively, our data describe a three-way interaction among major SMC complexes that dynamically modulates chromatin architecture during cell cycle progression. Orthogonal acute inducible degradation cell lines are used to delineate the mechanisms of how extrusive cohesin, cohesive cohesin and condensin interact to remodel chromosome architecture from interphase to mitosis.",

    "abstract": "The search for simple principles that underlie the spatial structure and dynamics of plant communities is a long-standing challenge in ecology1–6. In particular, the relationship between species coexistence and the spatial distribution of plants is challenging to resolve in species-rich communities7–9. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the spatial patterns of 720 tree species in 21 large forest plots and their consequences for species coexistence. We show that species with low abundance tend to be more spatially aggregated than more abundant species. Moreover, there is a latitudinal gradient in the strength of this negative aggregation–abundance relationship that increases from tropical to temperate forests. We suggest, in line with recent work10, that latitudinal gradients in animal seed dispersal11 and mycorrhizal associations12–14 may jointly generate this pattern. By integrating the observed spatial patterns into population models8, we derive the conditions under which species can invade from low abundance in terms of spatial patterns, demography, niche overlap and immigration. Evaluation of the spatial-invasion condition for the 720 tree species analysed suggests that temperate and tropical forests both meet the invasion criterion to a similar extent but through contrasting strategies conditioned by their spatial patterns. Our approach opens up new avenues for the integration of observed spatial patterns into ecological theory and underscores the need to understand the interaction among spatial patterns at the neighbourhood scale and multiple ecological processes in greater detail. A unified framework is presented that integrates observed spatial patterns of individual trees in forests with ecological processes into a novel coexistence theory.",

    "abstract": "Rates of lineage diversification vary considerably across the tree of life, often as a result of evolutionary innovations1–5. Although the ability to produce new traits can vary between clades and may drive ecological transitions6–9, the impact of differences in the pace at which innovations evolve at macroevolutionary scales has been overlooked. Complex teeth are one innovation that contributed to the evolutionary success of major vertebrate lineages10–12. Here we show that evolutionary lability of tooth complexity, but not complexity itself, spurs rapid diversification across ray-finned fishes. Speciation rates are five times higher when transitions between simple and complex teeth occur rapidly. We find that African cichlids are unique among all fishes; they are dominated by lineages that transition between simple and complex teeth at unparalleled rates. This innovation interacted with the ecological versatility of complex teeth to spur rapid adaptive radiations in lakes Malawi, Victoria and Barombi Mbo. The marked effect on diversification stems from the tight association of tooth complexity with microhabitat and diet. Our results show that phylogenetic variation in how innovations evolve can have a stronger effect on patterns of diversification than the innovation itself. Investigating the impact of innovations from this new perspective will probably implicate more traits in causing heterogeneous diversification rates across the tree of life. A study shows that the rapid diversification of cichlids in African lakes is driven by their ability to evolve between having simple or complex teeth.",

Artificial atoms mimic real atoms by demonstrating discrete energy levels attributable to quantum confinement3–8. As such, they offer a solid-state analogue for simulating intra-atomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation. Signatures of interatomic bond formation have been extensively observed in various artificial atoms9–17. However, direct evidence of the intra-atomic orbital hybridization in the artificial atoms remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Here we realize the orbital hybridization in artificial atoms by altering the shape of the artificial atoms. The anisotropy of the confining potential gives rise to the hybridization between quasibound states with different orbital quantum numbers within the artificial atom. These hybridized orbits are directly visualized in real space in our experiment and are well reproduced by both numerical calculations and analytical derivations. Our study opens an avenue for designing artificial matter that cannot be accessed on real atoms through experiments. Moreover, the results obtained inspire the progressive control of quantum states in diverse systems. Orbital hybridization in artificial atoms is achieved by altering their shape, and the anisotropy of the confining potential gives rise to the hybridization between quasibound states with different orbital quantum numbers within the artificial atom.",

    "abstract": "Mergers of binary neutron stars emit signals in both the gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic spectra. Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 (refs. 1,2) led to scientific discoveries across cosmology3, nuclear physics4–6 and gravity7. Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from the GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated electromagnetic transient, AT 2017gfo (ref. 8), 11 h after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive electromagnetic observations. However, owing to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here we present a machine-learning framework that performs complete binary neutron star inference in just 1 s without making any such approximations. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing: (1) accurate localization even before the merger; (2) improved localization precision by around 30% compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (3) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors. Analysis of gravitational waves from merging binary neutron stars was accelerated using machine learning, enabling full low-latency parameter estimation and enhancing the potential for multi-messenger observations.",

    "abstract": "To survive in dynamic environments with uncertain resources, animals must adapt their behaviour flexibly, choosing strategies such as persevering with a current choice, exploring alternatives or disengaging altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal strategies during such decisions1–5. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioural strategies such as persevering, exploring or disengaging remain poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub that is critical for flexible switching between behavioural strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations, fibre photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behaviours, we found that the main cell types of the MRN—GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic (VGluT2+) and serotonergic neurons—have complementary functions and regulate perseverance, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons—for instance, through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus, which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN—leads to perseverative behaviour. By contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2+ neurons drives exploration. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula that conveys negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioural switchboard that is uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioural strategies. These circuits thus may also have an important role in the aetiology of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders. Behavioural experiments in mice demonstrate that GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic and serotonergic neurons in the median raphe nucleus have distinct and complementary functions in regulating decision-making resulting in flexible behavioural strategies.",

    "abstract": "Tropical forest canopies are the biosphere’s most concentrated atmospheric interface for carbon, water and energy1,2. However, in most Earth System Models, the diverse and heterogeneous tropical forest biome is represented as a largely uniform ecosystem with either a singular or a small number of fixed canopy ecophysiological properties3. This situation arises, in part, from a lack of understanding about how and why the functional properties of tropical forest canopies vary geographically4. Here, by combining field-collected data from more than 1,800 vegetation plots and tree traits with satellite remote-sensing, terrain, climate and soil data, we predict variation across 13 morphological, structural and chemical functional traits of trees, and use this to compute and map the functional diversity of tropical forests. Our findings reveal that the tropical Americas, Africa and Asia tend to occupy different portions of the total functional trait space available across tropical forests. Tropical American forests are predicted to have 40% greater functional richness than tropical African and Asian forests. Meanwhile, African forests have the highest functional divergence—32% and 7% higher than that of tropical American and Asian forests, respectively. An uncertainty analysis highlights priority regions for further data collection, which would refine and improve these maps. Our predictions represent a ground-based and remotely enabled global analysis of how and why the functional traits of tropical forest canopies vary across space. Data from a variety of sources—including satellite, climate and soil data, as well as field-collected information on plant traits—are pooled and analysed to map the functional diversity of tropical forest canopies globally.",

    "abstract": "Frictional interfaces are found in systems ranging from biological joints to earthquake faults. When and how these interfaces slide is a fundamental problem in geosciences and engineering1–20. It is believed that there exists a threshold shear force, called static friction, below which the interface is stationary4,10, despite many studies suggesting that this concept is outdated1,21–28. By contrast, rate-and-state friction formulations1,26,27 predict that interfaces are always sliding29, but this feature is often considered an artefact that calls for modifications30. Here we show that nominally stationary interfaces subjected to constant shear and normal loads, with a driving force that is notably below the classically defined static friction for which creep is known to occur9,27–29, are sliding, but with diminishingly small rates down to 10−12 m s−1. Our precise measurements directly at the interface are enabled by digital image correlation18,31,32. This behaviour contradicts classical models of friction but confirms the prediction of rate-and-state friction1,26,27. The diminishing slip rates of nominally stationary interfaces reflect interface healing, which would manifest itself in higher peak friction in subsequent slip events15,27,33, such as earthquakes and landslides, substantially modifying their nucleation and propagation and hence their hazard3,12,13,34. Digital image correlation measurements show that nominally stationary interfaces subjected to constant shear and normal loads are sliding at extremely small rates, confirming the predictions of rate-and-state friction formulations.",

    "abstract": "Global ocean surface temperatures were at record levels for more than a year from April 2023 onwards, exceeding the previous record in 2015–2016 by 0.25 °C on average between April 2023 and March 20241. The nearly global extent and unprecedented intensity of this event prompted questions about how exceptional it was and whether climate models can represent such record-shattering jumps in surface ocean temperatures2. Here we construct observation-based synthetic time series to show that a jump in global sea surface temperatures that breaks the previous record by at least 0.25 °C is a 1-in-512-year event under the current long-term warming trend (1-in-205-year to 1-in-1,185-year event; 95% confidence interval). Without a global warming trend, such an event would have been practically impossible. Using 270 simulations from a wide range of fully coupled climate models, we show that these models successfully simulate such record-shattering jumps in global ocean surface temperatures, underpinning the models’ usefulness in understanding the characteristics, drivers and consequences of such events. These model simulations suggest that the record-shattering jump in surface ocean temperatures in 2023–2024 was an extreme event after which surface ocean temperatures are expected to revert to the expected long-term warming trend. Observations and climate models suggest that the global sea surface temperature jump in 2023–2024 was not unexpected and would have been nearly impossible without anthropogenic warming.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein complex that is essential for the uptake of pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix as the primary carbon source for the tricarboxylic acid cycle1,2. Here we present six cryo-electron microscopy structures of human MPC in three states: three structures in the intermembrane space (IMS)-open state, obtained in different conditions; a structure of pyruvate-treated MPC in the occluded state; and two structures in the matrix-facing state, bound with the inhibitor UK5099 or with an inhibitory nanobody on the matrix side. MPC is a heterodimer consisting of MPC1 and MPC2, with the transmembrane domain adopting pseudo-C2 symmetry. Approximate rigid-body movements occur between the IMS-open state and the occluded state, whereas structural changes, mainly on the matrix side, facilitate the transition between the occluded state and the matrix-facing state, revealing an alternating access mechanism during pyruvate transport. In the UK5099-bound structure, the inhibitor fits well and interacts extensively with a pocket that opens to the matrix side. Our findings provide key insights into the mechanisms that underlie MPC-mediated substrate transport, and shed light on the recognition and inhibition of MPC by UK5099, which will facilitate the future development of drugs that target MPC. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human mitochondrial pyruvate carrier provide insights into its architecture, substrate transport mechanism and inhibition by the drug UK5099, with implications for the development of treatments for various metabolic diseases.",

Existing theories centring on reward2, surprise3, salience4 and uncertainty5 individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others. Merging ideas from reinforcement learning theory6 with recent insights into the filtering properties of the dorsal raphe nucleus7, here we find a unifying perspective in a prospective code for value. This biological code for near-future reward explains why serotonin neurons are activated by both rewards and punishments3,4,8–13, and why these neurons are more strongly activated by surprising rewards but have no such surprise preference for punishments3,9—observations that previous theories have failed to reconcile. Finally, our model quantitatively predicts in vivo population activity better than previous theories. By reconciling previous theories and establishing a precise connection with reinforcement learning, our work represents an important step towards understanding the role of serotonin in learning and behaviour.

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) underlie human pathologies including cancer and neurodegeneration1,2. However, the proteins that sense ROS levels and regulate their production through their cysteine residues remain ill defined. Here, using systematic base-editing and computational screens, we identify cysteines in VPS35, a member of the retromer trafficking complex3, that phenocopy inhibition of mitochondrial translation when mutated. We find that VPS35 underlies a reactive metabolite-sensing pathway that lowers mitochondrial translation to decrease ROS levels. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide oxidizes cysteine residues in VPS35, resulting in retromer dissociation from endosomal membranes and subsequent plasma membrane remodelling. We demonstrate that plasma membrane localization of the retromer substrate SLC7A1 is required to sustain mitochondrial translation. Furthermore, decreasing VPS35 levels or oxidation of its ROS-sensing cysteines confers resistance to ROS-generating chemotherapies, including cisplatin, in ovarian cancer models. Thus, we identify that intracellular ROS levels are communicated to the plasma membrane through VPS35 to regulate mitochondrial translation, connecting cytosolic ROS sensing to mitochondrial ROS production. Systematic base-editing and computational screens identify specific cysteine residues on VPS35 in the retromer complex as key sensors that decrease mitochondrial translation in response to reactive oxygen species signals.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory T (Treg) cells, which specifically express the master transcription factor FOXP3, have a pivotal role in maintaining immunological tolerance and homeostasis and have the potential to revolutionize cell therapies for autoimmune diseases1–3. Although stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells in the presence of TGFβ and IL-2 can induce FOXP3+ Treg cells in vitro (iTreg cells), the resulting cells are often unstable and have thus far hampered translational efforts4–6. A systematic approach towards understanding the regulatory networks that dictate Treg differentiation could lead to more effective iTreg cell-based therapies. Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screen to catalogue gene regulatory determinants of FOXP3 induction in primary human T cells and characterized their effects at single-cell resolution using Perturb-icCITE-seq. We identify the RBPJ–NCOR repressor complex as a novel, context-specific negative regulator of FOXP3 expression. RBPJ-targeted knockout enhanced iTreg differentiation and function, independent of canonical Notch signalling. Repeated cytokine and T cell receptor signalling stimulation in vitro revealed that RBPJ-deficient iTreg cells exhibit increased phenotypic stability compared with control cells through DNA demethylation of the FOXP3 enhancer CNS2, reinforcing FOXP3 expression. Conversely, overexpression of RBPJ potently suppressed FOXP3 induction through direct modulation of FOXP3 histone acetylation by HDAC3. Finally, RBPJ-ablated human iTreg cells more effectively suppressed xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease than control iTreg cells in a humanized mouse model. Together, our findings reveal novel regulators of FOXP3 and point towards new avenues to improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy for autoimmune disease. The RBPJ–NCOR repressor complex is identified as a negative regulator of FOXP3 expression through modulation of histone acetylation in induced regulatory T cells.",

    "abstract": "One of the main interpretations of deep-rooted geophysical structures in the mantle1 is that they stem from the top-down solidification of the primitive basal magma ocean of Earth above the core2–6. However, it remains debated whether solids first formed at the bottom of the mantle, solidifying upward, or above the melts, solidifying downward. Here we show that gravitational segregation of dense, iron-rich melts from lighter, iron-poor solids drives mantle evolution, regardless of where melting curves and geotherms intersect. This process results in the accumulation of iron-oxide-rich melts above the core, forming a basal magma ocean. We numerically model mantle solidification using a new multiphase fluid dynamics approach that integrates melting phase relations and geochemical models. This enables estimating the compositional signature and spatial distribution of primordial geochemical reservoirs, which may be directly linked to the isotopic anomalies measured in Archean rocks7–11. We find that a substantial amount of solids is produced at the surface of the planet, not at depth, injecting geochemical signatures of shallow silicate fractionation in the deep mantle. This work could serve as a foundation for re-examining the intricate interplay between mantle dynamics, petrology and geochemistry during the first thousand million years of the evolution of rocky planets. As the early Earth solidified, gravitational segregation of dense, iron-rich melts drove mantle evolution, injecting geochemical signatures of shallow silicate fractionation into the deep mantle and inevitably forming a basal magma ocean.",

    "abstract": "Pyrazoles are heterocycles commonly found as key substructures in agrochemicals and medicinally active compounds alike1,2. Despite their pervasiveness, established methods fall notably short in delivering complex pyrazoles selectively due to issues of differentiation during either assembly or N-functionalization3. This is a direct consequence of a dominant synthetic strategy that attempts to control selectivity-determining bonds between poorly differentiated starting materials. To overcome this longstanding challenge, we here describe a prototypical example of an alternative conceptual approach, ‘strategic atom replacement’, in which we synthesize N-alkyl pyrazoles from isothiazoles. The net forward transformation is a ‘swap’ of the isothiazole sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom and its associated alkyl fragment to deliver the alkylated pyrazole4,5. Linking the two azoles is an orphaned heterocycle class, 1,2,3-thiadiazine-S-oxides, whose synthetic potential has yet to be tapped6. By proceeding through these unusual heterocycles, the typical selectivity and separation challenges associated with exclusively bond-based pyrazole preparations are circumvented, and even minimally differentiated peripheral substituents can be discriminated to afford isomerically pure products. A prototypical example of a ‘strategic atom replacement’ approach enables synthesis of N-alkyl pyrazoles from isothiazoles by swapping the sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom and its associated alkyl fragment to deliver the alkylated pyrazole.",

    "abstract": "Although it is one of the most arid regions today, the Sahara Desert was a green savannah during the African Humid Period (AHP) between 14,500 and 5,000 years before present, with water bodies promoting human occupation and the spread of pastoralism in the middle Holocene epoch1. DNA rarely preserves well in this region, limiting knowledge of the Sahara’s genetic history and demographic past. Here we report ancient genomic data from the Central Sahara, obtained from two approximately 7,000-year-old Pastoral Neolithic female individuals buried in the Takarkori rock shelter in southwestern Libya. The majority of Takarkori individuals’ ancestry stems from a previously unknown North African genetic lineage that diverged from sub-Saharan African lineages around the same time as present-day humans outside Africa and remained isolated throughout most of its existence. Both Takarkori individuals are closely related to ancestry first documented in 15,000-year-old foragers from Taforalt Cave, Morocco2, associated with the Iberomaurusian lithic industry and predating the AHP. Takarkori and Iberomaurusian-associated individuals are equally distantly related to sub-Saharan lineages, suggesting limited gene flow from sub-Saharan to Northern Africa during the AHP. In contrast to Taforalt individuals, who have half the Neanderthal admixture of non-Africans, Takarkori shows ten times less Neanderthal ancestry than Levantine farmers, yet significantly more than contemporary sub-Saharan genomes. Our findings suggest that pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into a deeply divergent, isolated North African lineage that had probably been widespread in Northern Africa during the late Pleistocene epoch. Pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into the Green Sahara, where an isolated, distinct North African ancestry persisted.",

    "abstract": "Animals learn the value of foods on the basis of their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic1–10 and preferences to those that are nutritious11–13. However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavours experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the postingestive reactivation of neural flavour representations in this temporal credit-assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel14,15, but not familiar, flavours with delayed gastrointestinal malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavours that support aversive postingestive learning. Analyses of brain-wide activation patterns reveal that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavours across every stage of learning (consumption, delayed malaise and memory retrieval). By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of malaise-coding hindbrain neurons, we show that delayed malaise signals selectively reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts the strengthening of flavour responses upon memory retrieval, which in turn leads to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavour. By contrast, flavour representations in the amygdala degrade in the absence of unexpected postingestive consequences. Thus, we demonstrate that postingestive reactivation and plasticity of neural flavour representations may support learning from delayed feedback. Illness signals from the gut reactivate and strengthen flavour representations in the amygdala to support learning from delayed postingestive feedback.",

Oxygen-redox (OR) electrochemistry offers a breakthrough in capacity limits, while inducing structural disorder with reduced electrochemical reversibility3–5. The conventional explanation for the thermal expansion of solids relies on the Grüneisen relationship, linking the expansion coefficient to the anharmonicity of the crystal lattice6. However, this paradigm may not be applicable to OR materials due to the unexplored dynamic disorder–order transition in such systems7,8. Here we reveal the presence of negative thermal expansion with a large coefficient value of −14.4(2) × 10−6 °C−1 in OR active materials, attributing this to thermally driven disorder–order transitions. The modulation of OR behaviour not only enables precise control over the thermal expansion coefficient of materials, but also establishes a pragmatic framework for the design of functional materials with zero thermal expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the reinstatement of structural disorder within the material can also be accomplished through the electrochemical driving force. By adjusting the cut-off voltages, evaluation of the discharge voltage change indicates a potential for nearly 100% structure recovery. This finding offers a pathway for restoring OR active materials to their pristine state through operando electrochemical processes, presenting a new mitigation strategy to address the persistent challenge of voltage decay. Using operando electrochemical processes, we found a way to restore oxygen-redox active materials exhibiting structural and voltage decay to their pristine state, providing a framework for the design of functional materials with zero thermal expansion.",

    "abstract": "Somatic DNMT3A-R882 codon mutations drive the most common form of clonal haematopoiesis (CH) and are associated with increased acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) risk1,2. Preventing expansion of DNMT3A-R882-mutant haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) may therefore avert progression to AML. To identify DNMT3A-R882-mutant-specific vulnerabilities, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen on primary mouse Dnmt3aR882H/+ HSPCs. Among the 640 vulnerability genes identified, many were involved in mitochondrial metabolism, and metabolic flux analysis confirmed enhanced oxidative phosphorylation use in Dnmt3aR882H/+ versus Dnmt3a+/+ (WT) HSPCs. We selected citrate/malate transporter Slc25a1 and complex I component Ndufb11, for which pharmacological inhibitors are available, for downstream studies. In vivo administration of SLC25A1 inhibitor CTPI2 and complex I inhibitors IACS-010759 and metformin suppressed post-transplantation clonal expansion of Dnmt3aR882H/+, but not WT, long-term haematopoietic stem cells. The effect of metformin was recapitulated using a primary human DNMT3A-R882 CH sample. Notably, analysis of 412,234 UK Biobank participants showed that individuals taking metformin had a markedly lower prevalence of DNMT3A-R882-mutant CH, after controlling for potential confounders including glycated haemoglobin, diabetes and body mass index. Collectively, our data propose modulation of mitochondrial metabolism as a therapeutic strategy for prevention of DNMT3A-R882-mutant AML. Metformin may serve as a non-toxic intervention to inhibit mitochondrial metabolism and slow DNMT3A-R882 clonal haematopoiesis expansion, thus delaying or averting progression to acute myeloid leukaemia.",

    "abstract": "The pursuit of non-volatile memory with program speeds below one nanosecond, beyond the capabilities of non-volatile flash and high-speed volatile static random-access memory, remains a longstanding challenge in the field of memory technology1. Utilizing fundamental physics innovation enabled by advanced materials, series of emerging memories2–5 are being developed to overcome the speed bottleneck of non-volatile memory. As the most extensively applied non-volatile memory, the speed of flash is limited by the low efficiency of the electric-field-assisted program, with reported speeds6–10 much slower than sub-one nanosecond. Here we report a two-dimensional Dirac graphene-channel flash memory based on a two-dimensional-enhanced hot-carrier-injection mechanism, supporting both electron and hole injection. The Dirac channel flash shows a program speed of 400 picoseconds, non-volatile storage and robust endurance over 5.5 × 106 cycles. Our results confirm that the thin-body channel can optimize the horizontal electric-field (Ey) distribution, and the improved Ey-assisted program efficiency increases the injection current to 60.4 pA μm−1 at |VDS| = 3.7 V. We also find that the two-dimensional semiconductor tungsten diselenide has two-dimensional-enhanced hot-hole injection, but with different injection behaviour. This work demonstrates that the speed of non-volatile flash memory can exceed that of the fastest volatile static random-access memory with the same channel length. A two-dimensional Dirac graphene-channel flash memory based on a two-dimensional-enhanced hot-carrier-injection mechanism that supports both electron and hole injection is used to make devices with a subnanosecond program speed.",

However, such enzymes have caveats such as an increased risk of off-target editing3,5,6. Here, to enable scalable reprogramming of Cas9 enzymes, we combined high-throughput protein engineering with machine learning to derive bespoke editors that are more uniquely suited to specific targets. Through structure–function-informed saturation mutagenesis and bacterial selections, we obtained nearly 1,000 engineered SpCas9 enzymes and characterized their protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM)7 requirements to train a neural network that relates amino acid sequence to PAM specificity. By utilizing the resulting PAM machine learning algorithm (PAMmla) to predict the PAMs of 64 million SpCas9 enzymes, we identified efficacious and specific enzymes that outperform evolution-based and engineered SpCas9 enzymes as nucleases and base editors in human cells while reducing off-targets. An in silico-directed evolution method enables user-directed Cas9 enzyme design, including for allele-selective targeting of the RHOP23H allele in human cells and mice. Together, PAMmla integrates machine learning and protein engineering to curate a catalogue of SpCas9 enzymes with distinct PAM requirements, motivating a shift away from generalist enzymes towards safe and efficient bespoke Cas9 variants. Combined high-throughput protein engineering with machine learning to curate libraries of CRISPR genome-editing enzymes with distinct genome targeting properties is described.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity must be regulated in a narrow permissive band for the proper operation of neural networks. Changes in synaptic connectivity and network activity—for example, during learning—might disturb this balance, eliciting compensatory mechanisms to maintain network function1–3. In the neocortex, excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons exhibit robust forms of stabilizing plasticity. However, although neuronal plasticity has been thoroughly studied in pyramidal cells4–8, little is known about how interneurons adapt to persistent changes in their activity. Here we describe a critical cellular process through which cortical parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons adapt to changes in their activity levels. We found that changes in the activity of individual PV+ interneurons drive bidirectional compensatory adjustments of the number and strength of inhibitory synapses received by these cells, specifically from other PV+ interneurons. High-throughput profiling of ribosome-associated mRNA revealed that increasing the activity of a PV+ interneuron leads to upregulation of two genes encoding multiple secreted neuropeptides: Vgf and Scg2. Functional experiments demonstrated that VGF is critically required for the activity-dependent scaling of inhibitory PV+ synapses onto PV+ interneurons. Our findings reveal an instructive role for neuropeptide-encoding genes in regulating synaptic connections among PV+ interneurons in the adult mouse neocortex. Increasing the activity of individual parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the mouse brain modulates the number and strength of inhibitory parvalbumin synapses received by these cells through changes in the expression of the neuropeptide-encoding genes Vgf and Scg2.",

How this tolerance to rhizobia is achieved without compromising plant immunity is largely unknown. Here we identify the cytoplasmic kinase MtLICK1/2, which interacts with nodulation factor receptor MtLYK3 to drive symbiotic signalling and suppress plant immunity. Rhizobial infection and nodule development are defective in Mtlick1/2, phenocopying the Mtlyk3-1 mutant. MtLICK1/2 and MtLYK3 undergo reciprocal transphosphorylation during rhizobial symbiosis. Phosphorylated MtLYK3 activates the receptor-like kinase MtDMI2 to stimulate symbiotic signalling. MtLICK1/2 is activated in the rhizobial infection area to suppress plant immunity. Thus, MtLICK1/2 and MtLYK3 together amplify symbiotic signalling and dampen host immunity to enable legume–rhizobium symbiosis. A plant kinase mediates symbiotic signalling and suppress host immunity to enable legume–rhizobium symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical CO2 reduction into chemicals and fuels holds great promise for renewable energy storage and carbon recycling1–3. Although high-temperature CO2 electroreduction in solid oxide electrolysis cells is industrially relevant, current catalysts have modest energy efficiency and a limited lifetime at high current densities, generally below 70% and 200 h, respectively, at 1 A cm−2 and temperatures of 800 °C or higher4–8. Here we develop an encapsulated Co–Ni alloy catalyst using Sm2O3-doped CeO2 that exhibits an energy efficiency of 90% and a lifetime of more than 2,000 h at 1 A cm−2 for high-temperature CO2-to-CO conversion at 800 °C. Its selectivity towards CO is about 100%, and its single-pass yield reaches 90%. We show that the efficacy of our catalyst arises from its unique encapsulated structure and optimized alloy composition, which simultaneously enable enhanced CO2 adsorption, moderate CO adsorption and suppressed metal agglomeration. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design of catalysts for high-temperature reactions that overcomes the typical trade-off between activity and stability and has potential industrial applications. An optimized Co–Ni alloy catalyst encapsulated with Sm2O3-doped CeO2 shows both high activity and stability for high-temperature CO2-to-CO conversion, overcoming the limitations of such catalysts typically used in industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "The pressures humanity has been placing on the environment have put Earth’s stability at risk. The planetary boundaries framework serves as a method to define a ‘safe operating space for humanity’1,2 and has so far been applied mostly to highlight the currently prevailing unsustainable environmental conditions. The ability to evaluate trends over time, however, can help us explore the consequences of alternative policy decisions and identify pathways for living within planetary boundaries3. Here we use the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment4 to project control variables for eight out of nine planetary boundaries under alternative scenarios to 2050, both with and without strong environmental policy measures. The results show that, with current trends and policies, the situation is projected to worsen to 2050 for all planetary boundaries, except for ozone depletion. Targeted interventions, such as implementing the Paris climate agreement, a shift to a healthier diet, improved food, and water- and nutrient-use efficiency, can effectively reduce the degree of transgression of the planetary boundaries, steering humanity towards a more sustainable trajectory (that is, if they can be implemented based on social and institutional feasibility considerations). However, even in this scenario, several planetary boundaries, including climate change, biogeochemical flows and biodiversity, will remain transgressed in 2050, partly as result of inertia. This means that more-effective policy measures will be needed to ensure we are living well within the planetary boundaries. Current trends imply that we will transgress most of the planetary boundaries by 2050; however, ambitious, urgent and universal action to ameliorate climate change and increase resource efficiency can effectively reduce the degree of transgression.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian gut harbours trillions of commensal bacteria that interact with their hosts through various bioactive molecules1,2. However, the mutualistic strategies that hosts evolve to benefit from these symbiotic relationships are largely unexplored. Here we report that mouse enterocytes secrete apolipoprotein L9a and b (APOL9a/b) in the presence of microbiota. By integrating flow cytometry sorting of APOL9-binding bacterial taxa with 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing (APOL9-seq), we identify that APOL9a/b, as well as their human equivalent APOL2, coat gut bacteria belonging to the order of Bacteroidales with a high degree of specificity through commensal ceramide-1-phosphate (Cer1P) lipids. Genetic abolition of ceramide-1-phosphate synthesis pathways in gut-dominant symbiote Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron significantly decreases the binding of APOL9a/b to the bacterium. Instead of lysing the bacterial cells, coating of APOL9a/b induces the production of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from the target bacteria. Subsequently, the Bacteroides-elicited outer membrane vesicles enhance the host’s interferon-γ signalling to promote major histocompatibility complex class II expression in the intestinal epithelial cells. In mice, the loss of Apol9a/b compromises the gut major histocompatibility complex class II-instructed immune barrier function, leading to early mortality from infection by intestinal pathogens. Our data show how a host-elicited factor benefits gut immunological homeostasis by selectively targeting commensal ceramide molecules. APOL9a/b proteins coat mouse intestinal bacteria with high specificity, and genetic abolition of ceramide-1-phosphate synthesis pathways in the symbiote Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron significantly decreases this binding of APOL9a/b to the bacterium.",

    "abstract": "To grow at distant sites, metastatic cells must overcome major challenges posed by the unique cellular and metabolic composition of secondary organs1. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines2, in vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDL-cholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates—7-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterol—with protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC. PCSK9 regulates low density lipoprotein-cholesterol import and determines organ preference of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, with PCSK9-low cells metastasizing to the liver and PCSK9-high cells preferring the lung.",

    "abstract": "Ferrous iron (Fe2+) is essential in all eukaryotic cells for various oxidoreductase reactions, including the demethylation of DNA and proteins. Histone demethylation is required for normal epigenetic regulation of the Y-chromosomal sex-determining gene Sry in developing gonads during male sex determination1,2. Here we investigate the potential connection between iron metabolism, histone demethylation and sex determination in mammals. We found that Fe2+-producing pathways are substantially activated in mouse embryonic gonads during the sex-determining period. Chelation of iron in cultured XY gonads reduced the level of KDM3A-mediated H3K9 demethylation of Sry, mostly abolished Sry expression and caused the gonads to express ovarian markers. In vivo, conditional deletion of the gene Tfrc—which is required for iron incorporation—in fetal XY gonadal somatic cells, or acute pharmaceutical suppression of available iron in pregnant mice, resulted in male-to-female gonadal sex reversal in a proportion of offspring, highlighting the pivotal role of iron metabolism in male sex determination. Finally, long-term feeding of pregnant mice with a low-iron diet, when combined with a heterozygous variant of Kdm3a that by itself has no observable effect, suppressed Sry expression and caused male-to-female sex reversal in some of the progeny, revealing a connection between maternal dietary iron and fetal developmental outcomes. Iron-deficient conditions in pregnant mice can cause XY mouse embryos to develop female rather than male genitalia, revealing that iron metabolism has a role in determining male sex in mice.",

    "abstract": "Vision enables many animals to perform spatial reasoning from remote locations1. By viewing distant landmarks, animals recall spatial memories and plan future trajectories. Although these spatial functions depend on hippocampal place cells2,3, the relationship between place cells and active visual behaviour is unknown. Here we studied a highly visual animal, the chickadee, in a behaviour that required alternating between remote visual search and spatial navigation. We leveraged the head-directed nature of avian vision to track gaze in freely moving animals. We discovered a profound link between place coding and gaze. Place cells activated not only when the chickadee was in a specific location, but also when it simply gazed at that location from a distance. Gaze coding was precisely timed by fast ballistic head movements called ‘head saccades’4,5. On each saccadic cycle, the hippocampus switched between encoding a prediction of what the bird was about to see and a reaction to what it actually saw. The temporal structure of these responses was coordinated by subclasses of interneurons that fired at different phases of the saccade. We suggest that place and gaze coding are components of a unified process by which the hippocampus represents the location that is relevant to the animal in each moment. This process allows the hippocampus to implement both local and remote spatial functions. Place cells in the chickadee hippocampus coherently represent locations in space, whether physically visited or viewed, enabling spatial reasoning at a distance through a unified process coordinated by head saccades.",

    "abstract": "Silicon has enabled advancements in semiconductor technology through miniaturization, but scaling challenges necessitate the exploration of new materials1. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic thickness and high carrier mobility, offer a promising alternative2–5. Although significant progress has been made in wafer-scale growth6–8, high-performance field-effect transistors9–20 and circuits based on 2D materials21–23, achieving complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integration remains a challenge. Here, we present a 2D one instruction set computer based on CMOS technology, leveraging the heterogeneous integration of large-area n-type MoS2 and p-type WSe2 field-effect transistors. By scaling the channel length, incorporating a high-κ gate dielectric and optimizing material growth and device postprocessing, we tailored the threshold voltages for both n- and p-type 2D field-effect transistors, achieving high drive currents and reduced subthreshold leakage. This enabled circuit operation below 3 V with an operating frequency of up to 25 kHz, which was constrained by parasitic capacitances, along with ultra-low power consumption in the picowatt range and a switching energy as low as approximately 100 pJ. Finally, we projected the performance of the one instruction set computer and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art silicon technology using an industry-standard SPICE-compatible BSIM-BULK model. This model was calibrated with experimental data that incorporate device-to-device variations. Although further advances are needed, this work marks a significant milestone in the application of 2D materials to microelectronics. A two-dimensional one instruction set computer has been fabricated based on complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology by leveraging the heterogeneous integration of large-area n-type MoS2 and p-type WSe2 field-effect transistors.",

    "abstract": "Each spring, billions of Bogong moths escape hot conditions across southeast Australia by migrating up to 1,000 km to a place that they have never previously visited—a limited number of cool caves in the Australian Alps, historically used for aestivating over summer1,2. At the beginning of autumn, the same individuals make a return migration to their breeding grounds to reproduce and die. Here we show that Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby navigating in their inherited migratory direction towards their distant goal. By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator3–5, we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth’s known magnetic sense4), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions. Visual interneurons in different regions of the moth’s brain responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation, firing maximally when the moth was headed southwards. Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth’s magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination. Every spring, Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to navigate up to 1,000 km towards their alpine migratory goal.",

    "abstract": "The nervous system has a pivotal role in cancer biology, and pathological investigations have linked intratumoural nerve density to metastasis1. However, the precise impact of cancer-associated neurons and the communication channels at the nerve–cancer interface remain poorly understood. Previous cancer denervation models in rodents and humans have highlighted robust cancer dependency on nerves, but the underlying mechanisms that drive nerve-mediated cancer aggressivity remain unknown2,3. Here we show that cancer-associated neurons enhance cancer metabolic plasticity by transferring mitochondria to cancer cells. Breast cancer denervation and nerve–cancer coculture models confirmed that neurons significantly improve tumour energetics. Neurons cocultured with cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, resulting in increased mitochondrial mass and subsequent transfer of mitochondria to adjacent cancer cells. To precisely track the fate of recipient cells, we developed MitoTRACER, a reporter of cell-to-cell mitochondrial transfer that permanently labels recipient cancer cells and their progeny. Lineage tracing and fate mapping of cancer cells acquiring neuronal mitochondria in primary tumours revealed their selective enrichment at metastatic sites following dissemination. Collectively, our data highlight the enhanced metastatic capabilities of cancer cells that receive mitochondria from neurons in primary tumours, shedding new light on how the nervous system supports cancer metabolism and metastatic dissemination. A study reports the development of a method to trace intercellular transfer of mitochondria, and demonstrates that cancer cells that receive mitochondria from neurons have enhanced metastatic capabilities.",

Yet, the pathways from computer vision to surveillance continue to be contentious. Here we present an empirical account of the nature and extent of the surveillance AI pipeline, showing extensive evidence of the close relationship between the field of computer vision and surveillance. Through an analysis of computer-vision research papers and citing patents, we found that most of these documents enable the targeting of human bodies and body parts. Comparing the 1990s to the 2010s, we observed a fivefold increase in the number of these computer-vision papers linked to downstream surveillance-enabling patents. Additionally, our findings challenge the notion that only a few rogue entities enable surveillance. Rather, we found that the normalization of targeting humans permeates the field. This normalization is especially striking given patterns of obfuscation. We reveal obfuscating language that allows documents to avoid direct mention of targeting humans, for example, by normalizing the referring to of humans as ‘objects’ to be studied without special consideration. Our results indicate the extensive ties between computer-vision research and surveillance.

    "abstract": "Classical mechanics characterizes the kinetic energy of a particle, the energy it holds due to its motion, as consistently positive. By contrast, quantum mechanics describes the motion of particles using wave functions, in which regions of negative local kinetic energy can emerge1. This phenomenon occurs when the amplitude of the wave function experiences notable decay, typically associated with quantum tunnelling. Here, we investigate the quantum mechanical motion of particles in a system of two coupled waveguides, in which the population transfer between the waveguides acts as a clock, allowing particle speeds along the waveguide axis to be determined. By applying this scheme to exponentially decaying quantum states at a reflective potential step, we determine an energy–speed relationship for particles with negative local kinetic energy. We find that the smaller the energy of the particles—in other words, the more negative the local kinetic energy—the higher the measured speed inside the potential step. Our findings contribute to the ongoing tunnelling time debate2–6 and can be viewed as a test of Bohmian trajectories in quantum mechanics7–9. Regarding the latter, we find that the measured energy–speed relationship does not align with the particle dynamics postulated by the guiding equation in Bohmian mechanics. The study of the relationship between particle speed and negative kinetic energy, arising in regions in which, according to classical mechanics, particles are not allowed to enter, reveals behaviour that appears to contradict the predictions of Bohmian mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Research into the palaeobiology of extinct taxa through ancient DNA and proteomics has been mostly limited to Plio-Pleistocene fossils1–9, due to molecular breakdown over time, which is exacerbated in tropical settings1–3. Here we sample small proteomes from the interior enamel of fossils at palaeontological sites from the Pleistocene to the Oligocene in the Turkana Basin, Kenya, which has produced a rich record of Cenozoic mammalian evolution10. Through a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic workflow, and using criteria to locate diagenetiforms derived from enamel, we recover fragments of enamelin, ameloblastin, matrix metalloprotease-20 and dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 from an Early Miocene rhinocerotid and several proboscideans collected from the sites of Buluk (16 million years ago; Ma) and Loperot (18 Ma). Diagenetiform counts decline in progressively older fossils, and we observe variability in Early Miocene preservation across sites. Phylogenetic analyses reveal the contribution of these sequences to the systematic placement of extinct taxa, although we caution that this approach must account for sparse fragments, uncertainty in fragment identification and possible sequence diagenesis. We identify likely modifications that support the ancient age of these proteins, and some of the oldest examples of advanced glycation end-products yet known. The discovery of protein sequences within dense enamel tissues in one of the persistently warmest regions on Earth promises the discovery of much older proteomes that will aid in the study of the palaeobiology and evolutionary relationships of extinct taxa. The isolation of dental proteins from fossils deposited 1.5 million to 18 million years ago in the Turkana Basin in Kenya, a tropical region, demonstrate the promise of dental enamel for palaeoproteomic and evolutionary studies.",

    "abstract": "Water is the third most abundant molecule in the universe and a key component in the interiors of icy moons, giant planets and Uranus- and Neptune-like exoplanets1–3. Owing to its distinct molecular structure and flexible hydrogen bonds that readily adapt to a wide range of pressures and temperatures, water forms numerous crystalline and amorphous phases4–6. Most relevant for the high pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors is ice VII (ref. 4), and simulations have identified along its melting curve the existence of a so-called plastic phase7–12 in which individual molecules occupy fixed positions as in a solid yet are able to rotate as in a liquid. Such plastic ice has not yet been directly observed in experiments. Here we present quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements, conducted at temperatures between 450 and 600 K and pressures up to 6 GPa, that reveal the existence of a body-centred cubic structure, as found in ice VII, with water molecules showing picosecond rotational dynamics typical for liquid water. Comparison with molecular dynamics simulations indicates that this plastic ice VII does not conform to a free rotor phase but rather shows rapid orientational jumps, as observed in jump-rotor plastic crystals13,14. We anticipate that our observation of plastic ice VII will affect our understanding of the geodynamics of icy planets and the differentiation processes of large icy moons. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements show the existence of a body-centred cubic structure, similar to that of ice VII, where water molecules exhibit picosecond rotational dynamic and rapid orientational jumps characteristic of liquid water.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral cortex development in humans is a highly complex and orchestrated process that is under tight genetic regulation. Rare mutations that alter gene expression or function can disrupt the structure of the cerebral cortex, resulting in a range of neurological conditions1. Lissencephaly (‘smooth brain’) spectrum disorders comprise a group of rare, genetically heterogeneous congenital brain malformations commonly associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability2. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain unknown. Here we establish hypoactivity of the mTOR pathway as a clinically relevant molecular mechanism in lissencephaly spectrum disorders. We characterized two types of cerebral organoid derived from individuals with genetically distinct lissencephalies with a recessive mutation in p53-induced death domain protein 1 (PIDD1) or a heterozygous chromosome 17p13.3 microdeletion leading to Miller–Dieker lissencephaly syndrome (MDLS). PIDD1-mutant organoids and MDLS organoids recapitulated the thickened cortex typical of human lissencephaly and demonstrated dysregulation of protein translation, metabolism and the mTOR pathway. A brain-selective activator of mTOR complex 1 prevented and reversed cellular and molecular defects in the lissencephaly organoids. Our findings show that a converging molecular mechanism contributes to two genetically distinct lissencephaly spectrum disorders. Cellular, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells show that mTOR pathway hypoactivation is involved in two genetically distinct lissencephaly spectrum disorders.",

These phases can be strongly influenced by anisotropic couplings, leading to higher critical temperatures, as emphasized by the recent discovery of superconductivity in nickelates7–10. Quantum simulators with ultracold atoms provide a versatile platform to engineer such couplings and to observe emergent structures in real space with single-particle resolution. Here we show, to our knowledge, the first signatures of individual stripes in a cold-atom Fermi–Hubbard quantum simulator using mixed-dimensional (mixD) settings. Increasing the energy scale of hole–hole attraction to the spin exchange energy, we access the interesting crossover temperature regime in which stripes begin to form11. We observe extended, attractive correlations between hole dopants and find an increased probability of forming larger structures akin to individual stripes. In the spin sector, we study correlation functions up to the third order and find results consistent with stripe formation. These observations are interpreted as a precursor to the stripe phase, which is characterized by interleaved charge and spin density wave ordering with fluctuating lines of dopants separating domains of opposite antiferromagnetic order12–14. Observations of the formation of individual stripes in a mixed-dimensional cold-atom Fermi–Hubbard quantum simulator are described, enhancing understanding of the phase diagram of high-temperature superconducting materials and the relationship between charge pairs and stripes.",

    "abstract": "Frictional motion is mediated by rapidly propagating ruptures that detach the ensemble of contacts forming the frictional interface between contacting bodies1–7. These ruptures are similar to shear cracks. When this process takes place in natural faults, these rapid ruptures are essentially earthquakes8,9. Although fracture mechanics describe the rapid motion of these singular objects, the nucleation process that creates them is not understood10–19. Here we fully describe the nucleation process by extending fracture mechanics to explicitly incorporate finite interface widths (which are generally ignored20,21). We show, experimentally and theoretically, that slow steady creep ensues at a well-defined stress threshold. Moreover, as slowly creeping patches approach the interface width, a topological transition takes place in which these creeping patches smoothly transition to the rapid fracture that is described by classical fracture mechanics22–26. Apart from its relevance to fracture and material strength, this new picture of rupture nucleation dynamics is directly relevant to earthquake nucleation dynamics; slow, aseismic rupture must always precede rapid seismic rupture (so long as the initial defect in the interface is localized in both spatial dimensions). The theory may provide a new framework for understanding how and when earthquakes nucleate. Experimental and theoretical evidence shows that incorporating finite interface widths extends fracture mechanics to include crack (and earthquake) nucleation; slow steady creep occurring at a well-defined stress threshold.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations that drive colorectal cancer can be present in healthy intestines for long periods without overt consequence1,2. Mutation of Apc, the most common initiating event in conventional adenomas3, activates Wnt signalling, thus conferring fitness on mutant intestinal stem cells (ISCs)4,5. Apc mutations may occur in ISCs that arise by routine self-renewal or by dedifferentiation of their progeny. Although ISCs of these different origins are fundamentally similar6,7, it is unclear whether both generate tumours equally well in uninjured intestines. It is also unknown whether cis-regulatory elements are substantively modulated upon Wnt hyperactivation or as a feature of subsequent tumours. Here we show in two mouse models that adenomas are not an obligatory outcome of Apc deletion in either ISC source, but require proximity of mutant intestinal crypts. Reduced crypt density abrogates, and aggregation of mutant colonic crypts augments, adenoma formation. Moreover, adenoma-resident ISCs open chromatin at thousands of enhancers that are inaccessible in Apc-null ISCs that are not associated with adenomas. These cis elements explain adenoma-selective gene activity and persist, with little further expansion of the repertoire, as other oncogenic mutations accumulate. Thus, cooperativity between neighbouring mutant crypts and new accessibility at specific enhancers are key steps early in intestinal tumorigenesis. Mouse models of colorectal cancer show that adenoma formation following deletion of Apc is dependent on a proximity effect of mutant crypts and increased chromosome accessibility at specific enhancers.",

    "abstract": "After a long-distance migration, Avars with Eastern Asian ancestry arrived in Eastern Central Europe in 567 to 568 ce and encountered groups with very different European ancestry1,2. We used ancient genome-wide data of 722 individuals and fine-grained interdisciplinary analysis of large seventh- to eighth-century ce neighbouring cemeteries south of Vienna (Austria) to address the centuries-long impact of this encounter1,2. We found that even 200 years after immigration, the ancestry at one site (Leobersdorf) remained dominantly East Asian-like, whereas the other site (Mödling) shows local, European-like ancestry. These two nearby sites show little biological relatedness, despite sharing a distinctive late-Avar culture3,4. We reconstructed six-generation pedigrees at both sites including up to 450 closely related individuals, allowing per-generation demographic profiling of the communities. Despite different ancestry, these pedigrees together with large networks of distant relatedness show absence of consanguinity, patrilineal pattern with female exogamy, multiple reproductive partnerships (for example, levirate) and direct correlation of biological connectivity with archaeological markers of social status. The generation-long genetic barrier was maintained by systematically choosing partners with similar ancestry from other sites in the Avar realm. Leobersdorf had more biological connections with the Avar heartlands than with Mödling, which is instead linked to another site from the Vienna Basin with European-like ancestry. Mobility between sites was mostly due to female exogamy pointing to different marriage networks as the main driver of the maintenance of the genetic barrier. Ancient genome-wide data of 722 individuals and interdisciplinary analysis of large seventh- to eighth-century ce neighbouring cemeteries near Vienna are used to address the impact of the encounter between Eastern Asian Avars and Europeans.",

    "abstract": "Seismic tomographic models based only on wave velocities have limited ability to distinguish between a thermal or compositional origin for Earth’s 3D structure1. Complementing wave velocities with attenuation observations can make that distinction, which is fundamental for understanding mantle convection evolution. However, global 3D attenuation models are only available for the upper mantle at present2–5. Here we present a 3D global model of attenuation for the whole mantle made using whole-Earth oscillations, constraining even spherical harmonics up to degree four. In the upper mantle, we find that high attenuation correlates with low velocity, indicating a thermal origin, in agreement with previous studies6,7. In the lower mantle, we find the opposite and observe the highest attenuation in the ‘ring around the Pacific’, which is seismically fast, and the lowest attenuation in the large low-seismic-velocity provinces (LLSVPs). Comparing our model with wave speeds and attenuation predicted by a laboratory-based viscoelastic model8 suggests that the circum-Pacific is a colder and small-grain-size region9, surrounding the warmer and large-grain-size LLSVPs. Viscosities calculated for the inferred variations in grain size and temperature confirm LLSVPs as long-lived, stable features10. Using whole-Earth oscillations to constrain a 3D global model of attenuation for the whole mantle, low attenuation correlates with low velocity in the lower mantle, suggesting long-lived deep-mantle provinces.",

    "abstract": "Quantum materials governed by emergent topological fermions have become a cornerstone of physics. Dirac fermions in graphene form the basis for moiré quantum matter and Dirac fermions in magnetic topological insulators enabled the discovery of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect1–3. By contrast, there are few materials whose electromagnetic response is dominated by emergent Weyl fermions4–6. Nearly all known Weyl materials are overwhelmingly metallic and are largely governed by irrelevant, conventional electrons. Here we theoretically predict and experimentally observe a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet in van der Waals (Cr,Bi)2Te3. In transport, we find a record bulk anomalous Hall angle of greater than 0.5 along with non-metallic conductivity, a regime that is strongly distinct from conventional ferromagnets. Together with symmetry analysis, our data suggest a semimetallic Fermi surface composed of two Weyl points, with a giant separation of more than 75% of the linear dimension of the bulk Brillouin zone, and no other electronic states. Using state-of-the-art crystal-synthesis techniques, we widely tune the electronic structure, allowing us to annihilate the Weyl state and visualize a unique topological phase diagram exhibiting broad Chern insulating, Weyl semimetallic and magnetic semiconducting regions. Our observation of a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet offers an avenue towards new correlated states and nonlinear phenomena, as well as zero-magnetic-field Weyl spintronic and optical devices. Van der Waals (Cr,Bi)2Te3, synthesized by non-equilibrium molecular beam epitaxy, is characterized by magnetotransport measurements and shown to be a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet, with Fermi surface composed of two Weyl points and no irrelevant electronic states.",

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries from time-domain surveys are defying our expectations for how matter accretes onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The increased rate of short-timescale, repetitive events around SMBHs, including the recently discovered quasi-periodic eruptions1–5, are garnering further interest in stellar-mass companions around SMBHs and the progenitors to millihertz-frequency gravitational-wave events. Here we report the discovery of a highly significant millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in an actively accreting SMBH, 1ES 1927+654, which underwent a major optical, ultraviolet and X-ray outburst beginning in 20186,7. The QPO was detected in 2022 with a roughly 18-minute period, corresponding to coherent motion on a scale of less than 10 gravitational radii, much closer to the SMBH than typical quasi-periodic eruptions. The period decreased to 7.1 minutes over 2 years with a decelerating period evolution (\n                \n                  \n                \n                $$\\ddot{P}$$\n                \n               greater than zero). To our knowledge, this evolution has never been seen in SMBH QPOs or high-frequency QPOs in stellar-mass black holes. Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion struggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset angular-momentum losses, and the lack of a direct analogue to stellar-mass black-hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the observed properties of the QPO in 1ES 1927+654. Future X-ray monitoring will test these models, and if it is a stellar-mass orbiter, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should detect its low-frequency gravitational-wave emission. A millihertz frequency X-ray quasi-periodic oscillation has been observed near the innermost orbit of an actively accreting supermassive black hole and its frequency has evolved significantly over 2 years, a phenomenon that is difficult to explain with existing models.",

    "abstract": "Fossils representing Cretaceous lineages of crown clade birds (Aves) are exceptionally rare but are crucial to elucidating major ecological shifts across early avian divergences. Among the earliest known putative crown birds is Vegavis iaai1–5, a foot-propelled diver from the latest Cretaceous (69.2–68.4 million years ago)6 of Antarctica with controversial phylogenetic affinities2,7–10. Initially recovered by phylogenetic analyses as a stem anatid (ducks and closely related species)1,2,11, Vegavis has since been recovered as a stem member of Anseriformes (waterfowl)7–9, or outside Aves altogether10. Here we report a new, nearly complete skull of Vegavis that provides new insight into its feeding ecology and exhibits morphologies that support placement among waterfowl within crown-group birds. Vegavis has an avian beak (absence of teeth and reduced maxilla) and brain shape (hyperinflated cerebrum and ventrally shifted optic lobes). The temporal fossa is well excavated and expansive, indicating that this bird had hypertrophied jaw musculature. The beak is narrow and pointed, and the mandible lacks retroarticular processes. Together, these features comprise a feeding apparatus unlike that of any other known anseriform but like that of other extant birds that capture prey underwater (for example, grebes and loons). The Cretaceous occurrence of Vegavis, with a feeding ecology unique among known Galloanserae (waterfowl and landfowl), is further indication that the earliest anseriform divergences were marked by evolutionary experiments unrepresented in the extant diversity3,11–13. A new, nearly complete fossil skull of Vegavis from the James Ross Basin, Antarctic Peninsula, provides insight into its feeding ecology and exhibits morphologies that support placement among waterfowl within crown-group birds.",

    "abstract": "The development of new synthetic methodologies is instrumental for enabling the discovery of new medicines. The methods that provide efficient access to structural alternatives for aromatic compounds (that is, saturated arene bioisosteres) have become highly coveted1–4. The incorporation of these bioisosteres typically leads to favourable drug-like properties and represents an emerging field of research. Here we report a new synthetic method that furnishes a coveted motif, the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold5,6, using mild reaction conditions and an operationally simple protocol. The methodology proceeds through the uncommon coupling of two strained fragments: transiently generated cyclic allenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, which possess considerable strain energies of about 30 kcal mol−1 (ref. 7) and about 60 kcal mol−1 (ref. 6), respectively. The reaction is thought to proceed by a σ-bond insertion through a diradical pathway. However, rather than requiring an external stimulus to generate radical species, reactivity is thought to arise as a result of innate diradical character present in each reactant. This diradicaloid character8, an underused parameter in reaction design, arises from the severe geometric distortions of each reactant. Our studies provide a means to access functionalized bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes of value for drug discovery, underscore how geometric distortion of reactants can be used to enable uncommon modes of reactivity and should encourage the further exploration and strategic use of diradicaloids in chemical synthesis. A new synthetic method provides a coveted motif, the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold, using the uncommon coupling of two strained diradicaloid fragments: transiently generated cyclic allenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes.",

    "abstract": "Neoantigen vaccines are under investigation for various cancers, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung cancers1,2. We tracked the phylogenetic history of an EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with erlotinib, osimertinib, radiotherapy and a personalized neopeptide vaccine (NPV) targeting ten somatic mutations, including EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del). The ex19del mutation was clonal, but is likely to have appeared after a whole-genome doubling (WGD) event. Following osimertinib and NPV treatment, loss of the ex19del mutation was identified in a progressing small-cell-transformed liver metastasis. Circulating tumour DNA analyses tracking 467 somatic variants revealed the presence of this EGFR wild-type clone before vaccination and its expansion during osimertinib/NPV therapy. Despite systemic T cell reactivity to the vaccine-targeted ex19del neoantigen, the NPV failed to halt disease progression. The liver metastasis lost vaccine-targeted neoantigens through chromosomal instability and exhibited a hostile microenvironment, characterized by limited immune infiltration, low CXCL9 and elevated M2 macrophage levels. Neoantigens arising post-WGD were more likely to be absent in the progressing liver metastasis than those occurring pre-WGD, suggesting that prioritizing pre-WGD neoantigens may improve vaccine design. Data from the TRACERx 421 cohort3 provide evidence that pre-WGD mutations better represent clonal variants, and owing to their presence at multiple copy numbers, are less likely to be lost in metastatic transition. These data highlight the power of phylogenetic disease tracking and functional T cell profiling to understand mechanisms of immune escape during combination therapies. We show the evolution of a case of EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with a combination of erlotinib, osimertinib, radiotherapy and a personalized neopeptide vaccine targeting somatic mutations, including EGFR exon 19 deletion.",

    "abstract": "The survival of malignant cells within tumours is often seen as depending on ruthless competition for nutrients and other resources1,2. Although competition is certainly critical for tumour evolution and cancer progression, cooperative interactions within tumours are also important, albeit poorly understood3,4. Cooperative populations at all levels of biological organization risk extinction if their population size falls below a critical tipping point5,6. Here we examined whether cooperation among tumour cells may be a potential therapeutic target. We identified a cooperative mechanism that enables tumour cells to proliferate under the amino acid-deprived conditions found in the tumour microenvironment. Disruption of this mechanism drove cultured tumour populations to the critical extinction point and resulted in a marked reduction in tumour growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that tumour cells collectively digest extracellular oligopeptides through the secretion of aminopeptidases. The resulting free amino acids benefit both aminopeptidase-secreting cells and neighbouring cells. We identified CNDP2 as the key enzyme that hydrolyses these peptides extracellularly, and loss of this aminopeptidase prevents tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. These data show that cooperative scavenging of nutrients is key to survival in the tumour microenvironment and reveal a targetable cancer vulnerability. Nutrient-starved tumour cells cooperate by secreting aminopeptidases that digest oligopeptides in the microenvironment, creating a shared pool of free amino acids.",

Here, using 18 single, double and triple whole-body and tissue-specific knockout and mutant mice, along with systematic mitochondrial morphology analysis, untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered that the synergy between two stress-responsive systems—the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin and the metalloprotease OMA1—safeguards mitochondrial structure and genome by mitochondrial fusion, mediated by the outer membrane GTPase MFN1 and the inner membrane GTPase OPA1. Whereas the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses. Thus, our data show that Parkin and OMA1 maintain a dual regulatory mechanism that controls mitochondrial fusion at the two membranes, even in the absence of extrinsic stress. We find that, in mice, although the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform creative industries through supporting human creative ideation—the generation of new ideas1–5. However, limitations in model capabilities raise key challenges in integrating these technologies more fully into creative practices. Iterative tweaking and divergent thinking remain key to enabling creativity support using technology6,7, yet these practices are insufficiently supported by state-of-the-art generative AI models. Using game development as a lens, we demonstrate that we can make use of an understanding of user needs to drive the development and evaluation of generative AI models in a way that aligns with these creative practices. Concretely, we introduce a state-of-the-art generative model, the World and Human Action Model (WHAM), and show that it can generate consistent and diverse gameplay sequences and persist user modifications—three capabilities that we identify as being critical for this alignment. In contrast to previous approaches to creativity support tools that required manually defining or extracting structure for relatively narrow domains, generative AI models can learn relevant structure from available data, opening the potential for a much broader range of applications. A state-of-the-art generative artificial intelligence model of a video game is introduced to allow the support of human creative ideation, with the analysis of user study data highlighting three necessary capabilities, namely, consistency, diversity and persistency.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian fatty acid synthase (FASN) enzyme is a dynamic multienzyme that belongs to the megasynthase family. In mammals, a single gene encodes six catalytically active domains and a flexibly tethered acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that shuttles intermediates between active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis1. FASN is an essential enzyme in mammalian development through the role that fatty acids have in membrane formation, energy storage, cell signalling and protein modifications. Thus, FASN is a promising target for treatment of a large variety of diseases including cancer, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, and viral and parasite infections2,3. The multi-faceted mechanism of FASN and the dynamic nature of the protein, in particular of the ACP, have made it challenging to understand at the molecular level. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human FASN in a multitude of conformational states with NADPH and NADP+ plus acetoacetyl-CoA present, including structures with the ACP stalled at the dehydratase (DH) and enoyl-reductase (ER) domains. We show that FASN activity in vitro and de novo lipogenesis in cells is inhibited by mutations at the ACP–DH and ACP–ER interfaces. Together, these studies provide new molecular insights into the dynamic nature of FASN and the ACP shuttling mechanism, with implications for developing improved FASN-targeted therapeutics. Using cryo-electron microscopy, the structures of mammalian fatty acid synthase reveal how the acyl carrier protein dynamically shuttles intermediates between selected active sites.",

    "abstract": "Long-chain fatty acids are the building blocks of fat in human bodies. In mammals, fatty acid synthase (FASN) contains multiple enzymatic domains to catalyse all chemical reactions needed for de novo fatty acid synthesis1. Although the chemical reactions carried out by these enzymatic domains are well defined, how the dimeric FASN with an open architecture continuously catalyses such reactions to synthesize a complete fatty acid remains elusive. Here, using a strategy of tagging and purifying endogenous FASN in HEK293T cells for single-particle cryo-electron microscopy studies, we characterized the structural dynamics of endogenous human FASN. We captured conformational snapshots of various functional substates in the condensing cycle and developed a procedure to analyse the particle distribution landscape of FASN with different orientations between its condensing and modifying wings. Together, our findings reveal that FASN function does not require a large rotational motion between its two main functional domains during the condensing cycle, and that the catalytic reactions in the condensing cycle carried out by the two monomers are unsynchronized. Our data thus provide a new composite view of FASN dynamics during the fatty acid synthesis condensing cycle. A study examines functional human endogenous fatty acid synthase and characterizes its structural dynamics using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, providing insights into its dynamics during the fatty acid synthesis condensing cycle.",

    "abstract": "The crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are pivotal in biomedical and evolutionary research1–3. However, their genomic complexity and interspecies genetic differences remain unclear4. Here, we present a complete genome assembly of a crab-eating macaque, revealing 46% fewer segmental duplications and 3.83 times longer centromeres than those of humans5,6. We also characterize 93 large-scale genomic differences between macaques and humans at a single-base-pair resolution, highlighting their impact on gene regulation in primate evolution. Using ten long-read macaque genomes, hundreds of short-read macaque genomes and full-length transcriptome data, we identified roughly 2 Mbp of fixed-genetic variants, roughly 240 Mbp of complex loci, 16.76 Mbp genetic differentiation regions and 110 alternative splice events, potentially associated with various phenotypic differences between the two macaque species. In summary, the integrated genetic analysis enhances understanding of lineage-specific phenotypes, adaptation and primate evolution, thereby improving their biomedical applications in human disease research.

    "abstract": "Metabolic flux, or the rate of metabolic reactions, is one of the most fundamental metrics describing the status of metabolism in living organisms. However, measuring fluxes across the entire metabolic network remains nearly impossible, especially in multicellular organisms. Computational methods based on flux balance analysis have been used with genome-scale metabolic network models to predict network-level flux wiring1–6. However, such approaches have limited power because of the lack of experimental constraints. Here, we introduce a strategy that infers whole-animal metabolic flux wiring from transcriptional phenotypes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using a large-scale Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS) dataset for roughly 900 metabolic genes7, we show that the transcriptional response to metabolic gene perturbations can be integrated with the metabolic network model to infer a highly constrained, semi-quantitative flux distribution. We discover several features of adult C. elegans metabolism, including cyclic flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, lack of de novo purine synthesis flux and the primary use of amino acids and bacterial RNA as a tricarboxylic acid cycle carbon source, all of which we validate by stable isotope tracing. Our strategy for inferring metabolic wiring based on transcriptional phenotypes should be applicable to a variety of systems, including human cells. A strategy is introduced that infers whole-animal metabolic flux wiring from transcriptional phenotypes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and several features in its adult metabolism are discovered that are validated by stable isotope tracing.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of metabolism is vital to any organism and can be achieved by transcriptionally activating or repressing metabolic genes1–3. Although many examples of transcriptional metabolic rewiring have been reported4, a systems-level study of how metabolism is rewired in response to metabolic perturbations is lacking in any animal. Here we apply Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS)—a high-throughput method combining whole-animal RNA-interference and RNA-sequencing5—to around 900 metabolic genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We derive a metabolic gene regulatory network (mGRN) in which 385 perturbations are connected to 9,414 genes by more than 110,000 interactions. The mGRN has a highly modular structure in which 22 perturbation clusters connect to 44 gene expression programs. The mGRN reveals different modes of transcriptional rewiring from simple reaction and pathway compensation to rerouting and more complex network coordination. Using metabolic network modelling, we identify a design principle of transcriptional rewiring that we name the compensation–repression (CR) model. The CR model explains most transcriptional responses in metabolic genes and reveals a high level of compensation and repression in five core metabolic functions related to energy and biomass. We provide preliminary evidence that the CR model may also explain transcriptional metabolic rewiring in human cells. Systems-level Worm Perturb-Seq of metabolic genes reveals design principles of transcriptional metabolic rewiring, many of which can be explained by a compensation–repression model.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) edge devices1–12 demand high-precision energy-efficient computations, large on-chip model storage, rapid wakeup-to-response time and cost-effective foundry-ready solutions. Floating point (FP) computation provides precision exceeding that of integer (INT) formats at the cost of higher power and storage overhead. Multi-level-cell (MLC) memristor compute-in-memory (CIM)13–15 provides compact non-volatile storage and energy-efficient computation but is prone to accuracy loss owing to process variation. Digital static random-access memory (SRAM)-CIM16–22 enables lossless computation; however, storage is low as a result of large bit-cell area and model loading is required during inference. Thus, conventional approaches using homogeneous CIM architectures and computation formats impose a trade-off between efficiency, storage, wakeup latency and inference accuracy. Here we present a mixed-precision heterogeneous CIM AI edge processor, which supports the layer-granular/kernel-granular partitioning of network layers among on-chip CIM architectures (that is, memristor-CIM, SRAM-CIM and tiny-digital units) and computation number formats (INT and FP) based on sensitivity to error. This layer-granular/kernel-granular flexibility allows simultaneous optimization within the two-dimensional design space at the hardware level. The proposed hardware achieved high energy efficiency (40.91 TFLOPS W−1 for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and 28.63 TFLOPS W−1 for MobileNet-v2 with ImageNet), low accuracy degradation (<0.45% for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and for MobilNet-v2 with ImageNet) and rapid wakeup-to-response time (373.52 μs). A mixed-precision heterogeneous memristor combined with a compute-in-memory artificial intelligence (AI) processor allows optimization of the precision, energy efficiency, storage and wakeup-to-response time requirements of AI edge devices, which is demonstrated using existing models and datasets.",

    "abstract": "Navigating social environments is a fundamental challenge for the brain. It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’1–6. This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)7–9. However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals. Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains10–12. The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities. Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity. A study combining group decision-making tasks with fMRI shows that the brain’s dorsomedial prefrontal cortex uses basis functions, similar to those in the visual, motor and spatial domains, to represent patterns of social interaction.",

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA from the Mediterranean region has revealed long-range connections and population transformations associated with the spread of food-producing economies1–6. However, in contrast to Europe, genetic data from this key transition in northern Africa are limited, and have only been available from the far western Maghreb (Morocco)1–3. Here we present genome-wide data for nine individuals from the Later Stone Age through the Neolithic period from Algeria and Tunisia. The earliest individuals cluster with pre-Neolithic people of the western Maghreb (around 15,000–7,600 years before present (bp)), showing that this ‘Maghrebi’ ancestry profile had a substantial geographic and temporal extent. At least one individual from Djebba (Tunisia), dating to around 8,000 years bp, harboured ancestry from European hunter–gatherers, probably reflecting movement in the Early Holocene across the Strait of Sicily. Later Neolithic people from the eastern Maghreb retained largely local forager ancestry, together with smaller contributions from European farmers (by around 7,000 years bp) and Levantine groups (by around 6,800 years bp), and were thus far less impacted by external gene flow than were populations in other parts of the Neolithic Mediterranean. Ancient DNA from the eastern Maghreb (Tunisia and Algeria) dating between 15,000 and 6,000 years ago shows that this region was far less affected by external gene flow than the rest of the Neolithic Mediterranean, including not only Europe but also the western Maghreb (Morocco).",

    "abstract": "Many natural motor skills, such as speaking or locomotion, are acquired through a process of trial-and-error learning over the course of development. It has long been hypothesized, motivated by observations in artificial learning experiments, that dopamine has a crucial role in this process. Dopamine in the basal ganglia is thought to guide reward-based trial-and-error learning by encoding reward prediction errors1, decreasing after worse-than-predicted reward outcomes and increasing after better-than-predicted ones. Our previous work in adult zebra finches—in which we changed the perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback—showed that dopamine in Area X, the singing-related basal ganglia, encodes performance prediction error: dopamine is suppressed after worse-than-predicted (distorted syllables) and activated after better-than-predicted (undistorted syllables) performance2. However, it remains unknown whether the learning of natural behaviours, such as developmental vocal learning, occurs through dopamine-based reinforcement. Here we tracked song learning trajectories in juvenile zebra finches and used fibre photometry3 to monitor concurrent dopamine activity in Area X. We found that dopamine was activated after syllable renditions that were closer to the eventual adult version of the song, compared with recent renditions, and suppressed after renditions that were further away. Furthermore, the relationship between dopamine and song fluctuations revealed that dopamine predicted the future evolution of song, suggesting that dopamine drives behaviour. Finally, dopamine activity was explained by the contrast between the quality of the current rendition and the recent history of renditions—consistent with dopamine’s hypothesized role in encoding prediction errors in an actor–critic reinforcement-learning model4,5. Reinforcement-learning algorithms6 have emerged as a powerful class of model to explain learning in reward-based laboratory tasks, as well as for driving autonomous learning in artificial intelligence7. Our results suggest that complex natural behaviours in biological systems can also be acquired through dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning. Studies in zebra finches show that dopamine has a key role as a reinforcement signal in the trial-and-error process of learning that underlies complex natural behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Intratumour heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity drive tumour progression and therapy resistance1,2. Oncogene dosage variation contributes to cell-state transitions and phenotypic heterogeneity3, thereby providing a substrate for somatic evolution. Nonetheless, the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity are still poorly understood. Here we show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major source of high-level focal amplification in key oncogenes and a major contributor of MYC heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that ecDNAs drive varying levels of MYC dosage, depending on their regulatory landscape, enabling cancer cells to rapidly and reversibly adapt to microenvironmental changes. In the absence of selective pressure, a high ecDNA copy number imposes a substantial fitness cost on PDAC cells. We also show that MYC dosage affects cell morphology and dependence of cancer cells on stromal niche factors. Our work provides a detailed analysis of ecDNAs in PDAC and describes a new genetic mechanism driving MYC heterogeneity in PDAC. In a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, extrachromosomal DNAs are shown to be a source of high-level focal amplification driving MYC heterogeneity and phenotypic adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Antigenic variation is an immune evasion strategy used by many different pathogens. It involves the periodic, non-random switch in the expression of different antigens throughout an infection. How the observed hierarchy in antigen expression is achieved has remained a mystery1,2. A key challenge in uncovering this process has been the inability to track transcriptome changes and potential genomic rearrangements in individual cells during a switch event. Here we report the establishment of a highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing approach for the model protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. This approach has revealed genomic rearrangements that occur in individual cells during a switch event. Our data show that following a double-strand break in the transcribed antigen-coding gene—an important trigger for antigen switching—the type of repair mechanism and the resultant antigen expression depend on the availability of a homologous repair template in the genome. When such a template was available, repair proceeded through segmental gene conversion, creating new, mosaic antigen-coding genes. Conversely, in the absence of a suitable template, a telomere-adjacent antigen-coding gene from a different part of the genome was activated by break-induced replication. Our results show the critical role of repair sequence availability in the antigen selection mechanism. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the power of highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing methods in detecting genomic rearrangements that drive transcriptional changes at the single-cell level. A highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing approach reveals genomic features controlling the order of antigen activation in the model protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei.",

    "abstract": "Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication, primarily relies on erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs)1,2. Yet, EDFAs only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibres. This has motivated the development of amplifiers operating beyond the erbium gain window. Pioneering work on optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs)3,4 using intrinsic third-order optical nonlinearity has led to demonstrations of increased channel capacity. OPAs offer high gain, can reach the 3-dB quantum limit for phase-preserving amplifiers and exhibit unidirectional operation. However, power requirements for highly nonlinear fibres3,5–8 or bulk waveguides9,10 have impeded their adoption. By contrast, OPAs based on integrated photonic circuits offer the advantages of substantially increased mode confinement and optical nonlinearity but have been limited in bandwidth11,12. We overcome this challenge by using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide13–15 photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and attain up to 35 dB of parametric gain with waveguides only a few centimetres long in a compact footprint of 0.25 square millimetres. Fibre-to-fibre net gain exceeding 10 dB across an ultra-broad bandwidth of approximately 140 nm (that is, 17 THz) is achieved, with a threefold increase in the gain window compared with C-band EDFAs. We further demonstrate a high dynamic range for input signals, spanning six orders of magnitude, while maintaining a low noise figure. We exploit these performance characteristics to amplify coherent communication signals. This marks, to our knowledge, the first ultra-broadband, high-gain, continuous-wave amplification in a photonic chip, opening up new capabilities for next-generation integrated photonics. An optical parametric amplifier based on integrated photonic circuits fabricated using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide demonstrates improved bandwidth and gain performance over state-of-the-art erbium-doped fibre amplifiers while maintaining a low noise figure.",

    "abstract": "Nanoribbons, nanometre-wide strips of a two-dimensional material, are a unique system in condensed matter. They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times1,2, quantum confinement3 and topologically protected states4,5 can emerge. An exciting prospect for this material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge, a key property for spin-based electronics such as (low-energy) non-volatile transistors6. Here we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). We demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs show macroscopic magnetic properties arising from their edge, with internal fields of roughly 240 to 850 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at sub-1-T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that on photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funnelled to a state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a fascinating system for studying the interplay between magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics. Phosphorene nanoribbons demonstrate extraordinary magnetic properties, ranging from large internal fields in films to macroscopic alignment in solution, which can be coupled to photoexcitations that localize to the magnetic edge of these ribbons.",

    "abstract": "Who the first inhabitants of Western Europe were, what their physical characteristics were, and when and where they lived are some of the pending questions in the study of the settlement of Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene epoch. The available palaeoanthropological information from Western Europe is limited and confined to the Iberian Peninsula1,2. Here we present most of the midface of a hominin found at the TE7 level of the Sima del Elefante site (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain), dated to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years ago. This fossil (ATE7-1) represents the earliest human face of Western Europe identified thus far. Most of the morphological features of the midface of this hominin are primitive for the Homo clade and they do not display the modern-like aspect exhibited by Homo antecessor found at the neighbouring Gran Dolina site, also in the Sierra de Atapuerca, and dated to between 900,000 and 800,000 years ago3. Furthermore, ATE7-1 is more derived in the nasoalveolar region than the Dmanisi and other roughly contemporaneous hominins. On the basis of the available evidence, it is reasonable to assign the new human remains from TE7 level to Homo aff. erectus. From the archaeological, palaeontological and palaeoanthropological information obtained in the lower levels of the Sima del Elefante and Gran Dolina sites4–8, we suggest a turnover in the human population in Europe at the end of the Early Pleistocene. A Homo aff. erectus individual dated to 1.4 million to 1.1 million years ago found at Sima del Elefante (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain) does not display the modern-human-like aspect of Homo antecessor found at the neighbouring Gran Dolina site (900,000–800,000 years ago).",

    "abstract": "Phonon polaritons are quasiparticles resulting from the coherent coupling of photons with optical phonons in polar dielectrics1. Owing to their exceptional ability to confine electric fields to deep-subwavelength scales with low loss, they are uniquely poised to enable a suite of applications beyond the reach of conventional photonics, such as subdiffraction imaging2 and near-field energy transfer3–5. The conventional approach to exciting phonon polaritons through optical methods, however, involves costly light sources along with near-field schemes6,7, and generally leads to low excitation efficiency owing to substantial momentum mismatch between phonon polaritons and free-space photons. Here we demonstrate that under proper conditions, phonon polaritons can be excited all-electrically by drifting charge carriers. Specifically, in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/graphene heterostructures, by electrically driving charge carriers in ultrahigh-mobility graphene out of equilibrium, we observe bright electroluminescence of hBN’s hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared frequencies, which shows a temperature and carrier density dependence distinct from black-body thermal emission. Moreover, the carrier density dependence of the HPhP electroluminescence spectra reveals that HPhP electroluminescence can arise from both interband transition and intraband Cherenkov radiation8 of charge carriers in graphene. The HPhP electroluminescence offers avenues for realizing electrically pumped mid-infrared and terahertz phonon-polariton light sources. All-electrical excitation of the hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride by drifting charge carriers in nearby graphene results in electroluminescence at mid-infrared frequencies.",

    "abstract": "In the course of antibody affinity maturation, germinal centre (GC) B cells mutate their immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes in a process known as somatic hypermutation (SHM)1–4. Panels of mutant B cells with different binding affinities for antigens are then selected in a Darwinian manner, which leads to a progressive increase in affinity among the population5. As with any Darwinian process, rare gain-of-fitness mutations must be identified and common loss-of-fitness mutations avoided6. Progressive acquisition of mutations therefore poses a risk during large proliferative bursts7, when GC B cells undergo several cell cycles in the absence of affinity-based selection8–13. Using a combination of in vivo mouse experiments and mathematical modelling, here we show that GCs achieve this balance by strongly suppressing SHM during clonal-burst-type expansion, so that a large fraction of the progeny generated by these bursts does not deviate from their ancestral genotype. Intravital imaging and image-based cell sorting of a mouse strain carrying a reporter of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity showed that B cells that are actively undergoing proliferative bursts lack the transient CDK2low ‘G0-like’ phase of the cell cycle in which SHM takes place. We propose a model in which inertially cycling B cells mostly delay SHM until the G0-like phase that follows their final round of division in the GC dark zone, thus maintaining affinity as they clonally expand in the absence of selection. B cell germinal centres achieve a balance between clonal expansion and sequence diversification by suppressing somatic hypermutation during proliferative clonal bursts.",

    "abstract": "Rapid learning confers significant advantages on animals in ecological environments. Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues1–4. This slow learning is thought to be supported by gradual changes to cue representation in the sensory cortex2,5. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest6,7, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity. Here we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance)7. Optogenetic silencing demonstrated that the auditory cortex drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable once mice achieve ‘expert’ performance. Instead of enhanced cue representations8, two-photon calcium imaging of auditory cortical neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance. A reward-prediction signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors early in training, and faded in expert mice. Silencing at the time of this signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting that it serves an associative role. A distinct cell ensemble encoded and controlled licking suppression that drove slower performance improvements. These ensembles were spatially clustered but uncoupled from sensory representations, indicating higher-order functional segregation within auditory cortex. Our results reveal that the sensory cortex manifests higher-order computations that separably drive rapid learning and slower performance improvements, reshaping our understanding of the fundamental role of the sensory cortex. In mice, learning and performance on an auditory task is driven by higher-order signals in the auditory cortex that are no longer required when the mouse has achieved expert-level performance.",

    "abstract": "Weather prediction is critical for a range of human activities, including transportation, agriculture and industry, as well as for the safety of the general public. Machine learning transforms numerical weather prediction (NWP) by replacing the numerical solver with neural networks, improving the speed and accuracy of the forecasting component of the prediction pipeline1–6. However, current models rely on numerical systems at initialization and to produce local forecasts, thereby limiting their achievable gains. Here we show that a single machine learning model can replace the entire NWP pipeline. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system, ingests observations and produces global gridded forecasts and local station forecasts. The global forecasts outperform an operational NWP baseline for several variables and lead times. The local station forecasts are skilful for up to ten days of lead time, competing with a post-processed global NWP baseline and a state-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting system with input from human forecasters. End-to-end tuning further improves the accuracy of local forecasts. Our results show that skilful forecasting is possible without relying on NWP at deployment time, which will enable the realization of the full speed and accuracy benefits of data-driven models. We believe that Aardvark Weather will be the starting point for a new generation of end-to-end models that will reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude and enable the rapid, affordable creation of customized models for a range of end users. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end machine learning model, replaces the entire numerical weather prediction pipeline with a machine learning model, by producing accurate global and local forecasts without relying on numerical solvers, revolutionizing weather prediction with improved speed, accuracy and customization capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Calorie-rich foods, particularly those that are high in fat and sugar, evoke pleasure in both humans and animals1. However, prolonged consumption of such foods may reduce their hedonic value, potentially contributing to obesity2–4. Here we investigated this phenomenon in mice on a chronic high-fat diet (HFD). Although these mice preferred high-fat food over regular chow in their home cages, they showed reduced interest in calorie-rich foods in a no-effort setting. This paradoxical decrease in hedonic feeding has been reported previously3–7, but its neurobiological basis remains unclear. We found that in mice on regular diet, neurons in the lateral nucleus accumbens (NAcLat) projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encoded hedonic feeding behaviours. In HFD mice, this behaviour was reduced and uncoupled from neural activity. Optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway increased hedonic feeding in mice on regular diet but not in HFD mice, though this behaviour was restored when HFD mice returned to a regular diet. HFD mice exhibited reduced neurotensin expression and release in the NAcLat→VTA pathway. Furthermore, neurotensin knockout in the NAcLat and neurotensin receptor blockade in the VTA each abolished optogenetically induced hedonic feeding behaviour. Enhancing neurotensin signalling via overexpression normalized aspects of diet-induced obesity, including weight gain and hedonic feeding. Together, our findings identify a neural circuit mechanism that links the devaluation of hedonic foods with obesity. In mice, prolonged consumption of a high-fat diet decreases interest in calorie-rich foods as a result of reduced neurotensin expression and signalling, which uncouples hedonic feeding behaviour linked to neurons projecting from lateral nucleus accumbens to ventral tegmental area.",

    "abstract": "An increased level of phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit-α (eIF2α, encoded by EIF2S1; eIF2α-p) coupled with decreased guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B is a hallmark of the ‘canonical’ integrated stress response (c-ISR)1. It is unclear whether impaired eIF2B activity in human diseases including leukodystrophies2, which occurs in the absence of eIF2α-p induction, is synonymous with the c-ISR. Here we describe a mechanism triggered by decreased eIF2B activity, distinct from the c-ISR, which we term the split ISR (s-ISR). The s-ISR is characterized by translational and transcriptional programs that are different from those observed in the c-ISR. Opposite to the c-ISR, the s-ISR requires eIF4E-dependent translation of the upstream open reading frame 1 and subsequent stabilization of ATF4 mRNA. This is followed by altered expression of a subset of metabolic genes (for example, PCK2), resulting in metabolic rewiring required to maintain cellular bioenergetics when eIF2B activity is attenuated. Overall, these data demonstrate a plasticity of the mammalian ISR, whereby the loss of eIF2B activity in the absence of eIF2α-p induction activates the eIF4E–ATF4–PCK2 axis to maintain energy homeostasis. A study describes the split integrated stress response, a cellular stress response mechanism characterized by reduced eIF2B activity without eIF2α phosphorylation, which activates the eIF4E–ATF4–PCK2 axis, enabling metabolic reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic circadian clock keeps time by using a transcription–translation feedback loop, which exhibits an architecture that is conserved across a diverse range of organisms, including fungi, plants and animals1. Despite their mechanistic similarity, the molecular components of these clocks indicate a lack of common ancestry2. Our study reveals that RUVBL2, which is a P-loop NTPase enzyme previously shown to affect circadian phase and amplitude as part of mammalian clock super-complexes, influences the circadian period through its remarkably slow ATPase activity, resembling the well-characterized KaiC-based clock in cyanobacteria. A screen of RUVBL2 variants identified arrhythmic, short-period and long-period mutants that altered circadian locomotor activity rhythms following delivery by adeno-associated virus to the murine suprachiasmatic nucleus. Enzymatic assays showed that wild-type RUVBL2 hydrolyses only around 13 ATP molecules a day, a vastly reduced turnover compared with typical ATPases. Notably, physical interactions between RUVBL2 orthologues and core clock proteins in humans, Drosophila and the fungus Neurospora, along with consistent circadian phenotypes of RUVBL2-mutant orthologues across species, reinforce their clock-related function in eukaryotes. Thus, as well as establishing RUVBL2 as a common core component in eukaryotic clocks, our study supports the idea that slow ATPase activity, initially discovered in cyanobacteria, is a shared feature of eukaryotic clocks. A study finds that RUVBL2 is a conserved component of eukaryotic circadian clocks and suggests that slow ATPase activity, which was initially discovered in cyanobacteria, is a shared feature of eukaryotic clocks.",

    "abstract": "The Saharo-Arabian Desert is one of the largest biogeographical barriers on Earth, impeding dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, including movements of past hominins. Recent research suggests that this barrier has been in place since at least 11 million years ago1. In contrast, fossil evidence from the late Miocene epoch and the Pleistocene epoch suggests the episodic presence within the Saharo-Arabian Desert interior of water-dependent fauna (for example, crocodiles, equids, hippopotamids and proboscideans)2–6, sustained by rivers and lakes7,8 that are largely absent from today’s arid landscape. Although numerous humid phases occurred in southern Arabia during the past 1.1 million years9, little is known about Arabia’s palaeoclimate before this time. Here, based on a climatic record from desert speleothems, we show recurrent humid intervals in the central Arabian interior over the past 8 million years. Precipitation during humid intervals decreased and became more variable over time, as the monsoon’s influence weakened, coinciding with enhanced Northern Hemisphere polar ice cover during the Pleistocene. Wetter conditions likely facilitated mammalian dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, with Arabia acting as a key crossroads for continental-scale biogeographic exchanges. A climatic record from desert speleothems shows that the central Arabian interior experienced recurrent humid intervals over the past 8 million years, which likely facilitated mammalian dispersals between Africa and Eurasia.",

    "abstract": "The water contents of the lunar interior record important clues for understanding the formation and subsequent thermochemical evolution of the Moon1. The Chang’e-6 (CE6) mission returned samples from the South Pole–Aitken impact basin of the lunar farside2–4, providing an opportunity to study the water contents of the farside mantle. Here we report the water abundances and hydrogen isotope compositions of apatite and melt inclusions from CE6 mare basalt, derived from partial melting of the lunar mantle. The parent magma of CE6 mare basalt is estimated to have a water abundance of 15–168 μg g−1 with a δD value of −123 ± 167‰. Our estimate of water abundance of 1–1.5 μg g−1 for the mantle source indicates that the farside mantle is potentially drier than its nearside counterpart. This contrast thus suggests that the distribution of water in the interior of the Moon may exhibit a hemispheric dichotomy similar to numerous surface features5. The new estimate for the lunar farside mantle represents a landmark for estimating the water abundance of the bulk silicate Moon, providing critical constraints on the giant impact origin hypothesis6–8 and the subsequent evolution of the Moon for which the role of water is central1,9. An estimate of water abundance in the lunar mantle indicates that the farside mantle is potentially drier than its nearside counterpart.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is replicated by DNA polymerase γ (POLγ), a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic POLγA subunit and two accessory POLγB subunits1. More than 300 mutations in POLG, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit, have been linked to severe, progressive conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality, for which no treatment exists2. Here we report on the discovery and characterization of PZL-A, a first-in-class small-molecule activator of mtDNA synthesis that is capable of restoring function to the most common mutant variants of POLγ. PZL-A binds to an allosteric site at the interface between the catalytic POLγA subunit and the proximal POLγB subunit, a region that is unaffected by nearly all disease-causing mutations. The compound restores wild-type-like activity to mutant forms of POLγ in vitro and activates mtDNA synthesis in cells from paediatric patients with lethal POLG disease, thereby enhancing biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery and cellular respiration. Our work demonstrates that a small molecule can restore function to mutant DNA polymerases, offering a promising avenue for treating POLG disorders and other severe conditions linked to depletion of mtDNA. An activator of DNA polymerase γ restores function to disease-causing mutant variants and demonstrates a potential route to treatments for inherited mitochondrial disorders involving POLG mutations.",

    "abstract": "In the same way that the mRNA-binding specificities of transfer RNAs define the genetic code, the DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) form the molecular basis of the gene regulatory code1,2. The human gene regulatory code is much more complex than the genetic code, in particular because there are more than 1,600 TFs that commonly interact with each other. TF–TF interactions are required for specifying cell fate and executing cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. Despite this, the landscape of interactions between DNA-bound TFs is poorly defined. Here we map the biochemical interactions between DNA-bound TFs using CAP-SELEX, a method that can simultaneously identify individual TF binding preferences, TF–TF interactions and the DNA sequences that are bound by the interacting complexes. A screen of more than 58,000 TF–TF pairs identified 2,198 interacting TF pairs, 1,329 of which preferentially bound to their motifs arranged in a distinct spacing and/or orientation. We also discovered 1,131 TF–TF composite motifs that were markedly different from the motifs of the individual TFs. In total, we estimate that the screen identified between 18% and 47% of all human TF–TF motifs. The novel composite motifs we found were enriched in cell-type-specific elements, active in vivo and more likely to be formed between developmentally co-expressed TFs. Furthermore, TFs that define embryonic axes commonly interacted with different TFs and bound to distinct motifs, explaining how TFs with a similar specificity can define distinct cell types along developmental axes. A large-scale analysis of DNA-bound transcription factors (TFs) shows how the presence of DNA markedly affects the landscape of TF interactions, and identifies composite motifs that are recognized by complexes of TFs rather than by individual ones.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between nontrivial band topology and layered antiferromagnetism in MnBi2Te4 has opened a new avenue for exploring topological phases of matter1–4. The quantum anomalous Hall effect5 and axion insulator state6 have been observed in odd and even number layers of MnBi2Te4, and the quantum metric nonlinear Hall effect7,8 has been shown to exist in this topological antiferromagnet. The rich and complex antiferromagnetic spin dynamics in MnBi2Te4 is expected to generate new quantum anomalous Hall phenomena that are absent in conventional ferromagnetic topological insulators, but experimental observations are still unknown. Here we fabricate a device of 7-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 covered with an AlOx capping layer, which enables the investigation of antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect over wide parameter spaces. By tuning the gate voltage and perpendicular magnetic field, we uncover a cascade of quantum phase transitions that can be attributed to the influence of complex spin configurations on edge state transport. Furthermore, we find that an in-plane magnetic field enhances both the coercive field and the exchange gap of the surface state, in contrast to that in the ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall state. Combined with numerical simulations, we propose that these peculiar features arise from the spin flip and flop transitions that are inherent to a van der Waals antiferromagnet. The versatile tunability of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in MnBi2Te4 paves the way for potential applications in topological antiferromagnetic spintronics9,10. A new device based on 7-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 covered with an AlOx capping layer enables the investigation of antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect over wide parameter spaces.",

    "abstract": "Impaired differentiation is a hallmark of myeloid malignancies1,2. Therapies that enable cells to circumvent the differentiation block, such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), are by and large curative in acute promyelocytic leukaemia3, but whether ‘differentiation therapy’ is a generalizable therapeutic approach for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and beyond remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of the histone demethylase LSD1 (LSD1i) and the WNT pathway antagonist GSK3 kinase4 (GSK3i) robustly promotes therapeutic differentiation of established AML cell lines and primary human AML cells, as well as reducing tumour burden and significantly extending survival in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, this combination promotes differentiation by activating genes in the type I interferon pathway via inducing expression of transcription factors such as IRF7 (LSD1i) and the co-activator β-catenin (GSK3i), and their selective co-occupancy at targets such as STAT1, which is necessary for combination-induced differentiation. Combination treatment also suppresses the canonical, pro-oncogenic WNT pathway and cell cycle genes. Analysis of datasets from patients with AML suggests a correlation between the combination-induced transcription signature and better prognosis, highlighting clinical potential of this strategy. Collectively, this combination strategy rewires transcriptional programs to suppress stemness and to promote differentiation, which may have important therapeutic implications for AML and WNT-driven cancers beyond AML. Simultaneous inhibition of LSD1 and GSK3 kinase promotes cell differentiation, providing a therapeutic strategy for treating acute myeloid leukaemia.",

    "abstract": "Potatoes were first brought to Europe in the sixteenth century1,2. Two hundred years later, one of the species had become one of the most important food sources across the entire continent and, later, even the entire world3. However, its highly heterozygous, autotetraploid genome has complicated its improvement since then4–7. Here we present the pan-genome of European potatoes generated from phased genome assemblies of ten historical potato cultivars, which includes approximately 85% of all haplotypes segregating in Europe. Sequence diversity between the haplotypes was extremely high (for example, 20× higher than in humans), owing to numerous introgressions from wild potato species. By contrast, haplotype diversity was very low, in agreement with the population bottlenecks caused by domestication and transition to Europe. To illustrate a practical application of the pan-genome, we converted it into a haplotype graph and used it to generate phased, megabase-scale pseudo-genome assemblies of commercial potatoes (including the famous French fries potato ‘Russet Burbank’) using cost-efficient short reads only. In summary, we present a nearly complete pan-genome of autotetraploid European potato, we describe extraordinarily high sequence diversity in a domesticated crop, and we outline how this resource might be used to accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and research. A haplotype-resolved pan-genome of autotetraploid European potato founder lines shows high nucleotide diversity at remarkably low haplotype diversity, which is probably the result of hybridization events with wild potato species, followed by population bottlenecks during domestication and transition to Europe.",

    "abstract": "The formation of accessible chromatin around DNA double-strand breaks is essential for their efficient repair1. Although the linker histone H1 is known to facilitate higher-order chromatin compaction2,3, the mechanisms by which H1 modifications regulate chromatin relaxation in response to DNA damage are unclear. Here we show that CTP synthase 1 (CTPS1)-catalysed deamidation of H1 asparagine residues 76 and 77 triggers the sequential acetylation of lysine 75 following DNA damage, and this dual modification of H1 is associated with chromatin opening. Mechanistically, the histone acetyltransferase p300 showed a preference for deamidated H1 as a substrate, establishing H1 deamidation as a prerequisite for subsequent acetylation. Moreover, high expression of CTPS1 was associated with resistance to cancer radiotherapy, in both mouse xenograft models and clinical cohorts. These findings provide new insights into how linker histones regulate dynamic chromatin alterations in the DNA damage response. Insights into how the linker histone H1 promotes chromatin alterations and allows repair of DNA damage are described.",

    "abstract": "The maritime Phoenician civilization from the Levant transformed the entire Mediterranean during the first millennium bce1–3. However, the extent of human movement between the Levantine Phoenician homeland and Phoenician–Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean has been unclear in the absence of comprehensive ancient DNA studies. Here, we generated genome-wide data for 210 individuals, including 196 from 14 sites traditionally identified as Phoenician and Punic in the Levant, North Africa, Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and Ibiza, and an early Iron Age individual from Algeria. Levantine Phoenicians made little genetic contribution to Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean between the sixth and second centuries bce, despite abundant archaeological evidence of cultural, historical, linguistic and religious links4. Instead, these inheritors of Levantine Phoenician culture derived most of their ancestry from a genetic profile similar to that of Sicily and the Aegean. Much of the remaining ancestry originated from North Africa, reflecting the growing influence of Carthage5. However, this was a minority contributor of ancestry in all of the sampled sites, including in Carthage itself. Different Punic sites across the central and western Mediterranean show similar patterns of high genetic diversity. We also detect genetic relationships across the Mediterranean, reflecting shared demographic processes that shaped the Punic world. Levantine Phoenicians made little genetic contribution to Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean between the sixth and second centuries bce; instead, the Punic people derived most of their ancestry from a genetic profile similar to that of Sicily and the Aegean, with notable contributions from North Africa as well.",

    "abstract": "The coupling between electrons and phonons is one of the fundamental interactions in solids, underpinning a wide range of phenomena, such as resistivity, heat conductivity and superconductivity. However, direct measurements of this coupling for individual phonon modes remain a substantial challenge. In this work, we introduce a new technique for mapping phonon dispersions and electron–phonon coupling (EPC) in van der Waals (vdW) materials. By generalizing the quantum twisting microscope1 (QTM) to cryogenic temperatures, we demonstrate its capability to map not only electronic dispersions through elastic momentum-conserving tunnelling but also phononic dispersions through inelastic momentum-conserving tunnelling. Crucially, the inelastic tunnelling strength provides a direct and quantitative measure of the momentum and mode-resolved EPC. We use this technique to measure the phonon spectrum and EPC of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with twist angles larger than 6°. Notably, we find that, unlike standard acoustic phonons, whose coupling to electrons diminishes as their momentum tends to zero, TBG exhibits a low-energy mode whose coupling increases with decreasing twist angle. We show that this unusual coupling arises from the modulation of the interlayer tunnelling by a layer-antisymmetric ‘phason’ mode of the moiré system. The technique demonstrated here opens the way for examining a large variety of other neutral collective modes that couple to electronic tunnelling, including plasmons2, magnons3 and spinons4 in quantum materials. Generalization of a quantum twisting microscope to cryogenic temperatures in twisted bilayer graphene shows the ability to map phononic dispersions through inelastic momentum-conserving tunnelling and reveals an angle-dependent coupling between electrons and phonons.",

    "abstract": "The body of an animal influences how its nervous system generates behaviour1. Accurately modelling the neural control of sensorimotor behaviour requires an anatomically detailed biomechanical representation of the body. Here we introduce a whole-body model of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in a physics simulator2. Designed as a general-purpose framework, our model enables the simulation of diverse fly behaviours, including both terrestrial and aerial locomotion. We validate its versatility by replicating realistic walking and flight behaviours. To support these behaviours, we develop phenomenological models for fluid and adhesion forces. Using data-driven, end-to-end reinforcement learning3,4, we train neural network controllers capable of generating naturalistic locomotion5–7 along complex trajectories in response to high-level steering commands. Furthermore, we show the use of visual sensors and hierarchical motor control8, training a high-level controller to reuse a pretrained low-level flight controller to perform visually guided flight tasks. Our model serves as an open-source platform for studying the neural control of sensorimotor behaviour in an embodied context. A detailed whole-body model of the fruit fly, developed using a physics-based simulation and deep reinforcement learning, accurately replicates real fly behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In most complex nervous systems there is a clear anatomical separation between the nerve cord, which contains most of the final motor outputs necessary for behaviour, and the brain. In insects, the neck connective is both a physical and an information bottleneck connecting the brain and the ventral nerve cord (an analogue of the spinal cord) and comprises diverse populations of descending neurons (DNs), ascending neurons (ANs) and sensory ascending neurons, which are crucial for sensorimotor signalling and control. Here, by integrating three separate electron microscopy (EM) datasets1–4, we provide a complete connectomic description of the ANs and DNs of the Drosophila female nervous system and compare them with neurons of the male nerve cord. Proofread neuronal reconstructions are matched across hemispheres, datasets and sexes. Crucially, we also match 51% of DN cell types to light-level data5 defining specific driver lines, as well as classifying all ascending populations. We use these results to reveal the anatomical and circuit logic of neck connective neurons. We observe connected chains of DNs and ANs spanning the neck, which may subserve motor sequences. We provide a complete description of sexually dimorphic DN and AN populations, with detailed analyses of selected circuits for reproductive behaviours, including male courtship6 (DNa12; also known as aSP22) and song production7 (AN neurons from hemilineage 08B) and female ovipositor extrusion8 (DNp13). Our work provides EM-level circuit analyses that span the entire central nervous system of an adult animal. Three electron microscopy datasets are combined to provide a complete connectomic description of the neural circuitry that makes up the neck connective in Drosophila, including the descending neurons, ascending neurons and sensory ascending neurons.",

    "abstract": "Nickel is a critical element in the shift to sustainable energy systems, with the demand for nickel projected to exceed 6 million tons annually by 20401–4, largely driven by the electrification of the transport sector. Primary nickel production uses acids and carbon-based reductants, emitting about 20 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of nickel produced5–7. Here we present a method using fossil-free hydrogen-plasma-based reduction to extract nickel from low-grade ore variants known as laterites. We bypass the traditional multistep process and combine calcination, smelting, reduction and refining into a single metallurgical step conducted in one furnace. This approach produces high-grade ferronickel alloys at fast reduction kinetics. Thermodynamic control of the atmosphere of the furnace enables selective nickel reduction, yielding an alloy with minimal impurities (<0.04 wt% silicon, approximately 0.01 wt% phosphorus and <0.09 wt% calcium), eliminating the need for further refining. The proposed method has the potential to be up to about 18% more energy efficient while cutting direct carbon dioxide emissions by up to 84% compared with current practice. Our work thus shows a sustainable approach to help resolve the contradiction between the beneficial use of nickel in sustainable energy technologies and the environmental harm caused by its production. A one-step process using fossil-free hydrogen-plasma-based reduction is used to extract nickel from low-grade ore and create high-grade ferronickel alloys, providing a more sustainable and environmentally friendly method for obtaining nickel.",

    "abstract": "The targeted delivery of therapeutics to internal organs to, for example, promote healing or apoptosis holds promise in the treatment of numerous diseases1–4. Currently, the prevailing delivery modality relies on the circulation; however, this modality has substantial efficiency, safety and/or controllability limitations5–9. Here we report a battery-free, chipless, soft nanofluidic intracellular delivery (NanoFLUID) patch that provides enhanced and customized delivery of payloads in targeted internal organs. The chipless architecture and the flexible nature of thin functional layers facilitate integration with internal organs. The nanopore–microchannel–microelectrode structure enables safe, efficient and precise electroperforation of the cell membrane, which in turn accelerates intracellular payload transport by approximately 105 times compared with conventional diffusion methods while operating under relatively low-amplitude pulses (20 V). Through evaluations of the NanoFLUID patch in multiple in vivo scenarios, including treatment of breast tumours and acute injury in the liver and modelling tumour development, we validated its efficiency, safety and controllability for organ-targeted delivery. NanoFLUID-mediated in vivo transfection of a gene library also enabled efficient screening of essential drivers of breast cancer metastasis in the lung and liver. Through this approach, DUS2 was identified as a lung-specific metastasis driver. Thus, NanoFLUID represents an innovative bioelectronic platform for the targeted delivery of payloads to internal organs to treat various diseases and to uncover new insights in biology. A nanofluidic intracellular delivery (NanoFLUID) patch provides a versatile, biocompatible and efficient method for the targeted delivery of payloads to internal organs for therapeutic purposes and for biomolecular investigations.",

    "abstract": "A chain of quantum dots (QDs) in semiconductor–superconductor hybrid systems can form an artificial Kitaev chain hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs)1–3. These zero-energy states are expected to be localized on the edges of the chain4, at the outermost QDs. The remaining QDs, comprising the bulk, are predicted to host an excitation gap that protects the MBSs at the edges from local on-site perturbations. Here we demonstrate this connection between the bulk and edges in a minimal system, by engineering a three-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas. Through direct tunnelling spectroscopy on each site, we show that the appearance of stable zero-bias conductance peaks at the outer QDs is correlated with the presence of an excitation gap in the middle QD. Furthermore, we show that this gap can be controlled by applying a superconducting phase difference between the two hybrid segments and that the MBSs are robust only when the excitation gap is present. We find a close agreement between experiments and the original Kitaev model, thus confirming key predictions for MBSs in a three-site chain. An artificial Kitaev chain is realized by engineering three coupled quantum dots in a two-dimensional electron gas, which enables the manipulation and observation of both the edge and bulk states.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) impairs the durability of aluminium (Al) alloys and hinders their use in a hydrogen economy1–3. Intermetallic compound particles in Al alloys can trap hydrogen and mitigate HE4, but these particles usually form in a low number density compared with conventional strengthening nanoprecipitates. Here we report a size-sieved complex precipitation in Sc-added Al–Mg alloys to achieve a high-density dispersion of both fine Al3Sc nanoprecipitates and in situ formed core-shell Al3(Mg, Sc)2/Al3Sc nanophases with high hydrogen-trapping ability. The two-step heat treatment induces heterogeneous nucleation of the Samson-phase Al3(Mg, Sc)2 on the surface of Al3Sc nanoprecipitates that are only above 10 nm in size. The size dependence is associated with Al3Sc nanoprecipitate incoherency, which leads to local segregation of magnesium and triggers the formation of Al3(Mg, Sc)2. The tailored distribution of dual nanoprecipitates in our Al–Mg–Sc alloy provides about a 40% increase in strength and nearly five times improved HE resistance compared with the Sc-free alloy, reaching a record tensile uniform elongation in Al alloys charged with H up to 7 ppmw. We apply this strategy to other Al–Mg-based alloys, such as Al–Mg–Ti–Zr, Al–Mg–Cu–Sc and Al–Mg–Zn–Sc alloys. Our work showcases a possible route to increase hydrogen resistance in high-strength Al alloys and could be readily adapted to large-scale industrial production. A size-sieved complex precipitation in Sc-added Al–Mg alloys achieves a high-density dispersion of both fine Al3Sc nanoprecipitates and in situ formed core-shell Al3(Mg, Sc)2/Al3Sc nanophases with high hydrogen-trapping ability.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic genome is packed into nucleosomes of 147 base pairs around a histone core and is organized into euchromatin and heterochromatin, corresponding to the A and B compartments, respectively1,2. Here we investigated whether individual nucleosomes contain sufficient information for 3D genomic organization into compartments, for example, in their biophysical properties. We purified native mononucleosomes to high monodispersity and used physiological concentrations of polyamines to determine their condensability. The chromosomal regions known to partition into A compartments have low condensability and those for B compartments have high condensability. Chromatin polymer simulations using condensability as the only input, without any trans factors, reproduced the A/B compartments. Condensability is also strongly anticorrelated with gene expression, particularly near the promoters and in a cell type-dependent manner. Therefore, mononucleosomes have biophysical properties associated with genes being on or off. Comparisons with genetic and epigenetic features indicate that nucleosome condensability is an emergent property, providing a natural axis on which to project the high-dimensional cellular chromatin state. Analysis using various condensing agents or histone modifications and mutations indicates that the genome organization principle encoded into nucleosomes is mostly electrostatic in nature. Polyamine depletion in mouse T cells, resulting from either knocking out or inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase, results in hyperpolarized condensability, indicating that when cells cannot rely on polyamines to translate the biophysical properties of nucleosomes to 3D genome organization, they accentuate condensability contrast, which may explain the dysfunction observed with polyamine deficiency3–5. A technique called condense-seq has been developed to measure nucleosome condensability and used to show that mononucleosomes contain sufficient information to condense into large-scale compartments without requiring any external factors.",

    "abstract": "As the primary source of noradrenaline in the brain, the locus coeruleus (LC) regulates arousal, avoidance and stress responses1,2. However, how local neuromodulatory inputs control LC function remains unresolved. Here we identify a population of transcriptionally, spatially and functionally diverse GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) neurons in the LC dendritic field that receive distant inputs and modulate modes of LC firing to control global arousal levels and arousal-related processing and behaviours. We define peri-LC anatomy using viral tracing and combine single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics to molecularly define both LC noradrenaline-producing and peri-LC cell types. We identify several neuronal cell types that underlie peri-LC functional diversity using a series of complementary neural circuit approaches in behaving mice. Our findings indicate that LC and peri-LC neurons are transcriptionally, functionally and anatomically heterogenous neuronal populations that modulate arousal and avoidance states. Defining the molecular, cellular and functional diversity of the LC and peri-LC provides a roadmap for understanding the neurobiological basis of arousal, motivation and neuropsychiatric disorders. A set of neurons in the peri-locus coeruleus region controls arousal and avoidance states, providing an understanding of the neurobiological basis of arousal and exploratory behaviours.",

    "abstract": "In bilaterian animals, gene regulation is shaped by a combination of linear and spatial regulatory information. Regulatory elements along the genome are integrated into gene regulatory landscapes through chromatin compartmentalization1,2, insulation of neighbouring genomic regions3,4 and chromatin looping that brings together distal cis-regulatory sequences5. However, the evolution of these regulatory features is unknown because the three-dimensional genome architecture of most animal lineages remains unexplored6,7. To trace the evolutionary origins of animal genome regulation, here we characterized the physical organization of the genome in non-bilaterian animals (sponges, ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians)8,9 and their closest unicellular relatives (ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates)10 by combining high-resolution chromosome conformation capture11,12 with epigenomic marks and gene expression data. Our comparative analysis showed that chromatin looping is a conserved feature of genome architecture in ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians. These sequence-determined distal contacts involve both promoter–enhancer and promoter–promoter interactions. By contrast, chromatin loops are absent in the unicellular relatives of animals. Our findings indicate that spatial genome regulation emerged early in animal evolution. This evolutionary innovation introduced regulatory complexity, ultimately facilitating the diversification of animal developmental programmes and cell type repertoires. The physical organization of the genome in non-bilaterian animals and their closest unicellular relatives is characterized; comparative analysis shows chromatin looping is a conserved feature of genome architecture and spatial genome regulation emerged early in animal evolution.",

    "abstract": "Research on the morphology, physiology and genomics of Asgard archaea has provided valuable insights into the evolutionary history of eukaryotes1–3. A previous study suggested that eukaryotes are nested within Heimdallarchaeia4, but their exact phylogenetic placement within Asgard archaea remains controversial4,5. This debate complicates understanding of the metabolic features and timescales of early eukaryotic ancestors. Here we generated 223 metagenome-assembled nearly complete genomes of Asgard archaea that have not previously been documented. We identify 16 new lineages at the genus level or higher, which substantially expands the known phylogenetic diversity of Asgard archaea. Through sophisticated phylogenomic analysis of this expanded genomic dataset involving several marker sets we infer that eukaryotes evolved before the diversification of all sampled Heimdallarchaeia, rather than branching with Hodarchaeales within the Heimdallarchaeia. This difference in the placement of eukaryotes is probably caused by the previously underappreciated chimeric nature of Njordarchaeales genomes, which we find are composed of sequences of both Asgard and TACK archaea (Asgard’s sister phylum). Using ancestral reconstruction and molecular dating, we infer that the last Asgard archaea and eukaryote common ancestor emerged before the Great Oxidation Event and was probably an anaerobic H2-dependent acetogen. Our findings support the hydrogen hypothesis of eukaryogenesis, which posits that eukaryotes arose from the fusion of a H2-consuming archaeal host and a H2-producing protomitochondrion. Ancestral reconstruction together with molecular dating of the last Asgard archaea and eukaryote common ancestor suggest that eukaryotes arose from the fusion of a H2-consuming archaeal host and a H2-producing protomitochondrion.",

    "abstract": "Graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide flat-band systems show similar phase diagrams, replete with magnetic1–5 and superconducting6–11 phases. An abiding question has been whether magnetic ordering competes with superconductivity or facilitates pairing. For example, recent studies of Bernal bilayer graphene in the presence of enhanced spin–orbit coupling show a substantial increase in the observed domain and critical temperature Tc of superconducting states12–14; however, the mechanism for this enhancement remains unknown. Here we show that introducing spin–orbit coupling in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) by substrate proximity effect generates new superconducting pockets for both electron and hole doping, with maximal Tc ≈ 300 mK, which is three times larger than in RTG encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride. Using local magnetometry, we show that superconductivity straddles a transition between a spin-canted state with a finite in-plane magnetic moment and a state with complete spin–valley locking. This transition is reproduced in our Hartree–Fock calculations, in which this transition is driven by the competition between spin–orbit coupling and the carrier-density-tuned Hund’s interaction. Our experiment suggests that the enhancement of superconductivity by spin–orbit coupling is driven by a quantitative change in the canting angle rather than a change in the ground state symmetry. These results align with a recently proposed mechanism for the enhancement of superconductivity15, in which fluctuations in the spin-canting order contribute to the pairing interaction. Introducing spin–orbit coupling by substrate proximity effect leads to an enhancement of superconducting phases in rhombohedral trilayer graphene.",

    "abstract": "Choice behaviour of animals is characterized by two main tendencies: taking actions that led to rewards and repeating past actions1,2. Theory suggests that these strategies may be reinforced by different types of dopaminergic teaching signals: reward prediction error to reinforce value-based associations and movement-based action prediction errors to reinforce value-free repetitive associations3–6. Here we use an auditory discrimination task in mice to show that movement-related dopamine activity in the tail of the striatum encodes the hypothesized action prediction error signal. Causal manipulations reveal that this prediction error serves as a value-free teaching signal that supports learning by reinforcing repeated associations. Computational modelling and experiments demonstrate that action prediction errors alone cannot support reward-guided learning, but when paired with the reward prediction error circuitry they serve to consolidate stable sound–action associations in a value-free manner. Together we show that there are two types of dopaminergic prediction errors that work in tandem to support learning, each reinforcing different types of association in different striatal areas. Dopaminergic action prediction error signals are used by mice as a value-free teaching signal to reinforce stable sound–action associations in the tail of the striatum.",

    "abstract": "The known fossil record of crown-group amniotes begins in the late Carboniferous with the sauropsid trackmaker Notalacerta1,2 and the sauropsid body fossil Hylonomus1–4. The earliest body fossils of crown-group tetrapods are mid-Carboniferous, and the oldest trackways are early Carboniferous5–7. This suggests that the tetrapod crown group originated in the earliest Carboniferous (early Tournaisian), with the amniote crown group appearing in the early part of the late Carboniferous. Here we present new trackway data from Australia that challenge this widely accepted timeline. A track-bearing slab from the Snowy Plains Formation of Victoria, Taungurung Country, securely dated to the early Tournaisian8,9, shows footprints from a crown-group amniote with clawed feet, most probably a primitive sauropsid. This pushes back the likely origin of crown-group amniotes by at least 35–40 million years. We also extend the range of Notalacerta into the early Carboniferous. The Australian tracks indicate that the amniote crown-group node cannot be much younger than the Devonian/Carboniferous boundary, and that the tetrapod crown-group node must be located deep within the Devonian; an estimate based on molecular-tree branch lengths suggests an approximate age of early Frasnian for the latter. The implications for the early evolution of tetrapods are profound; all stem-tetrapod and stem-amniote lineages must have originated during the Devonian. It seems that tetrapod evolution proceeded much faster, and the Devonian tetrapod record is much less complete, than has been thought. Analysis of a fossil trackway from the earliest Carboniferous of Australia shows prints of toes with claws, suggesting that the origin of amniotes was at least 35–40 million years earlier than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Evidence indicates that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist at the centres of most galaxies. Their mass correlates with the galactic bulge mass1, suggesting a coevolution with their host galaxies2, most likely through powerful winds3. X-ray observations have detected highly ionized winds outflowing at sub-relativistic speeds from the accretion disks around SMBHs4,5. However, the limited spectral resolution of present X-ray instruments has left the physical structure and location of the winds poorly understood, hindering accurate estimates of their kinetic power6,7. Here the first X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observation of the luminous quasar PDS 456 is reported. The high-resolution spectrometer Resolve aboard XRISM enabled the discovery of five discrete velocity components outflowing at 20–30% of the speed of light. This demonstrates that the wind structure is highly inhomogeneous, which probably consists of up to a million clumps. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be 60–300 solar masses per year, with the wind kinetic power exceeding the Eddington luminosity limit. Compared with the galaxy-scale outflows, the kinetic power is more than three orders of magnitude larger, whereas the momentum flux is ten times larger. These estimates disfavour both energy-driven and momentum-driven outflow models. This suggests that such wind activity occurs in less than 10% of the quasar phase and/or that its energy/momentum is not efficiently transferred to the galaxy-scale outflows owing to the clumpiness of the wind and the interstellar medium. Observations of a luminous quasar from the high-resolution spectrometer Resolve aboard XRISM revealed highly inhomogeneous wind structure outflowing from a supermassive black hole, which probably consists of up to a million clumps.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer and shows minimal response to therapies. The immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment in glioblastoma contributes to the limited therapeutic response. Astrocytes are abundant in the central nervous system and have important immunoregulatory roles. However, little is known about their role in the immune response to glioblastoma1. Here we used single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing of clinical glioblastoma samples and samples from preclinical models, multiplexed immunofluorescence, in vivo CRISPR-based cell-specific genetic perturbations and in vitro mouse and human experimental systems to address this gap in knowledge. We identified an astrocyte subset that limits tumour immunity by inducing T cell apoptosis through the death receptor ligand TRAIL. Moreover, we identified that IL-11 produced by tumour cells is a driver of STAT3-dependent TRAIL expression in astrocytes. Astrocyte signalling through STAT3 and TRAIL expression were associated with a shorter time to recurrence and overall decreased survival in patients with glioblastoma. Genetic inactivation of the IL-11 receptor or TRAIL in astrocytes extended survival in mouse models of glioblastoma and enhanced T cell and macrophage responses. Finally, treatment with an oncolytic HSV-1 virus engineered to express a TRAIL-blocking single-chain antibody in the tumour microenvironment extended survival and enhanced tumour-specific immunity in preclinical models of glioblastoma. In summary, we establish that IL-11–STAT3-driven astrocytes suppress glioblastoma-specific protective immunity by inducing TRAIL-dependent T cell apoptosis, and engineered therapeutic viruses can be used to target this mechanism of astrocyte-driven tumour immunoevasion. A population of TRAIL-positive astrocytes in glioblastoma contributes to an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment and this mechanism can be targeted with an engineered oncolytic virus to improve outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal editing comprises the structural reorganization of compounds. Such editing can be achieved through atom swapping, atom insertion, atom deletion or reorganization of the compound’s backbone structure1,2. Conducted at a late stage in drug development campaigns, skeletal editing enables diversification of an existing pharmacophore, enhancing the efficiency of drug development. Instead of constructing a heteroarene classically from basic building blocks, structural variants are readily accessible directly starting from a lead compound or approved pharmacophore. Here we present C to N atom swapping in indoles at the C2 position to give indazoles through oxidative cleavage of the indole heteroarene core and subsequent ring closure. Reactions proceed through ring-opened oximes as intermediates. These ring deconstructed intermediates can also be diverted into benzimidazoles resulting in an overall C to N atom swapping with concomitant skeletal reorganization. The same structural diverting strategies are equally well applicable to benzofurans leading to either benzisoxazoles or benzoxazoles. The compound classes obtained through these methods—indazoles3,4, benzisoxazoles5, benzimidazoles6,7 and benzoxazoles8—are biologically relevant moieties found as substructures in natural products and pharmaceuticals. The procedures introduced substantially enlarge the methods portfolio in the emerging field of skeletal editing. C to N atom swapping in indoles is introduced that gives indazoles through oxidative cleavage of the indole heteroarene core and subsequent ring closure, adding another method to the field of skeletal editing.",

    "abstract": "The decline in malaria deaths has recently stalled owing to several factors, including the widespread resistance of Anopheles vectors to the insecticides used in long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs)1,2. One way to mitigate insecticide resistance is to directly kill parasites during their mosquito-stage of development by incorporating antiparasitic compounds into LLINs. This strategy can prevent onward parasite transmission even when insecticides lose efficacy3,4. Here, we performed an in vivo screen of compounds against the mosquito stages of Plasmodium falciparum development. Of the 81 compounds tested, which spanned 28 distinct modes of action, 22 were active against early parasite stages in the mosquito midgut lumen, which in turn prevented establishment of infection. Medicinal chemistry was then used to improve antiparasitic activity of the top hits from the screen. We generated several endochin-like quinolones (ELQs) that inhibited the P. falciparum cytochrome bc1 complex (CytB). Two lead compounds that targeted separate sites in CytB (Qo and Qi) showed potent, long-lasting and stable activity when incorporated and/or extruded into bed net-like polyethylene films. ELQ activity was fully preserved in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and parasites resistant to these compounds had impaired development at the mosquito stage. These data demonstrate the promise of incorporating ELQ compounds into LLINs to counteract insecticide resistance and to reduce malaria transmission. An in vivo screen of small-molecule compounds to inhibit the mosquito-stage development of Plasmodium identified hits that can be incorporated into bed nets and led to effective parasite killing in the insect host.",

    "abstract": "Anyons1,2 are low-dimensional quasiparticles that obey fractional statistics, hence interpolating between bosons and fermions. In two dimensions, they exist as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall states3–5 and are believed to enable topological quantum computing6,7. One-dimensional anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here we observed emergent anyonic correlations in a one-dimensional strongly interacting quantum gas, resulting from the phenomenon of spin–charge separation8–10. A mobile impurity provides the necessary spin degree of freedom to engineer anyonic correlations in the charge sector and simultaneously acts as a probe to reveal these correlations. Starting with bosons, we tune the statistical phase to transmute bosons through anyons to fermions and observe an asymmetric momentum distribution11–14, a hallmark of anyonic correlations. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we observed dynamical fermionization of the anyons15. This study opens the door to the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting15–17. Emergent anyonic correlations via spin–charge separation are observed in a one-dimensional strongly interacting quantum gas, enabling the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting.",

    "abstract": "Many species use a temporary decrease in body temperature and metabolic rate (torpor) as a strategy to survive food scarcity in a cool environment. Torpor is caused by preoptic neurons that express a variety of peptides and receptors1–7, but no single genetic marker has been found for this population. Here we report that expression of the prostaglandin EP3 receptor (EP3R) marks a unique population of median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) neurons that are required for both torpor and lipopolysaccharide-induced fever8. The MnPO-EP3R neurons produce persistent fever responses when inhibited and prolonged hypothermic responses when activated either chemogenetically or optogenetically, even for brief periods of time. The mechanism for these prolonged responses appears to involve increases in intracellular levels of cAMP and calcium that may persist for many minutes up to hours beyond the termination of a stimulus. These properties endow the population of MnPO-EP3R neurons with the ability to act as a two-way switch for the hypothermic and hyperthermic responses that are required for survival. Neurons in the median preoptic nucleus that express the prostaglandin EP3 receptor produce prolonged hypothermic responses or hyperthermic responses, respectively, following brief activation or inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are thought to create subcellular microenvironments that have different physicochemical properties compared with their surrounding nucleoplasm or cytoplasm1–5. However, probing the microenvironments of condensates and their relationship to biological function is a major challenge because tools to selectively manipulate specific condensates in living cells are limited6–9. Here, we develop a non-natural micropeptide (that is, the killswitch) and a nanobody-based recruitment system as a universal approach to probe endogenous condensates, and demonstrate direct links between condensate microenvironments and function in cells. The killswitch is a hydrophobic, aromatic-rich sequence with the ability to self-associate, and has no homology to human proteins. When recruited to endogenous and disease-specific condensates in human cells, the killswitch immobilized condensate-forming proteins, leading to both predicted and unexpected effects. Targeting the killswitch to the nucleolar protein NPM1 altered nucleolar composition and reduced the mobility of a ribosomal protein in nucleoli. Targeting the killswitch to fusion oncoprotein condensates altered condensate compositions and inhibited the proliferation of condensate-driven leukaemia cells. In adenoviral nuclear condensates, the killswitch inhibited partitioning of capsid proteins into condensates and suppressed viral particle assembly. The results suggest that the microenvironment within cellular condensates has an essential contribution to non-stoichiometric enrichment and mobility of effector proteins. The killswitch is a widely applicable tool to alter the material properties of endogenous condensates and, as a consequence, to probe functions of condensates linked to diverse physiological and pathological processes. Targeting a non-natural micropeptide ‘killswitch’ to several biomolecular condensates altered condensate compositions and revealed condensate functions in human cells",

    "abstract": "Rivers and streams are an important pathway in the global carbon cycle, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from their water surfaces to the atmosphere1,2. Until now, CO2 and CH4 emitted from rivers were thought to be predominantly derived from recent (sub-decadal) biomass production and, thus, part of ecosystem respiration3–6. Here we combine new and published measurements to create a global database of the radiocarbon content of river dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2 and CH4. Isotopic mass balance of our database suggests that 59 ± 17% of global river CO2 emissions are derived from old carbon (millennial or older), the release of which is linked to river catchment lithology and biome. This previously unrecognized release of old, pre-industrial-aged carbon to the atmosphere from long-term soil, sediment and geologic carbon stores through lateral hydrological routing equates to 1.2 ± 0.3 Pg C year−1, similar in magnitude to terrestrial net ecosystem exchange. A consequence of this flux is a greater than expected net loss of carbon from aged organic matter stores on land. This requires a reassessment of the fate of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial systems and in global carbon cycle budgets and models. Using a global database of the radiocarbon content of rivers combining new and published measurements, isotopic mass balance suggests that about 60% of river CO2 emissions are derived from millennial or older carbon sources.",

    "abstract": "Microangiopathy is a major complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes to the acute and chronic complications of the disease1. Endotheliopathy and dysregulated blood coagulation are prominent in COVID-19 and are considered to be major causes of microvascular obstruction1,2. Here we demonstrate extensive endothelial cell (EC) death in the microvasculature of COVID-19 organs. Notably, EC death was not associated with fibrin formation or platelet deposition, but was linked to microvascular red blood cell (RBC) haemolysis. Importantly, this RBC microangiopathy was associated with ischaemia–reperfusion injury, and was prominent in the microvasculature of humans with myocardial infarction, gut ischaemia, stroke, and septic and cardiogenic shock. Mechanistically, ischaemia induced MLKL-dependent EC necroptosis and complement-dependent RBC haemolysis. Deposition of haemolysed RBC membranes at sites of EC death resulted in the development of a previously unrecognized haemostatic mechanism preventing microvascular bleeding. Exaggeration of this haemolytic response promoted RBC aggregation and microvascular obstruction. Genetic deletion of Mlkl from ECs decreased RBC haemolysis, microvascular obstruction and reduced ischaemic organ injury. Our studies demonstrate the existence of a RBC haemostatic mechanism induced by dying ECs, functioning independently of platelets and fibrin. Therapeutic targeting of this haemolytic process may reduce microvascular obstruction in COVID-19, and other major human diseases associated with organ ischaemia. A red blood cell haemostatic mechanism induced by dying ECs functions independently of platelets and fibrin.",

    "abstract": "The integrity of the plasma membrane is vital for nearly all aspects of cell functioning1. Mechanical forces can cause plasma membrane damage2, but it is unclear whether there are large molecules that regulate the integrity of the plasma membrane under mechanical strain. Here we constructed a 384-well cellular-stretch system that delivers precise, reproducible strain to cultured cells. Using the system, we screened 10,843 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting 2,726 multipass transmembrane proteins for strain-induced membrane permeability changes. The screen identified NINJ1—a protein that was recently proposed to regulate pyroptosis and other lytic cell death3,4—as the top hit. We demonstrate that NINJ1 is a critical regulator of mechanical-strain-induced plasma membrane rupture (PMR), without the need for stimulating any cell death programs. NINJ1 levels on the plasma membrane are inversely correlated with the amount of force required to rupture the membrane. In the pyroptosis context, NINJ1 on its own is not sufficient to fully rupture the membrane, and additional mechanical force is required for full PMR. Our study establishes that NINJ1 functions as a bona fide determinant of membrane biomechanical properties. Our study also suggests that PMR across tissues of distinct mechanical microenvironments is subjected to fine-tuning by differences in NINJ1 expression and external forces. The NINJ1 protein regulates plasma membrane rupture by altering membrane biomechanical properties, independent of cell death programs.",

    "abstract": "Preventing gender disparities in mathematics is a worldwide preoccupation1,2. In infancy and early childhood, boys and girls exhibit similar core knowledge of number and space3–8. Gender disparities in maths are, therefore, thought to primarily reflect an internalization of the sociocultural stereotype that ‘girls are bad at maths’. However, where, when and how widely this stereotype becomes entrenched remains uncertain. Here, we report the results of a 4-year longitudinal assessment of language and mathematical performance of all French first and second graders (2,653,082 children). Boys and girls exhibited very similar maths scores upon school entry, but a gender gap in favour of boys became highly significant after 4 months of schooling and reached an effect size of about 0.20 after 1 year. These findings were repeated each year and varied only slightly across family, class or school type and socio-economic level. Although schooling correlated with age, exploiting the near-orthogonal variations indicated that the gender gap increased with schooling rather than with age. These findings point to the first year of school as the time and place where a maths gender gap emerges in favour of boys, thus helping focus the search for solutions and interventions. Boys and girls exhibit very similar maths scores upon school entry, but a gender gap in favour of boys becomes highly significant after 4 months of schooling, which increases with years of schooling, independently of age.",

    "abstract": "The unpredictability of random numbers is fundamental to both digital security1,2 and applications that fairly distribute resources3,4. However, existing random number generators have limitations—the generation processes cannot be fully traced, audited and certified to be unpredictable. The algorithmic steps used in pseudorandom number generators5 are auditable, but they cannot guarantee that their outputs were a priori unpredictable given knowledge of the initial seed. Device-independent quantum random number generators6–9 can ensure that the source of randomness was unknown beforehand, but the steps used to extract the randomness are vulnerable to tampering. Here we demonstrate a fully traceable random number generation protocol based on device-independent techniques. Our protocol extracts randomness from unpredictable non-local quantum correlations, and uses distributed intertwined hash chains to cryptographically trace and verify the extraction process. This protocol forms the basis for a public traceable and certifiable quantum randomness beacon that we have launched10. Over the first 40 days of operation, we completed the protocol 7,434 out of 7,454 attempts—a success rate of 99.7%. Each time the protocol succeeded, the beacon emitted a pulse of 512 bits of traceable randomness. The bits are certified to be uniform with error multiplied by actual success probability bounded by 2−64. The generation of certifiable and traceable randomness represents a public service that operates with an entanglement-derived advantage over comparable classical approaches. A study demonstrates a public generator of random numbers based on device-independent techniques, with the randomness being fully auditable and traceable.",

    "abstract": "Climate change threatens global food systems1, but the extent to which adaptation will reduce losses remains unknown and controversial2. Even within the well-studied context of US agriculture, some analyses argue that adaptation will be widespread and climate damages small3,4, whereas others conclude that adaptation will be limited and losses severe5,6. Scenario-based analyses indicate that adaptation should have notable consequences on global agricultural productivity7–9, but there has been no systematic study of how extensively real-world producers actually adapt at the global scale. Here we empirically estimate the impact of global producer adaptations using longitudinal data on six staple crops spanning 12,658 regions, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories. We estimate that global production declines 5.5 × 1014 kcal annually per 1 °C global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise (120 kcal per person per day or 4.4% of recommended consumption per 1 °C; P < 0.001). We project that adaptation and income growth alleviate 23% of global losses in 2050 and 34% at the end of the century (6% and 12%, respectively; moderate-emissions scenario), but substantial residual losses remain for all staples except rice. In contrast to analyses of other outcomes that project the greatest damages to the global poor10,11, we find that global impacts are dominated by losses to modern-day breadbaskets with favourable climates and limited present adaptation, although losses in low-income regions losses are also substantial. These results indicate a scale of innovation, cropland expansion or further adaptation that might be necessary to ensure food security in a changing climate. Analysis of data on six stable crops, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories, allows estimation of agricultural impacts and the potential of global producer adaptations to reduce output losses owing to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a polygenic disorder occurring after extreme trauma exposure. Recent studies have begun to detail the molecular biology of PTSD. However, given the array of PTSD-perturbed molecular pathways identified so far1, it is implausible that a single cell type is responsible. Here we profile the molecular responses in over two million nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 111 human brains, collected post-mortem from individuals with and without PTSD and major depressive disorder. We identify neuronal and non-neuronal cell-type clusters, gene expression changes and transcriptional regulators, and map the epigenomic regulome of PTSD in a cell-type-specific manner. Our analysis revealed PTSD-associated gene alterations in inhibitory neurons, endothelial cells and microglia and uncovered genes and pathways associated with glucocorticoid signalling, GABAergic transmission and neuroinflammation. We further validated these findings using cell-type-specific spatial transcriptomics, confirming disruption of key genes such as SST and FKBP5. By integrating genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data, we uncovered the regulatory mechanisms of credible variants that disrupt PTSD genes, including ELFN1, MAD1L1 and KCNIP4, in a cell-type-specific context. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive characterization of the cell-specific molecular regulatory mechanisms that underlie the persisting effects of traumatic stress response on the human prefrontal cortex. A comprehensive analysis of the cell-specific molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying post-traumatic stress disorder in the human prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "The pursuit of strong yet ductile alloys has been ongoing for centuries. However, for all alloys developed thus far, including recent high-entropy alloys, those possessing good tensile ductility rarely approach 2-GPa yield strength at room temperature. The few that do are mostly ultra-strong steels1–3; however, their stress–strain curves exhibit plateaus and serrations because their tensile flow suffers from plastic instability (such as Lüders strains)1–4, and the elongation is pseudo-uniform at best. Here we report that a group of carefully engineered multi-principal-element alloys, with a composition of Fe35Ni29Co21Al12Ta3 designed by means of domain knowledge-informed machine learning, can be processed to reach an unprecedented range of simultaneously high strength and ductility. An example of this synergy delivers 1.8-GPa yield strength combined with 25% truly uniform elongation. We achieved strengthening by pushing microstructural heterogeneities to the extreme through unusually large volume fractions of not only coherent L12 nanoprecipitates but also incoherent B2 microparticles. The latter, being multicomponent with a reduced chemical ordering energy, is a deformable phase that accumulates dislocations inside to help sustain a high strain hardening rate that prolongs uniform elongation. A new group of multi-principal-element alloys, designed through machine learning and extreme microstructural heterogeneities, achieve high strength (1.8-GPa yield strength) and ductility (25% uniform elongation) at room temperature.",

    "abstract": "All-solid-state batteries require advanced cathode designs to realize their potential for high energy density and economic viability1–3. Integrated all-in-one cathodes, which eliminate inactive conductive additives and heterogeneous interfaces, hold promise for substantial energy and stability gains but are hindered by materials lacking sufficient Li+/e− conductivity, mechanical robustness and structural stability4–14. Here we present Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4, a cost-effective halide material that overcomes these challenges. Leveraging reversible Fe2+/Fe3+ redox and rapid Li+/e− transport within its framework, Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 achieves an electrode energy density of 529.3 Wh kg−1 versus Li+/Li. Critically, Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 shows unique dynamic properties during cycling, including reversible local Fe migration and a brittle-to-ductile transition that confers self-healing behaviour. This enables exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 90% capacity retention for 3,000 cycles at a rate of 5 C. Integration of Li1.3Fe1.2Cl4 with a nickel-rich layered oxide further increases the energy density to 725.6 Wh kg−1. By harnessing the advantageous dynamic mechanical and diffusion properties of all-in-one halides, this work establishes all-in-one halides as an avenue for energy-dense, durable cathodes in next-generation all-solid-state batteries. A cost-effective all-in-one halide cathode material with high energy density and exceptional cycling stability can be used to achieve energy-dense, durable cathodes for the next generation of all-solid-state batteries.",

    "abstract": "The broad bandgap tunability of both perovskites and organic semiconductors enables the development of perovskite–organic tandem solar cells with promising theoretical efficiency. However, the certified efficiencies of reported perovskite–organic tandem solar cells remain lower than those of single-junction perovskite solar cells, primarily because of insufficient near-infrared photocurrent in narrow-bandgap organic subcells1–3. Here we design and synthesize an asymmetric non-fullerene acceptor (NFA), P2EH-1V, featuring a unilateral conjugated π-bridge to reduce the optical bandgap to 1.27 eV while maintaining ideal exciton dissociation and nanomorphology. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms efficient hole transfer from P2EH-1V to the donor PM6. Devices based on P2EH-1V exhibit reduced non-radiative voltage losses of 0.20 eV without compromising charge-generation efficiency. We achieve a 17.9% efficiency for the organic bottom cell, with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 28.60 mA cm−2. Furthermore, we minimize interface recombination losses, enabling the perovskite top cell to achieve an impressive open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.37 V and a fill factor (FF) of 85.5%. These advancements result in perovskite–organic tandem solar cells achieving a record efficiency of 26.7% (certified at 26.4%) over an aperture area greater than 1 cm2. A new asymmetric non-fullerene acceptor, P2EH-1V, is designed and synthesized for constructing devices demonstrating record-high efficiencies of 26.7% (certified at 26.4%) over an aperture area greater than 1 cm2 in perovskite–organic tandem solar cells.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how animals and humans learn from experience to make adaptive decisions is a fundamental goal of neuroscience and psychology. Normative modelling frameworks such as Bayesian inference1 and reinforcement learning2 provide valuable insights into the principles governing adaptive behaviour. However, the simplicity of these frameworks often limits their ability to capture realistic biological behaviour, leading to cycles of handcrafted adjustments that are prone to researcher subjectivity. Here we present a novel modelling approach that leverages recurrent neural networks to discover the cognitive algorithms governing biological decision-making. We show that neural networks with just one to four units often outperform classical cognitive models and match larger neural networks in predicting the choices of individual animals and humans, across six well-studied reward-learning tasks. Critically, we can interpret the trained networks using dynamical systems concepts, enabling a unified comparison of cognitive models and revealing detailed mechanisms underlying choice behaviour. Our approach also estimates the dimensionality of behaviour3 and offers insights into algorithms learned by meta-reinforcement learning artificial intelligence agents. Overall, we present a systematic approach for discovering interpretable cognitive strategies in decision-making, offering insights into neural mechanisms and a foundation for studying healthy and dysfunctional cognition. Modelling biological decision-making with tiny recurrent neural networks enables more accurate predictions of animal choices than classical cognitive models and offers insights into the underlying cognitive strategies and neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Establishing a unified theory of cognition has been an important goal in psychology1,2. A first step towards such a theory is to create a computational model that can predict human behaviour in a wide range of settings. Here we introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behaviour in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art language model on a large-scale dataset called Psych-101. Psych-101 has an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from more than 60,000 participants performing in excess of 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behaviour of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but it also generalizes to previously unseen cover stories, structural task modifications and entirely new domains. Furthermore, the model’s internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after fine-tuning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discover computational models that capture human behaviour across a wide range of domains. We believe that such models provide tremendous potential for guiding the development of cognitive theories, and we present a case study to demonstrate this. A computational model called Centaur, developed by fine-tuning a language model on a huge dataset called Psych-101, can predict and simulate human nature in experiments expressible in natural language, even in previously unseen situations.",

    "abstract": "Plastic pollution of the marine realm is widespread, with most scientific attention given to macroplastics and microplastics1,2. By contrast, ocean nanoplastics (<1 μm) remain largely unquantified, leaving gaps in our understanding of the mass budget of this plastic size class3–5. Here we measure nanoplastic concentrations on an ocean-basin scale along a transect crossing the North Atlantic from the subtropical gyre to the northern European shelf. We find approximately 1.5–32.0 mg m−3 of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanoplastics throughout the entire water column. On average, we observe a 1.4-fold higher concentration of nanoplastics in the mixed layer when compared with intermediate water depth, with highest mixed-layer nanoplastic concentrations near the European continent. Nanoplastic concentrations at intermediate water depth are 1.8-fold higher in the subtropical gyre compared with the open North Atlantic outside the gyre. The lowest nanoplastic concentrations, with about 5.5 mg m−3 on average and predominantly composed of PET, are present in bottom waters. For the mixed layer of the temperate to subtropical North Atlantic, we estimate that the mass of nanoplastic may amount to 27 million tonnes (Mt). This is in the same range or exceeding previous budget estimates of macroplastics/microplastics for the entire Atlantic6,7 or the global ocean1,8. Our findings suggest that nanoplastics comprise the dominant fraction of marine plastic pollution. Observations from 12 hydrocast stations along a transect crossing the North Atlantic from the subtropical gyre to the northern European shelf provide evidence of large amounts of nanoplastics throughout the entire water column.",

    "abstract": "Human history is born in writing. Inscriptions are among the earliest written forms, and offer direct insights into the thought, language and history of ancient civilizations. Historians capture these insights by identifying parallels—inscriptions with shared phrasing, function or cultural setting—to enable the contextualization of texts within broader historical frameworks, and perform key tasks such as restoration and geographical or chronological attribution1. However, current digital methods are restricted to literal matches and narrow historical scopes. Here we introduce Aeneas, a generative neural network for contextualizing ancient texts. Aeneas retrieves textual and contextual parallels, leverages visual inputs, handles arbitrary-length text restoration, and advances the state of the art in key tasks. To evaluate its impact, we conduct a large study with historians using outputs from Aeneas as research starting points. The historians find the parallels retrieved by Aeneas to be useful research starting points in 90% of cases, improving their confidence in key tasks by 44%. Restoration and geographical attribution tasks yielded superior results when historians were paired with Aeneas, outperforming both humans and artificial intelligence alone. For dating, Aeneas achieved a 13-year distance from ground-truth ranges. We demonstrate Aeneas’ contribution to historical workflows through analysis of key traits in the renowned Roman inscription Res Gestae Divi Augusti, showing how integrating science and humanities can create transformative tools to assist historians and advance our understanding of the past. Aeneas, a generative neural network trained on ancient texts, helps historians contextualize inscriptions and perform epigraphic tasks, offering an improved starting point for historical research.",

Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) and SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposition activities mediate the transduction8,9 of unique sequence stretches in 5′ or 3′, depending on source mobile element class and locus. SV breakpoint analyses point to a spectrum of homology-mediated processes contributing to SV formation and recurrent deletion events. Our open-access resource underscores the value of long-read sequencing in advancing SV characterization and enables guiding variant prioritization in patient genomes. Intermediate-coverage long-read sequencing in 1,019 diverse humans from the 1000 Genomes Project, representing 26 populations, enables the generation of comprehensive population-scale structural variant catalogues comprising common and rare alleles.",

    "abstract": "How new structures emerge during evolution has long fascinated biologists. An example is how the diminutive bones of the mammalian middle ear arose from ancestral fish jawbones1. By contrast, the evolutionary origin of the outer ear, another mammalian innovation, remains a mystery, partly because it is supported by non-mineralized elastic cartilage, which is rarely recovered in fossils. Whether the outer ear arose de novo or through the reuse of ancestral developmental programs has remained unknown. Here we show that the outer ear shares gene regulatory programs with the gills of fishes and amphibians for both its initial outgrowth and the later development of the elastic cartilage. Comparative single-nucleus multiomics of the human outer ear and zebrafish gills reveals conserved gene expression and putative enhancers enriched for common transcription factor binding motifs. This is reflected by the transgenic activity of human outer-ear enhancers in gills, and of fish gill enhancers in the outer ear. Furthermore, single-cell multiomics of the cartilaginous book gills of horseshoe crabs reveals a developmental program shared with the distal-less homeobox (DLX)-mediated gill program of vertebrates, with a book-gill distal-less enhancer driving expression in zebrafish gills. We propose that elements of an invertebrate gill program were reutilized in vertebrates to generate first gills and then the outer ear. A study on the evolutionary origin of the mammalian outer ear finds that it shares genetic programs with the gills of fishes and amphibians, indicating that elements of an ancestral gill have been reused.",

    "abstract": "The zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) interferes with memory maintenance and long-term potentiation (LTP)1 when administered to mice. However, mice lacking its putative target, protein kinase PKMζ, exhibit normal learning and memory as well as LTP2,3, making the mechanism of ZIP unclear. Here we show that ZIP disrupts LTP by removing surface AMPA receptors through its cationic charge alone. This effect requires endophilin-A2-mediated endocytosis and is fully blocked by drugs suppressing macropinocytosis. ZIP and other cationic peptides remove newly inserted AMPA receptor nanoclusters at potentiated synapses, providing a mechanism by which these peptides erase memories without altering basal synaptic function. When delivered in vivo, cationic peptides can modulate memories on local and brain-wide scales, and these mechanisms can be leveraged to prevent memory loss in a model of traumatic brain injury. Our findings uncover a previously unknown synaptic mechanism by which memories are maintained or lost. Elucidation of the mechanism by which zeta inhibitory peptide erases memories, involving endocytosis of AMPA receptors on potentiated synapses, provides insight into more general mechanisms of memory maintenance and response to traumatic brain injury.",

    "abstract": "Graphene is a single-layered sp2-hybridized carbon allotrope, which is impermeable to all atomic entities other than hydrogen1,2. The introduction of defects allows selective gas permeation3–5; efforts have been made to control the size of these defects for higher selectivity6–9. Permeation of entities other than gases, such as ions10,11, is of fundamental scientific interest because of its potential application in desalination, detection and purification12–16. However, a precise experimental observation of halide permeation has so far remained unknown11,15–18. Here we show halide permeation through a single benzene-sized defect in a molecular nanographene. Using supramolecular principles of self-aggregation, we created a stable bilayer of the nanographene19–23. As the cavity in the bilayer nanographene could be accessed only by two angstrom-sized windows, any halide that gets trapped inside the cavity has to permeate through the single benzene hole. Our experiments reveal the permeability of fluoride, chloride and bromide through a single benzene hole, whereas iodide is impermeable. Evidence for high permeation of chloride across single-layer nanographene and selective halide binding in a bilayer nanographene provides promise for the use of single benzene defects in graphene for artificial halide receptors24,25, as filtration membranes26 and further to create multilayer artificial chloride channels. Halide permeation through a single benzene-sized defect in a molecular nanographene shows the permeability of fluoride, chloride and bromide, whereas iodide is impermeable.",

    "abstract": "During motor learning, breaks in practice are known to facilitate behavioural optimizations. Although this process has traditionally been studied over long breaks that last hours to days1–6, recent studies in humans have demonstrated that rapid performance gains during early motor sequence learning are most pronounced after very brief breaks lasting seconds to minutes7–10. However, the precise causal neural mechanisms that facilitate performance gains after brief breaks remain poorly understood. Here we recorded neural ensemble activity in the motor cortex of macaques while they performed a visuomotor sequence learning task interspersed with brief breaks. We found that task-related neural cofiring patterns were reactivated during brief breaks. The rate and content of reactivations predicted the magnitude and pattern of subsequent performance gains. Of note, we found that performance gains and reactivations were positively correlated with cortical ripples (80–120 Hz oscillations) but anti-correlated with β bursts (13–30 Hz oscillations), which ultimately dominated breaks after the fast learning phase plateaued. We then applied 20 Hz epidural alternating current stimulation (ACS) to motor cortex, which reduced reactivation rates in a phase-specific and dose-dependent manner. Notably, 20 Hz ACS also eliminated performance gains. Overall, our results indicate that the reactivations of task ensembles during brief breaks are causal drivers of subsequent performance gains. β bursts compete with this process, possibly to support stable performance. In macaques, motor cortex activity associated with motor learning tasks is reactivated during brief breaks between learning blocks and predicts subsequent performance gains.",

    "abstract": "The Casarabe culture (500–1400 ce), spreading over roughly 4,500 km2 of the monumental mounds region of the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia, is one of the clearest examples of urbanism in pre-Columbian (pre-1492 ce) Amazonia. It exhibits a four-tier hierarchical settlement pattern, with hundreds of monumental mounds interconnected by canals and causeways1,2. Despite archaeological evidence indicating that maize was cultivated by this society3, it is unknown whether it was the staple crop and which type of agricultural farming system was used to support this urban-scale society. Here, we address this issue by integration of remote sensing, field survey and microbotanical analyses, which shows that the Casarabe culture invested heavily in landscape engineering, constructing a complex system of drainage canals (to drain excess water during the rainy season) and newly documented savannah farm ponds (to retain water in the dry season). Phytolith analyses of 178 samples from 18 soil profiles in drained fields, farm ponds and forested settings record the singular and ubiquitous presence of maize (Zea mays) in pre-Columbian fields and farm ponds, and an absence of evidence for agricultural practices in the forest. Collectively, our findings show how the Casarabe culture managed the savannah landscape for intensive year-round maize monoculture that probably sustained its relatively large population. Our results have implications for how we conceive agricultural systems in Amazonia, and show an example of a Neolithic-like, grain-based agrarian economy in the Amazon. Remote sensing, field survey and microbotanical analyses show that the pre-Columbian Casarabe culture in the Bolivian Amazon invested heavily in landscape engineering, constructing a complex system of drainage canals and newly documented savannah farm ponds.",

    "abstract": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) show potential to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in humans1. However, there are limited data on the antibody concentrations required to prevent infection. Clinical trials of bNAb prophylaxis have demonstrated partial efficacy2, but the sampling frequency typically does not allow precise timing of infection events and concurrent antibody levels. Here, using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, we show that although potent bNAbs can delay the onset of acute viremia, subclinical infections occur while bNAb levels remain high. Serial SIV challenge of monkeys given partially and fully neutralizing bNAbs revealed that ‘viral blips’—low and transient plasma viremia—often occur while serum bNAb concentrations are well above currently accepted protective levels. To understand the precise timing of the infections resulting in such blips, we performed plasma viral sequencing on monkeys that were serially challenged with genetically barcoded SIV after bNAb administration. These analyses showed that subclinical infections occurred in most animals that were given potent bNAb prophylaxis. These subclinical infections occurred while antibody concentrations were 2- to 400-fold higher than the levels required to prevent fully viremic breakthrough infection. This study demonstrates that immunoprophylaxis can mask subclinical infections, which may affect the interpretation of prophylactic HIV-1 bNAb clinical trials. Viral sequencing reveals subclinical infections in animals challenged with simian immunodeficiency virus even in the presence of potent neutralizing antibodies, with implications for clinical trials of antiviral agents against human immunodeficiency virus.",

    "abstract": "Hexameric helicases are nucleotide-driven molecular machines that unwind DNA to initiate replication across all domains of life. Despite decades of intensive study, several critical aspects of their function remain unresolved1: the site and mechanism of DNA strand separation, the mechanics of unwinding propagation, and the dynamic relationship between nucleotide hydrolysis and DNA movement. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that the simian virus 40 large tumour antigen (LTag) helicase assembles in the form of head-to-head hexamers at replication origins, melting DNA at two symmetrically positioned sites to establish bidirectional replication forks. Through continuous heterogeneity analysis2, we characterize the conformational landscape of LTag on forked DNA under catalytic conditions, demonstrating coordinated motions that drive DNA translocation and unwinding. We show that the helicase pulls the tracking strand through DNA-binding loops lining the central channel, while directing the non-tracking strand out of the rear, in a cyclic process. ATP hydrolysis functions as an ‘entropy switch’, removing blocks to translocation rather than directly powering DNA movement. Our structures show the allosteric couplings between nucleotide turnover and subunit motions that enable DNA unwinding while maintaining dedicated exit paths for the separated strands. These findings provide a comprehensive model for replication fork establishment and progression that extends from viral to eukaryotic systems. More broadly, they introduce fundamental principles of the mechanism by which ATP-dependent enzymes achieve efficient mechanical work through entropy-driven allostery. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of DNA helicases in various conformations provide insight into an ATP-hydrolysis-dependent ‘entropy switch’ that drives unwinding of DNA for replication, with probable conservation across viral and eukaryotic systems.",

    "abstract": "Mutation of some genes drives uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer. The Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) provided the very first such genetic link to cancer1,2. However, little is known about the trajectory to CML, the rate of BCR::ABL1 clonal expansion and how this affects disease. Using whole-genome sequencing of 1,013 haematopoietic colonies from nine patients with CML aged 22 to 81 years, we reconstruct phylogenetic trees of haematopoiesis. Intronic breaks in BCR and ABL1 were not always observed, and out-of-frame exonic breakpoints in BCR, requiring exon skipping to derive BCR::ABL1, were also noted. Apart from ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations, extra myeloid gene mutations were mostly present in wild-type cells. We inferred explosive growth attributed to BCR::ABL1 commencing 3–14 years (confidence interval 2–16 years) before diagnosis, with annual growth rates exceeding 70,000% per year. Mutation accumulation was higher in BCR::ABL1 cells with shorter telomere lengths, reflecting their excessive cell divisions. Clonal expansion rates inversely correlated with the time to diagnosis. BCR::ABL1 in the general population mirrored CML incidence, and advanced and/or blast phase CML was characterized by subsequent genomic evolution. These data highlight the oncogenic potency of BCR::ABL1 fusion and contrast with the slow and sequential clonal trajectories of most cancers. Explosive growth is attributed to the BCR::ABL1 gene 3–14 years before diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukaemia, highlighting the oncogenic potency of gene fusion and the slow and sequential trajectories of most other cancers.",

    "abstract": "Materials with a high electrocaloric effect (ECE)1,2 tend to favour a disordered yet easily tunable polar structure. Perovskite ferroelectrics3 stand out as ideal candidates owing to their high dielectric responses and reasonable thermal conductivity. The introduction of multielement atomic distortions induces a high-polar-entropy state4 that notably increases the ECE by effectively overcoming the constraints imposed by highly ordered, polar-correlated perovskite structures. Here we developed a lead-free relaxor ferroelectric with strong polar disorder through targeted multielement substitution at both the A and B sites of the perovskite, effectively distorting the lattice structure and inducing a variety of nanoscale polar configurations, polymorphic polar variants and non-polar regions. A combination of these multielement-induced features led to an increased density of interfaces, significantly enhancing the polar entropy. Remarkably, a high ECE for an entropy change of about 15 J kg−1 K−1 under a 10 MV m−1 field is observed for the material across a broad temperature range exceeding 60 °C. The formation of ultrafine, dispersed, multiphase lattice configurations leads to high-polar-entropy ferroelectric oxides with a high ECE and a long lifetime of over 1 million cycles that are suitable for manufacturing multilayer ceramic capacitors for practical electrocaloric refrigeration applications. Targeted multielement substitution of a lead-free relaxor ferroelectric perovskite distorts the lattice structure and induces strong polar disorder, leading to high-polar-entropy ferroelectric oxides with a high electrocaloric effect and long lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Radio-frequency (RF) accelerators providing high-quality relativistic electron beams are an important resource enabling many areas of science, as well as industrial and medical applications. Two decades ago, laser-plasma accelerators1 that support orders of magnitude higher electric fields than those provided by modern RF cavities produced quasi-monoenergetic electron beams for the first time2–4. Since then, high-brightness electron beams at gigaelectronvolt (GeV) beam energy and competitive beam properties have been demonstrated from only centimetre-long plasmas5–9, a substantial advantage over the hundreds of metres required by RF-cavity-based accelerators. However, despite the considerable progress, the comparably large energy spread and the fluctuation (jitter) in beam energy still effectively prevent laser-plasma accelerators from driving real-world applications. Here we report the generation of a laser-plasma electron beam using active energy compression, resulting in a performance so far only associated with modern RF-based accelerators. Using a magnetic chicane, the electron bunch is first stretched longitudinally to imprint an energy correlation, which is then removed with an active RF cavity. The resulting energy spread and energy jitter are reduced by more than an order of magnitude to below the permille level, meeting the acceptance criteria of a modern synchrotron, thereby opening the path to a compact storage ring injector and other applications. A laser-plasma electron beam generated using active energy compression demonstrates reduction in energy spread and jitter by an order of magnitude to below the permille level, comparable with modern radio-frequency accelerators.",

Here we present CRISPR-mediated transcriptome organization (CRISPR-TO), a system that harnesses RNA-guided, nuclease-dead dCas13 for programmable control of endogenous RNA localization in live cells. CRISPR-TO enables targeted localization of endogenous RNAs to diverse subcellular compartments, including the outer mitochondrial membrane, p-bodies, stress granules, telomeres and nuclear stress bodies, across various cell types. It allows for inducible and reversible bidirectional RNA transport along microtubules via motor proteins, facilitating real-time manipulation and monitoring of RNA localization dynamics in living cells. In primary cortical neurons, we demonstrate that repositioned mRNAs undergo local translation along neurites and at neurite tips, and co-transport with ribosomes, with β-actin mRNA localization enhancing the formation of dynamic filopodial protrusions and inhibiting axonal regeneration. CRISPR-TO-enabled screening in primary neurons identifies Stmn2 mRNA localization as a driver of neurite outgrowth. By enabling large-scale perturbation of the spatial transcriptome, CRISPR-TO bridges a critical gap left by sequencing and imaging technologies, offering a versatile platform for high-throughput functional interrogation of RNA localization in living cells and organisms. CRISPR-TO, a system for programmable control of spatial localization of cellular RNAs, is presented and enables functional investigation of endogenous RNA localization in diverse living cells.",

    "abstract": "The earliest record of tooth antecedents and the tissue dentine1,2, an early-vertebrate novelty, has been controversially represented by fragmentary Cambrian fossils identified as Anatolepis heintzi3–5. Anatolepis exoskeletons have the characteristic tubules of dentine that prompted their interpretation as the first precursors of teeth3, known as odontodes. Debates over whether Anatolepis is a legitimate vertebrate6–8 have arisen because of limitations in imaging and the lack of comparative exoskeletal tissues. Here, to resolve this controversy and understand the origin of dental tissues, we synchrotron-scanned diverse extinct and extant vertebrate and invertebrate exoskeletons. We find that the tubules of Anatolepis have been misidentified as dentine tubules and instead represent aglaspidid arthropod sensory sensilla structures9,10. Synchrotron scanning reveals that deep ultrastructural similarities between odontodes and sensory structures also extend to definitive vertebrate tissues. External odontodes of the Ordovician vertebrate Eriptychius11–13 feature large dentine tubules1 that are morphologically convergent with invertebrate sensilla. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that the external odontodes of extant chondrichthyans and teleosts retain extensive innervation suggestive of a sensory function akin to teeth14–16. These patterns of convergence and innervation reveal that dentine evolved as a sensory tissue in the exoskeleton of early vertebrates, a function retained in modern vertebrate teeth16. Middle-Ordovician fossils now represent the oldest known evidence for vertebrate dental tissues. Re-examination of the presumed Cambrian fossil fish Anatolepis reveals previous misidentification of aglaspidid sensory structures as dentine, a vertebrate sensory tissue, showing it to be an arthropod, and shifting the origin of vertebrate hard tissues to the Middle Ordovician.",

    "abstract": "The shale gas revolution has shifted propylene production from naphtha cracking to on-purpose production with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as the dominant technology1–9. Because PDH is endothermic and requires high temperatures that favour sintering and coking, the challenge is to develop active and stable catalysts1–3 that are sufficiently stable10,11. Zeolite-supported Pt–Sn catalysts have been developed to balance activity, selectivity and stability12,13 and more recent work documented a PDH catalyst based on zeolite-anchored single rhodium atoms with exceptional performance and stability14. Here we show for silicalite-1 (S-1) that migration of encapsulated Pt–Sn2 clusters and hence agglomeration and anchoring within the zeolite versus agglomeration on the external surface can be controlled by adjusting the length of the S-1 crystals’ b-axis. We find that, when this axis is longer than 2.00 μm, migration of Pt–Sn2 monomers during PDH results in intracrystalline formation of (Pt–Sn2)2 dimers that are securely locked in the channels of S-1 and capable of converting pure propane feed to propylene at 550 °C for more than 6 months with 98.3% selectivity at 91% equilibrium conversion. This performance exceeds that of other Pt-based PDH catalysts and approaches that of the Rh-based catalyst. Although synthesis requirements and cost are at present prohibitive for industrial use, we anticipate that our approach to controlling the migration and lockup of metals in zeolites may enable the development of other noble-metal catalysts that offer extended service lifetimes in industrial applications15–17. Tuning the b-axis length of silicalite-1 crystals allows control over the migration–agglomeration–lockup of active metal species in zeolites, which enables the creation of stable and durable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by fungal pathogens, poses serious threats to public health, wildlife and ecosystem stability1. Host–fungus interactions and environmental factors have been extensively examined2–4. However, the role of genetic variability in pathogens is often less well-studied, even for diseases such as white-nose in bats, which has caused one of the highest disease-driven death tolls documented in nonhuman mammals5. Previous research on white-nose disease has primarily focused on variations in disease outcomes attributed to host traits or environmental conditions6–8, but has neglected pathogen variability. Here we leverage an extensive reference collection of 5,479 fungal isolates from 27 countries to reveal that the widespread causative agent is not a single species but two sympatric cryptic species, each exhibiting host specialization. Our findings provide evidence of recombination in each species, but significant genetic differentiation across their genomes, including differences in genome organization. Both species contain geographically differentiated populations, which enabled us to identify the species introduced to North America and trace its source population to a region in Ukraine. In light of our discovery of the existence of two cryptic species of the causative agent of white-nose disease, our research underscores the need to integrate the study of pathogen variability into comprehensive disease surveillance, management and prevention strategies. This holistic approach is crucial for enhancing our understanding of diseases and implementing effective measures to prevent their spread. The identification of two cryptic species of the fungal pathogen that causes white-nose disease in bats highlights the need to integrate studies of genetic variability in pathogens into disease surveillance, management and prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Allergens that induce allergic airway inflammation are highly diverse, but they commonly activate type 2 immune responses1,2. Airway epithelial cells are crucial in allergen sensing3–5. However, the shared features among diverse allergens that elicit similar innate responses, and their epithelial detection mechanisms, remain poorly defined1,2,6–9. Here we identify pore-forming proteins as one of the common stimuli of allergic airway inflammation and reveal their immune-activation mechanisms. Using the prevalent mould allergen Alternaria alternata as a model, we established an in vitro system to investigate type 2 innate immune sensing. A six-step biochemical fractionation identified Aeg-S and Aeg-L as the core immune-stimulatory components. Biochemical reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that these proteins form 16- to 20-mer transmembrane pore complexes. Their cooperative perforation acts as a bona fide type 2 immune adjuvant to support antigen-specific T helper 2 and immunoglobulin E responses. Genetically engineered A. alternata strains that lack pore-forming activity do not induce allergic responses in mice. Furthermore, pore-forming proteins from various species, despite structural and membrane target differences, are sufficient to trigger respiratory allergies. Perforations in airway epithelial cells initiate allergic responses through two mechanisms: one triggers IL-33 release, and the other involves Ca2+ influx, which activates MAPK signalling and type 2 inflammatory gene expression. These findings provide insight into how type 2 immune responses detect common perturbations caused by structurally diverse stimuli. Targeting downstream signalling of epithelial perforation may open new avenues for treating respiratory allergies. The ability to form pores in the plasma membrane of host airway epithelial cells is a common feature of many structurally diverse allergens that induce type 2 immune responses by stimulating IL-33 release and causing Ca2+ influx.",

    "abstract": "Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are theoretically contested1–4 and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude5,6. Here we present a method to directly access this quantity by precisely measuring the energy width of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the radioactive decay of beryllium-7. The final state in the decay process contains a recoiling lithium-7 nucleus, which is entangled with an electron neutrino at creation. The lithium-7 energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding beryllium-7 radioisotopes into a high-resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. Under this approach, we set a lower limit on the Heisenberg spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter of 6.2 pm, which implies that the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first, to our knowledge, direct lower limit on the spatial extent of a neutrino wavepacket is extracted. These results may have implications in several areas including the theoretical understanding of neutrino properties, the nature of localization in weak nuclear decays and the interpretation of neutrino physics data. An innovative method using superconducting sensors precisely measures the recoil energy of lithium-7 nuclei, setting a lower limit on the spatial extent of neutrino wavepackets, advancing understanding of neutrino properties and weak nuclear decays.",

    "abstract": "The cratonic crust contains abundant mineral deposits of metals such as gold, copper and rare earths1–5 and is underlain by a thick mantle lithosphere rich in the volatiles carbon, sulfur and water6–8. Although volatiles are known to be key components in metallogenesis9, how and where they are distributed in the cratonic lithosphere mantle and their role in the initial enrichment of metals have not been sufficiently explored. Here we compile sulfur and copper contents of global cratonic peridotites, identifying sulfide-rich and copper-rich continental roots at depths of 160–190 km at cratonic margins. Our new high-pressure experiments show that carbonated silicate melts originating from the asthenosphere lose silicate components during reaction with lithospheric peridotite, evolving to carbonatite melts that become concentrated at cratonic margins. Sulfur solubility in melts substantially decreases as the SiO2 content of melts decreases during this process, forcing sulfide precipitation and the formation of sulfide-rich continental roots at the base of the mantle lithosphere. The migration of carbonated melts towards cratonic margins replenishes the continental roots there with sulfur, explaining the co-location of magmatic metal deposits with carbonatites close to cratonic margins. These findings highlight the notable role of carbonated melts in metallogenesis and provide a potential platform for metal ore exploration. Examination of the sulfur and copper contents of global cratonic peridotites combined with new high-pressure experiments shows that the migration of carbonated melts towards cratonic margins explains the co-location of magmatic metal deposits with carbonatites.",

    "abstract": "Foraminifera are ubiquitous marine protists that intracellularly accumulate phosphate1, an important macronutrient in marine ecosystems and in fertilizer potentially leaked into the ocean. Intracellular phosphate concentrations can be 100–1,000 times higher than in the surrounding water1. Here we show that phosphate storage in foraminifera is widespread, from tidal flats to the deep sea. The total amount of intracellular phosphate stored in the benthic foraminifer Ammonia confertitesta in the Wadden Sea during a bloom is as high as around 5% of the annual consumption of phosphorus (P) fertilizer in Germany. Budget calculations for the Southern North Sea and the Peruvian Oxygen Minimum Zone indicate that benthic foraminifera may buffer riverine P runoff for approximately 37 days at the Southern North Sea and for about 21 days at the Peruvian margin. This indicates that these organisms are probably relevant for marine P cycling—they potentially buffer anthropogenic eutrophication in coastal environments. Phosphate is stored as polyphosphate in cell organelles that are potentially acidocalcisomes. Their metabolic functions can range from regulation of osmotic pressure and intracellular pH to calcium and energy storage. In addition, storage of energetic P compounds, such as creatine phosphate and polyphosphate, is probably an adaptation of foraminifera to O2 depletion. Phosphate storage in foraminifera is found to be widespread, indicating that these organisms are probably relevant for marine phosphorus cycling and potentially buffer anthropogenic eutrophication in coastal environments.",

Turnover rates differ markedly among communities4, but the drivers of this variation across taxa and realms remain unknown. Here we analyse 42,255 time series of species composition from marine, terrestrial and freshwater assemblages, and show that temporal rates of turnover were consistently faster in locations that experienced faster temperature change, including both warming and cooling. In addition, assemblages with limited access to microclimate refugia or that faced stronger human impacts on land were especially responsive to temperature change, with up to 48% of species replaced per decade. These results reveal a widespread signal of vulnerability to continuing climate change and highlight which ecological communities are most sensitive, raising concerns about ecosystem integrity as climate change and other human impacts accelerate. Global-scale analyses of marine, terrestrial and freshwater assemblages found that temporal rates of species replacement were faster in locations with faster temperature change, including warming and cooling, and vulnerable assemblages were especially responsive.",

    "abstract": "The fate of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)1 is the largest cause of uncertainty in long-term sea-level projections. In the last interglacial (LIG) around 125,000 years ago, data suggest that sea level was several metres higher than today2–4, and required a significant contribution from Antarctic ice loss, with WAIS usually implicated. Antarctica and the Southern Ocean were warmer than today5–8, by amounts comparable to those expected by 2100 under moderate to high future warming scenarios. However, direct evidence about the size of WAIS in the LIG is sparse. Here we use sea salt data from an ice core from Skytrain Ice Rise, adjacent to WAIS, to show that, during most of the LIG, the Ronne Ice Shelf was still in place, and close to its current extent. Water isotope data are consistent with a retreat of WAIS9, but seem inconsistent with more dramatic model realizations10 in which both WAIS and the large Antarctic ice shelves were lost. This new constraint calls for a reappraisal of other elements of the LIG sea-level budget. It also weakens the observational basis that motivated model simulations projecting the highest end of projections for future rates of sea-level rise to 2300 and beyond. Sea salt data from an ice core record show that Antarctica’s Ronne Ice Shelf survived the last interglacial, the last period of enhanced and sustained global warmth about 125,000 years ago.",

    "abstract": "Autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are a genetically engineered therapy that is highly effective against B cell malignancies and multiple myeloma1. However, the length and cost of personalized manufacturing limits access and leaves patients vulnerable to disease progression. Allogeneic cell therapies have the potential to increase patient access and improve treatment outcomes but are limited by immune rejection2,3. To devise a strategy to protect allogeneic CAR T cells from host immune cells, we turned to lymphotropic viruses that have evolved integrated mechanisms for immune escape of virus-infected lymphocytes4. We find that viral evasins that partially reduce human leukocyte antigen class I expression can shelter CAR T cells from mismatched CD8+ T cells without triggering ‘missing-self’ rejection by natural killer cells. However, this protection alone is insufficient to sustain effective allogeneic CAR T cell therapy. HIV-1 Nef uniquely also acts through the serine/threonine kinase Pak2 to abate activation-induced cell death and promote survival of CAR T cells in vivo. Thus, virus-like immune escape can harness several mechanisms that act in concert to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic CAR T cells. HIV-1 immune evasin Nef reduces activation-induced cell death and promotes survival of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells; thus, virus-like immune escape enhances therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic CAR T cells.",

    "abstract": "Many children from low-income backgrounds worldwide fail to master school mathematics1; however, some children extensively use mental arithmetic outside school2,3. Here we surveyed children in Kolkata and Delhi, India, who work in markets (n = 1,436), to investigate whether maths skills acquired in real-world settings transfer to the classroom and vice versa. Nearly all these children used complex arithmetic calculations effectively at work. They were also proficient in solving hypothetical market maths problems and verbal maths problems that were anchored to concrete contexts. However, they were unable to solve arithmetic problems of equal or lesser complexity when presented in the abstract format typically used in school. The children’s performance in market maths problems was not explained by memorization, access to help, reduced stress with more familiar formats or high incentives for correct performance. By contrast, children with no market-selling experience (n = 471), enrolled in nearby schools, showed the opposite pattern. These children performed more accurately on simple abstract problems, but only 1% could correctly answer an applied market maths problem that more than one third of working children solved (β = 0.35, s.e.m. = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = 0.30–0.40, P < 0.001). School children used highly inefficient written calculations, could not combine different operations and arrived at answers too slowly to be useful in real-life or in higher maths. These findings highlight the importance of educational curricula that bridge the gap between intuitive and formal maths. Children who learn maths working in markets and children who learn maths only from school were both unable to transfer their skills to new contexts, highlighting a need to reconsider how maths is taught in school.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-hot Jupiters, an extreme class of planets not found in our Solar System, provide a unique window into atmospheric processes. The extreme temperature contrasts between their day and night sides pose a fundamental climate puzzle: how is energy distributed? To address this, we must observe the three-dimensional structure of these atmospheres, particularly their vertical circulation patterns that can serve as a testbed for advanced global circulation models, for example, in ref. 1. Here we show a notable shift in atmospheric circulation in an ultra-hot Jupiter: a unilateral flow from the hot star-facing side to the cooler space-facing side of the planet sits below an equatorial super-rotational jet stream. By resolving the vertical structure of atmospheric dynamics, we move beyond integrated global snapshots of the atmosphere, enabling more accurate identification of flow patterns and allowing for a more nuanced comparison to models. Global circulation models based on first principles struggle to replicate the observed circulation pattern2 underscoring a critical gap between theoretical understanding of atmospheric flows and observational evidence. This work serves as a testbed to develop more comprehensive models applicable beyond our Solar System as we prepare for the next generation of giant telescopes. Ultra-hot Jupiters provide a unique window into atmospheric processes and this in-depth study enables integrated global snapshots of the atmosphere and more accurate identification of flow patterns, thus allowing for better comparison to models.",

    "abstract": "Online platforms are rife with racial discrimination1, but current interventions focus on employers2,3 rather than customers. We propose a customer-facing solution: changing to a two-point rating scale (dichotomization). Compared with the ubiquitous five-star scale, we argue that dichotomization reduces modern racial discrimination by focusing evaluators on the distinction between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ performance, thereby reducing how personal beliefs shape customer assessments. Study 1 is a quasi-natural experiment on a home-services labour platform (n = 69,971) in which the company exogenously changed from a five-star scale to a dichotomous scale (thumbs up or thumbs down). Dichotomization eliminated customers’ racial discrimination whereby non-white workers received lower ratings and earned 91 cents for each US dollar paid to white workers for the same work. A pre-registered experiment (study 2, n = 652) found that the equalizing effect of dichotomization is most prevalent among evaluators holding modern racist beliefs. Further experiments (study 3, n = 1,435; study 4, n = 528) provide evidence of the proposed mechanism, and eight supplementary studies support measurement and design choices. Our research offers a promising intervention for reducing customers’ subtle racial discrimination in a large section of the economy and contributes to the interdisciplinary literature on evaluation processes and racial inequality. Changing from a five-point scale to a two-point scale for rating workers reduces racial discrimination by making customers focus on whether the work was good or bad instead of their own personal biases.",

    "abstract": "The virus particles of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are released in an immature, non-infectious form. Proteolytic cleavage of the main structural polyprotein Gag into functional domains induces rearrangement into mature, infectious virions. In immature virus particles, the Gag membrane-binding domain, MA, forms a hexameric protein lattice that undergoes structural transition, following cleavage, into a distinct, mature MA lattice1. The mechanism of MA lattice maturation is unknown. Here we show that released spacer peptide 2 (SP2), a conserved peptide of unknown function situated about 300 residues downstream of MA, binds MA to induce structural maturation. By high-resolution in-virus structure determination of MA, we show that MA does not bind lipid into a side pocket as previously thought1, but instead binds SP2 as an integral part of the protein–protein interfaces that stabilize the mature lattice. Analysis of Gag cleavage site mutants showed that SP2 release is required for MA maturation, and we demonstrate that SP2 is sufficient to induce maturation of purified MA on lipid monolayers in vitro. SP2-triggered MA maturation correlated with faster fusion of virus with target cells. Our results reveal a new, unexpected interaction between two HIV-1 components, provide a high-resolution structure of mature MA, establish the trigger of MA structural maturation and assign function to the SP2 peptide. A study reports that the structural maturation of the matrix domain of the Gag protein of HIV-1 is induced by the proteolytic release and binding of the spacer peptide SP2.",

    "abstract": "Human accelerated regions (HARs) are conserved genomic loci that have experienced rapid nucleotide substitutions following the divergence from chimpanzees1,2. HARs are enriched in candidate regulatory regions near neurodevelopmental genes, suggesting their roles in gene regulation3. However, their target genes and functional contributions to human brain development remain largely uncharacterized. Here we elucidate the cis-regulatory functions of HARs in human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-induced excitatory neurons. Using genomic4 and chromatin looping information, we prioritized 20 HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues for functional characterization via single-cell CRISPR interference, and demonstrated their species-specific gene regulatory functions. Our findings reveal diverse functional outcomes of HAR-mediated cis-regulation in human neurons, including attenuated NPAS3 expression by altering the binding affinities of multiple transcription factors in HAR202 and maintaining iPS cell pluripotency and neuronal differentiation capacities through the upregulation of PUM2 by 2xHAR.319. Finally, we used prime editing to demonstrate differential enhancer activity caused by several HAR26;2xHAR.178 variants. In particular, we link one variant in HAR26;2xHAR.178 to elevated SOCS2 expression and increased neurite outgrowth in human neurons. Thus, our study sheds new light on the endogenous gene regulatory functions of HARs and their potential contribution to human brain evolution. The cis-regulatory functions of human accelerated regions of genomic loci and their potential contribution to human brain evolution are revealed.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of blood glucose, the body’s primary source of energy, is indispensable for overall health and metabolic homeostasis. It is regulated predominantly by the glucagon receptor family which is highly conserved in vertebrates1–4. Compared with other vertebrates, avian blood glucose levels are relatively high5,6, and blood glucose regulatory mechanisms in birds have remained unclear. Here we show that high hepatic expression of the avian glucagon receptor (GCGR) in association with constitutively active Gs signalling is dependent on the interaction of different domains. In vivo experiments showed that expression of constitutively active GCGR in hepatic cells led to correspondingly high blood glucose, rapid hepatic lipid utilization and high metabolic rates via downstream signalling pathway activation in fish, reptiles, birds and mammals. Furthermore, we identified a point mutation proximal to the GCGR gene region in chicken that resulted in reduced GCGR mRNA expression and increased body weight. Overexpressing a natural human GCGR variant (HsGCGR(H339R)) with modest constitutive activity in mice demonstrated that high expression of this variant increased blood glucose concentration and reduced body weight. In sum, we find that high expression and constitutive activity of GCGR may have contributed to the evolution of flight in the ancestors of birds. Hepatic expression of constitutively active glucagon receptor may have contributed to the glucose and lipid metabolism and the high metabolic rates that enabled the evolution of flight in birds.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen genomics can provide insights into underlying infectious disease transmission patterns1,2, but new methods are needed to handle modern large-scale pathogen genome datasets and realize this full potential3–5. In particular, genetically proximal viruses should be highly informative about transmission events as genetic proximity indicates epidemiological linkage. Here we use pairs of identical sequences to characterize fine-scale transmission patterns using 114,298 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected through Washington State (USA) genomic sentinel surveillance with associated age and residence location information between March 2021 and December 2022. This corresponds to 59,660 sequences with another identical sequence in the dataset. We find that the location of pairs of identical sequences is highly consistent with expectations from mobility and social contact data. Outliers in the relationship between genetic and mobility data can be explained by SARS-CoV-2 transmission between postcodes with male prisons, consistent with transmission between prison facilities. We find that transmission patterns between age groups vary across spatial scales. Finally, we use the timing of sequence collection to understand the age groups driving transmission. Overall, this study improves our ability to use large pathogen genome datasets to understand the determinants of infectious disease spread. The analysis of pairs of identical SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences enables characterization of transmission patterns between geographies and age groups.",

    "abstract": "Although learning in response to extrinsic reinforcement is theorized to be driven by dopamine signals that encode the difference between expected and experienced rewards1,2, skills that enable verbal or musical expression can be learned without extrinsic reinforcement. Instead, spontaneous execution of these skills is thought to be intrinsically reinforcing3,4. Whether dopamine signals similarly guide learning of these intrinsically reinforced behaviours is unknown. In juvenile zebra finches learning from an adult tutor, dopamine signalling in a song-specialized basal ganglia region is required for successful song copying, a spontaneous, intrinsically reinforced process5. Here we show that dopamine dynamics in the song basal ganglia faithfully track the learned quality of juvenile song performance on a rendition-by-rendition basis. Furthermore, dopamine release in the basal ganglia is driven not only by inputs from midbrain dopamine neurons classically associated with reinforcement learning but also by song premotor inputs, which act by means of local cholinergic signalling to elevate dopamine during singing. Although both cholinergic and dopaminergic signalling are necessary for juvenile song learning, only dopamine tracks the learned quality of song performance. Therefore, dopamine dynamics in the basal ganglia encode performance quality during self-directed, long-term learning of natural behaviours. Dopamine release in the basal ganglia of the zebra finch is driven by neurons associated with reinforcement learning and by cholinergic signalling, and tracks performance quality during long-term learning of its song.",

    "abstract": "The efficient and modular diversification of molecular scaffolds, particularly for the synthesis of diverse molecular libraries, remains a notable challenge in drug optimization campaigns1–3. The late-stage introduction of alkyl fragments is especially desirable due to the high sp3 character and structural versatility of these motifs4. Given their prevalence in molecular frameworks, C(sp2)–H bonds serve as attractive targets for diversification, although this process often requires difficult prefunctionalization or lengthy de novo syntheses. Traditionally, direct alkylations of arenes are achieved by using Friedel–Crafts reaction conditions with strong Brønsted or Lewis acids5,6. However, these methods suffer from poor functional group tolerance and low selectivity, limiting their broad implementation in late-stage functionalization and drug optimization campaigns. Here we report the application of a new strategy for the selective coupling of differently hybridized radical species, which we term ‘dynamic orbital selection’. This mechanistic model overcomes common limitations of Friedel–Crafts alkylations via the in situ formation of two distinct radical species, which are subsequently differentiated by a copper-based catalyst on the basis of their respective binding properties. As a result, we demonstrate here a general and highly modular reaction for the direct alkylation of native arene C–H bonds using abundant and benign alcohols and carboxylic acids as the alkylating agents. Ultimately, this solution overcomes the synthetic challenges associated with the introduction of complex alkyl groups into highly sophisticated drug scaffolds in a late-stage fashion, thereby granting access to vast new chemical space. Based on the generality of the underlying coupling mechanism, ‘dynamic orbital selection’ is expected to be a broadly applicable coupling platform for further challenging transformations involving two distinct radical species. Using the concept of dynamic orbital selection distinct organic radical species can be differentiated, enabling direct coupling of aromatics with alcohols or carboxylic acids.",

    "abstract": "The tumour-suppressor protein BRCA2 has a central role in homology-directed DNA repair by enhancing the formation of RAD51 filaments on resected single-stranded DNA generated at double-stranded DNA breaks and stimulating RAD51 activity1,2. Individuals with BRCA2 mutations are predisposed to cancer; however, BRCA2-deficient tumours are often responsive to targeted therapy with PARP inhibitors (PARPi)3–6. The mechanism by which BRCA2 deficiency renders cells sensitive to PARPi but with minimal toxicity in cells heterozygous for BRCA2 mutations remains unclear. Here we identify a previously unknown role of BRCA2 that is directly linked to the effect of PARP1 inhibition. Using biochemical and single-molecule approaches, we demonstrate that PARPi-mediated PARP1 retention on a resected DNA substrate interferes with RAD51 filament stability and impairs RAD51-mediated DNA strand exchange. Full-length BRCA2 protects RAD51 filaments and counteracts the instability conferred by PARPi-mediated retention by preventing the binding of PARP1 to DNA. Extending these findings to a cellular context, we use quantitative single-molecule localization microscopy to show that BRCA2 prevents PARPi-induced PARP1 retention at homologous-recombination repair sites. By contrast, BRCA2-deficient cells exhibit increased PARP1 retention at these lesions in response to PARPi. These results provide mechanistic insights into the role of BRCA2 in maintaining RAD51 stability and protecting homologous-recombination repair sites by mitigating PARPi-mediated PARP1 retention. The tumour-suppressor protein BRCA2 is discovered to have a previously undescribed role in maintaining genomic integrity and the sensitivity of PARP1 inhibitors.",

The structural mechanics of how glutamate gating occurs in full-length iGluRs is not well understood. Here, using the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid subtype iGluR (AMPAR), we identify the glutamate-gating mechanism. AMPAR activation by glutamate is augmented at physiological temperatures. By preparing AMPARs for cryogenic-electron microscopy at these temperatures, we captured the glutamate-gating mechanism. Activation by glutamate initiates ion channel opening that involves all ion channel helices hinging away from the pore axis in a motif that is conserved across all iGluRs. Desensitization occurs when the local dimer pairs decouple and enables closure of the ion channel below through restoring the channel hinges and refolding the channel gate. Our findings define how glutamate gates iGluRs, provide foundations for therapeutic design and demonstrate how physiological temperatures can alter iGluR function. Physiological temperatures augment activation of glutamate receptors, which enables the structural basis of neuronal excitation to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "Human RAD52 is a multifunctional DNA repair protein involved in several cellular events that support genome stability, including protection of stalled DNA replication forks from excessive degradation1–4. In its gatekeeper role, RAD52 binds to and stabilizes stalled replication forks during replication stress, protecting them from reversal by SMARCAL1 motor3. The structural and molecular mechanism of the RAD52-mediated fork protection remains elusive. Here, using P1 nuclease sensitivity, biochemical and single-molecule analyses, we show that RAD52 dynamically remodels replication forks through its strand exchange activity. The presence of the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA at the fork modulates the kinetics of the strand exchange without impeding the reaction outcome. Mass photometry and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy show that the replication fork promotes a unique nucleoprotein structure containing head-to-head arrangement of two undecameric RAD52 rings with an extended positively charged surface that accommodates all three arms of the replication fork. We propose that the formation and continuity of this surface is important for the strand exchange reaction and for competition with SMARCAL1. A head-to-head double-ring complex of the human multifunctional DNA repair protein RAD52 mediates protection of stalled replication forks during replication stress, protecting them from reversal by SMARCAL1 motor.",

    "abstract": "Flowering plant sexual reproduction requires double fertilization, yielding embryo and endosperm seed compartments: the latter supports embryo growth and seed germination. In an experiment to generate haploid embryos through inhibition of pollen phospholipase activity in sunflower (Helianthus annus), we serendipitously discovered that emasculated sunflowers spontaneously form parthenogenic haploid seed. Exploration of genetic, chemical and environmental factors demonstrated that a specific genotype background enabled high parthenogenesis and that full spectrum high-intensity light supplementation boosted parthenogenesis, yielding hundreds of haploid seeds per head. Induction of doubled haploid plants can greatly accelerate plant breeding efficiency; however, despite successful engineering of haploid induction in many crops, few reported systems are commercially scalable1. Here we report efficient methods of chemical emasculation and genome doubling to produce fertile plants and enable a scalable sunflower doubled haploid system. Spontaneous parthenogenesis in sunflower has been used to develop a scalable doubled haploid breeding system.",

    "abstract": "Four-wave mixing is a nonlinear optical phenomenon that can be used for wideband low-noise optical amplification and wavelength conversion. It has been extensively investigated for applications in communications1, computing2, metrology3, imaging4 and quantum optics5. With its advantages of small footprint, large nonlinearity and dispersion-engineering capability, optical integrated waveguides are excellent candidates for realizing high-gain and large-bandwidth four-wave mixing for which anomalous dispersion is a key condition. Various waveguides based on, for example, silicon, aluminium gallium arsenide and nonlinear glass have been studied6–10, but suffer from considerable gain and bandwidth reductions, as conventional design approaches for anomalous dispersion result in multi-mode operation. We present a methodology for fabricating nonlinear waveguides with simultaneous single-mode operation and anomalous dispersion for ultra-broadband operation and high-efficiency four-wave mixing. Although we implemented this in silicon nitride waveguides, the design approach can be used with other platforms as well. By using higher-order dispersion, we achieved unprecedented amplification bandwidths of more than 300 nm in these ultra-low-loss integrated waveguides. Penalty-free all-optical wavelength conversion of 100 Gbit s−1 data in a single optical channel of over 200 nm was realized. These single-mode dispersion-engineered nonlinear waveguides could become practical building blocks in various nonlinear photonics applications. An integrated optical parametric amplifier with an ultra-wide bandwidth was implemented using geometrically optimized low-loss nonlinear rib silicon nitride waveguides including the demonstration of broadband all-optical wavelength conversion.",

    "abstract": "The Maltese archipelago is a small island chain that is among the most remote in the Mediterranean. Humans were not thought to have reached and inhabited such small and isolated islands until the regional shift to Neolithic lifeways, around 7.5 thousand years ago (ka)1. In the standard view, the limited resources and ecological vulnerabilities of small islands, coupled with the technological challenges of long-distance seafaring, meant that hunter-gatherers were either unable or unwilling to make these journeys2–4. Here we describe chronological, archaeological, faunal and botanical data that support the presence of Holocene hunter-gatherers on the Maltese islands. At this time, Malta’s geographical configuration and sea levels approximated those of the present day, necessitating seafaring distances of around 100 km from Sicily, the closest landmass. Occupations began at around 8.5 ka and are likely to have lasted until around 7.5 ka. These hunter-gatherers exploited land animals, but were also able to take advantage of marine resources and avifauna, helping to sustain these groups on a small island. Our discoveries document the longest yet-known hunter-gatherer sea crossings in the Mediterranean, raising the possibility of unknown, precocious connections across the wider region. Archaeological discoveries from Malta suggest that humans were present on the Maltese islands from around 8,500 years ago, providing evidence that Mesolithic hunter-gatherers made sea crossings as long as 100 km.",

    "abstract": "Protein misfolding diseases, including α1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), pose substantial health challenges, with their cellular progression still poorly understood1–3. We use spatial proteomics by mass spectrometry and machine learning to map AATD in human liver tissue. Combining Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) with single-cell analysis4,5, we probe intact patient biopsies to resolve molecular events during hepatocyte stress in pseudotime across fibrosis stages. We achieve proteome depth of up to 4,300 proteins from one-third of a single cell in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. This dataset reveals a potentially clinically actionable peroxisomal upregulation that precedes the canonical unfolded protein response. Our single-cell proteomics data show α1-antitrypsin accumulation is largely cell-intrinsic, with minimal stress propagation between hepatocytes. We integrated proteomic data with artificial intelligence-guided image-based phenotyping across several disease stages, revealing a late-stage hepatocyte phenotype characterized by globular protein aggregates and distinct proteomic signatures, notably including elevated TNFSF10 (also known as TRAIL) amounts. This phenotype may represent a critical disease progression stage. Our study offers new insights into AATD pathogenesis and introduces a powerful methodology for high-resolution, in situ proteomic analysis of complex tissues. This approach holds potential to unravel molecular mechanisms in various protein misfolding disorders, setting a new standard for understanding disease progression at the single-cell level in human tissue. High-resolution spatial proteomics were used to map molecular events during hepatocyte stress in pseudotime across all fibrosis stages, recapitulating known disease progression markers and revealing early peroxisomal activation and late-stage proteotoxic phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between antibiotic use and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is vital for effective antibiotic stewardship. Yet, animal models and in vitro experiments poorly replicate real-world conditions1. To explain how resistance evolves in vivo, we exposed 60 human participants to ciprofloxacin and used longitudinal stool samples and a new computational method to assemble the genomes of 5,665 populations of commensal bacterial species within participants. Analysis of 2.3 million polymorphic sequence variants revealed 513 populations that underwent selective sweeps. We found convergent evolution focused on DNA gyrase and evidence of dispersed selective pressure at other genomic loci. Roughly 10% of susceptible bacterial populations evolved towards resistance through sweeps that involved substitutions at a specific amino acid in gyrase. The evolution of gyrase was associated with large populations that decreased in relative abundance during exposure. Sweeps persisted for more than 10 weeks in most cases and were not projected to revert within a year. Targeted amplification showed that gyrase mutations arose de novo within the participants and exhibited no measurable fitness cost. These findings revealed that brief ciprofloxacin exposure drives the evolution of resistance in gut commensals, with mutations persisting long after exposure. This study underscores the capacity of the human gut to promote the evolution of resistance and identifies key genomic and ecological factors that shape bacterial adaptation in vivo. Brief ciprofloxacin exposure in humans drives antibiotic resistance evolution in gut bacteria through selective sweeps, particularly involving DNA gyrase mutations, which persist long after exposure and demonstrate the human gutʼs capacity to promote resistance evolution.",

    "abstract": "Several hydrogen-rich superconductors have been found to show unprecedentedly high critical temperatures1–4, stimulating investigations into the nature of the superconductivity in these materials. Although their macroscopic superconducting properties are established1,5–7, microscopic insights into the pairing mechanism remains unclear. Here we characterize the superconducting gap structure in the high-temperature superconductor H3S and its deuterium counterpart D3S by performing tunnelling spectroscopy measurements. The tunnelling spectra reveal that H3S and D3S both have a fully gapped structure, which could be well described by a single s-wave Dynes model, with gap values 2Δ of approximately 60 meV and 44 meV, respectively. Furthermore, we observed gap features of another likely H-depleted HxS superconducting phase in a poorly synthesized hydrogen sulfide sample. Our work offers direct experimental evidence for superconductivity in the hydrogen-rich superconductor H3S from a microscopic perspective. It validates the phonon-mediated mechanism of superconducting pairing and provides a foundation for further understanding the origins of high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-rich compounds. Characterizing the superconducting gap structure in the high-temperature superconductor H3S by means of tunnelling spectroscopy reveals that it, as well as D3S, has a fully gapped structure, confirming the phonon-mediated mechanism of superconducting pairing.",

    "abstract": "Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains are central components of pattern recognition immune proteins across all domains of life1,2. In bacteria and plants, TIR-domain proteins recognize pathogen invasion and then produce immune signalling molecules exclusively comprising nucleotide moieties2–5. Here we show that the TIR-domain protein of the type II Thoeris defence system in bacteria produces a unique signalling molecule comprising the amino acid histidine conjugated to ADP-ribose (His-ADPR). His-ADPR is generated in response to phage infection and activates the cognate Thoeris effector by binding a Macro domain located at the C terminus of the effector protein. By determining the crystal structure of a ligand-bound Macro domain, we describe the structural basis for His-ADPR and its recognition and show its role by biochemical and mutational analyses. Our analyses furthermore reveal a family of phage proteins that bind and sequester His-ADPR signalling molecules, enabling phages to evade TIR-mediated immunity. These data demonstrate diversity in bacterial TIR signalling and reveal a new class of TIR-derived immune signalling molecules that combine nucleotide and amino acid moieties. In response to phage infection, the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain protein ThsB of the type II Thoeris defence system produces histidine conjugated to ADP-ribose, which stimulates bacterial defence by interacting with the Macro domain of the ThsA membrane effector protein.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations are widespread in normal human tissues1. Similarly, in murine chimeras, cells carrying an oncogenic lesion contribute normal cells to adult tissues without causing cancer2–4. How lineages that escape cancer via normal development differ from the minority that succumb is unclear. Tumours exhibit characteristic cancer hallmarks; we therefore searched for hallmarks that differentiate cancer-prone lineages from resistant lineages. Here we show that total cell cycle duration (Tc) predicts transformation susceptibility across multiple tumour types. Cancer-prone Rb- and p107-deficient retina (Rb is also known as Rb1 and p107 is also known as Rbl1) exhibited defects in apoptosis, senescence, immune surveillance, angiogenesis, DNA repair, polarity and proliferation. Perturbing the SKP2–p27–CDK2/CDK1 axis could block cancer without affecting these hallmarks. Thus, cancer requires more than the presence of its hallmarks. Notably, every tumour-suppressive mutation that we tested increased Tc, and the Tc of the cell of origin of retinoblastoma cells was half that of resistant lineages. Tc also differentiated the cell of origin in Rb−/− pituitary cancer. In lung, loss of Rb and p53 (also known as Trp53) transforms neuroendocrine cells, whereas KrasG12D or BrafV600E mutations transform alveolar type 2 cells5–7. The shortest Tc consistently identified the cell of origin, regardless of mutation timing. Thus, relative Tc is a hallmark of initiation that distinguishes cancer-prone from cancer-resistant lineages in several settings, explaining how mutated cells escape transformation without inducing apoptosis, senescence or immune surveillance. Total cell cycle duration is a key hallmark of cancer initiation, and determines whether defects in apoptosis, senescence, immune surveillance, angiogenesis, DNA repair, polarity and proliferation lead to cancer development.",

    "abstract": "Indigenous groups often encounter significant challenges when asserting ancestral claims and cultural affiliations based on oral histories, particularly in the USA where such narratives have historically been undervalued. Although ancient DNA offers a tool to complement traditional knowledge and address gaps in oral history, longstanding disregard for Indigenous sovereignty and beliefs has understandably led many Indigenous communities to distrust DNA studies1–4. Earlier research often focused on repatriation claims5–7, whereas more recent work has increasingly moved towards enhancing Tribal histories8,9. Here we present a collaborative study initiated by a federally recognized Native American tribe, the sovereign nation of Picuris Pueblo in the Northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico, USA, to address gaps in traditional knowledge and further their understanding of their population history and ancestry. We generated genomes from 16 ancient Picuris individuals and 13 present-day members of Picuris Pueblo, providing genomic data spanning the last millennium. We show genetic continuity between ancient and present-day Picuris, and more broadly with Ancestral Puebloans from Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon10, 275 km to the west. This suggests a firm spatiotemporal link among these Puebloan populations of the North American Southwest. Furthermore, we see no evidence of population decline before European arrival11–13, and no Athabascan ancestry in individuals predating 1500 ce, challenging earlier migration hypotheses14–16. This work prioritizes Indigenous control of genetic data and brings together oral tradition, archaeology, ethnography and genetics. A collaborative study initiated by the sovereign nation of Picuris Pueblo in the Northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico addresses gaps in traditional knowledge and furthers understanding of their population history and ancestry.",

    "abstract": "Animal and bacterial cells use nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) enzymes to respond to viral infection and control major forms of immune signalling including cGAS-STING innate immunity and CBASS anti-phage defence1–4. Here we discover a family of bacterial defence systems, which we name Hailong, that use NTase enzymes to constitutively synthesize DNA signals and guard against phage infection. Hailong protein B (HalB) is an NTase that converts deoxy-ATP into single-stranded DNA oligomers. A series of X-ray crystal structures define a stepwise mechanism of HalB DNA synthesis initiated by a C-terminal tyrosine residue that enables de novo enzymatic priming. We show that HalB DNA signals bind to and repress activation of a partnering Hailong protein A (HalA) effector complex. A 2.0-Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the HalA–DNA complex reveals a membrane protein with a conserved ion channel domain and a unique crown domain that binds the DNA signal and gates activation. Analysing Hailong defence in vivo, we demonstrate that viral DNA exonucleases required for phage replication trigger release of the primed HalA complex and induce protective host cell growth arrest. Our results explain how inhibitory nucleotide immune signals can serve as molecular guards against phage infection and expand the mechanisms NTase enzymes use to control antiviral immunity. Hailong, an anti-phage defence system, synthesizes an oligodeoxyadenylate signal that blocks effector activity in the absence of phage infection but is degraded by phage-encoded DNA exonucleases, leading to protective growth arrest of infected cells.",

    "abstract": "The relative twist angle between layers of near-lattice-matched van der Waals materials is critical for the emergent phenomena associated with moiré flat bands1–3. However, the concept of angle rotation control is not exclusive to moiré superlattices in which electrons directly experience a twist-angle-dependent periodic potential. Instead, it can also be used to induce programmable symmetry-breaking perturbations with the goal of stabilizing desired correlated states. Here we experimentally demonstrate ‘moiréless’ twist-tuning of superconductivity together with other correlated orders in Bernal bilayer graphene proximitized by tungsten diselenide. The precise alignment between the two materials systematically controls the strength of induced Ising spin–orbit coupling (SOC), profoundly altering the phase diagram. As Ising SOC is increased, superconductivity onsets at a higher displacement field and features a higher critical temperature, reaching up to 0.5 K. Within the main superconducting dome and in the strong Ising SOC limit, we find an unusual phase transition characterized by a nematic redistribution of holes among trigonally warped Fermi pockets and enhanced resilience to in-plane magnetic fields. The superconducting behaviour is theoretically compatible with the prominent role of interband interactions between symmetry-breaking Fermi pockets. Moreover, we identify two additional superconducting regions, one of which descends from an inter-valley coherent normal state and shows a Pauli-limit violation ratio exceeding 40, among the highest for all known superconductors4–7. Our results provide insights into ultraclean graphene superconductors and underscore the potential of utilizing moiréless-twist engineering across a wide range of van der Waals heterostructures. The superconductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene that emerges from the spin–orbit coupling induced by proximal tungsten diselenide can be tuned by modulating the twist angle between the two materials.",

    "abstract": "Photonic double-zero-index media, distinguished by concurrently zero-valued permittivity and permeability, exhibit extraordinary properties not found in nature1–8. Notably, the notion of zero index can be substantially expanded by generalizing the constitutive parameters from null scalars to non-reciprocal tensors with non-zero matrix elements but zero determinants9,10. Here we experimentally realize this class of gyromagnetic double-zero-index metamaterials possessing both double-zero-index features and non-reciprocal hallmarks. As an intrinsic property, this metamaterial always emerges at a spin-1/2 Dirac point of a topological phase transition. We discover and demonstrate that a spatiotemporal reflection vortex singularity is always anchored to the Dirac point of the metamaterial, with the vortex charge being determined by the topological invariant leap across the phase transition. This establishes a unique bulk–spatiotemporal vortex correspondence that extends the protected boundary effects into the time domain and characterizes topological phase-transition points, setting it apart from any pre-existing bulk–boundary correspondence. Based on this correspondence, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a mechanism to deterministically generate optical spatiotemporal vortex pulses11,12 with firmly fixed central frequency and momentum, hence showing ultrarobustness. Our findings uncover connections between zero-refractive-index photonics, topological photonics and singular optics, which might enable the manipulation of space-time topological light fields using the inherent topology of extreme-parameter metamaterials. Realization of a gyromagnetic double-zero-index metamaterial results in unconventional optical and topological properties, suitable to be used for the generation of light pulses shaped as a vortex both in time and space.",

    "abstract": "Humans have evolved an extraordinarily expanded and complex cerebral cortex associated with developmental and gene regulatory modifications1–3. Human accelerated regions (HARs) are highly conserved DNA sequences with human-specific nucleotide substitutions. Although there are thousands of annotated HARs, their functional contribution to species-specific cortical development remains largely unknown4,5. HARE5 is a HAR transcriptional enhancer of the WNT signalling receptor Frizzled8 that is active during brain development6. Here, using genome-edited mouse (Mus musculus, Mm) and primate models, we demonstrated that human (Homo sapiens, Hs) HARE5 fine-tunes cortical development and connectivity by controlling the proliferative and neurogenic capacities of neural progenitor cells. Hs-HARE5 knock-in mice have significantly enlarged neocortices, containing more excitatory neurons. By measuring neural dynamics in vivo, we showed that these anatomical features result in increased functional independence between cortical regions. We assessed underlying developmental mechanisms using fixed and live imaging, lineage analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing. We discovered that Hs-HARE5 modifies radial glial cell behaviour, with increased self-renewal at early developmental stages, followed by expanded neurogenic potential. Using genome-edited human and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, Pt) neural progenitor cells and cortical organoids, we showed that four human-specific variants of Hs-HARE5 drive increased enhancer activity that promotes progenitor proliferation. Finally, we showed that Hs-HARE5 increased progenitor proliferation by amplifying canonical WNT signalling. These findings illustrate how small changes in regulatory DNA can directly affect critical signalling pathways to modulate brain development. Our study uncovered new functions of HARs as key regulatory elements crucial for the expansion and complexity of the human cerebral cortex. HARE5, a human accelerated region enhancer, modulates cortical development by influencing neural progenitor cell behaviour, leading to an enlarged neocortex with increased functional independence between cortical regions through amplified WNT signalling.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memories—high-fidelity memories for events that depend initially on the hippocampus—do not maintain their precision in perpetuity. One benefit of this time-dependent loss of precision is the emergence of event-linked gist memories that may be used to guide future behaviour in new but related situations (that is, generalization)1–3. Models of systems consolidation propose that memory reorganization accompanies this loss of memory precision1,4; however, the locus of this reorganization is unclear. Here we report that time-dependent reorganization of hippocampal engram circuitry is sufficient to explain shifts in memory precision associated with systems consolidation. Using engram labelling tools in mice, we demonstrate that the passage of time rewires hippocampal engram circuits, enabling hippocampal engram neurons to be promiscuously active and guide behaviour in related situations that do not match the original training conditions. Reorganization depends on hippocampal neurogenesis; eliminating hippocampal neurogenesis prevents reorganization and maintains precise, event memories. Conversely, promoting hippocampal neurogenesis accelerates memory reorganization and the emergence of event-linked gist memories in the hippocampus. Our results indicate that systems consolidation models require updating to account for within-hippocampus reorganization that leads to qualitative shifts in memory precision. A study shows that loss of memory precision associated with systems consolidation can be explained by neurogenesis-dependent reorganization of engram circuitry within the hippocampus over time.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed cancer therapy1,2. The efficacy of immunotherapy depends on dendritic cell-mediated tumour antigen presentation, T cell priming and activation3,4. However, the relationship between the key transcription factors in dendritic cells and ICB efficacy remains unknown. Here we found that ICB reprograms the interplay between the STAT3 and STAT5 transcriptional pathways in dendritic cells, thereby activating T cell immunity and enabling ICB efficacy. Mechanistically, STAT3 restrained the JAK2 and STAT5 transcriptional pathway, determining the fate of dendritic cell function. As STAT3 is often activated in the tumour microenvironment5, we developed two distinct PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting chimera) degraders of STAT3, SD-36 and SD-2301. STAT3 degraders effectively degraded STAT3 in dendritic cells and reprogrammed the dendritic cell–transcriptional network towards immunogenicity. Furthermore, STAT3 degrader monotherapy was efficacious in treatment of advanced tumours and ICB-resistant tumours without toxicity in mice. Thus, the crosstalk between STAT3 and STAT5 transcriptional pathways determines the dendritic cell phenotype in the tumour microenvironment and STAT3 degraders hold promise for cancer immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint blockade activates T cell immunity by reprogramming the STAT3 and STAT5 transcriptional pathways in dendritic cells, and STAT3 degradation is effective for treating tumours of multiple cancer types in mouse models.",

    "abstract": "In the future, monsoon rainfall over densely populated South Asia is expected to increase, even as monsoon circulation weakens1–3. By contrast, past warm intervals were marked by both increased rainfall and a strengthening of monsoon circulation4–6, posing a challenge to understanding the response of the South Asian summer monsoon to warming. Here we show consistent South Asian summer monsoon changes in the mid-Pliocene, Last Interglacial, mid-Holocene and future scenarios, characterized by an overall increase in monsoon rainfall, a weakening of the monsoon trough-like circulation over the Bay of Bengal and a strengthening of the monsoon circulation over the northern Arabian Sea, as revealed by a compilation of proxy records and climate simulations. Increased monsoon rainfall is thermodynamically dominated by atmospheric moisture following the rich-get-richer paradigm, and dynamically dominated by the monsoon circulation driven by the enhanced land warming in subtropical western Eurasia and northern Africa. The coherent response of monsoon dynamics across warm climates reconciles past strengthening with future weakening, reinforcing confidence in future projections. Further prediction of South Asian summer monsoon circulation and rainfall by physics-based regression models using past information agrees well with climate model projections, with spatial correlation coefficients of approximately 0.8 and 0.7 under the high-emissions scenario. These findings underscore the promising potential of past analogues, bolstered by palaeoclimate reconstruction, in improving future South Asian summer monsoon projections. Proxy records and climate simulations show that in past warm intervals, the South Asian summer monsoon was characterized by an increase in monsoon rainfall, and weakening and strengthening of different parts of the monsoon circulation, consistent with future projections.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-long-range genomic contacts, which are key components of neuronal genome architecture1–3, constitute a biochemical enigma. This is because regulatory DNA elements make selective and stable contacts with DNA sequences located hundreds of kilobases away, instead of interacting with proximal sequences occupied by the exact same transcription factors1,4. This is exemplified in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), in which only a fraction of LHX2-, EBF1- and LDB1-bound sites interact with each other, converging into highly selective multi-chromosomal enhancer hubs5. To obtain biochemical insight into this process, here we assembled olfactory receptor (OR) enhancer hubs in vitro with recombinant proteins and enhancer DNA. Cell-free reconstitution of enhancer hubs revealed that OR enhancers form nucleoprotein condensates with unusual, solid-like characteristics. Assembly of these solid condensates is orchestrated by specific DNA motifs enriched in OR enhancers, which are likely to confer distinct homotypic properties on their resident LHX2–EBF1–LDB1 complexes. Single-molecule tracking and pulse-chase experiments in vivo confirmed that LHX2 and EBF1 assemble OR-transcription-competent condensates with solid properties in OSN nuclei, under physiological concentrations of protein. Thus, homophilic nucleoprotein interactions that are influenced by DNA sequence generate new types of biomolecular condensate, which might provide a generalizable explanation for the stability and specificity of long-range genomic contacts across cell types. In vitro reconstitution and in vivo live-cell imaging of LHX2–EBF1–LDB1 enhancer hubs in olfactory sensory neurons reveals that these transcription factors form condensates with solid, rather than liquid, phase properties.",

Rewiring spared neural circuits after injury is a long-standing goal of neurorehabilitation1,2. We hypothesized that combining intensive, progressive, task-focused training with real-time closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation (CLV) to enhance synaptic plasticity3 could increase strength, expand range of motion and improve hand function in people with chronic, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury. Here we report the results from a prospective, double-blinded, sham-controlled, randomized study combining gamified physical therapy using force and motion sensors to deliver sham or active CLV (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04288245). After 12 weeks of therapy composed of a miniaturized implant selectively activating the vagus nerve on successful movements, 19 people exhibited a significant beneficial effect on arm and hand strength and the ability to perform activities of daily living. CLV represents a promising therapeutic avenue for people with chronic, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury. Following spinal cord injury, gamified physical therapy that incorporates closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation can aid restoration of arm and hand function.",

    "abstract": "Unique phosphorylation ‘barcodes’ installed in different regions of an active seven-transmembrane receptor by different G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) have been proposed to promote distinct cellular outcomes1, but it is unclear whether or how arrestins differentially engage these barcodes. Here, to address this, we developed an antigen-binding fragment (Fab7) that recognizes both active arrestin2 (β-arrestin1) and arrestin3 (β-arrestin2) without interacting with bound receptor polypeptides. We used Fab7 to determine the structures of both arrestins in complex with atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) phosphorylated in different regions of its C-terminal tail by either GRK2 or GRK5 (ref. 2). The GRK2-phosphorylated ACKR3 resulted in more heterogeneous ‘tail-mode’ assemblies, whereas phosphorylation by GRK5 resulted in more rigid ‘ACKR3-adjacent’ assemblies. Unexpectedly, the finger loops of both arrestins engaged the micelle surface rather than the receptor intracellular pocket, with arrestin3 being more dynamic, partly because of its lack of a membrane-anchoring motif. Thus, both the region of the barcode and the arrestin isoform involved can alter the structure and dynamics of GPCR–arrestin complexes, providing a possible mechanistic basis for unique downstream cellular effects, such as the efficiency of chemokine scavenging and the robustness of arrestin binding in ACKR3. Different phosphorylation patterns created by GRK2 and GRK5 on the C-terminal tail of ACKR3 lead to distinct structural arrangements and dynamics of G-protein-coupled receptor–arrestin complexes, potentially explaining diverse cellular outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Every generation, the human genome is shuffled during meiosis and a single fertilized egg gives rise to all of the cells of the body1. Meiotic errors leading to chromosomal abnormalities are known causes of pregnancy loss2,3, but genetic aetiologies of euploid pregnancy loss remain largely unexplained4. Here we characterize sequence diversity in early pregnancy loss through whole-genome sequencing of 1,007 fetal samples and 934 parental samples from 467 trios affected by pregnancy loss (fetus, mother and father). Sequenced parental genomes enabled us to determine both the parental and meiotic origins of chromosomal abnormalities, detected in half of our set. It further enabled us to assess de novo mutations on both homologous chromosomes from parents transmitting extra chromosomes, and date them, revealing that 6.6% of maternal mutations occurred before sister chromatid formation in fetal oocytes. We find a similar number of de novo mutations in the trios affected by pregnancy loss as in 9,651 adult trios, but three times the number of pathogenic small (<50 bp) sequence variant genotypes in the loss cases compared with adults. Overall, our findings indicate that around 1 in 136 pregnancies is lost due to a pathogenic small sequence variant genotype in the fetus. Our results highlight the vast sequence diversity that is lost in early pregnancy. Around 1 in 136 pregnancies is lost due to a pathogenic small sequence variant genotype in the fetus.",

    "abstract": "Doping is a primary method to modulate the electrical properties of semiconductors, enabling the fabrication of various homojunctions/heterojunctions and complex devices1–8. For organic semiconductors (OSCs), the electrical performance has been extensively improved by developing doping methods and dopants9–13. However, compared with the state-of-the-art spatial resolution of inorganic semiconductor fabrication processes, OSCs lag far behind, limiting the construction of complex organic electronic devices5. Here we present a facile light-triggered doping strategy and develop a series of inactive photoactivable dopants (iPADs) for regionally controlled n-doping of OSCs. By converting iPADs into active dopants through ultraviolet (UV) exposure, controllable doping of various n-type OSCs with high electrical conductivity greater than 30 S cm−1 has been realized. Using iPADs can substantially improve the performances of OSCs in transistors, logic circuits and thermoelectrics. Also, regionally controlled doping is demonstrated in OSCs with a record resolution down to 1 μm. Overall, our strategy has achieved tunable doping levels in OSCs with high spatial resolution, which is expected to be highly suited for integrated circuits in both roll-to-roll and laboratory-scale environments. A facile light-triggered doping strategy involving a series of inactive photoactivable dopants is described that facilitates tunable regionally controlled n-doping of organic semiconductors, resulting in stable patterning of the doping profile at record high resolutions.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) are central to physiology1,2. Excess mROS production has been associated with several disease states2,3; however, the precise sources, regulation and mechanism of generation in vivo remain unclear, which limits translational efforts. Here we show that in obesity, hepatic coenzyme Q (CoQ) synthesis is impaired, which increases the CoQH2 to CoQ (CoQH2/CoQ) ratio and drives excessive mROS production through reverse electron transport (RET) from site IQ in complex I. Using multiple complementary genetic and pharmacological models in vivo, we demonstrate that RET is crucial for metabolic health. In patients with steatosis, the hepatic CoQ biosynthetic program is also suppressed, and the CoQH2/CoQ ratio positively correlates with disease severity. Our data identify a highly selective mechanism for pathological mROS production in obesity, which can be targeted to protect metabolic homeostasis. Reverse electron transport is the mechanism behind excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in the livers of obese mice, which has implications for developing therapeutics for fatty liver disease in humans.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a class of long-period radio transients (LPTs) has been discovered, exhibiting emission thousands of times longer than radio pulsars1–5. These findings, enabled by advances in wide-field radio surveys, challenge existing models of rotationally powered pulsars. Proposed models include highly magnetized neutron stars6, white-dwarf pulsars7 and white-dwarf binary systems with low-mass companions8. Although some models predict X-ray emission6,9, no LPTs have been detected in X-rays despite extensive searches1–5,10. Here we report the discovery of an extremely bright LPT (10–20 Jy in radio), ASKAP J1832−0911, which has coincident radio and X-ray emission, both with a 44.2-minute period. Its correlated and highly variable X-ray and radio luminosities, combined with other observational properties, are unlike any known Galactic object. The source could be an old magnetar or an ultra-magnetized white dwarf; however, both interpretations present theoretical challenges. This X-ray detection from an LPT reveals that these objects are more energetic than previously thought and establishes a class of hour-scale periodic X-ray transients with a luminosity of about 1033 erg s−1 linked to exceptionally bright coherent radio emission. A long-period radio transient with coincident radio and X-ray emission and observational properties unlike any known Galactic object has been observed by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder.",

    "abstract": "Surface albedo greatly affects how much energy the Earth absorbs. Intensive human activities and accelerated climate change have altered surface albedo across spatial and temporal scales1–3, yet assessments of the effects of land use or land cover (LULC) and snow variations on land surface albedo are scarce at the global scale. As a result, the global land surface albedo dynamics over recent decades and their corresponding radiative forcing to the climate system remain poorly understood4–9. Here we quantify the individual and combined effects of snow cover dynamics, LULC conversions and non-conversion regions on albedo variations during 2001–2020 and estimate their induced radiative forcing. We show that the negative radiative forcing induced by the global land surface albedo change was −0.142 (−0.158, −0.114) W m−2 over the past two decades. The global snow-free land surface albedo increased by 2.2% (P < 0.001), with a negative radiative forcing of −0.164 (−0.186, −0.138) W m−2 (P < 0.001). The magnitude of this negative forcing is sevenfold larger than the positive forcing induced by snow dynamics, and equivalent to 59.9% of that caused by CO2 emissions from 2011 to 201910. The global radiative forcing due to albedo changes in LULC non-conversion regions is 3.9 to 8.1 times greater than that from LULC conversions. The radiative forcing induced by albedo changes highlights the important role of land surface dynamics in modulating global warming. Effects of snow cover dynamics, land use or land cover conversions and non-conversion regions on albedo variations during 2001–2020 are quantified and their induced radiative forcing estimated, highlighting the role of land surface dynamics in modulating global warming.",

    "abstract": "Topological insulators were originally discovered for electron waves in condensed-matter systems. Recently, this concept has been transferred to bosonic systems such as photons1 and phonons2, which propagate in materials patterned with artificial lattices that emulate spin-Hall physics. This work has been motivated, in part, by the prospect of topologically protected transport along edge channels in on-chip circuits2,3. In principle, topology protects propagation against backscattering, but not against loss, which has remained limited to the dB cm−1 level for phononic waveguides, whether topological4–7 or not8–19. Here we combine advanced dissipation engineering20—in particular, the recently introduced method of soft clamping21—with the concept of valley-Hall topological insulators for phonons22–26. This enables on-chip phononic waveguides with propagation losses due to dissipation of 3 dB km−1 at room temperature, orders of magnitude below any previous chip-scale devices. The low losses also allow us to accurately quantify backscattering protection in topological phononic waveguides, using high-resolution ultrasound spectroscopy. We infer that phonons follow a sharp, 120° bend with a 99.99% probability instead of being scattered back, and less than one phonon in a million is lost. Our work will inspire new research directions on ultralow-loss phononic waveguides and will provide a clean bosonic system for investigating topological protection and non-Hermitian topological physics. A substantial reduction of losses in a phononic waveguide can be achieved by soft clamping, through which phonons can be guided through very sharp turns with losses accounting for less than one phonon in a million.",

    "abstract": "Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is the most common somatic alteration in men and is associated with higher mortality from epithelial cancers1–3. In tumours, epithelial LOY is also associated with poor survival4–7. This raises several fundamental questions, such as why LOY in PBMCs drives cancer mortality and whether there is a relationship between LOY in PBMCs, PBMC-derived immune cells and cancer cells (and, if so, what its consequences are). We sought to answer these questions through a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data from 29 human tumour types, along with autochthonous and syngeneic mouse models. In human and mouse tumours, malignant epithelial cells had the highest LOY prevalence, yet LOY was also present in tumour stromal and immune cells, with LOY in malignant epithelial cells predicting LOY in benign cells. LOY also correlated between paired tumour and PBMC samples from patients. Among benign cells, LOY induced the strongest shift in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with both showing transcriptomic signatures of immunosuppression. Furthermore, the magnitude of LOY in epithelial cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells independently predicts survival, with tumours exhibiting concurrent epithelial and T cell LOY having the worst outcomes. Here we establish a model that links LOY in immune cells to LOY in malignant cells, which may explain in part why LOY in PBMCs is associated with increased cancer mortality. Comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) in benign and malignant cells establishes a new model linking LOY in circulating and tumour-infiltrating immune cells to LOY in malignant cells.",

    "abstract": "Midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) signal reward-prediction errors that teach recipient circuits about expected rewards1. However, DANs are thought to provide a substrate for temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning (RL), an algorithm that learns the mean of temporally discounted expected future rewards, discarding useful information about experienced distributions of reward amounts and delays2. Here we present time–magnitude RL (TMRL), a multidimensional variant of distributional RL that learns the joint distribution of future rewards over time and magnitude. We also uncover signatures of TMRL-like computations in the activity of optogenetically identified DANs in mice during behaviour. Specifically, we show that there is significant diversity in both temporal discounting and tuning for the reward magnitude across DANs. These features allow the computation of a two-dimensional, probabilistic map of future rewards from just 450 ms of the DAN population response to a reward-predictive cue. Furthermore, reward-time predictions derived from this code correlate with anticipatory behaviour, suggesting that similar information is used to guide decisions about when to act. Finally, by simulating behaviour in a foraging environment, we highlight the benefits of a joint probability distribution of reward over time and magnitude in the face of dynamic reward landscapes and internal states. These findings show that rich probabilistic reward information is learnt and communicated to DANs, and suggest a simple, local-in-time extension of TD algorithms that explains how such information might be acquired and computed. An algorithm called time–magnitude reinforcement learning (TMRL) extends distributional reinforcement learning to take account of reward time and magnitude, and behavioural and neurophysiological experiments in mice suggest that midbrain dopamine neurons use TMRL-like computations.",

    "abstract": "Supported metal catalysts that integrate atomically dispersed species with controlled structures lie at the forefront of catalytic materials design, offering exceptional control over reactivity and high metal utilization, approaching the precision of molecular systems1–3. However, accurately resolving the local metal coordination environments remains challenging, hindering the advancement of structure–activity relationships needed to optimize their design for diverse applications1,2. Although electron microscopy reveals atomic dispersion, conventional spectroscopic methods used in heterogeneous catalysis only provide average structural information. Here we demonstrate that 195Pt solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing atomically dispersed Pt sites on various supports, so called single-atom catalysts (SACs). Monte Carlo simulations allow the conversion of NMR spectra into SAC signatures that describe coordination environments with molecular precision, enabling quantitative assessment of Pt-site distribution and homogeneity. This methodology can track the influence of synthetic parameters, uncovering the impact of specific steps and support types, and can also monitor changes upon reaction. It offers critical insights for the reproducible development of SACs with targeted structures. Beyond SACs, this approach lays the foundation for studying more complex architectures, such as dual-atom or single-cluster catalysts, containing various NMR-active metals. This study presents a nuclear magnetic resonance-based method to determine local structure and bonding of Pt single-atom catalysts.",

    "abstract": "North Atlantic Ocean circulation and temperature patterns profoundly influence global and regional climate across all timescales, from synoptic1 to seasonal2–4, decadal5, multidecadal6,7 and beyond8,9. During 2023, an extreme and near-basin-scale marine heatwave developed during Northern Hemisphere summer, peaking in July. The warming spread across virtually all regions of the North Atlantic, including the subpolar ocean, where a cooling trend over the past 50–100 years has been linked to a slowdown in the meridional overturning circulation10,11. Yet the mechanisms that led to this exceptional surface ocean warming remain unclear. Here we use observationally constrained atmospheric reanalyses alongside ocean observations and model simulations to show that air–sea heat fluxes acting on an extremely shallow surface mixed layer, rather than anomalous ocean heat transport, were responsible for this extreme ocean warming event. The dominant driver is shown to be anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling (shallowing) mixed layers, resulting in a rapid temperature increase in a shallow surface layer of the North Atlantic. Furthermore, solar radiation anomalies made regional-scale warming contributions in locations that approximately correspond to some of the region’s main shipping lanes, suggesting that reduced sulfate emissions could also have played a localized role. With a trend towards shallower mixed layers observed over recent decades, and projections that this will continue into the future, the severity of North Atlantic marine heatwaves is set to worsen. Atmospheric reanalyses combined with ocean observations and model simulations show that the extreme 2023 North Atlantic heatwave was primarily driven by anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling mixed layers, with a smaller contribution from clearer skies.",

    "abstract": "Plants make complex and potent therapeutic molecules1,2, but sourcing these molecules from natural producers or through chemical synthesis is difficult, which limits their use in the clinic. A prominent example is the anti-cancer therapeutic paclitaxel (sold under the brand name Taxol), which is derived from yew trees (Taxus species)3. Identifying the full paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway would enable heterologous production of the drug, but this has yet to be achieved despite half a century of research4. Within Taxus’ large, enzyme-rich genome5, we suspected that the paclitaxel pathway would be difficult to resolve using conventional RNA-sequencing and co-expression analyses. Here, to improve the resolution of transcriptional analysis for pathway identification, we developed a strategy we term multiplexed perturbation × single nuclei (mpXsn) to transcriptionally profile cell states spanning tissues, cell types, developmental stages and elicitation conditions. Our data show that paclitaxel biosynthetic genes segregate into distinct expression modules that suggest consecutive subpathways. These modules resolved seven new genes, allowing a de novo 17-gene biosynthesis and isolation of baccatin III, the industrial precursor to Taxol, in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, at levels comparable with the natural abundance in Taxus needles. Notably, we found that a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like protein, FoTO1, is crucial for promoting the formation of the desired product during the first oxidation, resolving a long-standing bottleneck in paclitaxel pathway reconstitution. Together with a new β-phenylalanine-CoA ligase, the eight genes discovered here enable the de novo biosynthesis of 3’-N-debenzoyl-2’-deoxypaclitaxel. More broadly, we establish a generalizable approach to efficiently scale the power of co-expression analysis to match the complexity of large, uncharacterized genomes, facilitating the discovery of high-value gene sets. An approach that combines single-nucleus RNA sequencing and multiplexed perturbation identifies genes that enable the biosynthesis of direct precursors of the anti-cancer drug Taxol, whose current production involves a laborious extraction process from yew trees.",

    "abstract": "Lipids are essential components of cancer cells due to their structural and signalling roles1. To meet metabolic demands, many cancers take up extracellular lipids2–5; however, how these lipids contribute to cancer growth and progression remains poorly understood. Here, using functional genetic screens, we identify uptake of lipoproteins—the primary mechanism for lipid transport in circulation—as a key determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer. Lipoprotein supplementation robustly inhibits ferroptosis across diverse cancer types, primarily through the delivery of α-tocopherol (α-toc), the most abundant form of vitamin E in human lipoproteins. Mechanistically, cancer cells take up lipoproteins through a pathway dependent on sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to cell-surface proteoglycans. Disrupting GAG biosynthesis or acutely degrading surface GAGs reduces lipoprotein uptake, sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis and impairs tumour growth in mice. Notably, human clear cell renal cell carcinomas—a lipid-rich malignancy—exhibit elevated levels of chondroitin sulfate and increased lipoprotein-derived α-toc compared with normal kidney tissue. Together, our study establishes lipoprotein uptake as a critical anti-ferroptotic mechanism in cancer and implicates GAG biosynthesis as a therapeutic target. Lipoprotein uptake dependent on sulfated glycosaminoglycans linked to cell-surface proteoglycans is a key determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Until now, computationally designed enzymes exhibited low catalytic rates1–5 and required intensive experimental optimization to reach activity levels observed in comparable natural enzymes5–9. These results exposed limitations in design methodology and suggested critical gaps in our understanding of the fundamentals of biocatalysis10,11. We present a fully computational workflow for designing efficient enzymes in TIM-barrel folds using backbone fragments from natural proteins and without requiring optimization by mutant-library screening. Three Kemp eliminase designs exhibit efficiencies greater than 2,000 M−1 s−1. The most efficient shows more than 140 mutations from any natural protein, including a novel active site. It exhibits high stability (greater than 85 °C) and remarkable catalytic efficiency (12,700 M−1 s−1) and rate (2.8 s−1), surpassing previous computational designs by two orders of magnitude1–5. Furthermore, designing a residue considered essential in all previous Kemp eliminase designs increases efficiency to more than 105 M−1 s−1 and rate to 30 s−1, achieving catalytic parameters comparable to natural enzymes and challenging fundamental biocatalytic assumptions. By overcoming limitations in design methodology11, our strategy enables programming stable, high-efficiency, new-to-nature enzymes through a minimal experimental effort. We present a computational approach to the design of high-efficiency enzymes with catalytic parameters comparable to natural enzymes, enabling programming of stable, high-efficiency, new-to-nature Kemp elimination enzymes through minimal experimental effort.",

    "abstract": "Modern colour image sensors face challenges in further improving sensitivity and image quality because of inherent limitations in light utilization efficiency1. A major factor contributing to these limitations is the use of passive optical filters, which absorb and dissipate a substantial amount of light, thereby reducing the efficiency of light capture2. On the contrary, active optical filtering in Foveon-type vertically stacked architectures still struggles to deliver optimal performance owing to their lack of colour selectivity, making them inefficient for precise colour imaging3. Here we introduce an innovative architecture for colour sensor arrays that uses multilayer monolithically stacked lead halide perovskite thin-film photodetectors. Perovskite bandgap tunability4 is utilized to selectively absorb the visible light spectrum’s red, green and blue regions, eliminating the need for colour filters. External quantum efficiencies of 50%, 47% and 53% are demonstrated for the red, green and blue channels, respectively, as well as a colour accuracy of 3.8% in ΔELab outperforming the state-of-the-art colour-filter array and Foveon-type photosensors. The image sensor design improves light utilization in colour sensors and paves the way for the next generation of highly sensitive, artefact-free images with enhanced colour fidelity. A colour sensor array based on multilayer monolithically stacked lead halide perovskite thin-film photodetectors achieves higher quantum efficiency and superior colour accuracy compared to conventional filter-based image sensors.",

    "abstract": "Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) persistently infects more than 90% of the human population, causing infectious mononucleosis1, susceptibility to autoimmune diseases2 and multiple malignancies of epithelial or B cell-origin3. EBV infects epithelial cells and B cells through interaction between viral glycoproteins and different host receptors4, but it has remained unknown whether a common receptor mediates infection of its two major host cell targets. Here, we establish R9AP as a crucial EBV receptor for entry into epithelial and B cells. R9AP silencing or knockout, R9AP-derived peptide and R9AP monoclonal antibody each significantly inhibit, whereas R9AP overexpression promotes, EBV uptake into both cell types. R9AP binds directly to the EBV glycoprotein gH/gL complex to initiate gH/gL–gB-mediated membrane fusion. Notably, the interaction of R9AP with gH/gL is inhibited by the highly competitive gH/gL-neutralizing antibody AMMO1, which blocks EBV epithelial and B cell entry. Moreover, R9AP mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion in cooperation with EBV gp42–human leukocyte antigen class II or gH/gL–EPHA2 complexes in B cells or epithelial cells, respectively. We propose R9AP as the crucial common receptor of B cells and epithelial cells and a potential prophylactic and vaccine target for EBV. R9AP is a key receptor for entry of Epstein–Barr virus into human epithelial and B cells, and interacts directly with the viral glycoprotein gH/gL complex to mediate virus–host membrane fusion.",

    "abstract": "All contemporary Eurasians trace most of their ancestry to a small population that dispersed out of Africa about 50,000 years ago (ka)1–9. By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa10–15. These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000 years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70 ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50 ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success. Analysis of species distribution models in a pan-African database comprising chronometrically dated archaeological sites over the past 120,000 years shows major expansion in the human niche from 70 ka, driven by adaptation to diverse habitats.",

    "abstract": "Planets are thought to form from dust and gas in protoplanetary disks, with debris disks being the remnants of planet formation. Aged a few million up to a few billion years, debris disks have lost their primordial gas, and their dust is produced by steady-state collisions between larger, rocky bodies1,2. Tens of debris disks, with sizes of tens, sometimes hundreds, of astronomical units have been resolved with high-spatial-resolution, high-contrast imagers at optical and near-infrared or (sub)millimetre interferometers3,4. They commonly show cavities, ring-like structures and gaps, which are often regarded as indirect signatures of the presence of planets that gravitationally interact with unseen planetesimals2,5. However, no planet responsible for these features has been detected yet, probably because of the limited sensitivity (typically 2–10 MJ) of high-contrast imaging instruments (see, for example, refs. 6–9) before the James Webb Space Telescope. Here we have used the unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope’s Mid-Infrared Instrument10,11 in the thermal infrared to search for such planets in the disk of the approximately 6.4-Myr-old star TWA 7. With its pole-on orientation, this three-ring debris disk is indeed ideally suited for such a detection. We unambiguously detected a source 1.5 arcsec from the star, which is best interpreted as a cold, sub-Jupiter-mass planet. Its estimated mass (about 0.3 MJ) and position (about 52 au, de-projected) can thoroughly account for the main disk structures. Using the James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument, a study reports evidence for a direct detection of a cold, sub-Jupiter-mass planet in the disk of the star TWA 7.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) enables customized chemistry to tailor protein functions1–3. Genetic code expansion offers a general approach for ncAA encoding by reassigning stop codons as the ‘blank’ codon; however, it is not completely orthogonal to translation termination for cellular transcripts. Here, to generate more bona fide blank codons, we developed an RNA codon-expansion (RCE) strategy that introduces and decodes bioorthogonally assignable pseudouridine (Ψ) codons (ΨGA, ΨAA or ΨAG) on specified mRNA transcripts to incorporate ncAAs in mammalian cells. The RCE strategy comprises a programmable guide RNA4, an engineered decoder tRNA, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. We first developed the RCE(ΨGA) system, which incorporates functional ncAAs into proteins via the ΨGA codon, demonstrating a higher translatome-wide and proteomic specificity compared with the genetic code expansion system. We further expanded our strategy to produce the RCE(ΨAA) and RCE(ΨAG) systems, with all three Ψ codon:(Ψ codon)-tRNAPyl pairs exhibiting mutual orthogonality. Moreover, we demonstrated that the RCE system cooperates compatibly with the genetic code expansion strategy for dual ncAA encoding. In sum, the RCE method utilized Ψ as a post-transcriptional ‘letter’ to encode and decode RNA codons in specific mRNA transcripts, opening a new route for genetic alphabet expansion and site-specific ncAA incorporation in eukaryotic cells. An RNA codon-expansion strategy enables incorporation of non-canonical amino acids into proteins of interest orthogonally to existing methods by inserting pseudouridine codons into specific mRNA transcripts and using an engineered decoder tRNA.",

    "abstract": "The global crisis of plastic waste accumulation threatens wildlife and ecosystems1. Catalytic processes that convert plastic waste into valuable chemicals and fuels offer promising solutions2. Recycling or upcycling of real-life plastic mixtures is challenging owing to their diverse composition and structure3. Here we propose a product-oriented strategy leveraging the orthogonality in reactivities of different functional groups in plastic mixtures to yield valuable products. This approach involves identifying functional groups followed by converting a selective component in the mixture to valuable products. We use mixtures of polystyrene, polylactic acid, polyurethane, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as real-life plastics, to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The diverse physical and chemical properties of these components, which typically hinder direct recovery, offer opportunities for extraction and transformation with the proposed strategy. From a 20-g mixture of real-life plastics, including polystyrene foam, a polylactic acid straw, a polyurethane tube, a polycarbonate mask, a polyvinyl chloride bag, a polyethylene terephthalate bottle, a polyethylene dropper and a polypropylene bottle, we obtained more than 8 separate chemicals: 1.3 g of benzoic acid, 0.5 g of plasticizer, 0.7 g of alanine, 0.7 g of lactic acid, 1.4 g of aromatic amine salt, 2.1 g of bisphenol A, 2.0 g of terephthalic acid and 3.5 g of C3–C6 alkanes. This study reveals the potential for designing transformation strategies for complex plastic waste based on their chemical nature and opens paths for managing end-of-life plastic mixtures. A product-oriented strategy that leverages the reactivities of different functional groups in real-life plastic mixtures can be used to obtain valuable products, opening a path for managing end-of-life plastic mixtures.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic onset is a critical transition for eukaryotic cell proliferation. The commonly held view of mitotic control is that the master regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), is first activated in the cytoplasm, at the centrosome, initiating mitosis1–3. Bistability in CDK activation ensures that the transition is irreversible, but how this unfolds in a spatially compartmentalized cell is unknown4–8. Here, using fission yeast, we show that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, and that the bistable responses differ markedly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a stronger response in the nucleus driving mitotic signal propagation from there to the cytoplasm. Abolishing cyclin–CDK localization to the centrosome led to activation occurring only in the nucleus, spatially uncoupling the nucleus and cytoplasm mitotically, suggesting that centrosomal cyclin–CDK acts as a ‘signal relayer’. We propose that the key mitotic regulatory system operates in the nucleus in proximity to DNA, which enables incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage to be effectively monitored to preserve genome integrity and to integrate ploidy within the CDK control network. This spatiotemporal regulatory framework establishes core principles for control of the onset of mitosis and highlights that the CDK control system operates within distinct regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Experiments in fission yeast show that cyclin-dependent kinase is first activated in the nucleus, from which the mitotic signal is propagated from CDK at the centrosome to the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "A key virtue of spin qubits is their sub-micron footprint, enabling a single silicon chip to host the millions of qubits required to execute useful quantum algorithms with error correction1–3. However, with each physical qubit needing multiple control lines, a fundamental barrier to scale is the extreme density of connections that bridge quantum devices to their external control and readout hardware4–6. A promising solution is to co-locate the control system proximal to the qubit platform at milli-kelvin temperatures, wired up by miniaturized interconnects7–10. Even so, heat and crosstalk from closely integrated control have the potential to degrade qubit performance, particularly for two-qubit entangling gates based on exchange coupling that are sensitive to electrical noise11,12. Here we benchmark silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-style electron spin qubits controlled by heterogeneously integrated cryo-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cryo-CMOS) circuits with a power density sufficiently low to enable scale-up. Demonstrating that cryo-CMOS can efficiently perform universal logic operations for spin qubits, we go on to show that milli-kelvin control has little impact on the performance of single- and two-qubit gates. Given the complexity of our sub-kelvin CMOS platform, with about 100,000 transistors, these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a ‘chiplet-style’ control architecture. CMOS-based circuits can be integrated with silicon-based spin qubits and can be controlled at milli-kelvin temperatures, which can potentially help scale up these systems.",

    "abstract": "Postmitotic neurons have high levels of methylated cytosine and its oxidized intermediates such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine1. However, the functional relevance of these epigenetic modifications of DNA are poorly understood. Here we show that some cytidine analogues, such as cytarabine, cause DNA double-strand breaks during TET-mediated active 5-methylcytosine demethylation by interrupting TDG-dependent base excision repair. These double-strand breaks are frequently converted into deletions and translocations by DNA ligase 4. In vivo, Purkinje and Golgi cells in the cerebellum are the only neuronal populations that exhibit high levels of DNA damage due to cytarabine. In Purkinje cells, TET targets highly expressed gene bodies marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. Many of these genes control movement coordination, which explains the long-recognized cerebellar neurotoxicity of cytarabine2. We show that other cytidine analogues, such as gemcitabine, cause only single-strand breaks in neurons, which are repaired by DNA ligase 3 with minimal toxicity. Our findings uncover a mechanistic link between TET-mediated DNA demethylation, base excision repair and gene expression in neurons. The results also provide a rational explanation for the different neurotoxicity profiles of an important class of antineoplastic agents. Certain antimetabolites used to treat cancer are more neurotoxic than others, and it is now shown that this is due to their greater tendency to generate DNA double-stranded breaks, whereas less neurotoxic agents induce single-stranded breaks.",

    "abstract": "Achieving highly ordered and uniformly covered self-assembly monolayers (SAMs) with optimal packing configuration on textured silicon substrates remains a critical challenge for further improving the efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs)1-3. Here we design an asymmetric SAM (named as HTL201) featuring anchoring group and spacer flanking a carbazole core, serving as hole selective layer (HSL) for perovskite/silicon TSCs. When compared to symmetric SAMs with nitrogen-bonded phosphonic acid group, the HTL201 molecule exhibits minimized steric hindrance and improved coverage on the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) recombination layer. The strong coordination interaction between HTL201 and perovskite film effectively reduces non-radiative recombination at buried interface. Notably, the optimized energy level alignment between perovskite and HTL201, accompanied by an increase in quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) value of the perovskite layer, enables an impressive voltage of nearly 2 V for perovskite/silicon TSCs, resulting in a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 34.58% based on a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, ancient protein sequences have emerged as a valuable source of data for deep-time phylogenetic inference1–4. Still, even though ancient proteins have been reported from the Middle–Late Miocene5,6, the recovery of protein sequences providing subordinal-level phylogenetic insights does not exceed 3.7 million years ago (Pliocene)1. Here, we push this boundary back to 21–24 million years ago (Early Miocene) by retrieving enamel protein sequences of a rhinocerotid (Epiaceratherium sp.; CMNFV59632) from Canada’s High Arctic. We recover partial sequences of seven enamel proteins and more than 1,000 peptide–spectrum matches, spanning at least 251 amino acids. Endogeneity is in line with thermal age estimates and is supported by indicators of protein damage, including several spontaneous and irreversible chemical modifications accumulated during prolonged diagenesis. Bayesian tip-dating places the divergence time of CMNFV59632 in the Middle Eocene–Oligocene, coinciding with a phase of high rhinocerotid diversification7. This analysis identifies a later Oligocene divergence for Elasmotheriinae, weakening alternative models suggesting a deep basal split between Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae8,9. The findings are consistent with hypotheses on the origin of the enigmatic fauna of the Haughton Crater, which, in spite of considerable endemism, has similarity to distant Eurasian faunas10,11. Our findings demonstrate the potential of palaeoproteomics in obtaining phylogenetic information from a specimen that is approximately ten times older than any sample from which endogenous DNA has been obtained so far. Protein sequences from fossil tooth enamel of a rhinocerotid from Canada’s High Arctic are used to develop phylogenetic frameworks from a specimen too old to preserve ancient DNA.",

    "abstract": "Plastic pollution is a pervasive and growing global problem1–4. Chemicals in plastics are often not sufficiently considered in the overall strategy to prevent and mitigate the impacts of plastics on human health, the environment and circular economy5–7. Here we present an inventory of 16,325 known plastic chemicals with a focus on their properties, presence in plastic and hazards. We find that diverse chemical structures serve a small set of functions, including 5,776 additives, 3,498 processing aids, 1,975 starting substances and 1,788 non-intentionally added substances. Using a hazard-based approach, we identify more than 4,200 chemicals of concern, which are persistent, bioaccumulative, mobile or toxic. We also determine 15 priority groups of chemicals, for which more than 40% of their members are of concern. Finally, we examine data gaps regarding the basic properties, hazards, uses and exposure potential of plastic chemicals. Our work maps the chemical landscape of plastics and contributes to setting the baseline for a transition towards safer and more sustainable materials and products. We propose that removing known chemicals of concern, disclosing the chemical composition and simplifying the formulation of plastics can provide pathways towards this goal. An inventory of 16,325 known plastic chemicals, including >4,200 hazardous compounds, supports the development of safer plastics.",

    "abstract": "Cross-species transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs) poses a serious threat to both animal and human health1–3. While the large RNA genome of CoVs shows relatively low mutation rates, recombination within genera is frequently observed4–7. Companion animals are often overlooked in the transmission cycle of viral diseases; however, the close relationship of feline (FCoV) and canine CoV (CCoV) to human hCoV-229E5,8, as well as the susceptibility of these animals to SARS-CoV-29, highlight their importance in potential transmission cycles. While recombination between CCoV and FCoV of a large fragment spanning orf1b to M has been previously described5,10, here we report the emergence of a highly pathogenic FCoV–CCoV recombinant responsible for a rapidly spreading outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) originating in Cyprus11. The minor recombinant region, spanning spike (S), shows 96.5% sequence identity to the pantropic canine coronavirus NA/09. Infection has rapidly spread, infecting cats of all ages. Development of FIP appears to be very frequent and sequence identities of samples from cats in different districts of the island are strongly supportive of direct transmission. A near-cat-specific deletion in the domain 0 of S is present in more than 90% of cats with FIP. It is unclear as yet whether this deletion is directly associated with disease development, and it may be linked to a biotype switch12. The domain 0 deletion and several amino acid changes in S, particularly the receptor-binding domain, indicate potential changes to receptor binding and cell tropism. The emergence of a highly pathogenic FCoV–CCoV recombinant is responsible for a rapidly spreading outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis originating in Cyprus.",

    "abstract": "Optically active spin defects in solids1,2 are leading candidates for quantum sensing3,4 and quantum networking5,6. Recently, single spin defects were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)7–11, a layered van der Waals (vdW) material. Owing to its two-dimensional structure, hBN allows spin defects to be positioned closer to target samples than in three-dimensional crystals, making it ideal for atomic-scale quantum sensing12, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single molecules. However, the chemical structures of these defects7–11 remain unknown and detecting a single nuclear spin with a hBN spin defect has been elusive. Here we report the creation of single spin defects in hBN using 13C ion implantation and the identification of three distinct defect types based on hyperfine interactions. We observed both S = 1/2 and S = 1 spin states within a single hBN spin defect. We demonstrated atomic-scale NMR and coherent control of individual nuclear spins in a vdW material, with a π-gate fidelity up to 99.75% at room temperature. By comparing experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose chemical structures for these spin defects. Our work advances the understanding of single spin defects in hBN and provides a pathway to enhance quantum sensing using hBN spin defects with nuclear spins as quantum memories. The detection and coherent control of single 13C nuclear spins in hexagonal boron nitride at room temperature enables the use of van der Waals materials in upcoming quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Lunar mare basalts illuminate the nature of the Moon’s mantle, the lunar compositional asymmetry and the early lunar magma ocean (LMO)1–3. However, the characteristics of the mantle beneath the vast South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin on the lunar farside remain a mystery. Here we present the petrology and geochemistry of basalt fragments from Chang’e-6 (CE6), the first returned lunar farside samples from the SPA basin4–7. These 2.8-billion-year-old CE6 basalts8 share similar major element compositions with the most evolved Apollo 12 ilmenite basalts. They exhibit extreme Sr–Nd depletion, with initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.699237 to 0.699329 and εNd(t) values (a measure of the neodymium isotopic composition) of 15.80 to 16.13. These characteristics indicate an ultra-depleted mantle, resulting from LMO crystallization and/or later depletion by melt extraction. The former scenario implies that the nearside and farside may possess an isotopically analogous depleted mantle endmember. The latter is probably related to the SPA impact, indicating that post-accretion massive impacts could have potentially triggered large-scale melt extraction of the underlying mantle. Either way, originating during the LMO or later melt extraction, the ultra-depleted mantle beneath the SPA basin offers a deep observational window into early lunar crust–mantle differentiation. Extreme Sr–Nd depletion in 2.8-billion-year-old basalt fragments from the lunar farside South Pole–Aitken basin suggests an ultra-depleted mantle source resulting from lunar magma ocean crystallization and/or later impact-related melt extraction.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota influence the antitumour efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade1–6, but the mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that a new strain of the bacterial genus Hominenteromicrobium (designated YB328) isolated from the faeces of patients who responded to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade augmented antitumour responses in mice. YB328 activated tumour-specific CD8+ T cells through the stimulation of CD103+CD11b− conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which, following exposure in the gut, migrated to the tumour microenvironment. Mice showed improved antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade when treated with faecal transplants from non-responder patients supplemented with YB238. This result suggests that YB328 could function in a dominant manner. YB328-activated CD103+CD11b− cDCs showed prolonged engagement with tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and promoted PD-1 expression in these cells. Moreover, YB238-augmented antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade treatment was observed in multiple mouse models of cancer. Patients with elevated YB328 abundance had increased infiltration of CD103+CD11b− cDCs in tumours and had a favourable response to PD-1 blockade therapy in various cancer types. We propose that gut microbiota enhance antitumour immunity by accelerating the maturation and migration of CD103+CD11b− cDCs to increase the number of CD8+ T cells that respond to diverse tumour antigens. A newly identified bacterial strain (YB328) isolated from the faeces of patients who responded to immune checkpoint blockade therapies can promote antitumour immunity through the activation of tumour-specific CD8+ T cells.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is the main underlying cause of cardiovascular diseases. Its prevention is based on the detection and treatment of traditional cardiovascular risk factors1. However, individuals at risk for early vascular disease often remain unidentified2. Recent research has identified new molecules in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis3, highlighting the need for alternative disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve early diagnosis and therapy efficacy. Here, we observed that imidazole propionate (ImP), produced by microorganisms, is associated with the extent of atherosclerosis in mice and in two independent human cohorts. Furthermore, ImP administration to atherosclerosis-prone mice fed with chow diet was sufficient to induce atherosclerosis without altering the lipid profile, and was linked to activation of both systemic and local innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. Specifically, we found that ImP caused atherosclerosis through the imidazoline-1 receptor (I1R, also known as nischarin) in myeloid cells. Blocking this ImP–I1R axis inhibited the development of atherosclerosis induced by ImP or high-cholesterol diet in mice. Identification of the strong association of ImP with active atherosclerosis and the contribution of the ImP–I1R axis to disease progression opens new avenues for improving the early diagnosis and personalized therapy of atherosclerosis. Imidazole propionate produced by gut microbiota is associated with atherosclerosis in mouse models and in humans, and causes the development of atherosclerosis through activation of the imidazoline-1 receptor in myeloid cells.",

The first high-temperature minerals to recondense from this gaseous reservoir start the clock on planet formation3,4. However, the production mechanism of this initial hot gas and its importance to planet formation in other systems are unclear. Here we report the astronomical detection of this t = 0 moment, capturing the building blocks of a new planetary system beginning its assembly. The young protostar HOPS-315 is observed at infrared and millimetre wavelengths with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), revealing a reservoir of warm silicon monoxide gas and crystalline silicate minerals low in the atmosphere of a disk within 2.2 au of the star, physically isolated from the millimetre SiO jet. Comparison with condensation models with rapid grain growth and disk structure models suggests the formation of refractory solids analogous to those in our Solar System. Our results indicate that the environment in the inner disk region is influenced by sublimation of interstellar solids and subsequent refractory solid recondensation from this gas reservoir on timescales comparable with refractory condensation in our own Solar System. Observations at infrared and millimetre wavelengths of the young protostar HOPS-315 show a gaseous disk captured at the point at which solids are first starting to condense, the t = 0 for planet formation.",

    "abstract": "Diverse sets of complete human genomes are required to construct a pangenome reference and to understand the extent of complex structural variation. Here we sequence 65 diverse human genomes and build 130 haplotype-resolved assemblies (median continuity of 130 Mb), closing 92% of all previous assembly gaps1,2 and reaching telomere-to-telomere status for 39% of the chromosomes. We highlight complete sequence continuity of complex loci, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), SMN1/SMN2, NBPF8 and AMY1/AMY2, and fully resolve 1,852 complex structural variants. In addition, we completely assemble and validate 1,246 human centromeres. We find up to 30-fold variation in α-satellite higher-order repeat array length and characterize the pattern of mobile element insertions into α-satellite higher-order repeat arrays. Although most centromeres predict a single site of kinetochore attachment, epigenetic analysis suggests the presence of two hypomethylated regions for 7% of centromeres. Combining our data with the draft pangenome reference1 significantly enhances genotyping accuracy from short-read data, enabling whole-genome inference3 to a median quality value of 45. Using this approach, 26,115 structural variants per individual are detected, substantially increasing the number of structural variants now amenable to downstream disease association studies. Using sequencing and haplotype-resolved assembly of 65 diverse human genomes, complex regions including the major histocompatibility complex and centromeres are analysed.",

    "abstract": "In their landmark study1, Fecht and Johnson unveiled a phenomenon that they termed the ‘entropy catastrophe’, a critical point where the entropy of superheated crystals equates to that of their liquid counterparts. This point marks the uppermost stability boundary for solids at temperatures typically around three times their melting point. Despite the theoretical prediction of this ultimate stability threshold, its practical exploration has been prevented by numerous intermediate destabilizing events, colloquially known as a hierarchy of catastrophes2–5, which occur at far lower temperatures. Here we experimentally test this limit under ultrafast heating conditions, directly tracking the lattice temperature by using high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering. Our gold samples are heated to temperatures over 14 times their melting point while retaining their crystalline structure, far surpassing the predicted threshold and suggesting a substantially higher or potentially no limit for superheating. We point to the inability of our samples to expand on these very short timescales as an important difference from previous estimates. These observations provide insights into the dynamics of melting under extreme conditions. Gold samples can be heated to more than 14 times their melting point while retaining their crystalline structure, far surpassing the predicted entropy catastrophe threshold and suggesting a substantially higher or potentially no limit for superheating.",

    "abstract": "Neutrinos are elementary particles that interact only very weakly with matter. Neutrino experiments are, therefore, usually big, with masses in the multi-tonne range. The thresholdless interaction of coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos on atomic nuclei leads to greatly enhanced interaction rates, which allows for much smaller detectors. The study of this process gives insights into physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The CONUS+ experiment1 was designed to first detect elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering in the fully coherent regime with low-energy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors. For this purpose, semiconductor detectors based on high-purity germanium crystals with extremely low-energy thresholds were developed2. Here we report the first observation of a neutrino signal with a statistical significance of 3.7σ from the CONUS+ experiment, operated at the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland. In 119 days of reactor operation (395 ± 106) neutrinos were measured compared with a predicted number from calculations assuming Standard Model physics of (347 ± 59) events. With increased precision, there is potential for fundamental discoveries in the future. The CONUS+ results in combination with other measurements of this interaction channel might therefore mark a starting point for a new era in neutrino physics. Direct observation of coherent elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering is reported using the data from the CONUS+ experiment in which the antineutrinos with energy less than 10 MeV are produced in a nuclear reactor.",

    "abstract": "Mouse lemurs are the smallest and fastest reproducing primates, as well as one of the most abundant, and they are emerging as a model organism for primate biology, behaviour, health and conservation. Although much has been learnt about their ecology and phylogeny in Madagascar and their physiology, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet-based and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing to create Tabula Microcebus, a transcriptomic atlas of 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs opportunistically obtained from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration and expert cell annotation, we define and biologically organize more than 750 lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. This includes cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and differentiating cells along the developmental trajectories of spermatogenesis, haematopoiesis and other adult tissues. We also describe dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types. We globally compare expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explore primate cell and gene expression evolution by comparing lemur transcriptomes to those of human, mouse and macaque. This reveals cell-type-specific patterns of primate specialization and many cell types and genes for which the mouse lemur provides a better human model than mouse1. The atlas provides a cellular and molecular foundation for studying this model primate and establishes a general approach for characterizing other emerging model organisms. Together with a companion paper, the generation of a transcriptomic atlas for the mouse lemur and analyses of example cell types establish this animal as a molecularly tractable primate model organism.",

    "abstract": "Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are an emerging primate model organism, but their genetics, cellular and molecular biology remain largely unexplored. In an accompanying paper1, we performed large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing of 27 organs from mouse lemurs. We identified more than 750 molecular cell types, characterized their transcriptomic profiles and provided insight into primate evolution of cell types. Here we use the generated atlas to characterize mouse lemur genes, physiology, disease and mutations. We uncover thousands of previously unidentified lemur genes and hundreds of thousands of new splice junctions including over 85,000 primate splice junctions missing in mice. We systematically explore the lemur immune system by comparing global expression profiles of key immune genes in health and disease, and by mapping immune cell development, trafficking and activation. We characterize primate-specific and lemur-specific physiology and disease, including molecular features of the immune program, lemur adipocytes and metastatic endometrial cancer that resembles the human malignancy. We present expression patterns of more than 400 primate genes missing in mice, many with similar expression patterns to humans and some implicated in human disease. Finally, we provide an experimental framework for reverse genetic analysis by identifying naturally occurring nonsense mutations in three primate immune genes missing in mice and by analysing their transcriptional phenotypes. This work establishes a foundation for molecular and genetic analyses of mouse lemurs and prioritizes primate genes, isoforms, physiology and disease for future study. Together with an accompanying paper presenting a transcriptomic atlas of the mouse lemur, interrogation of the atlas provides a rich body of data to support the use of the organism as a model for primate biology and health.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally, with most deaths caused by metastatic disease, often following long periods of clinical dormancy1. Understanding the mechanisms that disrupt the quiescence of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) is crucial for addressing metastatic progression. Infections caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 trigger both local and systemic inflammation2,3. Here we demonstrate, in mice, that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast DCCs in the lung, causing DCC proliferation within days of infection and a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions within two weeks. These phenotypic transitions and expansions are interleukin-6 dependent. We show that DCCs impair lung T cell activation and that CD4+ T cells sustain the pulmonary metastatic burden after the influenza infection by inhibiting CD8+ T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Crucially, these experimental findings align with human observational data. Analyses of cancer survivors from the UK Biobank (all cancers) and Flatiron Health (breast cancer) databases reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increases the risk of cancer-related mortality and lung metastasis compared with uninfected cancer survivors. These discoveries underscore the huge impact of respiratory viral infections on metastatic cancer resurgence, offering new insights into the connection between infectious diseases and cancer metastasis. Mouse models show that respiratory infections from viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 can trigger metastasis of dormant breast cancer cells in the lungs, a finding supported by epidemiological data from two large human cohorts.",

    "abstract": "The earliest molecular changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are poorly understood1–5. Here we show that endogenous lithium (Li) is dynamically regulated in the brain and contributes to cognitive preservation during ageing. Of the metals we analysed, Li was the only one that was significantly reduced in the brain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD. Li bioavailability was further reduced in AD by amyloid sequestration. We explored the role of endogenous Li in the brain by depleting it from the diet of wild-type and AD mouse models. Reducing endogenous cortical Li by approximately 50% markedly increased the deposition of amyloid-β and the accumulation of phospho-tau, and led to pro-inflammatory microglial activation, the loss of synapses, axons and myelin, and accelerated cognitive decline. These effects were mediated, at least in part, through activation of the kinase GSK3β. Single-nucleus RNA-seq showed that Li deficiency gives rise to transcriptome changes in multiple brain cell types that overlap with transcriptome changes in AD. Replacement therapy with lithium orotate, which is a Li salt with reduced amyloid binding, prevents pathological changes and memory loss in AD mouse models and ageing wild-type mice. These findings reveal physiological effects of endogenous Li in the brain and indicate that disruption of Li homeostasis may be an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Li replacement with amyloid-evading salts is a potential approach to the prevention and treatment of AD. Lithium has an essential role in the brain and is deficient early in Alzheimer’s disease, which can be recapitulated in mice and treated with a novel lithium salt that restores the physiological level.",

    "abstract": "Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) create massive protein sequence variation (up to 1030)1 in ecologically diverse microorganisms. A recent survey identified around 31,000 DGRs from more than 1,500 bacterial and archaeal genera, constituting more than 90 environment types2. DGRs are especially enriched in the human gut microbiome2,3 and nano-sized microorganisms that seem to comprise most microbial life and maintain DGRs despite reduced genomes4,5. DGRs are also implicated in the emergence of multicellularity6,7. Variation occurs during reverse transcription of a protein-encoding RNA template coupled to misincorporation at adenosines. In the prototypical Bordetella bacteriophage DGR, the template must be surrounded by upstream and downstream RNA segments for complementary DNA synthesis to be carried out by a complex of the DGR reverse transcriptase bRT and associated protein Avd. The function of the surrounding RNA was unknown. Here we show through cryogenic electron microscopy that this RNA envelops bRT and lies over the barrel-shaped Avd, forming an intimate ribonucleoprotein. An abundance of essential interactions in the ribonucleoprotein precisely position an RNA homoduplex in the bRT active site for initiation of reverse transcription. Our results explain how the surrounding RNA primes complementary DNA synthesis, promotes processivity, terminates polymerization and strictly limits mutagenesis to specific proteins through mechanisms that are probably conserved in DGRs belonging to distant taxa. This study presents cryogenic electron microscopy structural analysis of a diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) reverse transcription system from Bordetella bacteriophage, with results indicating that RNA surrounding the template controls reverse transcription through mechanisms that are conserved across distant taxa.",

    "abstract": "A particle current generated by pumping in the absence of gradients in potential energy, density or temperature1 is associated with non-trivial dynamics. A representative example is charge pumping that is associated with the quantum Hall effect2 and the quantum anomalous Hall effect3. Spin pumping, the spin equivalent of charge pumping, refers to the emission of a spin current by magnetization dynamics4–7. Previous studies have focused solely on transversal spin pumping arising from classical dynamics, which corresponds to precessing atomic moments with constant magnitude. However, longitudinal spin pumping arising from quantum fluctuations, which correspond to a temporal change in the atomic moment’s magnitude, remains unexplored. Here we experimentally investigate longitudinal spin pumping using iron–rhodium (FeRh), which undergoes a first-order antiferromagnet-to-ferromagnet phase transition during which the atomic moment’s magnitude varies over time. By injecting a charge current into a FeRh/platinum bilayer, we induce a rapid phase transition of FeRh in nanoseconds, leading to the emission of a spin current to the platinum layer. The observed inverse spin Hall signal is about one order of magnitude larger than expected for transversal spin pumping, suggesting the presence of longitudinal spin pumping driven by quantum fluctuations and indicating its superiority over classical transversal spin pumping. Our result highlights the significance of quantum fluctuations in spin pumping and holds broad applicability in diverse angular momentum dynamics, such as laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization8, orbital pumping9,10 and quantum spin transfer11–13. Longitudinal spin pumping is experimentally demonstrated using the magnetic phase transition of iron–rhodium, and the observed inverse spin Hall signal indicates that longitudinal spin pumping is driven by quantum fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages use diverse mechanisms to evade antiphage defence systems. ΦKZ-like jumbo phages assemble a proteinaceous, nucleus-like compartment that excludes antagonistic host nucleases and also internalizes DNA replication and transcription machinery1–4. The phage factors required for protein import and the mechanisms of selectivity remain unknown, however. Here we uncover an import system comprising proteins highly conserved across nucleus-forming phages, together with additional cargo-specific contributors. Using a genetic selection that forces the phage to decrease or abolish the import of specific proteins, we determine that the importation of five different phage nuclear-localized proteins requires distinct interfaces of the same factor, Imp1 (gp69). Imp1 localizes early to the nascent phage nucleus and forms discrete puncta in the mature phage nuclear periphery, probably in complex with direct interactor Imp6 (gp67), a conserved protein encoded in the same locus. The import of certain proteins, including a host topoisomerase, additionally requires Imp3 (gp59), a conserved factor necessary for proper Imp1 function. Three additional non-conserved phage proteins (Imp2 and Imp4/Imp5) are required for the import of two queried nuclear cargos (nuclear-localized protein 1 and host topoisomerase, respectively), perhaps acting as specific adaptors. We therefore propose a core import system that includes Imp1, Imp3 and Imp6, with multiple interfaces of Imp1 licensing transport through a protein lattice. This study uncovers a highly conserved jumbo phage protein, Imp1, that possesses multiple interfaces to license protein import into a proteinaceous nucleus-like compartment, using a genetic selection that forces the phage to decrease or abolish the import of specific proteins.",

    "abstract": "In the centres of many galaxy clusters, the hot (approximately 107 kelvin) intracluster medium can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales1,2. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies3–6 and the absence of soft X-ray lines from the cooling gas7–9 suggest that most of this gas never cools. This is known as the cooling flow problem. The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures10–16. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all the gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here we present observations of the Phoenix cluster17 using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne vi] λ 7.652-μm emission line, enabling us to probe the gas at 105.5 kelvin on large scales. These data show extended [Ne vi] emission that is cospatial with the cooling peak in the intracluster medium, the coolest gas phases and the sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate, which we estimate to be 5,000–23,000 solar masses per year. These data provide a large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 105 kelvin and 106 kelvin in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback has in not only regulating cooling but also promoting it18. Observations of the Phoenix cluster using the James Webb Space Telescope reveal rapid cooling in galaxy cluster cores, driven by black hole jets, with gas temperatures mapped between 105 K and 106 K and cooling rates of 5,000–23,000 M⊙ yr−1.",

    "abstract": "Educational disparities remain a key contributor to increasing social and wealth inequalities. To address this, researchers and policymakers have focused on average differences between racial groups or differences among students who are falling behind1. This focus potentially leads to educational triage, diverting resources away from high-achieving students, including those from racial minorities2,3. Here we focus on the ‘racial excellence gap’—the difference in the likelihood that students from racial minorities (Black and Hispanic) reach the highest levels of academic achievement compared with their non-minority (white and Asian) peers. There is a shortage of evidence that systematically measures the magnitude of the excellence gap and how it evolves4,5. Using longitudinal, statewide, administrative data, we document eight facts regarding the excellence gap from third grade (typically ages 8–9) to high school (typically ages 14–18), link the stability of excellence gaps and student backgrounds, and assess the efficacy of public policies. We show that excellence gaps in maths and reading are evident by the third grade and grow slightly over time, especially for female students. About one third of the gap is explained by a student’s socioeconomic status, and about one tenth is explained by the school environment. Top-achieving racial minority students are also less likely to persist in excellence as they progress through school. Moreover, state accountability policies that direct additional resources to reduce non-race-based inequality6 had minimal effects on the racial excellence gaps. Documenting these patterns is an important step towards eliminating excellence gaps and removing the ‘racial glass ceiling’. Data from Michigan, USA, systematically document that comparatively fewer students from racial minorities excel in maths and reading, and that this gap grows as students progress through school.",

    "abstract": "Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved behaviour that controls social hierarchies and protects valuable resources. In mice, aggressive behaviour can be broken down into an appetitive phase, which involves approach and investigation, and a consummatory phase, which involves biting, kicking and wrestling1. Here, by performing an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis on whole-brain FOS expression in mice, we identify a cluster of brain regions, including hypothalamic and amygdalar subregions and olfactory cortical regions, that are highly co-activated in male but not in female aggressors. The posterolateral cortical amygdala (COApl)—an extended olfactory structure—was found to be a hub region, on the basis of the number and strength of correlations with other regions in the cluster. Our data also show that oestrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing cells in the COApl (COAplEsr1) exhibit increased activity during attack behaviour and during bouts of investigation that precede an attack, in male mice only. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of COAplEsr1 cells in male aggressors reduces aggression and increases pro-social investigation without affecting social reward and reinforcement behaviour. We further show that COAplEsr1 projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus and central amygdala are necessary for these behaviours. Collectively, these data suggest that, in aggressive males, COAplEsr1 cells respond specifically to social stimuli, thereby enhancing their salience and promoting attack behaviour. The posterolateral cortical amygdala and other connected brain regions have a key role in mediating the transition from investigative to aggressive behaviour in male mice.",

    "abstract": "The complex life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum involves several major differentiation stages, each requiring strict control of gene expression. Fundamental changes in chromatin structure and epigenetic modifications during life cycle progression suggest a central role for these mechanisms in regulating the transcriptional program of malaria parasite development1–6. P. falciparum chromatin is distinct from other eukaryotes, with an extraordinarily high AT content (>80%)7 and highly divergent histones resulting in atypical DNA packaging properties8. Moreover, the chromatin remodellers that are critical for shaping chromatin structure are not conserved and are unexplored in P. falciparum. Here we identify P. falciparum Snf2L (PfSnf2L, encoded by PF3D7_1104200) as an ISWI-related ATPase that actively repositions P. falciparum nucleosomes in vitro. Our results demonstrate that PfSnf2L is essential, regulating both asexual development and sexual differentiation. PfSnf2L globally controls just-in-time transcription by spatiotemporally determining nucleosome positioning at the promoters of stage-specific genes. The unique sequence and functional properties of PfSnf2L led to the identification of an inhibitor that specifically kills P. falciparum and phenocopies the loss of correct gene expression timing. The inhibitor represents a new class of antimalarial transmission-blocking drugs, inhibiting gametocyte formation. Plasmodium falciparum Snf2L is an ISWI-related ATPase that actively repositions P. falciparum nucleosomes in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Revealing the connectivity of functionally identified individual neurons is necessary to understand how activity patterns emerge and support behaviour. Yet the brain-wide presynaptic wiring rules that lay the foundation for the functional selectivity of individual neurons remain largely unexplored. Cortical neurons, even in primary sensory cortex, are heterogeneous in their selectivity, not only to sensory stimuli but also to multiple aspects of behaviour. Here, to investigate presynaptic connectivity rules underlying the selectivity of pyramidal neurons to behavioural state1–10 in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we used two-photon calcium imaging, neuropharmacology, single-cell-based monosynaptic input tracing and optogenetics. We show that behavioural state-dependent activity patterns are stable over time. These are minimally affected by direct neuromodulatory inputs and are driven primarily by glutamatergic inputs. Analysis of brain-wide presynaptic networks of individual neurons with distinct behavioural state-dependent activity profiles revealed that although behavioural state-related and behavioural state-unrelated neurons shared a similar pattern of local inputs within S1, their long-range glutamatergic inputs differed. Individual cortical neurons, irrespective of their functional properties, received converging inputs from the main S1-projecting areas. Yet neurons that tracked behavioural state received a smaller proportion of motor cortical inputs and a larger proportion of thalamic inputs. Optogenetic suppression of thalamic inputs reduced behavioural state-dependent activity in S1, but this activity was not externally driven. Our results reveal distinct long-range glutamatergic inputs as a substrate for preconfigured network dynamics associated with behavioural state. Behavioural-state-dependent pyramidal neurons have a distinct pattern of long-range glutamatergic inputs, with a larger proportion of thalamic versus motor cortex inputs compared with non-behaviour-dependent neurons.",

    "abstract": "Humans emerged across Africa shortly before 300 thousand years ago (ka)1–3. Although this pan-African evolutionary process implicates diverse environments in the human story, the role of tropical forests remains poorly understood. Here we report a clear association between late Middle Pleistocene material culture and a wet tropical forest in southern Côte d’Ivoire, a region of present-day rainforest. Twinned optically stimulated luminescence and electron spin resonance dating methods constrain the onset of human occupations at Bété I to around 150 ka, linking them with Homo sapiens. Plant wax biomarker, stable isotope, phytolith and pollen analyses of associated sediments all point to a wet forest environment. The results represent the oldest yet known clear association between humans and this habitat type. The secure attribution of stone tool assemblages with the wet forest environment demonstrates that Africa’s forests were not a major ecological barrier for H. sapiens as early as around 150 ka. The identification of tools dated to the time of Homo sapiens associated with microfloral evidence of wet tropical forests indicates that West African forests were occupied by humans much earlier in human evolution than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive, computable representation of the functional repertoire of all macromolecules encoded within the human genome is a foundational resource for biology and biomedical research. The Gene Ontology Consortium has been working towards this goal by generating a structured body of information about gene functions, which now includes experimental findings reported in more than 175,000 publications for human genes and genes in experimentally tractable model organisms1,2. Here, we describe the results of a large, international effort to integrate all of these findings to create a representation of human gene functions that is as complete and accurate as possible. Specifically, we apply an expert-curated, explicit evolutionary modelling approach to all human protein-coding genes. This approach integrates available experimental information across families of related genes into models that reconstruct the gain and loss of functional characteristics over evolutionary time. The models and the resulting set of 68,667 integrated gene functions cover approximately 82% of human protein-coding genes. The functional repertoire reveals a marked preponderance of molecular regulatory functions, and the models provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human gene functions. We show that our set of descriptions of functions can improve the widely used genomic technique of Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. The experimental evidence for each functional characteristic is recorded, thereby enabling the scientific community to help review and improve the resource, which we have made publicly available. Evolutionary modelling and expert review are applied to integrate experimentally supported knowledge accumulated in the Gene Ontology knowledgebase to create a draft human gene ‘functionome’.",

    "abstract": "The Antarctic ozone ‘hole’ was discovered in 1985 (ref. 1) and man-made ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) are its primary cause2. Following reductions of ODSs under the Montreal Protocol3, signs of ozone recovery have been reported, based largely on observations and broad yet compelling model–data comparisons4. Although such approaches are highly valuable, they do not provide rigorous statistical detection of the temporal and spatial structure of Antarctic ozone recovery in the presence of internal climate variability. Here we apply pattern-based detection and attribution methods as used in climate-change studies5–11 to separate anthropogenically forced ozone responses from internal variability, relying on trend pattern information as a function of month and height. The analysis uses satellite observations together with single-model and multi-model ensemble simulations to identify and quantify the month–height Antarctic ozone recovery ‘fingerprint’12. We demonstrate that the data and simulations show compelling agreement in the fingerprint pattern of the ozone response to decreasing ODSs since 2005. We also show that ODS forcing has enhanced ozone internal variability during the austral spring, influencing detection of forced responses and their time of emergence. Our results provide robust statistical and physical evidence that actions taken under the Montreal Protocol to reduce ODSs are indeed resulting in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery, defined as increases in ozone consistent with expected month–height patterns. Pattern-based detection and attribution methods that make use of trend pattern information as a function of month and height provide evidence that reduction of ozone-depleting substances has resulted in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery.",

    "abstract": "The stability and function of biomolecules are directly influenced by their myriad interactions with water1–16. Here we investigated water through cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on a highly solvated molecule: the Tetrahymena ribozyme. By using segmentation-guided water and ion modelling (SWIM)17,18, an approach combining resolvability and chemical parameters, we automatically modelled and cross-validated water molecules and Mg2+ ions in the ribozyme core, revealing the extensive involvement of water in mediating RNA non-canonical interactions. Unexpectedly, in regions where SWIM does not model ordered water, we observed highly similar densities in both cryo-EM maps. In many of these regions, the cryo-EM densities superimpose with complex water networks predicted by molecular dynamics, supporting their assignment as water and suggesting a biophysical explanation for their elusiveness to conventional atomic coordinate modelling. Our study demonstrates an approach to unveil both rigid and flexible waters that surround biomolecules through cryo-EM map densities, statistical and chemical metrics, and molecular dynamics simulations. Using cryogenic electron microscopy and a modelling approach, complex water networks in a ribozyme are visualized.",

    "abstract": "Fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain is mediated by cation-selective AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors (AMPARs)1. AMPARs are critical for the learning and memory mechanisms of Hebbian plasticity2 and glutamatergic synapse homeostasis3, with recent work establishing that AMPAR missense mutations can cause autism and intellectual disability4–7. AMPARs have been grouped into two functionally distinct tetrameric assemblies based on the inclusion or exclusion of the GluA2 subunit that determines Ca2+ permeability through RNA editing8,9. GluA2-containing AMPARs are the most abundant in the central nervous system and considered to be Ca2+ impermeable10. Here we show this is not the case. Contrary to conventional understanding, GluA2-containing AMPARs form a continuum of polyamine-insensitive ion channels with varying degrees of Ca2+ permeability. Their ability to transport Ca2+ is shaped by the subunit composition of AMPAR tetramers as well as the spatial orientation of transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins and cornichon auxiliary subunits. Ca2+ crosses the ion-conduction pathway by docking to an extracellular binding site that helps funnel divalent ions into the pore selectivity filter. The dynamic range in Ca2+ permeability, however, arises because auxiliary subunits primarily modify the selectivity filter. Taken together, our work proposes a broader role for AMPARs in Ca2+ signalling in the mammalian brain and offers mechanistic insight into the pathogenic nature of missense mutations. GluA2-containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are not Ca2+ impermeable, and their ability to transport Ca2+ is shaped by the subunit composition of AMPAR tetramers as well as the orientation of transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins and cornichon auxiliary subunits.",

    "abstract": "Fibrosis, the replacement of healthy tissue with collagen-rich matrix, can occur following injury in almost every organ1,2. Mouse lungs follow a stereotyped sequence of fibrogenesis-to-resolution after bleomycin injury3, and we reasoned that profiling post-injury histological stages could uncover pro-fibrotic versus anti-fibrotic features with functional value for human fibrosis. Here we quantified spatiotemporally resolved matrix transformations for integration with multi-omic data. First, we charted stepwise trajectories of matrix aberration versus resolution, derived from a high-dimensional set of histological fibre features, that denoted a reversible transition in uniform-to-disordered histological architecture. Single-cell sequencing along these trajectories identified temporally enriched ‘ECM-secreting’ (Csmd1-expressing) and ‘pro-resolving’ (Cd248-expressing) fibroblasts at the respective post-injury stages. Visium-based spatial analysis further suggested divergent matrix architectures and spatial–transcriptional neighbourhoods by fibroblast subtype, identifying distinct fibrotic versus non-fibrotic biomolecular milieu. Critically, pro-resolving fibroblast instillation helped to ameliorate fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, the fibroblast neighbourhood-associated factors SERPINE2 and PI16 functionally modulated human lung fibrosis ex vivo. Spatial phenotyping of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at protein level additionally uncovered analogous fibroblast subtypes and neighbourhoods in human disease. Collectively, these findings establish an atlas of pro- and anti-fibrotic factors that underlie lung matrix architecture and implicate fibroblast-associated biological features in modulating fibrotic progression versus resolution. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of cells and matrix along the fibrotic trajectory in mouse lung identified PI16 as an anti-fibrotic factor with potential for therapeutic application in humans.",

SPDC is typically performed in non-centrosymmetric systems7 with an inherent second-order nonlinearity (χ(2))8–10. We demonstrate strong narrowband SPDC with an on-chip rate of 0.8 million pairs per second in Si3N4. Si3N4 is the pre-eminent material for photonic integration and also exhibits the lowest waveguide loss (which is essential for integrated quantum circuits). However, being amorphous, silicon nitride lacks an intrinsic χ(2), which limits its role in photonic quantum devices. We enabled SPDC in Si3N4 by combining strong light-field enhancement inside a high optical Q-factor microcavity with an optically induced space-charge field. We present narrowband photon pairs with a high spectral brightness. The quantum nature of the down-converted photon pairs is verified through coincidence measurements. This light source, based on Si3N4 integrated photonics technology, unlocks new avenues for quantum systems on a chip. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion was used to generate narrowband photon pairs with a high spectral brightness in a high-Q silicon nitride microresonator.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting (SC) states that break space-group symmetries of the underlying crystal can exhibit nontrivial spatial modulation of the order parameter. Previously, such states were intimately associated with the breaking of translational symmetry1,2, resulting in the density-wave orders3–8, with wavelengths spanning several unit cells9–19. However, a related basic concept has long been overlooked20: when only intra-unit-cell symmetries of the space group are broken, the SC states can show a distinct type of nontrivial modulation preserving long-range lattice translation. Here we refer to this new concept as the pair density modulation (PDM) and report the first observation of a PDM state in exfoliated thin flakes of the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), we discover robust SC gap modulation with the wavelength corresponding to the lattice periodicity and the amplitude exceeding 30% of the gap average. Notably, we find that the observed modulation originates from the large difference in SC gaps on the two nominally equivalent iron sublattices. The experimental findings, backed up by model calculations, suggest that, in contrast to the density-wave orders, the PDM state is driven by the interplay of sublattice symmetry breaking and a peculiar nematic distortion specific to the thin flakes. Our results establish new frontiers for exploring the intertwined orders in strong-correlated electronic systems and open a new chapter for iron-based superconductors. Pair density modulation, an unusual superconducting state whose superconducting gap is modulated by the wavelength corresponding to the lattice periodicity, is described and observed in exfoliated thin flakes of the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45.",

    "abstract": "Cortical networks for the production of spoken language in humans are organized by phonetic features1,2, such as articulatory parameters3,4 and vocal pitch5,6. Previous research has failed to find an equivalent forebrain representation in other species7–11. To investigate whether this functional organization is unique to humans, here we performed population recordings in the vocal production circuitry of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), a small parrot that can generate flexible vocal output12–15, including mimicked speech sounds16. Using high-density silicon probes17, we measured the song-related activity of a forebrain region, the central nucleus of the anterior arcopallium (AAC), which directly projects to brainstem phonatory motor neurons18–20. We found that AAC neurons form a functional vocal motor map that reflects the spectral properties of ongoing vocalizations. We did not observe this organizing principle in the corresponding forebrain circuitry of the zebra finch, a songbird capable of more limited vocal learning21. We further demonstrated that the AAC represents the production of distinct vocal features (for example, harmonic structure and broadband energy). Furthermore, we discovered an orderly representation of vocal pitch at the population level, with single neurons systematically selective for different frequency values. Taken together, we have uncovered a functional representation in a vertebrate brain that displays unprecedented commonalities with speech-related motor cortices in humans. This work therefore establishes the parrot as an important animal model for investigating speech motor control and for developing therapeutic solutions for addressing a range of communication disorders22,23. Using advanced brain-recording techniques, parrots were found to have a brain organization for vocal control similar to humans, making them an important model for studying speech and for developing potential treatments for communication disorders.",

    "abstract": "Meningomyelocele (also known as spina bifida) is considered to be a genetically complex disease resulting from a failure of the neural tube to close. Individuals with meningomyelocele display neuromotor disability and frequent hydrocephalus, requiring ventricular shunting. A few genes have been proposed to contribute to disease susceptibility, but beyond that it remains unexplained1. We postulated that de novo mutations under purifying selection contribute to the risk of developing meningomyelocele2. Here we recruited a cohort of 851 meningomyelocele trios who required shunting at birth and 732 control trios, and found that de novo likely gene disruption or damaging missense mutations occurred in approximately 22.3% of subjects, with 28% of such variants estimated to contribute to disease risk. The 187 genes with damaging de novo mutations collectively define networks including actin cytoskeleton and microtubule-based processes, Netrin-1 signalling and chromatin-modifying enzymes. Gene validation demonstrated partial or complete loss of function, impaired signalling and defective closure of the neural tube in Xenopus embryos. Our results indicate that de novo mutations make key contributions to meningomyelocele risk, and highlight critical pathways required for neural tube closure in human embryogenesis. Exome sequencing of 851 trios from more than 2,500 individuals finds 187 genes with de novo mutations that contribute to meningomyelocele (spina bifida) and highlights critical pathways required for neural tube closure.",

    "abstract": "The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect was recently discovered in twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2) bilayers1–4. Experiments so far have revealed Chern insulators from hole doping at ν = −1, −2/3, −3/5 and −4/7 (per moiré unit cell)1–6. In parallel, theories predict that, between v = −1 and −3, there exist exotic quantum phases7–15, such as the coveted fractional topological insulators, fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) states and non-Abelian fractional states. Here we use transient optical spectroscopy16,17 on tMoTe2 to reveal nearly 20 hidden states at fractional fillings that are absent in static optical sensing or transport measurements. A pump pulse selectively excites charge across the correlated or pseudogaps, leading to the disordering (melting) of correlated states18. A probe pulse detects the subsequent melting and recovery dynamics by means of exciton and trion sensing1,3,19–21. Besides the known states, we observe further fractional fillings between ν = 0 and −1 and a large number of states on the electron doping side (ν > 0). Most importantly, we observe new states at fractional fillings of the Chern bands at ν = −4/3, −3/2, −5/3, −7/3, −5/2 and −8/3. These states are potential candidates for the predicted exotic topological phases7–15. Moreover, we show that melting of correlated states occurs on two distinct timescales, 2–4 ps and 180–270 ps, attributed to electronic and phonon mechanisms, respectively. We discuss the differing dynamics of the electron-doped and hole-doped states from the distinct moiré conduction and valence bands. Transient optical spectroscopy applied to studying twisted MoTe2 for time-domain detection of fractional fillings of Chern bands reveals many hidden states that have not been previously observed and which could host exotic topological phases.",

    "abstract": "Thromboinflammation occurs in various diseases, leading to life-threatening microvascular occlusion with resulting end-organ failure1–4. Importantly, how microvascular thromboinflammation resolves remains poorly understood due to the small size-scale of microvasculature and the long duration (weeks to months) of this process. Here we introduce a hydrogel-based thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model with long-term culture capabilities to model microvascular thromboinflammation and monitor clot resolution over clinically and physiologically relevant timescales (up to months). Using this system, we mapped out the distinct temporal phases of clot resolution in microvascular thromboinflammation. Using multiplexed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with our thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model, we observed that inflammation shifts the endothelium fibrinolytic balance to favour thrombosis and pinpointed neutrophil elastase as a double-edged sword that induces clot resolution but also tissue damage. We then investigated the mechanisms of potential therapeutic agents that either prevent microvascular thrombosis or accelerate clot resolution. Specifically, we observed that, in thromboinflammation, (1) early tissue plasminogen activator administration within 3 h directly improves endothelial barrier function; (2) prophylactic defibrotide and enoxaparin suppress microvascular thromboinflammation through endothelium-mediated mechanisms; and (3) combining enoxaparin with crizanlizumab reduces microvascular occlusion and protects endothelial function in sickle cell disease. These data introduce a paradigm in investigating the underlying mechanisms of thromboinflammatory clot resolution and conducting drug discovery thereof. In thromboinflammation, early tissue plasminogen activator administration directly improves endothelial barrier function, prophylactic defibrotide and enoxaparin suppress microvascular thromboinflammation through endothelium-mediated mechanisms and combining enoxaparin with crizanlizumab reduces microvascular occlusion and protects endothelial function in sickle cell disease.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic oscillations in stars are sensitive to stellar interiors1. Frequency differences between overtone modes—large separations—probe stellar density2, whereas differences between low-degree modes—small separations—probe the sound-speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main-sequence Sun-like stars3, and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterized by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and become proportional to large separations4,5. Here we present evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolutions, eventually entering an ultradeep regime that leads to the red-giant-branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence. Measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars within the M67 cluster presents evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from subgiants to red giants.",

    "abstract": "Given the large number of genes significantly associated with risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, a critical unanswered question is the extent to which diverse mutations—sometimes affecting the same gene—will require tailored therapeutic strategies. Here we consider this in the context of rare neuropsychiatric disorder-associated copy number variants (2p16.3) resulting in heterozygous deletions in NRXN1, which encodes a presynaptic cell-adhesion protein that serves as a critical synaptic organizer in the brain. Complex patterns of NRXN1 alternative splicing are fundamental to establishing diverse neurocircuitry, vary between the cell types of the brain and are differentially affected by unique (non-recurrent) deletions1. We contrast the cell-type-specific effect of patient-specific mutations in NRXN1 using human-induced pluripotent stem cells, finding that perturbations in NRXN1 splicing result in divergent cell-type-specific synaptic outcomes. Through distinct loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms, NRXN1+/− deletions cause decreased synaptic activity in glutamatergic neurons, yet increased synaptic activity in GABAergic neurons. Reciprocal isogenic manipulations causally demonstrate that aberrant splicing drives these changes in synaptic activity. For NRXN1 deletions, and perhaps more broadly, precision medicine will require stratifying patients based on whether their gene mutations act through LOF or GOF mechanisms, to achieve individualized restoration of NRXN1 isoform repertoires by increasing wild-type and/or ablating mutant isoforms. Given the increasing number of mutations predicted to engender both LOF and GOF mechanisms in brain disorders, our findings add nuance to future considerations of precision medicine. How NRXN1 variants affect multiple neuropsychiatric disorders is explored.",

    "abstract": "During classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) encapsulates free DNA ends, forming a recruitment platform for downstream end-joining factors including ligase 4 (LIG4)1. DNA-PK can also bind telomeres and regulate their resection2–4, but does not initiate cNHEJ at this position. How the end-joining process is regulated in this context-specific manner is currently unclear. Here we show that the shelterin components TRF2 and RAP1 form a complex with DNA-PK that directly represses its end-joining function at telomeres. Biochemical experiments and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that when bound to TRF2, RAP1 establishes a network of interactions with KU and DNA that prevents DNA-PK from recruiting LIG4. In mouse and human cells, RAP1 is redundant with the Apollo nuclease in repressing cNHEJ at chromosome ends, demonstrating that the inhibition of DNA-PK prevents telomere fusions in parallel with overhang-dependent mechanisms. Our experiments show that the end-joining function of DNA-PK is directly and specifically repressed at telomeres, establishing a molecular mechanism for how individual linear chromosomes are maintained in mammalian cells. Biochemical, structural and genetic analysis of the shelterin complex reveal that by recruiting RAP1 to DNA, TRF2 directly inhibits DNA-dependent protein kinase to regulate classical non-homologous end joining at telomeres.",

    "abstract": "Oryza rufipogon, the wild progenitor of Asian cultivated rice Oryza sativa, is an important resource for rice breeding1. Here we present a wild–cultivated rice pangenome based on 145 chromosome-level assemblies, comprising 129 genetically diverse O. rufipogon accessions and 16 diverse varieties of O. sativa. This pangenome contains 3.87 Gb of sequences that are absent from the O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare reference genome. We captured alternate assemblies that include heterozygous information missing in the primary assemblies, and identified a total of 69,531 pan-genes, with 28,907 core genes and 13,728 wild-rice-specific genes. We observed a higher abundance and a significantly greater diversity of resistance-gene analogues in wild rice than in cultivars. Our analysis indicates that two cultivated subpopulations, intro-indica and basmati, were generated through gene flows among cultivars in South Asia. We also provide strong evidence to support the theory that the initial domestication of all Asian cultivated rice occurred only once. Furthermore, we captured 855,122 differentiated single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 13,853 differentiated presence–absence variations between indica and japonica, which could be traced to the divergence of their respective ancestors and the existence of a larger genetic bottleneck in japonica. This study provides reference resources for enhancing rice breeding, and enriches our understanding of the origins and domestication process of rice. A pangenome of wild and cultivated rice accessions captures the entire set of non-redundant genes and diversity in rice, and provides insights into the pathways involved in the evolution of rice.",

    "abstract": "Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the enzyme responsible for nearly all biologically generated methane1. Its active site comprises coenzyme F430, a porphyrin-based cofactor with a central nickel ion that is active exclusively in the Ni(I) state2,3. How methanogenic archaea perform the reductive activation of F430 represents a major gap in our understanding of one of the most ancient bioenergetic systems in nature. Here we purified and characterized the MCR activation complex from Methanococcus maripaludis. McrC, a small subunit encoded in the mcr operon, co-purifies with the methanogenic marker proteins Mmp7, Mmp17, Mmp3 and the A2 component. We demonstrated that this complex can activate MCR in vitro in a strictly ATP-dependent manner, enabling the formation of methane. In addition, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the MCR activation complex exhibiting different functional states with local resolutions reaching 1.8–2.1 Å. Our data revealed three complex iron–sulfur clusters that formed an electron transfer pathway towards F430. Topology and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses indicate that these clusters are similar to the [8Fe-9S-C] cluster, a maturation intermediate of the catalytic cofactor in nitrogenase. Altogether, our findings offer insights into the activation mechanism of MCR and prospects on the early evolution of nitrogenase. The structure and function of the MCR activation complex from Methanococcus maripaludis were revealed, demonstrating its ATP-dependent ability to activate MCR and form methane while uncovering a unique electron transfer pathway involving iron–sulfur clusters similar to the nitrogenase cofactor intermediates.",

    "abstract": "The stability of hazardous volcanic systems is strongly influenced by the uppermost magma storage depth and volatile exsolution1–3. Despite abundant evidence for an upper crustal magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone caldera4–7, its depth and the properties at its top have not been well constrained. New controlled-source seismic imaging illuminates a sharp reflective cap of the magma reservoir approximately 3.8 km beneath the northeastern caldera. Magma ascent to such low pressure is expected to drive volatile exsolution and potentially localized accumulation of bubbles near the top of the reservoir8,9, but this process typically remains hidden in contemporary volcanic systems. P-wave and P-to-S-wave reflections from the sharp top of the Yellowstone magma reservoir indicate that a mixture of supercritical fluid and magma fills the pore space at the cap of the approximately 3–8-km-deep low-shear-velocity layer imaged by seismic tomography6,7. The results are consistent with partial retention of bubbles exsolved from an upper crustal reservoir with ongoing magma supply from a volatile-enriched mantle source. Bubble accumulation can eventually lead to reservoir instability2,8, but the bubble volume fraction seismically estimated at the top of the reservoir today is lower than typical estimates of pre-eruptive conditions for rhyolites1,10,11, and measurements of the hydrothermal system document high fluxes of magmatic volatiles escaping to the surface12–15. We infer that the magma reservoir is in a stable state of efficient bubble ascent into the hydrothermal system on the basis of estimates that it is a crystal-rich (less than 30% porosity) reservoir for which dynamic modelling favours channelized bubble escape that prevents instability8. Seismic reflection imaging beneath the northeastern Yellowstone caldera reveals a sharp boundary at about 3.8 km depth, which is inferred to result from a mixture of supercritical fluid and magma filling the pore space.",

    "abstract": "Free radicals were first discovered more than 120 years ago by Gomberg1 and the first radical cross-couplings demonstrated by Kochi in the 1970s (ref. 2). In contrast to widely used polar cross-coupling chemistry to forge C(sp2)–C(sp2) bonds (such as Suzuki, Negishi and Kumada), radical cross-coupling is advantageous when applied to the coupling of saturated systems because of the mild conditions used and enhanced chemoselectivity associated with single-electron chemistry. The ability to use ubiquitous carbon-based fragments (such as carboxylic acids, alcohols, amines and olefins) in cross-coupling has greatly simplified access to various complex molecules3–9. Apart from these advantages, enantiospecific coupling reactions involving free radicals are unknown and generally believed to be challenging because of their near-instantaneous racemization (picosecond timescale)10. As a result, controlling the stereochemical outcome of radical cross-coupling can be achieved only on a case-by-case basis using bespoke chiral ligands11 or in a diastereoselective fashion guided by nearby stereocentres12. Here we show how readily accessible enantioenriched sulfonylhydrazides and low loadings of an inexpensive achiral Ni catalyst can be used to solve this challenge, thereby enabling enantiospecific, stereoretentive radical cross-coupling between enantioenriched alkyl fragments and (hetero)aryl halides without exogenous redox chemistry or chiral ligands. Calculations support the intermediacy of a unique Ni-bound diazene-containing transition state with C–C bond formation driven by loss of N2. Readily accessible enantioenriched sulfonylhydrazides and low loadings of an inexpensive achiral Ni catalyst can be used to control the stereochemical outcome of radical cross-coupling.",

Here we present the subunit composition and the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the native LPD-3 BLTP complex isolated from transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans. LPD-3 folds into an elongated, rod-shaped tunnel of which the interior is filled with ordered lipid molecules that are coordinated by a track of ionizable residues that line one side of the tunnel. LPD-3 forms a complex with two previously uncharacterized proteins, one of which we have named Spigot and the other of which remains unnamed. Spigot interacts with the N-terminal end of LPD-3 where lipids are expected to enter the tunnel, and experiments in multiple model systems indicate that Spigot has a conserved role in BLTP function. Our LPD-3 complex structural data reveal protein–lipid interactions that suggest a model for how the native LPD-3 complex mediates bulk lipid transport and provides a foundation for mechanistic studies of BLTPs. The LPD-3 complex structure reveals protein–lipid interactions that suggest a model for how the native LPD-3 complex mediates bulk lipid transport and provides a foundation for mechanistic studies of bridge-like lipid-transport proteins.",

Studying the distribution of the masses and charges of the fragments is essential for establishing the fission mechanisms and refining the theoretical models3,4. It has value for our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis5,6, in which the fission of nuclei with extreme neutron-to-proton ratios is pivotal for determining astrophysical abundances and understanding the origin of the elements7 and for energy applications8,9. Although the asymmetric distribution of fragments is well understood for actinides (elements in the periodic table with atomic numbers from 89 to 103) based on shell effects10, symmetric fission governs the scission process for lighter elements. However, unexpected asymmetric splits have been observed in neutron-deficient exotic nuclei11, prompting extensive further investigations. Here we present measurements of the charge distributions of fission fragments for 100 exotic fissioning systems, 75 of which have never been measured, and establish a connection between the neutron-deficient sub-lead region and the well-understood actinide region. These new data comprehensively map the asymmetric fission island and provide clear evidence for the role played by the deformed Z = 36 proton shell of the light fragment in the fission of sub-lead nuclei. Our dataset will help constrain the fission models used to estimate the fission properties of nuclei with extreme neutron-to-proton ratios for which experimental data are unavailable. Measurements of fission fragments for 100 fissioning systems are used to map an asymmetric fission island, providing evidence for the role played by the deformation induced by a closed 36-proton shell.",

    "abstract": "The ability to evaluate valence of a social agent based on social experience is essential for an animal’s survival in its social group1. Although hippocampal circuits have been implicated in distinguishing novel and familiar conspecifics2–7, it remains unclear how social valence is constructed on the basis of social history and what mechanisms underlie the heightened valence versatility in dynamic relationships. Here we demonstrate that the ventral (v)CA1 integrates serotonin (5-HT) inputs from the dorsal raphe and neurotensin inputs from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) to determine positive or negative valence of conspecific representations. Specifically, during an appetitive social interaction 5-HT is released into the vCA1 and disinhibits pyramidal neurons through 5-HT1B receptors, whereas neurotensin is released during an aversive social interaction and potentiates vCA1 neurons directly through NTR1s. Optogenetic silencing of dorsal raphe 5-HT and PVT neurotensin inputs into the vCA1 impairs positive and negative social valence, respectively, and excitation flexibly switches valence assignment. These results show how aversive and rewarding social experiences are linked to conspecific identity through converging dorsal raphe 5-HT and PVT neurotensin signals in the vCA1 that instruct opposing valence, and represent a synaptic switch for flexible social valence computation. Aversive and rewarding social experiences are linked to conspecific identity through converging dorsal raphe 5-HT and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus neurotensin signals in the vCA1 that instruct opposing valence, representing a synaptic switch for flexible social valence computation.",

    "abstract": "Despite accumulating evidence that bat-derived coronaviruses often require intermediate hosts to facilitate transmission to humans1, the potential role of fur animals in zoonotic coronavirus spillovers has largely been overlooked2. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a previously undescribed mink respiratory coronavirus (MRCoV) from farmed minks with pneumonia. Notably, MRCoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor and can infect mink, bat, monkey and human cells. Cryo-electron microscopy analyses revealed that the MRCoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds to the same interface on ACE2 receptors as the RBD of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) despite structural differences. We identify the key determinants on the RBD of MRCoV and ACE2 that confer efficient binding. HKU5-33S, a bat coronavirus closely related to MRCoV, uses ACE2 of the bat Pipistrellus abramus for cell entry and requires only two amino acid substitutions to adapt to mink ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 protease and polymerase inhibitors potently block MRCoV infection, thereby indicating a potential therapeutic strategy. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of coronavirus receptor dynamics and highlight their zoonotic potential. Given the risks posed by fur farms as reservoirs for emerging pathogens, our study underscores the need for enhanced surveillance to mitigate future coronavirus outbreaks. A newly identified coronavirus isolated from farmed minks can use the receptor ACE2 to infect cells of different mammalian species, including human cells, which has implications for potential zoonotic spillover events.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress response activation impairs cell survival and causes devastating degenerative diseases1–3. Organisms accordingly deploy silencing factors, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase silencing factor of the integrated stress response (SIFI), to terminate stress response signalling and ensure cellular homeostasis4. How a silencing factor can sense stress across cellular scales to elicit timely stress response inactivation is poorly understood. Here we combine cryo-electron microscopy analysis of endogenous SIFI with AlphaFold modelling and biochemical studies to report the structural and mechanistic basis of the silencing of the integrated stress response. SIFI detects both stress indicators and stress response components through flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, before building linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at separate, sterically restricted elongation modules. Ubiquitin handover by a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to linkage-specific ubiquitin polymer formation. Stress response silencing therefore exploits a catalytic mechanism that is geared towards processing many diverse proteins and therefore allows a single enzyme to monitor and, if needed, modulate a complex cellular state. To efficiently silence the integrated stress response, SIFI detects many diverse substrates that include stress indicators and stress response components through flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, before building linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at separate, sterically restricted elongation modules.",

GOLLD (Giant, Ornate, Lake- and Lactobacillales-Derived), ROOL (Rumen-Originating, Ornate, Large) and OLE (Ornate Large Extremophilic) RNAs form homo-oligomeric complexes whose stoichiometries are retained at lower concentrations than measured in cells. OLE RNA forms a dimeric complex with long co-axial pipes spanning two monomers. Both GOLLD and ROOL form distinct RNA-only multimeric nanocages with diameters larger than the ribosome, each empty except for a disordered loop. Extensive intramolecular and intermolecular A-minor interactions, kissing loops, an unusual A–A helix and other interactions stabilize the three complexes. Sequence covariation analysis of these large RNAs reveals evolutionary conservation of intermolecular interactions, supporting the biological importance of large, ornate RNA quaternary structures that can assemble without any involvement of proteins.

Yet, little is known about how dopamine modulates hippocampal representations of emotionally salient stimuli to inform appropriate resolution of approach versus avoidance conflicts. Here we studied dopaminoceptive neurons in the male mouse ventral hippocampus (vHipp), molecularly distinguished by their expression of dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. We show that these neurons are transcriptionally distinct and topographically organized across vHipp subfields and cell types. In the ventral subiculum where they are enriched, both D1 and D2 neurons are recruited during anxiogenic exploration, yet with distinct profiles related to investigation and behavioural selection. In turn, they mediate opposite approach–avoidance responses, and are differentially modulated by dopaminergic transmission in that region. Together, these results suggest that vHipp dopamine dynamics gate exploratory behaviours under contextual uncertainty, implicating dopaminoception in the complex computation engaged in the vHipp to govern emotional states. Approach versus avoidance responses are driven by D1 and D2 neurons in the ventral hippocampus.",

It remains unknown how motor learning shapes the way in which upstream regions activate M1 circuits to execute learned movements. Here, using longitudinal axonal imaging of the main inputs to M1 L2/3 in mice, we show that the motor thalamus is the key input source that encodes learned movements in experts (animals trained for two weeks). We then use optogenetics to identify the subset of M1 L2/3 neurons that are strongly driven by thalamic inputs before and after learning. We find that the thalamic influence on M1 changes with learning, such that the motor thalamus preferentially activates the M1 neurons that encode learned movements in experts. Inactivation of the thalamic inputs to M1 in experts impairs learned movements. Our study shows that motor learning reshapes the thalamic influence on M1 to enable the reliable execution of learned movements. Imaging and optogenetics in mice provide insight into the interplay between the primary motor cortex and the motor thalamus during learning, showing that thalamic inputs have a key role in the execution of learned movements.",

    "abstract": "Entrainment is a process in schooling migratory fish whereby routes to suitable habitats are transferred from repeat spawners to recruits over generations through social learning1. Selective fisheries targeting older fish may therefore result in collective memory loss and disrupted migration culture2. The world’s largest herring (Clupea harengus) population has traditionally migrated up to 1,300 km southward from wintering areas in northern Norwegian waters to spawn at the west coast. This conservative strategy is proposed to be a trade-off between high energetic swimming costs and enhanced larval survival under improved growth conditions3. Here an analysis of extensive data from fisheries, scientific surveys and tagging experiments demonstrates an abrupt approximately 800-km poleward shift in main spawning. The new migration was established by a large cohort recruiting when the abundance of older fish was critically low due to age-selective fisheries. The threshold of memory required for cultural transfer was probably not met—a situation that was further exacerbated by reduced spatiotemporal overlap between older fish and recruits driven by migration constraints and climate change. Finally, a minority of survivors from older generations adopted the migration culture from the recruits instead of the historically opposite. This may have profound consequences for production and coastal ecology, challenging the management of migratory schooling fish. A critically low abundance of older herring due to age-selective fisheries resulted in an approximately 800-km poleward shift in main spawning.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the mechanisms that underlie cooperation is fundamental to biology1. The most complex form of cooperation in vertebrates occurs in cooperative breeders, in which helpers forego reproduction and assist in raising the young of others, typically relatives2. Not all cooperative societies, however, are kin-based—nearly half of all avian3 and mammalian4 cooperative breeders form mixed-kin societies, much like those of humans5. Kin selection in mixed-kin societies occurs when individuals gain indirect fitness from the preferential helping of relatives6, but helpers also frequently assist non-kin7, highlighting a potential role for direct fitness in stabilizing cooperative societies7,8. Here, using a 20-year study of superb starlings (Lamprotornis superbus), we examined how direct and indirect fitness jointly influence helping behaviour. Although we detected kin-biased helping (demonstrating kin selection), non-kin helping was common despite opportunities to aid kin. Unexpectedly, specific pairs maintained long-term reciprocal helping relationships by swapping social roles across their lifetimes—a subtle pattern of reciprocity requiring decades of observation to detect. Given the frequency of non-kin helping and the occurrence of reciprocal helping among both kin and non-kin, helping behaviour in superb starlings seems to be greatly influenced by direct fitness. However, the relative importance of direct and indirect fitness varied with helpers’ sex and dispersal history. By uncovering a cryptic yet crucial role of long-term reciprocal helping, we suggest that reciprocity may be an underappreciated mechanism promoting the stability of cooperatively breeding societies. A study of the cooperative breeding behaviour of superb starlings during 40 consecutive breeding seasons over 20 years reveals long-term reciprocal helping between both related and unrelated individuals.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes catabolize lipids and other biological molecules, maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a major lipid constituent of intralysosomal vesicles, stimulates lipid-degrading enzymes and is altered in various human conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases1,2. Although lysosomal BMP synthase was recently discovered3, the enzymes mediating BMP turnover remain elusive. Here we show that lysosomal phospholipase PLA2G15 is a physiological BMP hydrolase. We further demonstrate that the resistance of BMP to lysosomal hydrolysis arises from its unique sn2, sn2′ esterification position and stereochemistry, as neither feature alone confers resistance. Purified PLA2G15 catabolizes most BMP species derived from cell and tissue lysosomes. Furthermore, PLA2G15 efficiently hydrolyses synthesized BMP stereoisomers with primary esters, challenging the long-held thought that BMP stereochemistry alone ensures resistance to acid phospholipases. Conversely, BMP with secondary esters and S,S stereoconfiguration is stable in vitro and requires acyl migration for hydrolysis in lysosomes. Consistent with our biochemical data, PLA2G15-deficient cells and tissues accumulate several BMP species, a phenotype reversible by supplementing wild-type PLA2G15 but not its inactive mutant. Targeting PLA2G15 reduces the cholesterol accumulation in fibroblasts of patients with Niemann–Pick disease type C1 and significantly ameliorates disease pathologies in Niemann–Pick disease type C1-deficient mice, leading to an extended lifespan. Our findings established the rules governing BMP stability in lysosomes and identified PLA2G15 as a lysosomal BMP hydrolase and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. Lysosomal phospholipase PLA2G15 was identified as a physiological BMP hydrolase whose activity depends on unique esterification and stereochemistry of BMP and offers a potential therapeutic target for Niemann–Pick disease type C1 and other neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "abstract": "Debris disks are exoplanetary systems that contain planets, minor bodies (asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, comets and so on) and micrometre-sized debris dust1. Because water ice is the most common frozen volatile, it plays an essential role in the formation of planets2,3 and minor bodies. Although water ice has been commonly found in Kuiper belt objects and comets in the Solar System4, no definitive evidence for water ice in debris disks has been obtained to date1. Here we report the discovery of water ice in the HD 181327 debris disk using the near-infrared spectrograph onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. We detected the solid-state broad absorption feature of water ice at 3 µm including a distinct Fresnel peak at 3.1 µm, which is indicative of large, crystalline water-ice particles. Gradients in the water-ice feature as a function of stellocentric distance reveal a dynamic environment in which water ice is destroyed and replenished. We estimated the water-ice mass fractions as ranging from 0.1% at approximately 85 au to 21% at approximately 113 au, indicating the presence of a water-ice reservoir in the HD 181327 disk beyond the snow line. The icy bodies that release water ice in HD 181327 are probably the extra-solar counterparts of water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects in our Solar System. The James Webb Space Telescope has detected water ice in the cold debris disk (analogous to the Kuiper belt) around the star HD 181327.",

    "abstract": "Here we report on the nearly complete and uncrushed 14th specimen of Archaeopteryx. Exceptional preservation and preparation guided by micro-computed tomographic data make this one of the best exemplars of this iconic taxon, preserving important data regarding skeletal transformation and plumage evolution in relation to the acquisition of flight during early avian evolution. The ventrolaterally exposed skull reveals a palatal morphology intermediate between troodontids1 and crownward Cretaceous birds2,3. Modifications of the skull reflect the shift towards a less rigid cranial architecture in archaeopterygids from non-avian theropods. The complete vertebral column reveals paired proatlases and a tail longer than previously recognized. Skin traces on the right major digit of the hand suggest that the minor digit was free and mobile distally, contrary to previous interpretations4. The morphology of the foot pads indicates that they were adapted for non-raptorial terrestrial locomotion. Specialized inner secondary feathers called tertials5,6 are observed on both wings. Humeral tertials are absent in non-avian dinosaurs closely related to birds, suggesting that these feathers evolved for flight, creating a continuous aerodynamic surface. These new findings clarify the mosaic of traits present in Archaeopteryx, refine ecological predictions and elucidate the unique evolutionary history of the Archaeopterygidae, providing clues regarding the ancestral avian condition. Analysis of the 'Chicago' Archaeopteryx, a nearly complete and uncrushed specimen, reveals details of the skeleton, soft tissues and plumage of this taxon, providing information on the evolution to avian dinosaur.",

    "abstract": "The structural evolution of molecular hydrogen H2 under multi-megabar compression and its relation to atomic metallic hydrogen is a key unsolved problem in condensed-matter physics. Although dozens of crystal structures have been proposed by theory1–4, only one, the simple hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) structure of only spherical disordered H2, has been previously confirmed in experiments5. Through advancing nano-focused synchrotron X-ray probes, here we report the observation of the transition from hcp H2 to a post-hcp structure with a six-fold larger supercell at pressures above 212 GPa, indicating the change of spherical H2 to various ordered configurations. Theoretical calculations based on our XRD results found a time-averaged structure model in the space group \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$P\\bar{6}2c$$\n                \n               with alternating layers of spherically disordered H2 and new graphene-like layers consisting of H2 trimers (H6) formed by the association of three H2 molecules. This supercell has not been reported by any previous theoretical study for the post-hcp phase, but is close to a number of theoretical models with mixed-layer structures. The evidence of a structural transition beyond hcp establishes the trend of H2 molecular association towards polymerization at extreme pressures, giving clues about the nature of the molecular-to-atomic transition of metallic hydrogen. Considering the spectroscopic behaviours that show strong vibrational and bending peaks of H2 up to 400 GPa, it would be prudent to speculate the continuation of hydrogen molecular polymerization up to its metallization. The observation of the transition from hcp H2 to a post-hcp structure with a six-fold larger supercell at pressures above 212 GPa is reported, indicating the trend of H2 polymerization through molecular association.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis to the cerebrospinal-fluid-filled leptomeninges, or leptomeningeal metastasis, represents a fatal complication of solid tumours1. Multimodal analyses of clinical specimens reveal substantial inflammatory infiltrate in leptomeningeal metastases with enrichment of IFNγ and resulting downstream signalling. Here, to investigate and overcome this futile anti-tumour response within the leptomeninges, we developed syngeneic lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma leptomeningeal-metastasis mouse models. We show that transgenic host mice lacking IFNγ or its receptor fail to control the growth of leptomeningeal metastases growth. Leptomeningeal overexpression of Ifng through a targeted adeno-associated-virus-based system controls cancer cell growth independent of adaptive immunity. Using a suite of transgenic hosts, we demonstrate that leptomeningeal T cells generate IFNγ to actively recruit and activate peripheral myeloid cells, generating a diverse spectrum of dendritic cell subsets. Independent of antigen presentation, migratory CCR7+ dendritic cells orchestrate the influx, proliferation and cytotoxic action of natural killer cells to control cancer cell growth in the leptomeninges. This study identifies unique, leptomeninges-specific IFNγ signalling and suggests an immune-therapeutic approach against tumours within this space.

    "abstract": "Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) has rich ethnic and cultural diversity with a population of nearly 300 million1,2. However, people from MSEA are underrepresented in the current human genomic databases. Here we present the SEA3K genome dataset (phase I), generated by deep short-read whole-genome sequencing of 3,023 individuals from 30 MSEA populations, and long-read whole-genome sequencing of 37 representative individuals. We identified 79.59 million small variants and 96,384 structural variants, among which 22.83 million small variants and 24,622 structural variants are unique to this dataset. We observed a high genetic heterogeneity across MSEA populations, reflected by the varied combinations of genetic components. We identified 44 genomic regions with strong signatures of Darwinian positive selection, covering 89 genes involved in varied physiological systems such as physical traits and immune response. Furthermore, we observed varied patterns of archaic Denisovan introgression in MSEA populations, supporting the proposal of at least two distinct instances of Denisovan admixture into modern humans in Asia3. We also detected genomic regions that suggest adaptive archaic introgressions in MSEA populations. The large number of novel genomic variants in MSEA populations highlight the necessity of studying regional populations that can help answer key questions related to prehistory, genetic adaptation and complex diseases. Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 3,023 human genomes from mainland Southeast Asia identifies high genetic heterogeneity among populations in the region and many unique small and structural variants.",

    "abstract": "In quantum mechanics, empty space is not void but is characterized by vacuum-field fluctuations, which underlie phenomena such as the Lamb shift1, spontaneous emission, and the Casimir effect2. Due to their quantitatively small relative contributions in free-space atomic physics, they were traditionally overlooked in solid-state systems. Recently, however, the interplay between electronic correlations and quantum electrodynamical effects in low-dimensional systems has become a rapidly advancing area in condensed matter physics3–5, with substantial implications for quantum materials and device engineering. High-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in the quantum Hall regime6 offer an ideal platform to investigate how vacuum electromagnetic fields affect strongly correlated electronic states. Here we demonstrate that adjusting the coupling strength between a two-dimensional electron gas and the vacuum fields of a hovering split-ring resonator leads to a significant reduction in exchange splitting at odd-integer filling factors, along with an enhancement of fractional quantum Hall gaps at filling factors 4/3, 5/3 and 7/5. Theoretical analysis indicates that these effects stem from an effective long-range attractive interaction mediated by virtual cavity photons in regions with strong vacuum electric field gradients. Our findings uncover a new mechanism by which cavity vacuum fields can reshape electronic correlations in quantum Hall systems, establishing a new approach for manipulating correlated quantum phases in low-dimensional materials and paving the way for engineering tailored many-body interactions in compact devices. Using a system to adjust the strength of cavity vacuum fields penetrating a Hall bar, a study describes the effect of the vacuum field of a cavity on electronic correlations in quantum Hall systems.",

    "abstract": "Ku70 and Ku80 form the Ku heterodimer, a ring-shaped complex that initiates the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway1. Ku binds to double-stranded DNA ends and recruits other NHEJ factors, including LIG4 and DNA-PKcs. Although Ku can bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)2 and trap mutated DNA-PKcs on ribosomal RNA3,4, the physiological role of the Ku–RNA interaction in otherwise wild-type cells remains unclear. Notably, Ku is dispensable for mouse development5,6 but is essential in human cells7. Despite their similar genome sizes, human cells express about 100-fold more Ku than mouse cells, suggesting that Ku has functions beyond NHEJ, possibly through a dose-sensitive interaction with dsRNA, which binds Ku 10 to 100 times more weakly than double-stranded DNA2,8. Here, Ku depletion induces profound interferon and NF-κB signalling via the dsRNA sensor MDA5–RIG-I and MAVS. Prolonged Ku degradation further activates other dsRNA sensors, especially PKR (also known as EIF2AK2) (suppressing translation) and OAS–RNaseL (cleaving ribosomal RNA), leading to growth arrest and cell death. Knockout of MAVS, RIG-I or MDA5 suppressed interferon signalling and, similarly to PKR knockout, partially rescued Ku-depleted human cells. Ku crosslinking and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed binding of Ku to diverse dsRNA molecules, predominantly stem-loops in primate-specific antisense Alu elements9 in introns and 3′ untranslated regions. Ku expression is higher in primates than in non-primate mammals and is tightly correlated with Alu expansion. Thus, Ku has a vital role in accommodating Alu expansion in primates, limiting dsRNA-induced innate immunity, which explains its high expression and essential function in human cells. Studies on the essentiality of Ku in human cells reveal that Ku interacts with diverse double-stranded RNA molecules, including antisense Alu, and enables tolerance of Alu sequence expansion in primates.",

    "abstract": "Bar structures are present in about half of local disk galaxies1 and play pivotal roles in secular galaxy evolution. Bars impose a non-axisymmetric perturbation on the rotating disk and transport gas inwards to feed the central starburst and, possibly, the activity of the nuclear supermassive black hole2. They are believed to be long-lived structures3,4 and are now identified at redshift z > 2 (refs. 5,6). However, little is known about the onset and effects of bars in the early cosmic epoch because the spectroscopy of distant bars at sufficient resolution is prohibitively expensive. Here we report on a kinematic study of a galactic bar at redshift 2.467, 2.6 billion years after the Big Bang. We observed the carbon monoxide and atomic carbon emission lines of the dusty star-forming galaxy J0107a and found the bar of J0107a has gas distribution and motion in a pattern identical to local bars7–9. At the same time, the bar drives large-scale non-circular motions that dominate over disk rotation, funnelling molecular gas into its centre at a rate of approximately 600 solar masses per year. Our results show that bar-driven dynamical processes and secular evolution were already at play 11.1 billion years ago, powering active star formation amid the gas-rich and far-infrared luminous growth phase in a massive disk galaxy. Gas distribution and motion patterns driven by a galactic bar of the J0107a dusty star-forming galaxy have analogues in local bars, indicating that similar processes of active star formation were already operating 11.1 billion years ago.",

    "abstract": "The isotopic composition of lavas associated with mantle plumes has previously been interpreted in the light of core–mantle interaction, suggesting that mantle plumes may transport core material to Earth’s surface1–5. However, a definitive fingerprint of Earth’s core in the mantle remains unconfirmed. Precious metals, such as ruthenium (Ru), are highly concentrated in the metallic core but extremely depleted in the silicate mantle. Recently discovered mass-independent Ru isotope variations (ε100Ru) in ancient rocks show that the Ru isotope composition of accreted material changed during later stages of Earth’s growth6, indicating that the core and mantle must have different Ru isotope compositions. This illustrates the potential of Ru isotopes as a new tracer for core–mantle interaction. Here we report Ru isotope anomalies for ocean island basalts. Basalts from Hawaii have higher ε100Ru than the ambient mantle. Combined with unradiogenic tungsten (W) isotope ratios, this is diagnostic of a core contribution to their mantle sources. The combined Ru and W isotope systematics of Hawaiian basalts are best explained by simple core entrainment but addition of core-derived oxide minerals at the core–mantle boundary is a possibility. Ru isotopes are proposed as tracers for core–mantle interaction on Earth, and anomalies for ocean island basalts from Hawaii are reported that have higher ε100Ru than the ambient mantle.",

This explains the observed dearth of S-type planets in tight binary star systems10–13. ν Octantis, whose stellar components have a mean separation of 2.6 au, has long been suspected of hosting a circum-primary planet in a retrograde and exceptionally wide orbit that resides midway between the stars14–20. Strong theoretical grounds against its formation and the absence of observational precedents, however, have challenged the reality of the planet. Here we present new radial velocity measurements that consolidate the planet hypothesis. Stable fits to all radial velocity data require the planetary orbit to be retrograde and practically coplanar. We also report the critical discovery from adaptive optics imaging that the companion star is a white dwarf. Our exploration of credible primordial binary orbital settings shows that the minimum separation between the stars was 1.3 au initially, which overlaps the current planetary orbit and makes any scenarios in which the circum-primary planetary orbit formed coevally with the young stars hardly conceivable. The retrograde planet must have originated from a circumbinary orbit or a second-generation protoplanetary disc, showing the role of binary stellar evolution in the formation and evolution of planetary systems. A planet in a retrograde orbit around a star with a close-in white dwarf companion reveals the role of binary stellar evolution in the formation and evolution of planets.",

    "abstract": "Cell heterogeneity is a universal feature of life. Although biological processes affected by cell-to-cell variation are manifold, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity and differential drug responses, the sources of cell heterogeneity remain largely unclear1,2. Mutational and epigenetic signatures from cancer (epi)genomics are powerful for deducing processes that shaped cancer genome evolution3–5. However, retrospective analyses face difficulties in resolving how cellular heterogeneity emerges and is propagated to subsequent cell generations. Here, we used multigenerational single-cell tracking based on endogenously labelled proteins and custom-designed computational tools to elucidate how oncogenic perturbations induce sister cell asymmetry and phenotypic heterogeneity. Dual CRISPR-based genome editing enabled simultaneous tracking of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions. Cell lineage trees of up to four generations were tracked in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses were combined with end-point measurements of cell cycle and DNA damage markers through iterative staining. Besides revealing replication and repair dynamics, damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell heterogeneity across multiple cell generations, through combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we delineate how common oncogenic events trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct outcomes for genome integrity. Our study provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level and sheds light onto cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development. A multigenerational single-cell tracking approach provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level, offering insights into cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria defend themselves from viral predation using diverse immune systems, many of which target foreign DNA for degradation1. Defence-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this strategy by using DNA synthesis instead2,3. We and others recently showed that DRT2 systems use an RNA template to assemble a de novo gene that encodes the antiviral effector protein Neo4,5. It remains unclear whether similar mechanisms of defence are used by other related DRT families. Here, we show that DRT9 systems defend against phage using DNA homopolymer synthesis. Viral infection triggers polydeoxyadenylate (poly-dA) accumulation in the cell, driving abortive infection and population-level immunity. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal how a non-coding RNA serves as both a structural scaffold and reverse transcription template to direct hexameric complex assembly and poly-dA synthesis. Notably, biochemical and functional experiments identify tyrosine residues within the reverse transcriptase itself that probably prime DNA synthesis, leading to the formation of protein–DNA covalent adducts. Synthesis of poly-dA by DRT9 in vivo is regulated by the competing activities of phage-encoded triggers and host-encoded silencers. Collectively, our study identifies a nucleic-acid-driven defence system that expands the paradigm of bacterial immunity and broadens the known functions of reverse transcriptases. A bacterial reverse transcriptase synthesizes polydeoxyadenylate to provide population-level immunity against viral infection.",

However, how diverse cell types are organized within tissue niches for cohesive functioning remains largely unknown. Here we systematically characterized cross-tissue coordinated cellular modules in healthy tissues, uncovering their spatiotemporal dynamics and phenotypic associations, and examined their rewiring in cancer. We first compiled a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas from 35 human tissues, revealing substantial inter-tissue variability in cellular composition. By leveraging covariance in cellular abundance, we identified 12 cellular modules with distinct cellular compositions, tissue prevalences and spatial organizations, and demonstrated coordinated intercellular communication within cellular modules using in situ spatial and in vivo perturbation data. Among them, two immune cellular modules in the spleen showed contrasting chronological dynamics with ageing. Analysis of multicellular changes in the breast revealed a menopausal trajectory associated with fibroblast dynamics. Furthermore, interrogation across cancer types uncovered simultaneous rewiring of two types of multicellular ecosystem during tumour progression, including the loss of tissue-specific healthy organization and the emergence of a convergent cancerous ecosystem. These findings reveal fundamental organizing principles of multicellular ecosystems in health and cancer, laying a foundation for further investigations into tissue-level functional coordination across diverse contexts. Comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of 35 human tissues reveals 12 cross-tissue coordinated cellular modules that exhibit intramodule communication and dynamic changes with ageing, and whose organization is perturbed during cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Self-recognition is a fundamental cellular process across evolution and forms the basis of neuronal self-avoidance1–4. Clustered protocadherin (cPcdh) proteins, which comprise a large family of isoform-specific homophilic recognition molecules, have a pivotal role in the neuronal self-avoidance that is required for mammalian brain development5–7. The probabilistic expression of different cPcdh isoforms confers unique identities on neurons and forms the basis for neuronal processes to discriminate between self and non-self5,6,8. Whether this self-recognition mechanism also exists in astrocytes remains unknown. Here we report that γC3, a specific isoform in the Pcdhγ family, is enriched in human and mouse astrocytes. Using genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that γC3 acts autonomously to regulate astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse visual cortex. To determine whether γC3 proteins act by promoting recognition between processes of the same astrocyte, we generated pairs of γC3 chimeric proteins that are capable of heterophilic binding to each other, but incapable of homophilic binding. Co-expression of complementary heterophilic binding isoform pairs in the same γC3-null astrocyte restored normal morphology. By contrast, chimeric γC3 proteins individually expressed in single γC3-null mutant astrocytes did not. These data establish that self-recognition mediated by γC3 contributes to astrocyte development in the mammalian brain. Human and mouse astrocytes express the protocadherin PcdhγC3, which promotes self-recognition of individual astrocytes, thereby contributing to normal astrocyte and brain development.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution affects climate through various complex interactions1. It perturbs the Earth’s radiative energy balance and alters the atmospheric oxidation capacity, which determines the lifetimes of short-lived climate forcers, such as methane1. A key mechanism in this dynamic is the impact of air pollutants on the hydroxyl radical (OH), the most important oxidant in the troposphere, which accounts for approximately 90% of the methane chemical sink2. However, a comprehensive quantification of the interactions between air pollutants, OH and methane over decadal timescales remains incomplete2. Here we develop an integrated observation-driven and model-driven approach to quantify how variations in key air pollutants influence the methane chemical sink and alter the methane budget. Our results indicate that, from 2005 to 2021, enhanced tropospheric ozone, increased water vapour and decreased carbon monoxide levels collectively contributed to a 1.3–2.0 Tg year−1 increase per year in the global methane sink, thereby buffering atmospheric methane growth rates. This increase in the methane sink was primarily concentrated in tropical regions and exhibited a north–south asymmetry. Periods of high methane growth were typically linked to abrupt OH level declines driven by fluctuations in air pollutants, especially during extreme events such as mega wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study suggests a trade-off between O3 pollution control and methane removal mediated by OH and highlights the risk of increasing carbon monoxide emissions from widespread wildfires. An integrated observation-driven and model-driven approach demonstrates that, from 2005 to 2021, periods of high atmospheric methane growth were linked to trends and variations in OH levels driven by fluctuations in air pollutants, especially during extreme events.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electronvolt (eV)-scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications1,2. A variety of such magnetic states with non-trivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d-wave, g-wave or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets3–7. Achieving voltage-based control of the non-uniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energy-efficient and compact devices for information storage and processing8,9. Spin-spiral type II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order that directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry-protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order10–14. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principles calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent an observation of p-wave magnetism in a spin-spiral type II multiferroic, which may lead to the development of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets. Experimental observations and theoretical analysis provide evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits p-wave magnetism and its spin chirality is related to ferroelectric polarization, which can be electrically controlled.",

    "abstract": "Lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated ex vivo gene therapy for haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has delivered on the promise of a ‘one-and-done’ treatment for several genetic diseases1. However, ex vivo manipulation and patient conditioning before transplantation are major hurdles that could be overcome by an in vivo approach. Here we demonstrate that in vivo gene delivery to HSPCs after systemic LV administration is enabled by the substantial trafficking of these cells from the liver to the bone marrow in newborn mice. We improved gene-transfer efficiency using a phagocytosis-shielded LV, successfully reaching bona fide HSPCs capable of long-term multilineage output and engraftment after serial transplantation, as confirmed by clonal tracking. HSPC mobilization further increased gene transfer, extending the window of intervention, although permissiveness to LV transduction declined with age. We successfully tested this in vivo strategy in mouse models of adenosine deaminase deficiency, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis and Fanconi anaemia. Interestingly, in vivo gene transfer provided a selective advantage to corrected HSPCs in Fanconi anaemia, leading to near-complete haematopoietic reconstitution and prevention of bone marrow failure. Given that circulating HSPCs in humans are also most abundant shortly after birth, in vivo HSPC gene transfer holds strong translational potential across multiple diseases. In vivo gene delivery to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in newborn mice using engineered lentiviral vectors shows promise as an effective treatment for genetic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Modelling liver disease in vitro requires systems that replicate disease progression1,2. Current tissue-derived organoids do not reproduce the complex cellular composition and tissue architecture observed in vivo3. Here, we describe a multicellular organoid system composed of adult hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells that recapitulates the architecture of the liver periportal region and, when manipulated, models aspects of cholestatic injury and biliary fibrosis. We first generate reproducible hepatocyte organoids with a functional bile canaliculi network that retain morphological features of in vivo tissue. By combining these with cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts, we generate assembloids that mimic the cellular interactions of the periportal region. Assembloids are functional, consistently draining bile from bile canaliculi into the bile duct. Of note, manipulating the relative number of portal mesenchymal cells is sufficient to induce a fibrotic-like state, independently of an immune compartment. By generating chimeric assembloids of mutant and wild-type cells, or after gene knockdown, we show proof of concept that our system is amenable to investigating gene function and cell-autonomous mechanisms. Together, we demonstrate that liver assembloids represent a suitable in vitro system to study bile canaliculi formation, bile drainage and how different cell types contribute to cholestatic disease and biliary fibrosis in an all-in-one model. An organoid system comprising adult mouse hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells recapitulates liver morphology, biliary function and fibrotic pathology, providing a new model for studies of hepatic biology.",

    "abstract": "How does the brain convert visual input into specific motor actions1,2? In Drosophila, visual projection neurons (VPNs)3,4 perform this visuomotor transformation by converting retinal positional information into synapse number in the brain5. The molecular basis of this phenomenon remains unknown. We addressed this issue in LPLC2 (ref. 6), a VPN type that detects looming motion and preferentially drives escape behaviour to stimuli approaching from the dorsal visual field with progressively weaker responses ventrally. This correlates with a dorsoventral gradient of synaptic inputs into and outputs from LPLC2. Here we report that LPLC2 neurons sampling different regions of visual space exhibit graded expression of cell recognition molecules matching these synaptic gradients. Dpr13 shapes LPLC2 outputs by binding DIP-ε in premotor descending neurons mediating escape. Beat-VI shapes LPLC2 inputs by binding Side-II in upstream motion-detecting neurons. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments show that these molecular gradients act instructively to determine synapse number. These patterns, in turn, fine-tune the perception of the stimulus and drive the behavioural response. Similar transcriptomic variation within neuronal types is observed in the vertebrate brain7 and may shape synapse number via gradients of cell recognition molecules acting through both genetically hard-wired programs and experience. Gradients of cell recognition molecules wire a sensorimotor interface in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid space around the brain drains to lymph nodes in the neck, but the connections and regulation have been challenging to identify1–24. Here we used fluorescent tracers in Prox1–GFP lymphatic reporter mice to map the pathway of CSF outflow through lymphatics to superficial cervical lymph nodes. CSF entered initial lymphatics in the meninges at the skull base and continued through extracranial periorbital, olfactory, nasopharyngeal and hard palate lymphatics, and then through smooth muscle-covered superficial cervical lymphatics to submandibular lymph nodes. Tracer studies in adult mice revealed that a substantial amount of total CSF outflow to the neck drained to superficial cervical lymph nodes. However, aged mice had fewer lymphatics in the nasal mucosa and hard palate and reduced CSF outflow to cervical lymph nodes. Superficial cervical lymphatics in aged mice had increased endothelial cell expression of Nos3, encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), but had less eNOS protein and impaired nitric oxide signalling. Manipulation of superficial cervical lymphatics through intact skin by a force-regulated mechanical device doubled CSF outflow and corrected drainage impairment in aged mice. This manipulation increased CSF outflow by compressing superficial cervical lymphatics while having little effect on their normal spontaneous contractions. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of superficial cervical lymphatics for CSF outflow and the potential for reversing CSF drainage impairment by non-invasive mechanical stimulation. The outflow pathway of cerebrospinal fluid into lymph nodes in the neck and how non-invasive mechanical stimulation can enhance drainage and restore impaired outflow in aged mice are explored.",

    "abstract": "Carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are used in many applications in the global energy transition, including for lightweighting aircraft and vehicles and in wind turbine blades, shipping containers and gas storage vessels1–4. Given the high cost and energy-intensive manufacture of CFRPs5–7, recycling strategies are needed that recover intact carbon fibres and the epoxy-amine resin components. Here we show that acetic acid efficiently depolymerizes both aliphatic and aromatic epoxy-amine thermosets used in CFRPs to recoverable monomers, yielding pristine carbon fibres. Deconstruction of materials from multiple sectors demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, providing clean fibres from 2 h reactions. The optimal conditions were scaled to 80.0 g of post-consumer CFRPs, and demonstrative composites were fabricated from the recycled carbon fibres, which were recycled two more times, maintaining their strength throughout. Process modelling and techno-economic analysis, with feedstock cost informed by wind turbine blade waste generation8, indicates this method is cost effective, with a minimum selling price of US$1.50 per kg for recycled carbon fibres whereas life cycle assessment shows process greenhouse gas emissions around 99% lower than virgin carbon fibre production. Overall, this approach could enable recycling of industrial CFRPs as it provides clean, mechanically viable recycled carbon fibres and recoverable resin monomers from the thermoset. Acetic acid efficiently depolymerizes aliphatic and aromatic epoxy-amine thermosets used in carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) to yield recoverable monomers and pristine carbon fibres, which, based on process modelling, techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment, could enable industrial recycling of CFRPs.",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes highly demanded RNAs grouped into three types of classical promoters, including type 1 (5S rRNA), type 2 (tRNA) and type 3 (short non-coding RNAs, such as U6, 7SK and RNase H1) promoters1–7. While structures of the Pol III preinitiation complex (PIC)8–11 and elongation complex (EC)12–16 have been determined, the mechanism underlying the transition from initiation to elongation remains unclear. Here we reconstituted seven human Pol III transcribing complexes (TC4, TC5, TC6, TC8, TC10, TC12 and TC13) halted on U6 promoters with nascent RNAs of 4–13 nucleotides. Cryo-electron microscopy structures captured initially transcribing complexes (ITCs; TC4 and TC5) and ECs (TC6–13). Together with KMnO4 footprinting, the data reveal extensive modular rearrangements: the transcription bubble expands from PIC to TC5, followed by general transcription factor (GTF) dissociation and abrupt bubble collapse from TC5 to TC6, marking the ITC–EC transition. In TC5, SNAPc and TFIIIB remain bound to the promoter and Pol III, while the RNA–DNA hybrid adopts a tilted conformation with template DNA blocked by BRF2, a TFIIIB subunit. Hybrid forward translocation during ITC–EC transition triggers BRF2-finger retraction, GTF release and transcription-bubble collapse. Pol III then escapes the promoter while GTFs stay bound upstream, potentially enabling reinitiation. These findings reveal molecular insights into Pol III dynamics and reinitiation mechanisms on type 3 promoters of highly demanded small RNAs, with the earliest documented initiation–elongation transition for an RNA polymerase. Reconstitution of seven human RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribing complexes (TC4/5/6/8/10/12/13) halted on U6 promoters with nascent RNAs of 4–13 nucleotides offers molecular insights into Pol III dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Clot-induced blockage in arteries or veins can cause severe medical conditions1. Mechanical thrombectomy is a minimally invasive technique used to treat ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and peripheral vascular disease2–4 by removing clots through aspiration5, stent retriever6 or cutting mechanisms7. However, current mechanical thrombectomy methods fail to remove clots in 10–30% of patients8–10, especially in the case of large, fibrin-rich clots11. These methods can also rupture and fragment clots12, causing distal emboli and poor outcomes13. To overcome these challenges, we develop the milli-spinner thrombectomy, which uses a simple yet innovative mechanics concept to modify the clot’s microstructure, facilitating its removal. The milli-spinner works by mechanically densifying the clot’s fibrin network and releasing red blood cells through spinning-induced compression and shear forces. It can shrink the clot volume by 95% for easy and fast removal. In vitro tests in pulmonary and cerebral artery flow models and in vivo experiments in swine models demonstrate that the milli-spinner achieves ultrafast clot debulking and high-fidelity revascularization, outperforming aspiration thrombectomy. The milli-spinner thrombectomy directly modifies the clot microstructure to facilitate clot removal, improving mechanical thrombectomy success rates compared with current methods that rely on clot rupture or cutting. This approach offers a promising new direction for mechanical thrombectomy devices, especially for treating ischaemic stroke, pulmonary embolism and peripheral thrombosis. The milli-spinner thrombectomy facilitates fast, complete clot removal by using spinning-induced compression and shear forces to mechanically modify the clot microstructure through densifying the fibrin network and releasing red blood cells, thus reducing clot volume.",

    "abstract": "Building a useful photonic quantum computer requires robust techniques to synthesize optical states that can encode qubits. Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill (GKP) states1 offer one of the most attractive classes of such qubit encodings, as they enable the implementation of universal gate sets with straightforward, deterministic and room temperature-compatible Gaussian operations2. Existing pioneering demonstrations generating optical GKP states3 and other complex non-Gaussian states4–11 have relied on free-space optical components, hindering the scaling eventually required for a utility-scale system. Here we use an ultra-low-loss integrated photonic chip fabricated on a customized multilayer silicon nitride 300-mm wafer platform, coupled over fibre with high-efficiency photon number resolving detectors, to generate GKP qubit states. These states show critical mode-level features necessary for fault tolerance, including at least four resolvable peaks in both p and q quadratures, and a clear lattice structure of negative Wigner function regions, in this case a 3 × 3 grid. We also show that our GKP states show sufficient structure to indicate that the devices used to make them could, after further reduction in optical losses, yield states for the fault-tolerant regime. This experiment validates a key pillar of bosonic architectures for photonic quantum computing2,12, paving the way for arrays of GKP sources that will supply future fault-tolerant machines. An ultra-low-loss integrated photonic chip fabricated on a customized multilayer silicon nitride 300-mm wafer platform, coupled over fibre with high-efficiency photon number resolving detectors, is used to generate Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill qubit states.",

    "abstract": "Compounds consisting only of the element nitrogen (polynitrogens or nitrogen allotropes) are considered promising clean energy-storage materials owing to their immense energy content that is much higher than hydrogen, ammonia or hydrazine, which are in common use, and because they release only harmless nitrogen on decomposition1. However, their extreme instability poses a substantial synthetic challenge and no neutral molecular nitrogen allotrope beyond N2 has been isolated2,3. Here we present the room-temperature preparation of molecular N6 (hexanitrogen) through the gas-phase reaction of chlorine or bromine with silver azide, followed by trapping in argon matrices at 10 K. We also prepared neat N6 as a film at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K), further indicating its stability. Infrared and ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, 15N-isotope labelling and ab initio computations firmly support our findings. The preparation of a metastable molecular nitrogen allotrope beyond N2 contributes to our fundamental scientific knowledge and possibly opens new opportunities for future energy-storage concepts.  The facile synthesis and spectroscopic identification of previously unreported hexanitrogen C2h-N6 is described, representing experimentally realized neutral molecular nitrogen allotropes beyond N2 that exhibit unexpected stability.",

    "abstract": "The generation of self-tolerant repertoires of T cells depends on the expression of peripheral self antigens in the thymic epithelium1 and the presence of small populations of cells that mimic the diverse phenotypes of peripheral tissues2–7. Whereas the molecular underpinnings of self-antigen expression have been extensively studied8, the developmental origins and differentiation pathways of thymic mimetic cells remain to be identified. Moreover, the histological identification of myoid and other peripheral cell types as components of the thymic microenvironment of many vertebrate species9 raises questions regarding the evolutionary origin of this unique tolerance mechanism. Here we show that during mouse development, mimetic cells appear in the microenvironment in two successive waves. Cells that exhibit transcriptional signatures characteristic of muscle, ionocyte, goblet and ciliated cells emerge before birth, whereas others, such as those that mimic enterohepatic cells and skin keratinocytes, appear postnatally. These two groups also respond differently to modulations of thymic epithelial cell progenitor pools caused by deletions of Foxn1 and Ascl1, expression of a hypomorphic variant of the transcription factor FOXN1, and overexpression of the signalling molecules BMP4 and FGF7. Differences in mimetic cell populations were also observed in thymic microenvironments reconstructed by replacement of mouse Foxn1 with evolutionarily ancient Foxn1/4 gene family members, including the Foxn4 gene of the cephalochordate amphioxus and the Foxn4 and Foxn1 genes of a cartilaginous fish. Whereas some cell types, such as ciliated cells, develop in the thymus in the absence of FOXN1, mimetic cells that appear postnatally, such as enterohepatic cells, require the activity of the vertebrate-specific transcription factor FOXN1. The thymus of cartilaginous fishes and the thymoid of lampreys, a representative of jawless vertebrates, which exhibit an alternative adaptive immune system10, also harbour cells that express genes encoding peripheral tissue components such as the liver-specific protein transthyretin. Our findings suggest an evolutionary model of successive changes of thymic epithelial genetic networks enabling the coordinated contribution of peripheral antigen expression and mimetic cell formation to achieve central tolerance for vertebrate-specific innovations of tissues such as the liver11,12. In mice, tissue-mimetic cells appear in thymus in two distinct waves, creating two distinct pools of mimetic cells, each expressing antigens characteristic of different cell types.",

    "abstract": "Conservation of damaged oil paintings requires manual inpainting of losses1,2, leading to months-long treatments of considerable expense; 70% of paintings in institutional collections are locked away from public view, in part because of treatment cost3,4. Recent advancements in digital image reconstruction have helped to envision treatment results, although without any direct means of achieving them5–8. Here I describe the physically applied digital restoration of a painting, a highly damaged oil-on-panel attributed to the Master of the Prado Adoration from the late fifteenth century. In parallel, 5,612 losses spanning 66,205 mm2 and 57,314 colours were infilled with a reversible laminate mask comprising a colour-accurate bilayer of printed pigments on polymeric films. To ensure the effectiveness of the restoration, ethical principles in painting conservation were implemented quantitatively for digital mask construction, a critically important foundation lacking in the current digital restoration literature. The infill process took 3.5 h, an estimated 66 times faster than conventional inpainting, and the result closely matched the simulation. This approach grants greatly increased foresight and flexibility to conservators, enabling the restoration of countless damaged paintings deemed unworthy of high conservation budgets. A digital restoration technique for damaged paintings was developed, in which a colour-accurate bilayer mask of printed pigments on polymeric films was used, reducing treatment time and cost while adhering to ethical conservation principles.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of fructose as a low-cost food additive, epidemiological evidence suggests that high fructose consumption during pregnancy or adolescence is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment1–3. An essential step in appropriate mammalian neurodevelopment is the phagocytic elimination of newly formed neurons by microglia, the resident professional phagocyte of the central nervous system4. Whether high fructose consumption in early life affects microglial phagocytosis and whether this directly affects neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here we show that offspring born to female mice fed a high-fructose diet and neonates exposed to high fructose exhibit decreased phagocytic activity in vivo. Notably, deletion of the high-affinity fructose transporter GLUT5 (also known as SLC2A5) in neonatal microglia completely reversed microglia phagocytic dysfunction, suggesting that high fructose directly affects neonatal development by suppressing microglial phagocytosis. Mechanistically, we found that high-fructose treatment of mouse and human microglia suppresses phagocytosis capacity, which is rescued in GLUT5-deficient microglia. Additionally, we found that high fructose drives significant GLUT5-dependent fructose uptake and catabolism to fructose 6-phosphate, rewiring microglial metabolism towards a hypo-phagocytic state in part by enforcing mitochondrial localization of the enzyme hexokinase 2. Mice exposed to high fructose as neonates develop anxiety-like behaviour as adolescents—an effect that is rescued in GLUT5-deficient mice. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological observation that high-fructose exposure during early life is associated with increased prevalence of adolescent anxiety disorders. Exposure of mice to high fructose during gestation or early postnatal life causes decreased microglial phagocytosis during brain development and leads to anxiety-like behaviour in adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Understanding thermal transport mechanisms across material interfaces is crucial for advancing semiconductor technologies, particularly in miniaturized devices operating under extreme power densities1,2. Although the interface phonon-mediated processes are theoretically established3–6 as the dominant mechanism for interfacial thermal transport in semiconductors7, their nanoscale dynamics remain experimentally elusive owing to challenges in measuring the temperature and non-equilibrium phonon distributions across the buried interface8–11. Here we overcome these limitations by using in situ vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an electron microscope to nanoscale profile temperature gradients across the AlN–SiC interface during thermal transport and map its non-equilibrium phonon occupations at sub-nanometre resolution. We observe a sharp temperature drop within about 2 nm across the interface, enabling direct extraction of relative interfacial thermal resistance (ITR). During thermal transport, the mismatch of phonon modes’ thermal conductivity at the interface causes substantial non-equilibrium phonons nearby, making the populations of interface modes different under forward and reverse heat flow and also leading to marked changes in the modal temperature of AlN optical phonons within about 3 nm of the interface. These results reveal the phonon transport dynamics at the (sub-)nanoscale and establish the inelastic phonon scattering mechanism involved by interface modes, offering valuable insights into the engineering of thermal interfaces. In situ vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy is used to examine phonon transport dynamics across the AlN–SiC interface during thermal transport at sub-nanometre resolution, demonstrating a sharp temperature drop within about 2 nm across the interface.",

    "abstract": "Trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) are important to marine life and are essential tools for studying ocean processes1. Two different frameworks have arisen regarding marine TEI cycling: reversible scavenging favours water-column control on TEI distributions2–5, and seafloor boundary exchange emphasizes sedimentary imprints on water-column biogeochemistry6,7. These two views lead to disparate interpretations of TEI behaviours8–10. Here we use rare earth elements and neodymium isotopes as exemplar tracers of particle scavenging11 and boundary exchange6,7,12. We integrate these data with models of particle cycling and sediment diagenesis to propose a general framework for marine TEI cycling. We show that, for elements with greater affinity for manganese oxide than biogenic particles, scavenging is a net sink throughout the water column, contrary to a common assumption for reversible scavenging3,13. In this case, a benthic flux supports increasing elemental concentrations with water depth. This sedimentary source consists of two components: one recycled from elements scavenged by water-column particles, and another newly introduced to the water column through marine silicate weathering inside sediment8,14,15. Abyssal oxic diagenesis drives this benthic source, and exerts a strong influence on water-column biogeochemistry through seafloor geometry and bottom-intensified turbulent mixing16,17. Our findings affirm the role of authigenic minerals, often overshadowed by biogenic particles, in water-column cycling18, and suggest that the abyssal seafloor, often regarded as inactive, is a focus of biogeochemical transformation19,20. Rare earth element and neodymium isotope data combined with models of particle cycling and sediment diagenesis suggest that the abyssal seafloor is a key driver of trace-metal biogeochemical cycles.",

    "abstract": "Although cell-fate specification is generally attributed to transcriptional regulation, emerging data also indicate a role for molecules linked with intermediary metabolism. For example, α-ketoglutarate (αKG), which fuels energy production and biosynthetic pathways in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is also a co-factor for chromatin-modifying enzymes1–3. Nevertheless, whether TCA-cycle metabolites regulate cell fate during tissue homeostasis and regeneration remains unclear. Here we show that TCA-cycle enzymes are expressed in the intestine in a heterogeneous manner, with components of the αKG dehydrogenase complex4–6 upregulated in the absorptive lineage and downregulated in the secretory lineage. Using genetically modified mouse models and organoids, we reveal that 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), the enzymatic subunit of the αKG dehydrogenase complex, has a dual, lineage-specific role. In the absorptive lineage, OGDH is upregulated by HNF4 transcription factors to maintain the bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs of enterocytes. In the secretory lineage, OGDH is downregulated through a process that, when modelled, increases the levels of αKG and stimulates the differentiation of secretory cells. Consistent with this, in mouse models of colitis with impaired differentiation and maturation of secretory cells, inhibition of OGDH or supplementation with αKG reversed these impairments and promoted tissue healing. Hence, OGDH dependency is lineage-specific, and its regulation helps to direct cell fate, offering insights for targeted therapies in regenerative medicine. Metabolic enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, such as 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, are differentially expressed in absorptive and secretory lineages, guiding cell fate establishment and offering insights for targeted regenerative therapies.",

    "abstract": "Sex inequalities in cancer are well documented, but the current limited understanding is hindering advances in precision medicine and therapies1. Consideration of ethnicity, age and sex is essential for the management of cancer patients because they underlie important differences in both incidence and response to treatment2,3. Age-related hormone production, which is a consistent divergence between the sexes, is underestimated in cancers that are not recognized as being hormone dependent4–6. Here, we show that premenopausal women have increased vulnerability to cancers, and we identify the cell–cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin as a crucial component in the oestrogen response in various cancers, including melanoma. In a mouse model of melanoma, we discovered an oestrogen-sensitizing pathway connecting E-cadherin, β-catenin, oestrogen receptor-α and GRPR that promotes melanoma aggressiveness in women. Inhibiting this pathway by targeting GRPR or oestrogen receptor-α reduces metastasis in mice, indicating its therapeutic potential. Our study introduces a concept linking hormone sensitivity and tumour phenotype in which hormones affect cell phenotype and aggressiveness. We have identified an integrated pro-tumour pathway in women and propose that targeting a G-protein-coupled receptor with drugs not commonly used for cancer treatment could be more effective in treating E-cadherin-dependent cancers in women. This study emphasizes the importance of sex-specific factors in cancer management and offers hope of improving outcomes in various cancers. A study finding an oestrogen-sensing signalling pathway that promotes melanoma metastasis only in female mice emphasizes the importance of recognizing sex-specific factors in cancer management.",

    "abstract": "Chest radiography frequently serves as baseline imaging for most lung diseases1. Deep learning has great potential for automating the interpretation of chest radiography2. However, existing chest radiographic deep learning models are limited in diagnostic scope, generalizability, adaptability, robustness and extensibility. To overcome these limitations, we have developed Ark+, a foundation model applied to chest radiography and pretrained by cyclically accruing and reusing the knowledge from heterogeneous expert labels in numerous datasets. Ark+ excels in diagnosing thoracic diseases. It expands the diagnostic scope and addresses potential misdiagnosis. It can adapt to evolving diagnostic needs and respond to novel diseases. It can learn rare conditions from a few samples and transfer to new diagnostic settings without training. It tolerates data biases and long-tailed distributions, and it supports federated learning to preserve privacy. All codes and pretrained models have been released, so that Ark+ is open for fine-tuning, local adaptation and improvement. It is extensible to several modalities. Thus, it is a foundation model for medical imaging. The exceptional capabilities of Ark+ stem from our insight: aggregating various datasets diversifies the patient populations and accrues knowledge from many experts to yield unprecedented performance while reducing annotation costs3. The development of Ark+ reveals that open models trained by accruing and reusing knowledge from heterogeneous expert annotations with a multitude of public (big or small) datasets can surpass the performance of proprietary models trained on large data. We hope that our findings will inspire more researchers to share code and datasets or federate privacy-preserving data to create open foundation models with diverse, global expertise and patient populations, thus accelerating open science and democratizing AI for medicine. Ark+, a fully open artificial intelligence foundation model, demonstrates exceptional capabilities in diagnosing common, rare and novel thoracic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Representation learning in neural networks may be implemented with supervised or unsupervised algorithms, distinguished by the availability of instruction. In the sensory cortex, perceptual learning drives neural plasticity1–13, but it is not known whether this is due to supervised or unsupervised learning. Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs) while mice learned multiple tasks, as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli. Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward-prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning. Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction that we validated with behavioural experiments. During visual learning, neural plasticity is driven by unsupervised learning in mice.",

    "abstract": "The ability of materials to respond to stimuli with significant optical nonlinearity is crucial for technological advancement and innovation1–3. Although photon-avalanche upconversion nanomaterials with nonlinearities exceeding 60 have been developed, further enhancement remains challenging4–6. Here we present a method to increase photon-avalanche nonlinearity beyond 500 by reconstructing the sublattice and extending the avalanche network. We demonstrate that lutetium substitution in the host material induces significant local crystal field distortions. These distortions strengthen cross-relaxation, the key process governing population accumulation. As a result, the optical nonlinearity is significantly amplified, enabling sub-diffraction imaging through single-beam scanning microscopy, achieving lateral and axial resolutions of 33 nm (about 1/32 of λExc) and 80 nm (around 1/13 of λExc), respectively (where λExc is the excitation wavelength). Moreover, our research shows regional differentiation within photon-avalanche nanocrystals, in which photon-avalanche performance varies across different regions at the single-nanoparticle level. This effect, coupled with extreme optical nonlinearity, enables visualization of nanoemitters at resolutions beyond their physical size using simple instrumentation. These advancements open new possibilities for super-resolution imaging, ultra-sensitive sensing, on-chip optical switching and infrared quantum counting. A strategy for engineering photon-avalanche nanoparticles is proposed such that they exhibit an unprecedentedly strong nonlinear optical response and their emissions scale by more than 500th power of the pump intensity.",

    "abstract": "The microbiota has been recognized as a critical contributor to various diseases1, with multiple reports of changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in contexts such as inflammatory bowel disease2,3 and neurodegenerative diseases4. These microbial shifts can exert systemic effects by altering the release of specific metabolites into the bloodstream5,6, and the gastrointestinal microbiota has also been reported to exhibit immunomodulatory activity through the activation of innate and adaptive immunity7,8. However, it remains unclear how the microbiota contributes to inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), where these microorganisms are typically absent. Here we report that T cells that recognize gut-colonizing segmented filamentous bacteria can induce inflammation in the mouse intestine and CNS in the absence of functional regulatory T cells. Gut commensal-specific CD4 T cells (Tcomm cells) that are dysregulated in the inflamed gut can become licensed to infiltrate into the CNS regardless of their antigen specificity and have the potential to be re-stimulated by host protein-derived antigens in the CNS via molecular mimicry, whereupon they produce high levels of GM-CSF, IFNγ and IL-17A, triggering neurological damage. These infiltrated Tcomm cells initiate CNS inflammation by activating microglia through their IL-23R-dependent encephalitogenic programme and their IL-23R-independent GM-CSF production. Together, our findings reveal potential mechanisms whereby perturbation of Tcomm cells can contribute to extraintestinal inflammation. Dysregulated CD4 T cells that recognize gut commensal antigens are able to infiltrate the central nervous systems and are re-stimulated by host proteins, resulting in neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Kupffer cells (KCs) are tissue-resident macrophages that colonize the liver early during embryogenesis1. Upon liver colonization, KCs rapidly acquire a tissue-specific transcriptional signature, mature alongside the developing liver and adapt to its functions1–3. Throughout development and adulthood, KCs perform distinct core functions that are essential for liver and organismal homeostasis, including supporting fetal erythropoiesis, postnatal erythrocyte recycling and liver metabolism4. However, whether perturbations of macrophage core functions during development contribute to or cause disease at postnatal stages is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a mouse model of maternal obesity to perturb KC functions during gestation. We show that offspring exposed to maternal obesity develop fatty liver disease, driven by aberrant developmental programming of KCs that persists into adulthood. Programmed KCs promote lipid uptake by hepatocytes through apolipoprotein secretion. KC depletion in neonate mice born to obese mothers, followed by replenishment with naive monocytes, rescues fatty liver disease. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF1α) in macrophages during gestation prevents the metabolic programming of KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, thereby averting the development of fatty liver disease. These results establish developmental perturbation of KC functions as a causal factor in fatty liver disease in adulthood and position fetal-derived macrophages as critical intergenerational messengers within the concept of developmental origins of health and diseases5. In a mouse model, maternal obesity during pregnancy can lead to fatty liver disease in the offspring, driven by aberrant developmental programming of Kuppfer cells.",

    "abstract": "Sexual reproduction relies on meiotic chromosome pairing to form bivalents, a process that is complicated in polyploids owing to the presence of multiple subgenomes1. Uneven ploidy mostly results in sterility due to unbalanced chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, pentaploid dogroses (Rosa sect. Caninae; 2n = 5x = 35) achieve stable sexual reproduction through a unique mechanism: 14 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted biparentally, while the remaining 21 chromosomes are maternally inherited as univalents2,3. Despite being studied for over a century, the role of centromeres in this process has remained unclear. Here we analyse haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies for three pentaploid dogroses. Subgenome phasing revealed a bivalent-forming subgenome with two highly homozygous chromosome sets and three divergent subgenomes lacking homologous partners, therefore explaining their meiotic behaviour. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny, phylogenetic relationships and centromere composition indicate that the subgenomes originated from two divergent clades of the genus Rosa. Pollen genome analysis shows that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins form bivalents, supporting multiple origins of dogroses and highlighting variation in subgenome contributions. We reveal that bivalent-forming centromeres are enriched with ATHILA retrotransposons, contrasting with larger tandem-repeat-based centromeres mainly found in univalents. This centromere structural bimodality possibly contributes to univalent drive during female meiosis. Our findings provide insights into the unique reproductive strategies of dogroses, advancing our understanding of genome evolution, centromere diversity and meiotic mechanisms in organisms with asymmetrical inheritance systems. Insights into the dogrose genome and centromeres explain their ability to achieve stable sexual reproduction.",

The human sweet taste receptor, a class C G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heterodimer composed of TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 (refs. 1,2), senses a wide range of sweet compounds—including natural sugars, artificial sweeteners and sweet proteins—and affects metabolic regulation beyond taste. However, the lack of three-dimensional structures hinders our understanding of its precise working mechanism. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the full-length human sweet taste receptor in apo and sucralose-bound states. These structures reveal a distinct asymmetric heterodimer architecture, with sucralose binding exclusively to the Venus flytrap domain of TAS1R2. Combining mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations, this work delineates the sweetener-recognition modes in TAS1R2. Structural comparisons further uncover conformational changes upon ligand binding and a unique activation mechanism. These findings illuminate the signal transduction mechanisms of chemosensory receptors in the class C GPCR family and provide the molecular basis for the design of a new generation of sweeteners. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human sweet taste receptor in the apo and sucralose-bound states reveal its heterodimeric architecture and mechanisms of ligand binding and signal activation.",

    "abstract": "Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions within a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific concept1. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter, such as deconfined quark–gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions2 or expanding quantum degenerate gases3,4. Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges5,6, levitons7 and anyon statistics8. Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity9 as the number of interacting particles increases10 remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analysing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit at which the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet scattering experiments illustrate how coordinated behaviour emerges through interactions of only a few elementary constituents. Studying similar signatures in other physical platforms such as cold-atom simulators4,11 or collections of anyonic excitations8,12 may help identify emergence of exotic phases and, more broadly, advance understanding of matter engineering. The emergence of universal collective behaviour is demonstrated through collisions of electron droplets containing up to five particles, which exhibit strong all-body correlations characteristic of a Coulomb liquid.",

    "abstract": "Tailoring magnetic ordering in solid-state materials is essential for emerging spintronics1,2. However, substitutional lattice doping in magnetic semiconductors is often constrained by the low solubility of magnetic elements3–5, limiting the maximum achievable doping concentration (for example, less than 5%) and ferromagnetic ordering temperature6. The intercalation of magnetic elements in layered two-dimensional atomic crystals (2DACs) without breaking in-plane covalent bonds offers an alternative approach to incorporate a much higher concentration of magnetic atoms (for example, up to 50%) beyond the typical solubility limit. However, commonly used chemical and electrochemical intercalation methods are largely confined to a few isolated examples so far. Here we report a general two-step intercalation and cation-exchange strategy to produce a library of highly ordered magnetic intercalation superlattices (MISLs) with tunable magnetic ordering. Monovalent transition-metal cations Cu+ and Ag+, divalent magnetic cations Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+, and trivalent rare-earth cations Eu3+ and Gd3+ have been successfully incorporated into group-VIB 2DACs, including MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2, and group-IVB, -VB, -IIIA, -IVA and -VA 2DACs, including TiS2, NbS2, NbSe2, TaS2, In2Se3, SnSe2, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. We show that these MISLs can be prepared with tunable concentrations of magnetic intercalants, enabling tailored magnetic ordering across a diverse array of functional 2DACs, including semiconductors, topological insulators, and superconductors. This work establishes a versatile material platform for both fundamental investigations and spintronics applications. A general two-step intercalation and cation-exchange strategy is used to produce a library of highly ordered magnetic intercalation superlattices with tunable chemical modulations and magnetic ordering.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation pheromone, 4-vinylanisole (4VA), is specifically released by gregarious migratory locusts, and is crucial in forming locust swarms that cause destructive plagues1. Control of locust plagues relies heavily on the extensive application of chemical pesticides, which has led to severe environmental and health issues2. As pheromones are primary mediators of insect communication and behaviour3, exploring their biosynthesis can provide important cues to develop innovative behavioural regulators, potentially reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Here we resolve the biosynthesis of 4VA and behavioural responses of locusts when enzymes in the 4VA biosynthetic pathway are manipulated. The process initiates with phenylalanine derived from food plants and proceeds through three precursors: cinnamic acid, p-hydroxycinnamic acid and 4-vinylphenol (4VP). Notably, the conversion from 4VP to 4VA through methylation is unique to gregarious locusts. This step is catalysed by two crucial methyltransferases, 4VPMT1 and 4VPMT2. Guided by the X-ray co-crystal structure of 4VPMT2 bound with 4VP and S-adenosyl-l-methionine, we developed 4-nitrophenol as a substrate surrogate. We identified several chemicals that can block 4VA production by inhibiting the enzymatic activities of 4VPMT proteins, thereby suppressing locust aggregative behaviour. The findings uncover the chemical logic behind 4VA biosynthesis and pinpoint two crucial enzymes as novel targets for locust swarm management. In locusts, the aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole is derived from dietary phenylalanine, and its production is dependent on two 4-vinylphenol methyltransferases that are potential targets for locust pest control.",

    "abstract": "The dendritic cell (DC)-initiated and sustained cancer immunity cycle is indispensable for effective endogenous and therapeutically mobilized antitumour T cell responses1–8. This necessitates the continuous migration of antigen-carrying DCs from the tumour microenvironment (TME) to the tumour draining lymph nodes (tdLNs)7–13. Here, through longitudinal analysis of human and mouse tumours, we observed a progressive decrease in migratory conventional DCs (mig-cDCs) in the tdLNs during tumour progression. This decline compromised tumour-specific T cell priming and subsequent T cell supply to the TME. Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) and its substrate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as key modulators of DC migration. Advanced tumours disrupted cGMP synthesis in DCs to decrease their motility, while PDE5 perturbation preserved the cGMP pool to restore DC migration. Mechanistically, cGMP enhanced myosin-II activity through Rho-associated factors, extending the paradigm of cGMP-regulated amoeboid migration from Dictyostelium to mammalian immune cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 using sildenafil restored mig-cDC homing to late-stage tdLNs and sustained antitumour immunity in a DC-dependent manner. Our findings bridge fundamental DC interstitial motility to antitumour immunity, revealing that its disruption in chaotic TME promotes immune evasion, and its enhancement offers a promising direction for DC-centric immunotherapy. Disruption of dendritic cell (DC) interstitial motility in the tumour microenvironment promotes immune evasion, and enhancement of DC interstitial motility offers a route for DC-centric immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are key features of intracellular compartmentalization1,2. As the most prominent nuclear condensate in eukaryotes, the nucleolus is a multiphase liquid-like structure in which ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are transcribed and processed, undergoing multiple maturation steps to form the small (SSU) and large (LSU) ribosomal subunits3–5. However, how rRNA processing is coupled to the layered organization of the nucleolus is poorly understood owing to a lack of tools to precisely monitor and perturb nucleolar rRNA processing dynamics. Here we developed two complementary approaches to spatiotemporally map rRNA processing and engineer de novo nucleoli. Using sequencing in parallel with imaging, we found that rRNA processing steps are spatially segregated, with sequential maturation of rRNA required for its outward movement through nucleolar phases. By generating synthetic nucleoli in cells using an engineered rDNA plasmid system, we show that defects in SSU processing can alter the ordering of nucleolar phases, resulting in inside-out nucleoli and preventing rRNA outflux, while LSU precursors are necessary to build the outermost layer of the nucleolus. These findings demonstrate how rRNA is both a scaffold and substrate for the nucleolus, with rRNA acting as a programmable blueprint for the multiphase architecture that facilitates assembly of an essential molecular machine. Spatially segregated rRNA processing dictates nucleolar morphology and drives outward progression of pre-ribosomal RNA through nucleolar phases.",

    "abstract": "Climate assessments of civil aviation1,2 have consistently quantified the dominant climate-forcing components: (1) CO2 emissions, (2) NOx (NO + NO2) emissions and (3) persistent contrails. All three components exert a positive radiative forcing (RF) and lead to climate warming of similar magnitudes. The aviation community is actively seeking to reduce its climate footprint through advanced engine technologies, more sustainable aviation fuel and optimal routing plans3–12. These approaches usually involve a trade-off of CO2 against NOx or contrails (non-CO2), such as burning 1% more fuel to decrease contrail RF by 4%. Here, we show that a climate-trade-off risk curve derived from uncertainties in the RF components2,13–16 can give the probability that a specified trade-off ratio will produce a climate benefit. For each component, we calculate the integrated effective RF resulting from 1 year of flights: global warming per activity (GWA). The complementary cumulative probability distribution of the GWA(non-CO2) to GWA(CO2) ratio results in a climate-trade-off risk curve giving the likelihood of a positive climate outcome as a function of the trade-off-CO2 to trade-off-non-CO2 ratio, because the product, GWA × trade-off, should be the same for both. We find a likely (67%) chance of climate mitigation on a 100-year time horizon for the above suggested ratio of 1:4, favouring proposed non-CO2 mitigation efforts3–12 with ratios smaller than this. A climate-trade-off risk curve derived from uncertainties in the radiative-forcing components indicates that focusing on reducing contrails or nitrogen oxide emissions is more effective than reducing CO2 emissions.",

    "abstract": "In a classic example of adaptation, harmless Batesian mimics gain protection from predators through resemblance to one or more unpalatable models1,2. Mimics vary greatly in accuracy, and explaining the persistence of inaccurate mimics is an ongoing challenge for evolutionary biologists3,4. Empirical testing of existing hypotheses is constrained by the difficulty of assessing the fitness of phenotypes absent among extant species, leaving large parts of the adaptive landscape unexplored5—a problem affecting the study of the evolution of most complex traits. Here, to address this, we created mimetic phenotypes that occupy hypothetical areas of trait space by morphing between 3D images of real insects (flies and wasps), and tested the responses of real predators to high-resolution, full-colour 3D-printed reproductions of these phenotypes. We found that birds have an excellent ability to learn to discriminate among insects on the basis of subtle differences in appearance, but this ability is weaker for pattern and shape than for colour and size traits. We found that mimics gained no special protection from intermediate resemblance to multiple model phenotypes. However, discrimination ability was lower in some invertebrate predators (especially crab spiders and mantises), highlighting that the predator community is key to explaining the apparent inaccuracy of many mimics. Birds have an excellent ability to learn to discriminate harmless insects from those that they mimic on the basis of subtle differences in appearance.",

    "abstract": "Barrier tissues isolate organisms from their surrounding environment. Maintaining the integrity of the tissues is essential for this function. In many seed plants, periderm forms as the outer barrier during secondary growth to prevent water loss and pathogen infection1. The periderm is regenerated when its integrity is lost following injury; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown, despite its importance for plant survival. Here we report that periderm integrity in Arabidopsis roots is sensed by diffusion of the gases ethylene and oxygen. Following injury of the periderm, ethylene leaks out through the wound and oxygen enters, resulting in attenuation of ethylene signalling and hypoxia signalling. This condition promotes periderm regeneration in the root. When regeneration is complete and barrier integrity is re-established, pre-injury levels of ethylene and hypoxia signalling are regained. Gas diffusion monitoring is also used to re-establish the barrier in inflorescence stems after the epidermis is injured. We thus propose that gas diffusion is used by plants as a general principle to monitor and re-establish barrier integrity. A study using Arabidopsis shows that plants can monitor the integrity of their outer barriers by sensing gas diffusion, enabling them to initiate wound repair to prevent water loss and pathogen entry.",

    "abstract": "Ancient Egyptian society flourished for millennia, reaching its peak during the Dynastic Period (approximately 3150–30 bce). However, owing to poor DNA preservation, questions about regional interconnectivity over time have not been addressed because whole-genome sequencing has not yet been possible. Here we sequenced a 2× coverage whole genome from an adult male Egyptian excavated at Nuwayrat (Nuerat, نويرات). Radiocarbon dated to 2855–2570 cal. bce, he lived a few centuries after Egyptian unification, bridging the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. The body was interred in a ceramic pot within a rock-cut tomb1, potentially contributing to the DNA preservation. Most of his genome is best represented by North African Neolithic ancestry, among available sources at present. Yet approximately 20% of his genetic ancestry can be traced to genomes representing the eastern Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia and surrounding regions. This genetic affinity is similar to the ancestry appearing in Anatolia and the Levant during the Neolithic and Bronze Age2–5. Although more genomes are needed to fully understand the genomic diversity of early Egyptians, our results indicate that contacts between Egypt and the eastern Fertile Crescent were not limited to objects and imagery (such as domesticated animals and plants, as well as writing systems)6–9 but also encompassed human migration. Whole-genome sequencing of an ancient male Egyptian revealed a mixture of North African Neolithic and eastern Fertile Crescent ancestry, suggesting human migration between Egypt and Mesopotamia by the Old Kingdom period.",

    "abstract": "Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that non-selectively preys on Gram-negative bacteria by invading the prey-cell periplasm, leaching host nutrients and ultimately lysing the infected cell to exit and find a new host1,2. The predatory life cycle of B. bacteriovorus is, in many ways, comparable to a bacteriophage. However, unlike phage defence, defence against B. bacteriovorus has not been widely investigated. Here we screened a collection of diverse Escherichia coli strains for resistance to B. bacteriovorus and identified that roughly one-third of strains robustly defended against predation by producing curli fibres. Curli fibres are oligomers of the functional amyloid protein CsgA, which is exceptionally durable3. Using genetics and microscopy, we demonstrate that curli fibres provide a barrier that protects susceptible cells independent of genes required for biofilm formation. This barrier further protected E. coli against attack by the predatory bacterium Myxococcus xanthus and select phages. Bioinformatic analysis of bacterial amyloids showed these systems are diverse and widespread in diderm bacteria (those with both inner and outer membranes). One of these, an evolutionarily distinct amyloid encoded by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, also protected against B. bacteriovorus. This work establishes that functional amyloids defend bacteria against a wide range of threats. Escherichia coli uses curli fibres, oligomers of the functional amyloid CsgA, as a barrier to protect against the predatory bacteria Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and Myxococcus xanthus in a mechanism that is independent of genes required for biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is effective against many cancers, although resistance remains a major issue and new strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes1–5. Here we studied ICB response in a cohort of patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma—a cancer type that poses considerable clinical challenges and lacks effective therapies6–8. We observed significantly prolonged overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with tumours with PPP2R1A mutations. Importantly, our findings were validated in additional ICB-treated patient cohorts across multiple cancer types. Translational analyses from tumour biopsies demonstrated enhanced IFNγ signalling, and the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures at the baseline, as well as enhanced immune infiltration and expansion of CD45RO+CD8+ T cells in the tumour neighbourhood after ICB treatment in PPP2R1A-mutated tumours. Parallel preclinical investigations showed that targeting PPP2R1A (by pharmacological inhibition or genetic modifications) in in vitro and in vivo models was associated with improved survival in the setting of treatment with several forms of immunotherapy, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and ICB. The results from these studies suggest that therapeutic targeting of PPP2R1A may represent an effective strategy to improve patient outcomes after ICB or other forms of immunotherapy, although additional mechanistic and therapeutic insights are needed. Inactivating PPP2R1A mutations correlate with better survival after immune checkpoint blockade in patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma, suggesting that targeting the phosphatase 2A (PP2A) pathway may represent an effective startegy for improving responses to immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Thermal nanophotonics enables fundamental breakthroughs across technological applications from energy technology to information processing1–11. From thermal emitters to thermophotovoltaics and thermal camouflage, precise spectral engineering has been bottlenecked by trial-and-error approaches. Concurrently, machine learning has demonstrated its powerful capabilities in the design of nanophotonic and meta-materials12–18. However, it remains a considerable challenge to develop a general design methodology for tailoring high-performance nanophotonic emitters with ultrabroadband control and precise band selectivity, as they are constrained by predefined geometries and materials, local optimization traps and traditional algorithms. Here we propose an unconventional machine learning-based paradigm that can design a multitude of ultrabroadband and band-selective thermal meta-emitters by realizing multiparameter optimization with sparse data that encompasses three-dimensional structural complexity and material diversity. Our framework enables dual design capabilities: (1) it automates the inverse design of a vast number of possible metastructure and material combinations for spectral tailoring; (2) it has an unprecedented ability to design various three-dimensional meta-emitters by applying a three-plane modelling method that transcends the limitations of traditional, flat, two-dimensional structures. We present seven proof-of-concept meta-emitters that exhibit superior optical and radiative cooling performance surpassing current state-of-the-art designs. We provide a generalizable framework for fabricating three-dimensional nanophotonic materials, which facilitates global optimization through expanded geometric freedom and dimensionality and a comprehensive materials database. An unconventional machine learning-based inverse design framework enables the generation of ultrabroadband and band-selective thermal meta-emitters with complex 3D architectures and diverse material compositions.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in solid tumours is limited by immunosuppression and antigen heterogeneity1–3. To overcome these barriers, ‘armoured’ CAR T cells, which secrete proinflammatory cytokines, have been developed4. However, their clinical application has been limited because of toxicity related to peripheral expression of the armouring transgene5. Here, we have developed a CRISPR knock-in strategy that leverages the regulatory mechanisms of endogenous genes to drive transgene expression in a tumour-localized manner. By screening endogenous genes with tumour-restricted expression, we have identified the NR4A2 and RGS16 promoters as promising candidates to support the delivery of cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-2 directly to the tumour site, leading to enhanced antitumour efficacy and long-term survival of mice in both syngeneic and xenogeneic models. This effect was concomitant with improved CAR T cell polyfunctionality, activation of endogenous antitumour immunity and a favourable safety profile, and was applicable in CAR T cells from patients. A CRISPR knock-in strategy that uses endogenous gene regulatory mechanisms can engineer ‘armoured’ CAR T cells that secrete proinflammatory cytokines directly within a tumour without causing toxicity, leading to prolonged survival in mice.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines1. The interaction can enhance the magnetic activity of the star, such as its chromospheric2 and radio3 emission or flaring4. So far, the search for magnetic star–planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here we report the detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets5,6. Combining space-borne photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and dedicated Characterising Exoplanets Telescope observations over 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the transit phase of the innermost planet, indicating persistent magnetic star–planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six times higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the remarkably extended atmosphere of the planet, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope7. HIP 67522 is, therefore, an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star–planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets. Planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets, were detected.",

    "abstract": "The cause of Mars’s loss of surface habitability is unclear, with isotopic data suggesting a ‘missing sink’ of carbonate1. Past climates with surface and shallow-subsurface liquid water are recorded by Mars’s sedimentary rocks, including strata in the approximately 4-km-thick record at Gale Crater2. Those waters were intermittent, spatially patchy and discontinuous, and continued remarkably late in Mars’s history3—attributes that can be understood if, as on Earth, sedimentary-rock formation sequestered carbon dioxide as abundant carbonate (recently confirmed in situ at Gale4). Here we show that a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate formation can explain the existence of intermittent Martian oases. In our model, increasing solar luminosity promoted the stability of liquid water, which in turn formed carbonate, reduced the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide and limited liquid water5. Chaotic orbital forcing modulated wet–dry cycles. The negative feedback restricted liquid water to oases and Mars self-regulated as a desert planet. We model snowmelt as the water source, but the feedback can also work with groundwater as the water source. Model output suggests that Gale faithfully records the expected primary episodes of liquid water stability in the surface and near-surface environment. Eventually, atmospheric thickness approaches water’s triple point, curtailing the sustained stability of liquid water and thus habitability in the surface environment. We assume that the carbonate content found at Gale is representative, and as a result we present a testable idea rather than definitive evidence. A modelling study suggests that Mars had a desert-like climate with intermittent liquid-water oases regulated by a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate formation.",

    "abstract": "Although most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range1. The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer–promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in vivo enhancer-replacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and medium-range limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis-acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1. The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh2. The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer–promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers. The REX element is associated with long-range enhancer–promoter interactions.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases have had devastating effects on human populations throughout history, but important questions about their origins and past dynamics remain1. To create an archaeogenetic-based spatiotemporal map of human pathogens, we screened shotgun-sequencing data from 1,313 ancient humans covering 37,000 years of Eurasian history. We demonstrate the widespread presence of ancient bacterial, viral and parasite DNA, identifying 5,486 individual hits against 492 species from 136 genera. Among those hits, 3,384 involve known human pathogens2, many of which had not previously been identified in ancient human remains. Grouping the ancient microbial species according to their likely reservoir and type of transmission, we find that most groups are identified throughout the entire sampling period. Zoonotic pathogens are only detected from around 6,500 years ago, peaking roughly 5,000 years ago, coinciding with the widespread domestication of livestock3. Our findings provide direct evidence that this lifestyle change resulted in an increased infectious disease burden. They also indicate that the spread of these pathogens increased substantially during subsequent millennia, coinciding with the pastoralist migrations from the Eurasian Steppe4,5. Screening shotgun-sequencing data from ancient humans covering 37,000 years of Eurasian history uncovers the widespread presence of ancient bacterial, viral and parasite DNA and zoonotic pathogens coincide with the widespread domestication of livestock.",

    "abstract": "The ability of coronaviruses to recombine and cross species barriers affects human and animal health globally and is a pandemic threat1,2. FCoV-23 is a recently emerged, highly pathogenic recombinant coronavirus responsible for a widespread outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis. Here we report cryogenic electron microscopy structures of two FCoV-23 spike isoforms that correspond to the in-host loss of domain 0 observed in clinical samples. The loss of domain 0 markedly enhances the fusogenicity and kinetics of entry into cells and possibly enables biotype switching and lethality. We show that FCoV-23 can use several aminopeptidase N orthologues as receptors and reveal the molecular determinants of receptor species tropism, including a glycan that modulates human receptor engagement. We define antigenic relationships among alphacoronaviruses that infect humans and other mammalian species and identify a cross-reactive alphacoronavirus monoclonal antibody that inhibits FCoV-23 entry. Our results pave the way for the development of vaccines and therapeutics that target this highly pathogenic virus. The molecular mechanisms of cell entry for the recently identified highly pathogenic feline coronavirus FCoV-23 are characterized in detail.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of river floods1. Floods not only cause damage by inundation and loss of life2,3 but also jeopardize infrastructure because of bank failure and riverbed erosion processes that are poorly understood. Common flood safety programmes include dyke reinforcement and river widening4–9. The 2021 flood in the Meuse Basin caused 43 fatalities and billions of dollars of damage to infrastructure10. Here, on the basis of analysis of the Meuse flood, we show how uneven widening of the river and heterogeneity of sediment deposits under the river can cause massive erosion. A recent flood safety programme widened the river11, but created bottlenecks where widening was either prevented by infrastructure or not yet implemented. Riverbed erosion was exacerbated by tectonic uplift that had produced a thin top gravel layer above fine-grained sediment. Greatly enhanced flow velocities produced underwater dunes with troughs that broke through the gravel armour in the bottlenecks, exposing easily erodible sands, resulting in extreme scour holes, one more than 15 m deep. Our investigation highlights the challenges of re-engineering rivers in the face of climate change, increased flood risks and competition for river widening space, and calls for a better understanding of the subsurface. Analysis of the 2021 Meuse River flood reveals potential erosion risks due to uneven river widening and subsoil variability, highlighting challenges for river engineering and flood mitigation in a changing climate.",

    "abstract": "The ability to detect and respond appropriately to ingested nutrients is essential for an organism’s survival and to ensure its metabolic demands are met. Nutrient signals from the gut lumen trigger local intestinal reflexes in the enteric nervous system (ENS) to facilitate digestion and absorption1–4, but the precise cellular pathways that are involved in the initial neuronal sensory process remain unclear. The extent to which the ENS is capable of discerning different luminal chemicals is also unknown. Here we use calcium imaging to identify specific enteric pathways that are activated in response to luminal nutrients applied to mouse jejunum. Notably, we show that different nutrients activate neurochemically defined ensembles of myenteric and submucosal neurons. Furthermore, we find that enteric neurons are not directly sensitive to nutrients but detect different luminal chemicals through the epithelium, mainly via a serotonin signalling pathway. Finally, our data reveal a spatial distribution of luminal information along the radial axis of the intestine, whereby some signals that originate from the villus epithelium are transmitted first to the myenteric plexus, and then back to the submucosal plexus, which is closer to the lumen. Calcium imaging of the mouse jejunum shows that specific nutrients in the intestinal lumen are detected by epithelial cells, which activate specific sets of enteric neurons through a serotonin-mediated signalling process.",

    "abstract": "Fine particulate matter (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less; PM2.5) causes millions of premature deaths globally1, but not all particles are equally harmful2–4. Current air-pollution control strategies, prioritizing PM2.5 mass reduction, have provided considerable health benefits but further refinements based on differences in the toxicity of various emission sources may provide greater benefits5–7. Here we integrated field measurements with air-quality modelling to assess the unequal toxicities of PM2.5 from various anthropogenic sources. Our findings revealed that the toxicity per unit of PM2.5 mass differed substantially between major sources, differing by up to two orders of magnitude. PM2.5 from solid fuel combustion in residential stoves had the highest toxicity, followed by those from the metallurgy industry, brake wear, diesel vehicles, petrol vehicles, the cement industry and power plants. We further analysed the source contributions of toxicity-adjusted PM2.5 emissions and population exposures in China. From 2005 to 2021, both the PM2.5 mass and relative-potency-adjusted emissions substantially decreased. Although industrial sources contributed 57.5% to the reduction in PM2.5 mass emissions, the reduction in relative potency-adjusted emissions was driven by residential combustion (approximately 80%). Clean-air policies should consider the differing toxicities of PM2.5 when formulating source-specific emission control regulations. This study proposes a cellular toxicity-based framework for PM2.5 reduction that could address the specific health risks in diverse regions, but further epidemiological studies will be required to confirm their relevance to human health outcomes and their application to public policy. A relative potency-adjusted inventory of fine-particulate matter (PM2.5) established in China reveals sectoral and regional disparities in PM2.5 emissions, exposures and associated toxic potencies.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss significantly improves metabolic and cardiovascular health in people with obesity1–3. The remodelling of adipose tissue (AT) is central to these varied and important clinical effects4. However, surprisingly little is known about the underlying mechanisms, presenting a barrier to treatment advances. Here we report a spatially resolved single-nucleus atlas (comprising 171,247 cells from 70 people) investigating the cell types, molecular events and regulatory factors that reshape human AT, and thus metabolic health, in obesity and therapeutic weight loss. We discover selective vulnerability to senescence in metabolic, precursor and vascular cells and reveal that senescence is potently reversed by weight loss. We define gene regulatory mechanisms and tissue signals that may drive a degenerative cycle of senescence, tissue injury and metabolic dysfunction. We find that weight loss reduces adipocyte hypertrophy and biomechanical constraint pathways, activating global metabolic flux and bioenergetic substrate cycles that may mediate systemic improvements in metabolic health. In the immune compartment, we demonstrate that weight loss represses obesity-induced macrophage infiltration but does not completely reverse activation, leaving these cells primed to trigger potential weight regain and worsen metabolic dysfunction. Throughout, we map cells to tissue niches to understand the collective determinants of tissue injury and recovery. Overall, our complementary single-nucleus and spatial datasets offer unprecedented insights into the basis of obese AT dysfunction and its reversal by weight loss and are a key resource for mechanistic and therapeutic exploration. An atlas study of adipose tissue in people with obesity undergoing weight loss and their lean counterparts reveals that weight loss reduces cell senescence but cannot reverse all the metabolic problems caused by obesity.",

    "abstract": "The carpus (wrist) of birds has a complex evolutionary history, long known to involve carpal reduction and recently shown to include topological replacement of one carpal (the ulnare) by another (the pisiform)1. The pisiform plays a crucial role in stabilization of the distal wingtip during flight2, and facilitates kinematic integration that ‘automates’ wing motion3. The apparent absence of a pisiform in all but the earliest theropod dinosaurs led to the proposal that it was lost early in theropod evolution and regained only in birds as a key step in the origin of flight1. Here, we describe the forelimb skeletons of two newly prepared theropod dinosaur specimens from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, each of which preserves a pisiform, establishing its presence in Oviraptorosauria and Troodontidae in addition to birds. Reinterpretation of published material in light of these specimens shows a pisiform in a wide range of theropod species, including Microraptor4, Ambopteryx5 and Anchiornis6. Our results indicate that the pisiform replaced the ulnare by origin of the clade Pennaraptora, phylogenetically coincident with the hypothesized origin(s) of flight in birds and their closest relatives7,8. Taken together, our results indicate that replacement of the ulnare by the pisiform was a terminal step in assembly of the dinosaurian flight apparatus that occurred close to the origins of flight in theropod dinosaurs, rather than a novelty restricted to birds. The forelimbs of two Late Cretaceous theropod dinosaurs show the presence of the pisiform bone, previously thought to have been lost early in theropod evolution and regained in birds during the evolution of flight, indicating that a birdlike pisiform appeared prior to the evolution of flight.",

    "abstract": "Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science [1, 2, 3, 4]. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained [12, 1], necessitating the use of special resource states known as ‘magic states’ [13] to implement universal, classically hard circuits [14]. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform ‘distillation’, creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs [15, 13]. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture [16, 8] to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d  =  3 and d  =  5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a common feature of human cancers and is linked to tumour progression, drug resistance, and metastasis1–6. Here we examine the impact of WGD on somatic evolution and immune evasion at single-cell resolution in patient tumours. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we analysed 70 high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples from 41 patients (30,260 tumour genomes) and observed near-ubiquitous evidence that WGD is an ongoing mutational process. WGD was associated with increased cell–cell diversity and higher rates of chromosomal missegregation and consequent micronucleation. We developed a mutation-based WGD timing method called doubleTime to delineate specific modes by which WGD can drive tumour evolution, including early fixation followed by considerable diversification, multiple parallel WGD events on a pre-existing background of copy-number diversity, and evolutionarily late WGD in small clones and individual cells. Furthermore, using matched single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that inflammatory signalling and cGAS-STING pathway activation result from ongoing chromosomal instability, but this is restricted to predominantly diploid tumours (WGD-low). By contrast, predominantly WGD tumours (WGD-high), despite increased missegregation, exhibited cell-cycle dysregulation, STING1 repression, and immunosuppressive phenotypic states. Together, these findings establish WGD as an ongoing mutational process that promotes evolvability and dysregulated immunity in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. A single-cell sequencing study using more than 30,000 tumour genomes from human ovarian cancers shows that whole-genome doubling is an ongoing mutational process that drives tumour evolution and disrupts immunity.",

    "abstract": "With their superficially shark-like appearance, the Mesozoic ichthyosaurs provide a classic illustration of major morphological adaptations in an ancestrally terrestrial tetrapod lineage following the invasion of marine habitats1–3. Much of what is known about ichthyosaur soft tissues derives from specimens with body outlines4–6. However, despite offering insights into aspects of biology that are otherwise difficult to envisage from skeletal evidence alone (such as the presence of a crescentic fluke), information on their soft parts has hitherto been limited to a taxonomically narrow sample of small- to dolphin-sized animals2,4–6. Here we report the discovery of a metre-long front flipper of the large-bodied Jurassic ichthyosaur Temnodontosaurus, including unique details of its soft-tissue anatomy. In addition to revealing a wing-like planform, the fossil preserves a serrated trailing edge that is reinforced by novel cartilaginous integumental elements, herein denominated chondroderms. We also document chordwise-parallel skin ornamentations and a protracted fleshy distal tip that presumably acted like a flexible winglet in life. By integrating morphological and numerical data, we show that the observed features probably provided hydroacoustic benefits, and conclude that the visually guided7,8 Temnodontosaurus relied on stealth while hunting in dim-lit pelagic environments. This unexpected combination of control surface modifications represents a previously unrecognized mode of concealment, and underscores the importance of soft-tissue fossils when inferring aspects of palaeoethology and predator–prey palaeoecology. Analysis of a fossilized front flipper of the Jurassic ichthyosaur Temnodontosaurus that preserves details of soft tissue indicates the presence of a serrated trailing edge that would have reduced noise generated while swimming, enabling stealth hunting and hiding from predators.",

    "abstract": "Living biological systems rely on the continuous operation of chemical reaction networks. These networks sustain out-of-equilibrium regimes in which chemical energy is continually converted into controlled mechanical work and motion1–3. Out-of-equilibrium reaction networks have also enabled the design and successful development of artificial autonomously operating molecular machines4,5, in which networks comprising pairs of formally—but non-microscopically—reverse reaction pathways drive controlled motion at the molecular level. In biological systems, the concurrent operation of several reaction pathways is enabled by the chemoselectivity of enzymes and their cofactors, and nature’s dissipative reaction networks involve several classes of reactions. By contrast, the reactivity that has been harnessed to develop chemical reaction networks in pursuit of artificial molecular machines is limited to a single reaction type. Only a small number of synthetic systems exhibit chemically fuelled continuous controlled molecular-level motion6–8 and all exploit the same class of acylation–hydrolysis reaction. Here we show that a redox reaction network, comprising concurrent oxidation and reduction pathways, can drive chemically fuelled continuous autonomous unidirectional motion about a C–C bond in a structurally simple synthetic molecular motor based on an achiral biphenyl. The combined use of an oxidant and reductant as fuels and the directionality of the motor are both enabled by exploiting the enantioselectivity and functional separation of reactivity inherent to enzyme catalysis. A redox reaction network, comprising concurrent oxidation and reduction pathways, is described that can drive autonomous unidirectional motion about a C–C bond in a structurally simple synthetic molecular motor based on an achiral biphenyl.",

    "abstract": "Propagation of intense X-ray pulses through dense media has led to the observation of phenomena such as atomic X-ray lasing1,2, self-induced transparency3 and stimulated X-ray Raman scattering (SXRS)4. SXRS has been long predicted as a means to launch and probe valence-electron wavepackets and as a building block for nonlinear X-ray spectroscopies5,6. However, experimental observations of SXRS to date4,7,8 have not provided spectroscopic information, and theoretical modelling has largely implemented hard-to-realize phase-coherent attosecond pulses. Here we demonstrate SXRS with spectroscopic precision, that is, detection of valence-excited states in neon with a near Fourier-limited joint energy–time resolution of 0.1 eV–40 fs. We used a new covariance analysis between statistically spiky broadband incident X-ray and scattered X-ray Raman pulses. Using 18,000 single shots, we beat not only the incident (about 8 eV) bandwidth but also the  approximately 0.2 eV instrumental energy resolution, thus creating super-resolution conditions, in analogy to super-resolved fluorescence microscopy9. Our experimental results, supported by ab initio propagation simulations, reveal the competition between lasing in the ion and stimulated Raman scattering in the neutral. We demonstrate enhanced signal collection efficiency and a broad excitation window, surpassing spontaneous Raman efficiencies by orders of magnitude. This stochastic SXRS approach represents a first step towards tracking elementary events that determine chemical outcomes10. A high-resolution spectroscopic tool is demonstrated using the stochastically fluctuating intensity spikes in time and energy domains of a self-amplified spontaneous emission X-ray free-electron laser.",

    "abstract": "Most people in the USA manage their health by taking at least one prescription drug, and drugs classified as non-antibiotics can adversely affect the gut microbiome and disrupt intestinal homeostasis1,2. Here we identify medications that are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal infections across a population cohort of more than one million individuals monitored over 15 years. Notably, the cardiac glycoside digoxin and other drugs identified in this epidemiological study are sufficient to alter the composition of the microbiome and the risk of infection with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) in mice. The effect of digoxin treatment on S. Tm infection is transmissible through the microbiome, and characterization of this interaction highlights a digoxin-responsive β-defensin that alters the microbiome composition and consequent immune surveillance of the invading pathogen. Combining epidemiological and experimental approaches thus provides an opportunity to uncover drug–host–microbiome–pathogen interactions that increase the risk of infections in humans. An analysis of prescription medications shows that several non-antibiotic drugs, such as the heart medication digoxin, can reduce the immune response to pathogens and increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections by altering the composition of the microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the largest natural source of new nitrogen (N) that supports terrestrial productivity1,2, yet estimates of global terrestrial BNF remain highly uncertain3,4. Here we show that this uncertainty is partly because of sampling bias, as field BNF measurements in natural terrestrial ecosystems occur where N fixers are 17 times more prevalent than their mean abundances worldwide. To correct this bias, we develop new estimates of global terrestrial BNF by upscaling field BNF measurements using spatially explicit abundances of all major biogeochemical N-fixing niches. We find that natural biomes sustain lower BNF, 65 (52–77) Tg N yr−1, than previous empirical bottom-up estimates3,4, with most BNF occurring in tropical forests and drylands. We also find high agricultural BNF in croplands and cultivated pastures, 56 (54–58) Tg N yr−1. Agricultural BNF has increased terrestrial BNF by 64% and total terrestrial N inputs from all sources by 60% over pre-industrial levels. Our results indicate that BNF may impose stronger constraints on the carbon sink in natural terrestrial biomes and represent a larger source of agricultural N than is generally considered in analyses of the global N cycle5,6, with implications for proposed safe operating limits for N use7,8. Biological nitrogen fixation may impose stronger constraints on the carbon sink in natural terrestrial biomes and represent a larger source of agricultural nitrogen than is generally considered in analyses of the global nitrogen cycle.",

    "abstract": "Salicylic acid (SA) is a ubiquitous plant hormone with a long history in human civilization1,2. Because of the central role of SA in orchestrating plant pathogen defence, understanding SA biosynthesis is fundamental to plant immunity research and crop improvement. Isochorismate-derived SA biosynthesis has been well defined in Arabidopsis. However, increasing evidence suggests a crucial function for phenylalanine-derived SA biosynthesis in many other plant species1. Here we reveal the phenylalanine-derived SA biosynthetic pathway in rice by identifying three dedicated enzymes — peroxisomal benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyltransferase (BEBT), the endoplasmic reticulum-associated cytochrome P450 enzyme benzylbenzoate hydroxylase (BBH), and cytosolic benzylsalicylate esterase (BSE) that sequentially convert benzoyl-CoA to benzylbenzoate, benzylsalicylate and SA. The pathogen-induced gene expression pattern and SA biosynthetic functions of this triple-enzyme module are conserved in diverse plants. This work fills a major knowledge gap in the biosynthesis of a key plant defence hormone, establishing a foundation for new strategies to create disease-resistant crops. Diverse plant species synthesize salicylic acid from phenylalanine through a pathway that includes a conserved triple-enzyme module that converts benzoyl-CoA to salicylic acid.",

    "abstract": "Complex integumentary appendages such as avian feathers and mammalian hair play a principal role in tetrapod evolution, with critical functions in insulation, sensation, display and flight. Although feathers and hair originated in the stem-lineages of birds and mammals, respectively1,2, their underlying gene regulatory network has much deeper amniote roots3. The early evolution of amniote integumentary appendages, however, remains poorly understood because of the absence of fossil evidence. Here we present Mirasaura grauvogeli, a small-sized diapsid from the Middle Triassic epoch (about 247 million years ago) with a distinctive crest formed by elongate integumentary appendages extending serially along its back, similar to those of the poorly understood Triassic reptile Longisquama4–7. Despite its superficially bird-like skull, Mirasaura is not closely related to avemetatarsalians but instead belongs to the exclusively Triassic reptilian clade Drepanosauromorpha8. Melanosomes preserved in its integumentary appendages are consistent in geometry with melanosomes of feathers but not those of reptilian skin or mammalian hair. Nevertheless, the morphology of the integumentary appendages and phylogenetic placement of Mirasaura indicate that they are not structurally homologous to feathers or other integumentary appendages in living amniotes. Our findings show that complex integumentary appendages are not restricted to avemetatarsalians and mammaliaforms among amniotes and evolved in a lineage basal to all extant reptiles, challenging our understanding of the evolution of the reptilian integument. A Middle Triassic diapsid is presented that has a distinctive crest consisting of integumentary appendages that are structurally distinct from avemetatarsalian feathers.",

    "abstract": "Salicylic acid (SA) is a pivotal phytohormone for plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Plants have evolved two pathways to produce SA: the isochorismate synthase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) pathways1. Whereas the isochorismate synthase pathway has been fully identified2–4, the PAL pathway remains incomplete. Here we report the full characterization of the PAL pathway for SA biosynthesis via functional analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) SA-DEFICIENT GENE 1 (OSD1) to OSD4. The cinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase OSD1 catalyses the conversion of trans-cinnamic acid to cinnamoyl-CoA, which is subsequently transformed to benzoyl-CoA via the β-oxidative pathway in peroxisomes. The resulting benzoyl-CoA is further converted to benzyl benzoate by the peroxisomal benzoyltransferase OSD2. Benzyl benzoate is subsequently hydroxylated to benzyl salicylate by the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-resident cytochrome P450 OSD3, which is ultimately hydrolysed to salicylic acid by the cytoplasmic carboxylesterase OSD4. Evolutionary analyses reveal that the PAL pathway was first assembled before the divergence of gymnosperms and has been conserved in most seed plants. Activation of the PAL pathway in rice significantly enhances salicylic acid levels and plant immunity. Completion of the PAL pathway provides critical insights into the primary salicylic acid biosynthetic pathway across plant species and offers a precise target for modulating crop immunity. Characterization of four SALICYLIC ACID-DEFICIENT GENEs in rice identifies an ancestral pathway for biosynthesis of salicylic acid from phenylalanine and provides genetic targets for engineering disease resistance in crop plants.",

    "abstract": "To coexist with its resident microorganisms, the host must have a sense to adjust its behaviour in response to them. In the intestine, a sense for nutrients transduced to the brain through neuroepithelial circuits guides appetitive choices1–5. However, a sense that allows the host to respond in real time to stimuli arising from resident gut microorganisms remains to be uncovered. Here we show that in the mouse colon, the ubiquitous microbial pattern flagellin—a unifying feature across phyla6—stimulates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) in peptide YY (PYY)-labelled colonic neuropod cells. This stimulation leads to PYY release onto NPY2R vagal nodose neurons to regulate feeding. Mice lacking TLR5 in these cells eat more and gain more weight than controls. We found that flagellin does not act on the nerve directly. Instead, flagellin stimulates neuropod cells from the colonic lumen to reduce feeding through a gut–brain sensory neural circuit. Moreover, flagellin reduces feeding independent of immune responses, metabolic changes or the presence of gut microbiota. This sense enables the host to adjust its behaviour in response to a molecular pattern from its resident microorganisms. We call this sense at the interface of the biota and the brain the neurobiotic sense7. A study reveals a gut–brain sensory pathway through which the microbial component flagellin activates neuropod cells in the colon to signal the brain and reduce feeding in mice.",

    "abstract": "Mycorrhizal fungi are ecosystem engineers that sustain plant life and help regulate Earth’s biogeochemical cycles1–3. However, in contrast to plants and animals, the global distribution of mycorrhizal fungal biodiversity is largely unknown, which limits our ability to monitor and protect key underground ecosystems4,5. Here we trained machine-learning algorithms on a global dataset of 25,000 geolocated soil samples comprising >2.8 billion fungal DNA sequences. We predicted arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungal richness and rarity across terrestrial ecosystems. On the basis of these predictions, we generated high-resolution, global-scale maps and identified key reservoirs of highly diverse and endemic mycorrhizal communities. Intersecting protected areas with mycorrhizal hotspots indicated that less than 10% of predicted mycorrhizal richness hotspots currently exist in protected areas. Our results describe a largely hidden component of Earth’s underground ecosystems and can help identify conservation priorities, set monitoring benchmarks and create specific restoration plans and land-management strategies. Machine-learning algorithms trained on 25,000 geolocated soil samples are used to create high-resolution global maps of mycorrhizal fungi, revealing that less than 10% of their biodiversity hotspots are in protected areas.",

    "abstract": "Gene editing has the potential to solve fundamental challenges in agriculture, biotechnology and human health. CRISPR-based gene editors derived from microorganisms, although powerful, often show notable functional tradeoffs when ported into non-native environments, such as human cells1. Artificial-intelligence-enabled design provides a powerful alternative with the potential to bypass evolutionary constraints and generate editors with optimal properties. Here, using large language models2 trained on biological diversity at scale, we demonstrate successful precision editing of the human genome with a programmable gene editor designed with artificial intelligence. To achieve this goal, we curated a dataset of more than 1 million CRISPR operons through systematic mining of 26 terabases of assembled genomes and metagenomes. We demonstrate the capacity of our models by generating 4.8× the number of protein clusters across CRISPR–Cas families found in nature and tailoring single-guide RNA sequences for Cas9-like effector proteins. Several of the generated gene editors show comparable or improved activity and specificity relative to SpCas9, the prototypical gene editing effector, while being 400 mutations away in sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that an artificial-intelligence-generated gene editor, denoted as OpenCRISPR-1, exhibits compatibility with base editing. We release OpenCRISPR-1 to facilitate broad, ethical use across research and commercial applications. Gene editors designed using artificial intelligence can undertake precision editing of the human genome.",

    "abstract": "The surface landscapes of cells differ as a function of cell type and are frequently altered in disease contexts1–3. Exploiting such differences is key to many therapeutic strategies and is the basis for developing diagnostic and basic-science tools. State-of-the-art strategies typically target single surface antigens, but each individual receptor rarely defines the specific cell type4,5. The development of programmable molecular systems that integrate multiple cell-surface features to convert on-target inputs to user-defined outputs is therefore highly desirable. Here we describe an autonomous decision-making device driven by proximity-gated protein trans-splicing that allows local generation of an active protein from two otherwise inactive polypeptide fragments. We show that this protein-actuator platform can perform convergent protein ligation on designated cell surfaces, allowing highly selective generation of active proteins, which can either remain physically associated with the cell surface on which they were manufactured or be released into the surrounding milieu. Because of its intrinsic modularity and tunability, we demonstrate that the technology is compatible with different types of input, targeting modality and functional output, allowing for the localized interrogation or manipulation of cellular systems. A synthetic biology system called SMART has been developed that uses conditional protein splicing for the programmable ligation of functional proteins from previously defined molecular combinations on cell surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic soft robots offer considerable potential across various scenarios, such as biomedical applications and industrial tasks, due to their shape programmability and reconfigurability, safe interaction, and biocompatibility1–4. Despite recent advances, magnetic soft robots are still limited by the difficulties in reprogramming their required magnetization profiles in real time on the spot (in situ), which is essential for performing multiple functions or executing diverse tasks5,6. Here, we introduce a method for real-time, in situ magnetization reprogramming that enables the rearrangement and recombination of magnetic units to achieve diverse magnetization profiles. We explore the applications of this method in structures of varying dimensions, from one-dimensional (1D) tubes to three-dimensional (3D) frameworks, showcasing a diverse and expanded range of configurations and their deformations. This method also demonstrates versatility in diverse scenarios, including navigating around objects without undesired contact, reprogramming cilia arrays, managing multiple instruments cooperatively or independently under the same magnetic field, and manipulating objects of various shapes. These capabilities extend the range of applications for magnetic actuation technologies. Furthermore, this method emancipates magnetic soft robots from the sole reliance on external magnetic fields for shape change, facilitating unprecedented modes and varieties of deformation while simultaneously reducing the need for complex magnetic field generation systems; thereby, opening new avenues for the development of magnetic actuation technologies.",

    "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA amplification is associated with poor cancer prognoses1. Large numbers of excised signal circles (ESCs) are produced as by-products of antigen receptor rearrangement during V(D)J recombination2,3. However, current dogma states that ESCs are progressively lost through cell division4. Here we show that ESCs replicate and persist through many cell generations and share many properties in common with circular extrachromosomal DNAs. Increased ESC copy numbers at diagnosis of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were highly correlated with subsequent relapse. By taking advantage of the matching recombination footprint that is formed upon the generation of each ESC, we measured ESC persistence and replication and found increased ESC replication in patients who later relapsed. This increased replication is controlled by cell-intrinsic factors and corresponds to increased expression of DNA replication- and repair-associated genes. Consistent with high ESC levels having a role in disease progression, the number of mutations typical of those caused by the V(D)J recombinase–ESC complex was significantly increased at diagnosis in patients who later relapsed. The number of such mutations in genes associated with relapse increased between diagnosis and relapse, and corresponded to clonal expansion of cells with high ESC copy numbers. These data demonstrate that the by-product of V(D)J recombination, when increased in abundance, potently associates with the V(D)J recombinase to cause adverse disease outcomes. Excised signal circles are circular DNA by-products of V(D)J recombination that form a complex with the V(D)J recombinase, and when increased in abundance, result in increased mutagenesis, causing adverse outcomes in cancer.",

Experiments and observations also link it to the emergence of energetic particles and X-rays3. However, how this multi-scale physics affects the abrupt onset of reconnection remains unknown. Here we report observations from laboratory experiments involving two flux ropes with electron beams that induce magnetic turbulence and then abruptly merge into a single structure, altering the magnetic topology in the MHD regime. Two separate electron beams are launched along magnetic field lines and form individual flux ropes with a drift velocity higher than the ambient Alfvén velocity, effectively driving magnetic turbulence through beam-driven instabilities, as inferred from the increased level of the turbulent power spectrum. Experimental observations, including the appearance of energetic particles, increased ion temperature and changes in the characteristics of the flux ropes, suggest that beam-driven turbulence drives three-dimensional (3D) reconnection. 3D particle-in-cell simulations are performed, which successfully reproduce the key aspects of the experiment. These results directly explain how non-MHD kinetic processes progress through multiple scales to induce global MHD changes. Observations from laboratory experiments involving two flux ropes show that electron beams induce magnetic turbulence and abruptly merge into a single structure, altering the magnetic topology in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) regime — a process supported by three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell simulations.",

    "abstract": "Parent-of-origin effects (POEs) occur when the effect of a genetic variant depends on its parental origin1. Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, POEs are believed to occur due to parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, resulting in opposing parental influences2. Despite their importance, POEs remain underexplored in complex traits, owing to the lack of parental genomes. Here we present an approach to infer the parent of origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging interchromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and X chromosome data, and sex-specific crossover in siblings. Applied to the UK Biobank, this enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 109,385 individuals. Genome-wide association study scans for 59 complex traits and over 14,000 protein quantitative trait loci contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 POEs and confirmed more than 50% of known associations. More than one third of these showed opposite parental influences, especially for traits related to growth (for example, IGF1 and height) and metabolism (for example, type 2 diabetes and triglyceride levels). Replication in up to 85,050 individuals from the Estonian Biobank and 42,346 offspring from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) validated 87% of testable associations. Overall, our findings highlight the contribution of POEs to complex traits and support the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon. A novel multistep strategy reveals how parent-of-origin effects shape complex traits in large-scale biobanks.",

    "abstract": "Acanthocephala (thorny-headed worms), characterized by the presence of an eversible proboscis with hooks, are a diverse endoparasitic group that infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates1. Although long regarded as a separate phylum, they have several putative sister taxa based on morphological features, including Platyhelminthes (flatworms)2, Priapulida (penis worms)3 and Rotifera (wheel animals)4. Molecular phylogenies have instead recovered them within rotifers5–10, suggesting acanthocephalans are derived from free-living worms with a jaw apparatus (Gnathifera). Their only fossil record is Late Cretaceous eggs11, contributing limited palaeontological information to deciphering their early evolution. Here we describe an acanthocephalan body fossil, Juracanthocephalus daohugouensis gen. et. sp. nov., from the Middle Jurassic Daohugou biota of China. Juracanthocephalus shows unambiguous acanthocephalan characteristics, for example a hooked proboscis, a bursa, as well as a jaw apparatus with discrete elements that is typical of other gnathiferans. Juracanthocephalus shares features with Seisonidea (an epizoic member of Rotifera) and Acanthocephala, bridging the evolutionary gap between jawed rotifers and the obligate parasitic, jawless acanthocephalans. Our results reveal previously unrecognized ecological and morphological diversity in ancient Acanthocephala and highlight the significance of transitional fossils, revealing the origins of this highly enigmatic group of living organisms. An acanthocephalan body fossil, Juracanthocephalus daohugouensis, is described from the Middle Jurassic Daohugou biota of China, showing previously unrecognized diversity in ancient Acanthocephala and the origins of this group of living organisms.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in understanding disease biology, treatment of group 3/4 medulloblastoma remains a therapeutic challenge in paediatric neuro-oncology1. Bulk-omics approaches have identified considerable intertumoural heterogeneity in group 3/4 medulloblastoma, including the presence of clear single-gene oncogenic drivers in only a subset of cases, whereas in most cases, large-scale copy number aberrations prevail2,3. However, intratumoural heterogeneity, the role of oncogene aberrations, and broad copy number variation in tumour evolution and treatment resistance remain poorly understood. To dissect this interplay, we used single-cell technologies (single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics) on a cohort of group 3/4 medulloblastoma with known alterations in the oncogenes MYC, MYCN and PRDM6. We show that large-scale chromosomal aberrations are early tumour-initiating events, whereas the single-gene oncogenic events arise late and are typically subclonal, but MYC can become clonal upon disease progression to drive further tumour development and therapy resistance. Spatial transcriptomics shows that the subclones are mostly interspersed across tumour tissue, but clear segregation is also present. Using a population genetics model, we estimate medulloblastoma initiation in the cerebellar unipolar brush cell lineage starting from the first gestational trimester. Our findings demonstrate how single-cell technologies can be applied for early detection and diagnosis of this fatal disease. A large-scale multi-omics analysis reports oncogenic alterations that drive medulloblastoma progression, rather than initiation, and the findings show how single-cell technologies can be used for early detection and diagnosis of medulloblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction1–4 is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors5–8 have focused primarily on the surface code9, which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. The colour code10 enables more efficient logic, but it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures such as superconducting qubits is challenging, and realizations of colour codes11–19 have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here we present a comprehensive demonstration of the colour code on a superconducting processor8. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of Λ3/5 = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the colour code, and the colour code may become more efficient than the surface code following modest device improvements. We test transversal Clifford gates with logical randomized benchmarking20 and inject magic states21, a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99% with post-selection. Finally, we teleport logical states between colour codes using lattice surgery22. This work establishes the colour code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future. Colour code on a superconducting qubit quantum processor is demonstrated, reporting above-breakeven performance and logical error scaling with increased code size by a factor of 1.56 moving from distance-3 to distance-5 code.",

    "abstract": "Acute inflammation is an essential response that our bodies use to combat infections1. However, in the absence of infections, chronic inflammation can have a pivotal role in the onset and progression of chronic diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, autoimmune disorders, metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and most ageing-associated pathologies2,3. The underlying mechanisms that distinguish chronic inflammation from its acute counterpart remain unclear, posing challenges to the development of targeted therapies for these major diseases. Here we identify a mechanism that separates the two responses: during chronic but not acute inflammation, chromatin remodelling is influenced by nuclear autophagy, in which the WSTF protein of the ISWI chromatin-remodelling complex interacts with the ATG8 autophagy protein family in the nucleus. This interaction leads to WSTF nuclear export and subsequent degradation by autophagosomes and lysosomes in the cytoplasm. Loss of WSTF leads to chromatin opening over inflammatory genes, amplifying inflammation. Cell-penetrating peptides that block the WSTF–ATG8 interaction do not affect acute inflammation but suppress chronic inflammation in senescence as well as in MASH and osteoarthritis in mouse models and patient samples. The ability to specifically target chronic inflammation without blunting acute inflammation offers an approach for treating common chronic inflammatory diseases. During chronic but not acute inflammation, chromatin remodelling is influenced by nuclear autophagy through WSTF interaction with ATG8 in the nucleus, leading to WSTF nuclear export and its subsequent degradation.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of animal phyla, each with their unique body plan, was a rapid event in the history of animal life, yet its genomic underpinnings are still poorly understood1. Here we investigate at the genomic, regulatory and cellular levels, the origin of one of the most distinctive animal phyla, the chaetognaths, whose organismal characteristics have historically complicated their phylogenetic placement2,3. We show that these characteristics are reflected at the cell-type level by the expression of genes that originated in the chaetognath lineage, contributing to adaptation to planktonic life at the sensory and structural levels4. Similarly to other members of gnathiferans (which also include rotifers and several other microscopic phyla)5,6, chaetognaths have undergone accelerated genomic evolution with gene loss and chromosomal fusions7,8. Furthermore, they secondarily duplicated thousands of genes9,10, without evidence for a whole-genome duplication, yielding, for instance, tandemly expanded Hox genes, as well as many phylum-specific genes. We also detected repeat-rich highly methylated neocentromeres and a simplified DNA methylation toolkit that is involved in mobile element repression rather than transcriptional control. Consistent with fossil evidence11,12, our observations suggest that chaetognaths emerged after a phase of morphological simplification through a reinvention of organ systems paralleled by massive genomic reorganization, explaining the uniqueness of their body plan. Genomic, single-cell transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses show that chaetognaths, following extensive gene loss in the gnathiferan lineage, relied on newly evolved genes and lineage-specific tandem duplications, not caused by a whole-genome duplication event, to shape their distinctive body plan.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between melting ice and a warming ocean drive the present-day retreat of tidewater glaciers of Greenland1–3, with consequences for both sea level rise4 and the global climate system5. Controlling glacier frontal ablation, these ice–ocean interactions involve chains of small-scale processes that link glacier calving—the detachment of icebergs6—and submarine melt to the broader fjord dynamics7,8. However, understanding these processes remains limited, in large part due to the challenge of making targeted observations in hazardous environments near calving fronts with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution9. Here we show that iceberg calving can act as a submarine melt amplifier through excitation of transient internal waves. Our observations are based on front-proximal submarine fibre sensing of the iceberg calving process chain. In this chain, calving initiates with persistent ice fracturing that coalesces into iceberg detachment, which in turn excites local tsunamis, internal gravity waves and transient currents at the ice front before the icebergs eventually decay into fragments. Our observations show previously unknown pathways in which tidewater glaciers interact with a warming ocean and help close the ice front ablation budget, which current models struggle to do10. These insights provide new process-scale understanding pertinent to retreating tidewater glaciers around the globe. Iceberg calving can act as a submarine melt amplifier through excitation of transient internal waves.",

    "abstract": "Acute tubular necrosis mediates acute kidney injury (AKI) and nephron loss1, the hallmark of end-stage renal disease2–4. For decades, it has been known that female kidneys are less sensitive to AKI5,6. Acute tubular necrosis involves dynamic cell death propagation by ferroptosis along the tubular compartment7,8. Here we demonstrate abrogated ferroptotic cell death propagation in female kidney tubules. 17β-oestradiol establishes an anti-ferroptotic state through non-genomic and genomic mechanisms. These include the potent direct inhibition of ferroptosis by hydroxyoestradiol derivatives, which function as radical trapping antioxidants, are present at high concentrations in kidney tubules and, when exogenously applied, protect male mice from AKI. In cells, the oxidized hydroxyoestradiols are recycled by FSP19,10, but FSP1-deficient female mice were not sensitive to AKI. At the genomic level, female ESR1-deficient kidney tubules partially lose their anti-ferroptotic capacity, similar to ovariectomized mice. While ESR1 promotes the anti-ferroptotic hydropersulfide system, male tubules express pro-ferroptotic proteins of the ether lipid pathway which are suppressed by ESR1 in female tissues until menopause. In summary, we identified non-genomic and genomic mechanisms that collectively explain ferroptosis resistance in female tubules and may function as therapeutic targets for male and postmenopausal female individuals. 17β-oestradiol establishes an anti-ferroptotic state in female kidney tubules.",

    "abstract": "Yellowstone Caldera is one of the largest volcanic systems on Earth, hosting three major caldera-forming eruptions in the past two million years, interspersed with periods of less explosive, smaller-volume eruptions1. Caldera-forming eruptions at Yellowstone are sourced by rhyolitic melts stored within the mid- to upper crust. Seismic tomography studies have suggested that a broad region of rhyolitic melt extends beneath Yellowstone Caldera, with an estimated melt volume that is one to four times greater than the eruptive volume of the largest past caldera-forming eruption, and an estimated melt fraction of 6–28 per cent2–5. Seismic velocity is strongly influenced by temperature, pressure and melt; however, magnetotelluric data are primarily sensitive to the presence of melt, making these data ideal for constraining volcanic systems. Here we utilize magnetotelluric data to model the resistivity structure of Yellowstone Caldera’s crustal magma reservoir and constrain the region’s potential for producing major volcanic eruptions. We find that rhyolitic melts are stored in segregated regions beneath the caldera with low melt fractions, indicating that the reservoirs are not eruptible. Typically, these regions have melt volumes equivalent to small-volume post-caldera Yellowstone eruptions. The largest region of rhyolitic melt storage, concentrated beneath northeast Yellowstone Caldera, has a storage volume similar to the eruptive volume of Yellowstone’s smallest caldera-forming eruption. We identify regions of basalt migrating from the lower crust, merging with and supplying heat to the northeast region of rhyolitic melt storage. On the basis of our analysis, we suggest that the locus of future rhyolitic volcanism has shifted to northeast Yellowstone Caldera. The resistivity structure of Yellowstone Caldera’s crustal magma reservoir indicates that the magma reservoirs are not eruptible at present and that the locus of future volcanism has shifted to northeast Yellowstone Caldera.",

    "abstract": "Excitons, Coulomb-driven bound states of electrons and holes, are typically composed of integer charges1,2. However, in bilayer systems influenced by charge fractionalization3,4, a more interesting form of interlayer exciton can emerge, in which pairing occurs between constituents that carry fractional charges. Despite numerous theoretical predictions for these fractional excitons5–16, their experimental observation has remained unexplored. Here we report transport signatures of excitonic pairing in fractional quantum Hall effect states. By probing the composition of these excitons and their impact on the underlying wavefunction, we discover two new types of quantum phases of matter. One of these can be viewed as the fractional counterpart of the exciton condensate at a total filling of 1, whereas the other involves a more unusual type of exciton that obeys non-bosonic quantum statistics, challenging the standard model of bosonic excitons. Excitonic pairing in fractional quantum Hall states shows two new quantum phases, including a fractional exciton condensate and an unusual type of exciton that obeys fermionic or anyonic quantum statistics.",

    "abstract": "Mollusca is the second most species-rich animal phylum, but the pathways of early molluscan evolution have long been controversial1–5. Modern faunas retain only a fraction of the past forms in this hyperdiverse and long-lived group. Recent analyses6–8 have consistently recovered a fundamental split into two sister clades, Conchifera (including gastropods, bivalves and cephalopods) and Aculifera9, comprising Polyplacophora (‘chitons’) and Aplacophora. Molluscan evolution in toto is characterized by plasticity in body-plan characters10, but historically aculiferans have been interpreted as more conservative10,11. The few completely preserved aculiferan or aculiferan-like fossils from the early Palaeozoic12–19 have been largely regarded as transitional forms that inform questions of character polarity between the extant polyplacophoran and aplacophoran body forms20,21. The history of early aculiferans, and the morphological and ecological range that they occupied, remain inadequately sampled. Here we describe two new three-dimensionally preserved aculiferan species from the Silurian Herefordshire Lagerstätte22,23, which substantially extend the morphological and ecological range of the clade. Phylogenetic analyses indicate positions within a complex nexus of taxa and suggest reversals in the states of fundamental characters such as the presence of valves and the nature of the foot. In contrast to previous hypotheses of morphological conservatism, evolution in early aculiferans generated a profusion of unusual forms comparable to the diversification of other crown-group molluscs. Fossils of two new worm-like aculiferan species add to the diversity of this group, showing that evolution in early aculiferans generated unusual forms comparable to other crown-group molluscs.",

    "abstract": "γ-Glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) is the sole identified enzyme that uses vitamin K (VK) as a cofactor in humans. This protein catalyses the oxidation of VK hydroquinone to convert specific glutamate residues to γ-carboxyglutamate residues in VK-dependent proteins (VDPs), which are involved in various essential biological processes and diseases1–3. However, the working mechanism of GGCX remains unclear. Here we report three cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human GGCX: in the apo state, bound to osteocalcin (a VDP) and bound to VK. The propeptide of the VDP binds to the lumenal domain of GGCX, which stabilizes transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of GGCX to create the VK-binding pocket. After binding of VK, residue Lys218 in GGCX mediates the oxidation of VK hydroxyquinone, which leads to the deprotonation of glutamate residues and the construction of γ-carboxyglutamate residues. Our structural observations and results from binding and cell biological assays and molecular dynamics simulations show that a cholesterol molecule interacts with the transmembrane helices of GGCX to regulate its protein levels in cells. Together, these results establish a link between cholesterol metabolism and VK-dependent pathways. Structural and cellular assays and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism of action of γ-glutamyl carboxylase, which involves cholesterol and vitamin K.",

    "abstract": "The γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues enables Ca2+-mediated membrane assembly of protein complexes that support broad physiological functions, including haemostasis, calcium homeostasis, immune response and endocrine regulation1–4. Modulating γ-carboxylation levels provides prevalent treatments for haemorrhagic and thromboembolic diseases5. This unique post-translational modification requires vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) to drive highly demanding reactions6 catalysed by the membrane-integrated γ-carboxylase (VKGC). Here, to decipher the underlying mechanisms, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VKGC in unbound form, with KH2 and four haemostatic and non-haemostatic proteins possessing propeptides and glutamate-rich domains in different carboxylation states. VKGC recognizes substrate proteins through knob-and-hole interactions with propeptides, thereby bringing tethered glutamate-containing segments for processive carboxylation within a large chamber that provides steric control. Propeptide binding also triggers a global conformational change to signal VKGC activation. Through sequential deprotonation and KH2 epoxidation, VKGC generates a free hydroxide ion as an exceptionally strong base that is required to deprotonate the γ-carbon of glutamate for CO2 addition. The diffusion of this superbase—protected and guided by a sealed hydrophobic tunnel—elegantly resolves the challenge of coupling KH2 epoxidation to γ-carboxylation across the membrane interface. These structural insights and extensive functional experiments advance membrane enzymology and propel the development of treatments for γ-carboxylation disorders. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal the mechanisms underlying multiple-substrate specificity, coupling of epoxidation with carboxylation and allosteric motions during VKGC catalysis, offering potential strategies for targeting haemostatic and non-haemostatic disorders associated with defects in γ-carboxylation.",

    "abstract": "Chirality is a ubiquitous and fundamental asymmetry in nature1,2. Recently, the interaction of chiral objects with spin currents has attracted enormous attention from both scientific and technological perspectives3–5. Of particular interest is the current-driven motion of chiral topological excitations such as chiral magnetic domain walls in chiral three-dimensional magnetic structures that could allow for high-density memory-storage devices. Here we use state-of-the-art multiphoton lithography6,7 to create three-dimensional chiral magnetic ribbons and perform current-induced motion of chiral domain walls. The ribbons are designed to have a clockwise or anticlockwise chiral twist with a variable magnitude. We find that domain walls can either pass through the ribbon or are impeded, depending on their chirality and configuration and the geometrical chiral twist of the ribbon. The interplay between the magnetic exchange energy and the geometrical twist generates a torsional field that favours chiral Bloch-type walls rather than the Néel-type wall favoured by the intrinsic magnetic properties of the magnetic ribbon itself. Furthermore, the interplay of spin chirality and chiral twist results in a non-reciprocal domain wall motion, namely, a domain wall filter or diode8–10. Our findings show how the interplay between geometrical and spin chiralities can lead to new functionalities that could allow for innovative chiral spintronics.

    "abstract": "Modern birds have diversified into a striking array of forms, behaviours and ecological roles. Analyses of molecular evolutionary rates can reveal the links between genomic and phenotypic change1–4, but disentangling the drivers of rate variation at the whole-genome scale has been difficult. Using comprehensive estimates of traits and evolutionary rates across a family-level phylogeny of birds5,6, we find that genome-wide mutation rates across lineages are predominantly explained by clutch size and generation length, whereas rate variation across genes is driven by the content of guanine and cytosine. Here, to find the subsets of genes and lineages that dominate evolutionary rate variation in birds, we estimated the influence of individual lineages on decomposed axes of gene-specific evolutionary rates. We find that most of the rate variation occurs along recent branches of the tree, associated with present-day families of birds. Additional tests on axes of rate variation show rapid changes in microchromosomes immediately after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene transition. These apparent pulses of evolution are consistent with major changes in the genetic machineries for meiosis, heart performance, and RNA splicing, surveillance and translation, and correlate with the ecological diversity reflected in increased tarsus length. Collectively, our analyses paint a nuanced picture of avian evolution, revealing that the ancestors of the most diverse lineages of birds underwent major genomic changes related to mutation, gene usage and niche expansion in the early Palaeogene period. Genomic evolutionary rates are decomposed to identify the dominant lineages and genes driving rate variation across the phylogeny of birds.",

    "abstract": "Goal-directed navigation in a new environment requires quickly identifying and exploiting important locations. Identifying new goal locations depends on neural computations that rapidly represent locations and connect location information to key outcomes such as food1. However, the mechanisms to trigger these computations at behaviourally relevant locations are not well understood. Here we show that parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in the mouse hippocampal CA3 have a causal role in identifying and exploiting new food locations such that decreases in inhibitory activity around goals enable reactivation to bind goal locations to food outcomes. PV interneurons in the CA3 substantially reduce firing on approach to and at goal locations while food-deprived mice learn to find food. These inhibitory decreases anticipate reward locations as the mice learn and are more prominent on correct trials. Sparse optogenetic stimulation to prevent goal-related decreases in PV interneuron firing impaired learning of goal locations. Disrupting goal-related decreases in PV interneuron activity impaired the reactivation of new goal locations after receipt of food, a process that associates previous locations to food outcomes such that the mice know where to seek food later. These results reveal that goal-selective and goal-predictive decreases in inhibitory activity enable learning, representations and outcome associations of crucial locations.

    "abstract": "The human cerebral cortex is composed of six layers and dozens of areas that are molecularly and structurally distinct1–4. Although single-cell transcriptomic studies have advanced the molecular characterization of human cortical development, a substantial gap exists owing to the loss of spatial context during cell dissociation5–8. Here we used multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)9, augmented with deep-learning-based nucleus segmentation, to examine the molecular, cellular and cytoarchitectural development of the human fetal cortex with spatially resolved single-cell resolution. Our extensive spatial atlas, encompassing more than 18 million single cells, spans eight cortical areas across seven developmental time points. We uncovered the early establishment of the six-layer structure, identifiable by the laminar distribution of excitatory neuron subtypes, 3 months before the emergence of cytoarchitectural layers. Notably, we discovered two distinct modes of cortical areal specification during mid-gestation: (1) a continuous, gradual transition observed across most cortical areas along the anterior–posterior axis and (2) a discrete, abrupt boundary specifically identified between the primary (V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortices as early as gestational week 20. This sharp binary transition in V1–V2 neuronal subtypes challenges the notion that mid-gestation cortical arealization involves only gradient-like transitions6,10. Furthermore, integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing with MERFISH revealed an early upregulation of synaptogenesis in V1-specific layer 4 neurons. Collectively, our findings underscore the crucial role of spatial relationships in determining the molecular specification of cortical layers and areas. This study establishes a spatially resolved single-cell analysis paradigm and paves the way for the construction of a comprehensive developmental atlas of the human brain. Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) together with deep-learning-based nucleus segmentation enabled the construction of a highly detailed and informative spatially resolved single-cell atlas of human fetal cortical development.",

    "abstract": "One-carbon homologues are structurally related and functionally identical organic molecules whose chain lengths differ by a single methylene (–CH2–) unit1. Across many classes of molecule—including pharmaceutical agents, natural products, agrochemicals, fragrances and petroleum products—the physicochemical characteristics exhibited by members of a homologous series subtly differ from one compound to another, which can impart remarkable differences to their function2. The efficient generation of homologues is, therefore, an important strategy in molecular discovery programmes3,4. Despite the availability of homologation strategies for several functional groups5,6, direct and general methods for one-carbon chain extension in alkenes remain an unmet synthetic need7,8. Here we report a catalytic one-carbon homologation process that is effective for many classes of alkene in simple and complex molecules. By leveraging the intrinsic reactivity of a new multifaceted allylsulfone reagent, a streamlined one-pot process, involving cross-metathesis and a fragmentation–retro-ene cascade, formally inserts a single methylene unit into the alkene chain. Among the applications of this process to several structurally and functionally complex molecules, we demonstrate how this practical transformation generates previously unexplored homologues of cyclosporine A9. These homologues exhibit modulated pharmacological and biological properties and could provide promising leads as cyclophilin inhibitors, a target that has great potential in many disease areas10. A new method for extending alkenes by one or two carbons is shown to be useful in attenuating the immunosuppressive properties of a medicine, making it potentially applicable for targeting disease areas where immunosuppresion is unwanted.",

    "abstract": "The galaxy correlation function serves as a fundamental tool for studying cosmology, galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. It is well established that more massive, redder and more compact galaxies tend to have stronger clustering in space1,2. These results can be understood in terms of galaxy formation in cold dark matter (CDM) halos of different mass and assembly history. Here we report an unexpectedly strong large-scale clustering for isolated, diffuse and blue dwarf galaxies, comparable to that seen for massive galaxy groups but much stronger than that expected from their halo mass. Our analysis indicates that the strong clustering aligns with the halo assembly bias seen in simulations3 with the standard ΛCDM cosmology only if more diffuse dwarfs formed in low-mass halos of older ages. This pattern is not reproduced by existing models of galaxy evolution in a ΛCDM framework4–6, and our finding provides clues for the search of more viable models. Our results can be explained well by assuming self-interacting dark matter7, suggesting that such a scenario should be considered seriously. Unexpected large-scale clustering of isolated, diffuse and blue dwarf galaxies, comparable to that seen for massive galaxy groups, challenges current models of cosmology and galaxy evolution.",

    "abstract": "Carbon has a central role in biology and organic chemistry, and its solid allotropes provide the basis of much of our modern technology1. However, the liquid form of carbon remains nearly uncharted2, and the structure of liquid carbon and most of its physical properties are essentially unknown3. But liquid carbon is relevant for modelling planetary interiors4,5 and the atmospheres of white dwarfs6, as an intermediate state for the synthesis of advanced carbon materials7,8, inertial confinement fusion implosions9, hypervelocity impact events on carbon materials10 and our general understanding of structured fluids at extreme conditions11. Here we present a precise structure measurement of liquid carbon at pressures of around 1 million atmospheres obtained by in situ X-ray diffraction at an X-ray free-electron laser. Our results show a complex fluid with transient bonding and approximately four nearest neighbours on average, in agreement with quantum molecular dynamics simulations. The obtained data substantiate the understanding of the liquid state of one of the most abundant elements in the universe and can test models of the melting line. The demonstrated experimental abilities open the path to performing similar studies of the structure of liquids composed of light elements at extreme conditions. A precise structure measurement of liquid carbon at pressures of around 1 million atmospheres obtained by in situ X-ray diffraction at an X-ray free-electron laser shows a complex fluid with transient bonding and approximately four nearest neighbours on average.",

    "abstract": "Current approaches used to track stem cell clones through differentiation require genetic engineering1,2 or rely on sparse somatic DNA variants3,4, which limits their wide application. Here we discover that DNA methylation of a subset of CpG sites reflects cellular differentiation, whereas another subset undergoes stochastic epimutations and can serve as digital barcodes of clonal identity. We demonstrate that targeted single-cell profiling of DNA methylation5 at single-CpG resolution can accurately extract both layers of information. To that end, we develop EPI-Clone, a method for transgene-free lineage tracing at scale. Applied to mouse and human haematopoiesis, we capture hundreds of clonal differentiation trajectories across tens of individuals and 230,358 single cells. In mouse ageing, we demonstrate that myeloid bias and low output of old haematopoietic stem cells6 are restricted to a small number of expanded clones, whereas many functionally young-like clones persist in old age. In human ageing, clones with and without known driver mutations of clonal haematopoieis7 are part of a spectrum of age-related clonal expansions that display similar lineage biases. EPI-Clone enables accurate and transgene-free single-cell lineage tracing on hematopoietic cell state landscapes at scale. The discovery that DNA methylation of different CpG sites can serve as digital barcodes of clonal identity led to the development of EPI-Clone, an algorithm that enables single-cell lineage tracing through cellular differentiation at scale.",

    "abstract": "ATP generated in the mitochondria is exported by an ADP/ATP carrier of the SLC25 family1. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cannot synthesize ATP but must import cytoplasmic ATP to energize protein folding, quality control and trafficking2,3. It was recently proposed that a member of the nucleotide sugar transporter family, termed SLC35B1 (also known as AXER), is not a nucleotide sugar transporter but a long-sought-after ER importer of ATP4. Here we report that human SLC35B1 does not bind nucleotide sugars but indeed executes strict ATP/ADP exchange with uptake kinetics consistent with the import of ATP into crude ER microsomes. A CRISPR–Cas9 cell-line knockout demonstrated that SLC35B1 clusters with the most essential SLC transporters for cell growth, consistent with its proposed physiological function. We have further determined seven cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human SLC35B1 in complex with an Fv fragment and either bound to an ATP analogue or ADP in all major conformations of the transport cycle. We observed that nucleotides were vertically repositioned up to approximately 6.5 Å during translocation while retaining key interactions with a flexible substrate-binding site. We conclude that SLC35B1 operates by a stepwise ATP translocation mechanism, which is a previously undescribed model for substrate translocation by an SLC transporter. SLC35B1, initially thought to be a nucleotide sugar transporter, is an essential ATP/ADP exchanger that imports ATP into the endoplasmic reticulum through a unique stepwise translocation mechanism.",

    "abstract": "There is ongoing debate as to when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved on Earth1,2. Geochemical data from ancient sediments indicate localized or ephemeral photosynthetic O2 production before the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) approximately 2.5–2.3 billion years ago (Ga), and currently suggest Archaean origins, approximately 3 Ga or earlier3–9. However, sedimentary records of the early Earth often suffer from preservation issues, and poor control on the timing of oxidation leaves geochemical proxy data for the ancient presence of O2 open to critique10–13. Here, we report rare Earth element data from three different Archaean carbonate platforms preserved in greenstone belts of the northwest Superior Craton (Canada), which were deposited by the activity of marine photosynthetic bacteria 2.87 Ga, 2.85 Ga and 2.78 Ga. All three indicate O2 production before the GOE in the form of significant depletions in cerium (Ce), reflecting oxidative Ce removal from ancient seawater, as occurs today14. Using 138La-138Ce geochronology, we show that La/Ce fractionation, and thus Ce oxidation, occurred at the time of deposition, making these the oldest directly dated Ce anomalies. These results place the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in the Mesoarchaean or earlier and bring an important new perspective on a long-standing debate regarding Earth’s biological and geochemical evolution. 138La-138Ce geochronology shows that La/Ce fractionation, and Ce oxidation, occurred at the time of deposition, placing the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in the Mesoarchaean or earlier.",

Repurposing natural enzymes through synthetic chemical strategies holds promise for exploring new chemical space2–6. Elegant strategies, including directed evolution7–10, artificial enzymes11 and photoenzymatic catalysis12,13, have demonstrated their capacities for expanding the applications of enzymes in both academia and industry. However, the integration of electrochemistry with enzymes has primarily been limited to replicating previously established enzyme functions14–16. Key challenges in achieving new enzyme reactivity with electricity include compatibility issues and difficulties in heterogeneous electron transfer. Here we report the reshaping of thiamine-dependent enzymes with ferrocene-mediated electrocatalysis to unlock an unnatural dynamic kinetic oxidation of α-branched aldehydes. This robust electroenzymatic approach yields various bioactive (S)-profens with up to 99% enantiomeric excess; it is applicable with whole cells overexpressing the enzyme and using down to 0.05 mol% enzyme loadings. Mechanistic investigations show multiple functions of the electroenzyme in precise substrate discrimination, accelerating racemization and facilitating kinetically matched electron transfer events. Reshaping of thiamine-dependent enzymes with ferrocene-mediated electrocatalysis can unlock an unnatural dynamic kinetic oxidation of α-branched aldehydes, providing new opportunities for making molecules.",

    "abstract": "Fast thermal dephasing limits macroscopic quantum phenomena to cryogenic conditions1–4 and hinders their use at ambient temperatures5,6. For electronic excitations in condensed media, dephasing is mediated by thermal lattice motion1,7,8. Therefore, taming the lattice influence is essential for creating collective electronic quantum states at high temperatures. Although there are occasional reports of high-Tc quantum effects across different platforms, it is unclear which lattice characteristics and electron–lattice interactions lead to macroscopically coherent electronic states in solids9. Here we studied intensity fluctuations in the macroscopic polarization during the emergence of superfluorescence in a lead halide perovskite10 and showed that spontaneously synchronized polaronic lattice oscillations accompany collective electronic dipole emission. We further developed an effective field model and theoretically confirmed that exciton–lattice interactions lead to a new electronically and structurally entangled coherent extended solitonic state beyond a critical polaron density. The analysis shows a phase transition with two processes happening in tandem: incoherent disordered polaronic lattice deformations establish an order, while macroscopic quantum coherence among excitons simultaneously emerges. Recombination of excitons in this state culminates in superfluorescence at high temperatures. Our study establishes fundamental connections between the transient superfluorescence process observed after the impulsive excitation of perovskites and general equilibrium phase transitions achieved by thermal cooling. By identifying various electron–lattice interactions in the perovskite structure and their respective role in creating collectively coherent electronic effects in solids, our work provides unprecedented insight into the design and development of new materials that exhibit high-temperature macroscopic quantum phenomena. Exciton–lattice interactions suppress thermal noise through vibration isolation, enabling unconventional solitonic superfluorescence at unusually high temperatures in lead halide perovskites.",

    "abstract": "Materials emitting circularly polarized light (CPL) are highly sought after for applications ranging from efficient displays to quantum information technologies1–7. However, established methods for time-resolved CPL (TRCPL) characterization have notable limitations8–17, generally requiring a compromise between sensitivity, accessible timescales and spectral information. This has limited the acquisition of in-depth photophysical insight necessary for materials development. Here we demonstrate a high-sensitivity (noise level of the order of 10−4), broadband (about 400–900 nm), transient (nanosecond resolution, millisecond range) full-Stokes (CPL and linear polarizations) spectroscopy setup. The achieved combination of high-sensitivity, broad wavelength response and flexible time ranges represents a substantial advancement over previous TRCPL approaches. As a result, TRCPL measurements are shown to be applicable to hitherto inaccessible material systems and photophysical processes, including systems with low (10−3) dissymmetry factors and luminescence pathways spanning nanosecond to millisecond time ranges. Finally, full-Stokes measurements allow tracking the temporal evolution of linear polarization components, of interest by themselves, but especially relevant in the context of controlling for associated CPL artefacts18,19 in the time domain. A high-sensitivity, broadband, transient, full-Stokes spectroscopy setup is demonstrated, which can detect quickly varying small signals from chiral emitters.",

    "abstract": "When two monolayer materials are stacked with a relative twist, an effective moiré translation symmetry emerges, leading to fundamentally different properties in the resulting heterostructure. As such, moiré materials have recently provided highly tunable platforms for exploring strongly correlated systems1,2. However, previous studies have focused almost exclusively on monolayers with triangular lattices and low-energy states near the Γ (refs. 3,4) or K (refs. 5–9) points of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Here we introduce a new class of moiré systems based on monolayers with triangular lattices but low-energy states at the M points of the BZ. These M-point moiré materials feature three time-reversal-preserving valleys related by threefold rotational symmetry. We propose twisted bilayers of exfoliable 1T-SnSe2 and 1T-ZrS2 as realizations of this new class. Using extensive ab initio simulations, we identify twist angles that yield flat conduction bands, provide accurate continuum models, analyse their topology and charge density and explore the platform’s rich physics. Notably, the M-point moiré Hamiltonians exhibit emergent momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetries and a kagome plane-wave lattice structure. This represents, to our knowledge, the first experimentally viable realization of projective representations of crystalline space groups in a non-magnetic system. With interactions, these systems act as six-flavour Hubbard simulators with Mott physics. Moreover, the presence of a momentum-space non-symmorphic in-plane mirror symmetry renders some of the M-point moiré Hamiltonians quasi-one-dimensional in each valley, suggesting the possibility of realizing Luttinger-liquid physics. A new class of moiré materials based on monolayers with triangular lattices and low-energy states at the M points of the Brillouin zone is introduced, demonstrating emergent momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetries, a kagome plane-wave lattice structure, and potential quasi-one-dimensionality.",

    "abstract": "Wild plants can contribute valuable genes to their domesticated relatives1. Fertility barriers and a lack of genomic resources have hindered the effective use of crop–wild introgressions. Decades of research into barley’s closest wild relative, Hordeum bulbosum, a grass native to the Mediterranean basin and Western Asia, have yet to manifest themselves in the release of a cultivar bearing alien genes2. Here we construct a pangenome of bulbous barley comprising 10 phased genome sequence assemblies amounting to 32 distinct haplotypes. Autotetraploid cytotypes, among which the donors of resistance-conferring introgressions are found, arose at least twice, and are connected among each other and to diploid forms through gene flow. The differential amplification of transposable elements after barley and H. bulbosum diverged from each other is responsible for genome size differences between them. We illustrate the translational value of our resource by mapping non-host resistance to a viral pathogen to a structurally diverse multigene cluster that has been implicated in diverse immune responses in wheat and barley. A study describes the assembly and analysis of a haplotype-resolved pangenome of bulbous barley with the potential to improve domesticated barley and illustrates its use in evolutionary research and trait mapping.",

    "abstract": "Remodelling plant immune receptors has become a vital strategy for creating new disease resistance traits to combat the growing threat of plant pathogens to global food security and environmental sustainability1–17. However, current methods are constrained by the rapid evolution of plant pathogens and often lack broad-spectrum and durable protection. Here we report an innovative strategy to engineer broad-spectrum, durable and complete disease resistance in plants through expression of a chimeric protein containing a flexible polypeptide coupled with a single or dual conserved pathogen-originated protease cleavage site fused in frame to the N terminus of an autoactive nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat immune receptor (NLR) containing a coiled-coil or RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8-like coiled-coil domain. Following invasion, pathogen-originated specific proteases cleave the inactive chimeric protein to form free autoactive NLR, triggering broad-spectrum plant disease resistance. We demonstrate that a single engineered NLR can confer broad-spectrum and complete resistance against multiple potyviruses. Given that many pathogenic organisms across kingdoms encode proteases, this strategy has the potential to be exploited to control viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, fungi, nematodes and pests in plants. Cleavage by pathogen-derived proteases of an engineered chimeric protein activates its plant immune receptor component, enabling broad-spectrum resistance to pathogens in plants.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of structural heart disease is critical to improving outcomes, but widespread screening remains limited by the cost and accessibility of imaging tools such as echocardiography1,2. Recent advances in machine learning applied to heart rhythm recordings have shown promise in identifying disease3,4, although previous work has been limited by development in narrow populations or targeting only select heart conditions5. Here we introduce a deep learning model, EchoNext, trained on more than 1 million heart rhythm and imaging records across a large and diverse health system to detect many forms of structural heart disease. The model demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in internal and external validation, outperforming cardiologists in a controlled evaluation and showing consistent performance across different care settings and racial and/or ethnic groups. The models were prospectively evaluated in a clinical trial of patients without previous cardiac imaging, successfully identifying previously undiagnosed heart disease. These findings support the potential of artificial intelligence to expand access to heart disease screening at scale. To enable further development and transparency, we have publicly released model weights and a large, annotated dataset linking heart rhythm data to imaging-based diagnoses. EchoNext, a deep learning model for electrocardiograms trained and validated in diverse health systems, successfully detects many forms of structural heart disease, supporting the potential of artificial intelligence to expand access to heart disease screening at scale.",

    "abstract": "The expression and location of proteins in tissues represent key determinants of health and disease. Although recent advances in multiplexed imaging have expanded the number of spatially accessible proteins1–3, the integration of biological layers (that is, cell structure, subcellular domains and signalling activity) remains challenging. This is due to limitations in the compositions of antibody panels and image resolution, which together restrict the scope of image analysis. Here we present pathology-oriented multiplexing (PathoPlex), a scalable, quality-controlled and interpretable framework. It combines highly multiplexed imaging at subcellular resolution with a software package to extract and interpret protein co-expression patterns (clusters) across biological layers. PathoPlex was optimized to map more than 140 commercial antibodies at 80 nm per pixel across 95 iterative imaging cycles and provides pragmatic solutions to enable the simultaneous processing of at least 40 archival biopsy specimens. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we identified epithelial JUN activity as a key switch in immune-mediated kidney disease, thereby demonstrating that clusters can capture relevant pathological features. PathoPlex was then used to analyse human diabetic kidney disease. The framework linked patient-level clusters to organ disfunction and identified disease traits with therapeutic potential (that is, calcium-mediated tubular stress). Finally, PathoPlex was used to reveal renal stress-related clusters in individuals with type 2 diabetes without histological kidney disease. Moreover, tissue-based readouts were generated to assess responses to inhibitors of the glucose cotransporter SGLT2. In summary, PathoPlex paves the way towards democratizing multiplexed imaging and establishing integrative image analysis tools in complex tissues to support the development of next-generation pathology atlases. Pathology-oriented multiplexing (PathoPlex) represents a framework for widespread access to multiplexed imaging and computational image analysis of clinical specimens at a relatively high throughput and subcellular resolution.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic field generation on Earth has probably persisted for at least 3.5 Gyr (refs. 1,2), initially sustained by secular cooling of the Earth’s core and, more recently, by the growth of the solid inner core3. Numerical models of the present-day geodynamo have proved to be successful in producing Earth-like magnetic fields4–7 and approaching realistic dynamic regimes8–11. However, thermal evolution12,13 and palaeomagnetic records14,15 suggest that the geodynamo operated for most of geomagnetic history without a solid inner core. Dynamo action in a whole fluid core remains poorly understood. Here we show dynamo actions that are independent of fluid viscosity in the correct geometry of the Earth’s core in the deep past at extremely low viscosity, demonstrating the negligible role of fluid viscosity in our dynamo simulations. Our early-Earth geometry models produce magnetic field intensity and morphologies that are compatible with the palaeomagnetic data in the deep past while showing remarkable similarity to the present-day magnetic field. This raises questions about the role of the solid inner core in producing the spatial-temporal variations of the observed Earth’s magnetic field7,16–18. Early-Earth geometry models are presented, producing magnetic field intensity and morphologies agreeing with palaeomagnetic data in the deep past and demonstrating the negligible role of fluid viscosity in the Earth’s early geodynamo.",

    "abstract": "Proteins that bind to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with high affinity and specificity could be useful for therapeutic and diagnostic applications1–4. However, a general methodology for targeting IDPs or IDRs has yet to be developed. Here we show that starting only from the target sequence of the input, and freely sampling both target and binding protein conformations, RFdiffusion5 can generate binders to IDPs and IDRs in a wide range of conformations. We used this approach to generate binders to the IDPs amylin, C-peptide, VP48 and BRCA1_ARATH in diverse conformations with a dissociation constant (Kd) ranging from 3 to 100 nM. For the IDRs G3BP1, common cytokine receptor γ-chain (IL-2RG) and prion protein, we diffused binders to β-strand conformations of the targets, obtaining Kd between 10 and 100 nM. Fluorescence imaging experiments show that the binders bind to their respective targets in cells. The G3BP1 binder disrupts stress granule formation in cells, and the amylin binder inhibits amyloid fibril formation and dissociates existing fibres, enables targeting of both monomeric and fibrillar amylin to lysosomes, and increases the sensitivity of mass spectrometry-based amylin detection. Our approach should be useful for creating binders to flexible IDPs or IDRs spanning a wide range of intrinsic conformational preferences. Using RFdiffusion, a general method for targeting intrinsically disordered proteins and regions for protein design has been developed.",

    "abstract": "Projections of tropical rainfall under global warming remain highly uncertain1,2, largely because of an unclear climate response to a potential weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)3. Although an AMOC slowdown can substantially alter tropical rainfall patterns4–8, the physical mechanisms linking high-latitude changes to tropical hydroclimate are poorly understood11. Here we demonstrate that an AMOC slowdown drives widespread shifts in tropical rainfall through the propagation of high-latitude cooling into the tropical North Atlantic. We identify and validate this mechanism using climate model simulations and palaeoclimate records from Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1)—a past period marked by pronounced AMOC weakening9,10. In models, prevailing easterly and westerly winds communicate the climate signal to the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean through the transport of cold air generated over the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic. Air–sea interactions transmit the response across the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, altering rainfall patterns as far as Indonesia, the tropical Andes and northern Australia. A similar teleconnection emerges under global warming scenarios, producing a consistent multi-model pattern of tropical hydroclimatic change. These palaeo-validated projections show widespread drying across Mesoamerica, the Amazon and West Africa, highlighting an elevated risk of severe drought for vulnerable human and ecological systems. An Atlantic meridional overturning circulation slowdown drives widespread shifts in tropical rainfall through the propagation of high-latitude cooling into the tropical North Atlantic.",

    "abstract": "Transition metal–hydrides have been widely exploited in catalysis for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated moieties, including carbonyls, alkenes and alkynes1. To complement heterolytic metal–hydride bond cleavage, metal–hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) has recently gained attention, as a promising strategy for radical hydrofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes2, thus enabling late-stage diversification of complex molecules3,4. However, owing to the weak interactions between the prochiral organic radical and the enantiopure catalyst5, asymmetric MHAT6 remains challenging. Here we show that cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) can be repurposed to catalyse asymmetric MHAT, a new-to-nature reaction. Directed evolution of P450BM3 yielded a triple mutant that catalyses MHAT radical cyclization of unactivated alkenes, producing diverse cyclic compounds—including pyrrolidines and piperidines—with up to 98:2 enantiomeric ratio under aerobic whole-cell conditions. Apart from electron-deficient alkenes, alternative radical acceptors—including hydrazones, oximes and nitriles—were converted by repurposed P450BM3 to enantioenriched cyclization products. Mechanistic investigations support an MHAT mechanism proceeding by homolytic cleavage of a fleeting iron(III)–hydride species2,6. Starting from CYP119, directed evolution afforded a stereocomplementary MHATase, highlighting the potential of repurposed CYPs for MHAT biocatalysis. Our study highlights the prospect of integrating homolytic metal–hydride reactivity into metalloenzymes, thus expanding the scope of asymmetric radical biocatalysis. Cytochrome P450 enzymes can be repurposed to catalyse asymmetric metal–hydride hydrogen atom transfer, a new-to-nature reaction.",

    "abstract": "Motor skill learning induces long-lasting synaptic plasticity at dendritic spines1–4 and at the outputs of motor cortical neurons to the striatum5,6. However, little is known about corticostriatal axon activity and structural plasticity during learning in the adult brain. Here, using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging, we tracked thousands of corticostriatal axonal boutons in the dorsolateral striatum of awake mice. We found that learning a new motor skill dynamically regulated these boutons. The activities of motor corticostriatal axonal boutons exhibited selectivity for rewarded movements (RM) and unrewarded movements (UM). Notably, boutons on the same axonal branches showed diverse responses during behaviour. Motor learning significantly increased the proportion of RM boutons and reduced the heterogeneity of bouton activities. Moreover, motor learning induced profound structural dynamism in boutons. By combining structural and functional imaging, we saw that newly formed axonal boutons were more likely to exhibit selectivity for RM and were stabilized during motor learning, whereas UM boutons were selectively eliminated. These findings reveal a novel form of plasticity in corticostriatal axons and show that motor learning drives dynamic bouton reorganization to support motor skill acquisition and execution. Individual boutons on mouse corticostriatal axons exhibit differential selectivity for rewarded and unrewarded movements during motor learning, and the proportion of reward-responsive boutons increases.",

    "abstract": "Immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments are common in cancers such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (MASH-HCC)1–3. Although immune cell metabolism influences effector function, the effect of tumour metabolism on immunogenicity is less understood4. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) links substrate availability and mitochondrial metabolism with lipid biosynthesis and gene regulation5–7. Although ACLY inhibition shows antiproliferative effects in various tumours, clinical translation has been limited by challenges in inhibitor development and compensatory metabolic pathways8–12. Here, using a mouse model of MASH-HCC that mirrors human disease, genetic inhibition of ACLY in hepatocytes and tumours reduced neoplastic lesions by over 70%. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of this pathway, a novel small-molecule ACLY inhibitor, EVT0185 (6-[4-(5-carboxy-5-methyl-hexyl)-phenyl]−2,2-dimethylhexanoic acid), was identified via phenotypic screening. EVT0185 is converted to a CoA thioester in the liver by SLC27A2 and structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy reveals that EVT0185-CoA directly interacts with the CoA-binding site of ACLY. Oral delivery of EVT0185 in three mouse models of MASH-HCC dramatically reduces tumour burden as monotherapy and enhances efficacy of current standards of care including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies. Transcriptomic and spatial profiling in mice and humans linked reduced tumour ACLY with increases in the chemokine CXCL13, tumour-infiltrating B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures. The depletion of B cells blocked the antitumour effects of ACLY inhibition. Together, these findings illustrate how targeting tumour metabolism can rewire immune function and suppress cancer progression in MASH-HCC. Using metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis-driven hepatocellular carcinoma mouse models, an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor reduces tumour burden and enhances efficacy of current standards of care.",

Here, we present a preclinical covalent compound, CMX410, that contains an aryl fluorosulfate (SuFEx)2 warhead and uniquely targets the acyltransferase domain of Pks13, an essential enzyme in cell-wall biosynthesis. CMX410 is equipotent against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mtb and efficacious in multiple mouse models of infection. Inhibition by CMX410 is irreversible through a previously undescribed mechanism: CMX410 reacts with the catalytic serine of the AT domain of Pks13, rapidly and irreversibly disabling the active site by forming a β-lactam. CMX410 is highly selective for its target and thus demonstrates excellent pharmacological and safety profiles, including no adverse effects in a 14-day rat toxicity study up to 1,000 mg kg−1 per day. The distinctive mode of action from current drugs, high potency across all tested clinical isolates, oral bioavailability, favourable performance in drug combination testing and superior pharmacological and safety characteristics make CMX410 a promising first-in-class candidate to replace outdated cell-wall biosynthesis inhibitors, such as isoniazid and ethambutol, in tuberculosis regimens. A preclinical covalent compound, CMX410, contains a aryl fluorosulfate warhead that targets the acyltransferase domain of Mtb Pks13, an essential enzyme in cell-wall biosynthesis, making it a promising candidate for tuberculosis treatment regimens.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in HIV-1 prophylaxis, vertical transmission remains a pressing problem in developing countries1. Given the promise of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for HIV-1 prevention2, we hypothesized that neonatal delivery of bNAbs using adeno-associated virus (AAV) could provide durable HIV-1 immunity during infancy. Here, using infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as a model, we show that a one-time administration of an AAV vector encoding bNAb 3BNC117 at birth led to sustained bNAb expression for more than three years without redosing. This approach significantly protected both infant and pre-adolescent rhesus macaques from infection with simian–human immunodeficiency virus in mucosal challenge models that mimic HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding and sexual intercourse. Age at the time of AAV-3BNC117 administration was a main determinant of success and was inversely correlated with the incidence of host anti-drug antibodies that restricted bNAb expression. Consistent with principles of neonatal tolerance3,4, newborn rhesus macaques exhibited higher levels of bNAb expression than older infants and juveniles following AAV-3BNC117 dosing. Furthermore, in utero exposure to recombinant 3BNC117 suppressed anti-drug antibodies and improved AAV-vectored delivery of this bNAb in older infants. Thus, our results suggest that neonatal and fetal immunological tolerance can be leveraged to improve postnatal AAV delivery of HIV-1 bNAbs in primates. Since years-long HIV-1 immunity can be generated in rhesus macaques from a one-time AAV vector administration at birth, future studies should evaluate the ability of this strategy to prevent perinatal and adolescent HIV-1 infections in humans. A single dose of an adeno-associated virus vector encoding an HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody given shortly after birth results in persistent antibody expression and protection from infection in rhesus macaque models of human HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding and sexual intercourse.",

    "abstract": "Hexagonal diamond (HD), with anticipated physical properties superior than the known cubic diamond, has been pursued relentlessly since its inception 60 years ago1. However, natural and synthetic HD has only been preserved as a highly disordered component in fragile, heterogeneous mixtures of other nanocarbon structures that precludes determination of bulk properties and identification of HD as a bona fide crystalline phase2–4. Here we report the synthesis, recovery and extensive characterization of bulk HD by compressing and heating high-quality graphite single crystals under controlled quasi-hydrostatic conditions. We demonstrate the successful synthesis of 100-µm-sized to mm-sized, highly ordered, bulk HD. We observed direct transformation of graphite (\n                \n                  \n                \n                $$10\\bar{1}0$$\n                \n              ) orientation to HD (0002) and graphite (0002) to HD (\n                \n                  \n                \n                $$10\\bar{1}0$$\n                \n              ). The bulk sample consists of threefold intergrowth of tightly knitted 100-nm-sized crystals, predominantly HD with trace imperfections of cubic diamond. The interlayer bonds in HD are shortened with respect to intralayer bonds to optimize the HD structure. Notably, the hardness of HD is only slightly higher than cubic diamond. We anticipate that purifying the precursor graphite carbon and fine-tuning the high pressure–temperature (P–T) synthesis conditions may lead to higher-quality HDs. The synthesis, recovery and detailed characterization of bulk hexagonal diamond under high pressure and temperature conditions using precursor graphite carbon is described, demonstrating the first successful synthesis in the 100 µm to millimetre size range.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian cells entering the cell cycle favour glycolysis to rapidly generate ATP and produce the biosynthetic intermediates that are required for rapid biomass accumulation1. Simultaneously, the ubiquitin-ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its coactivator CDH1 (APC/CCDH1) remains active, allowing origin licensing and blocking premature DNA replication. Paradoxically, glycolysis is reduced by APC/CCDH1 through the degradation of key glycolytic enzymes2, raising the question of how cells coordinate these mutually exclusive events to ensure proper cell division. Here we show that cells resolve this paradox by transiently inactivating the APC/C during cell cycle entry, which allows a transient metabolic shift favouring glycolysis. After mitogen stimulation, rapid mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of the APC/C adapter protein CDH1 at the amino terminus causes it to partially dissociate from the APC/C. This partial inactivation of the APC/C leads to the accumulation of PFKFB3, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, promoting a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. Delayed accumulation of phosphatase activity later removes CDH1 phosphorylation, restoring full APC/C activity, and shifting cells back to favouring oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, cells coordinate the simultaneous demands of cell cycle progression and metabolism through an incoherent feedforward loop, which transiently inhibits APC/C activity to generate a pulse of glycolysis that is required for mammalian cell cycle entry. APC/C activity is transiently inhibited to generate a pulse of glycolysis that is required for mammalian cell cycle entry.",

    "abstract": "Across mammalian species, new mothers undergo behavioural changes to nurture their offspring and meet the caloric demands of milk production1–5. Although many neural circuits underlying feeding and parenting behaviours are well characterized6–9, it is unclear how these different circuits interact and adapt during lactation. Here we performed transcriptomic profiling of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the mouse hypothalamus in response to lactation and hunger. Furthermore, we showed that heightened appetite in lactating mice was accompanied by increased activity of hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the ARC (ARCAgRP neurons). To assess the strength of hunger versus maternal drives, we designed a conflict assay in which female mice chose between a food source or pups and nesting material. Although food-deprived lactating mothers prioritized parenting over feeding, hunger reduced the duration and disrupted the sequences of parenting behaviours in both lactating and virgin females. We found that ARCAgRP neurons inhibit bombesin receptor subtype 3 (BRS3) neurons in the MPOA (MPOABRS3 neurons), which become more active postpartum and govern parenting and satiety. Activation of this ARCAgRP-to-MPOABRS3 circuit shifted behaviours from parenting to food-seeking. Thus, hypothalamic networks are modulated by physiological states and work antagonistically during the prioritization of competing motivated behaviours. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of mouse hypothalamus and behavioural experiments show that specific hypothalamic networks regulate conflicting feeding versus parenting behaviours of female mice.",

    "abstract": "Migration of transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells into the brain following systemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transplantation (HCT) holds great promise as a therapeutic modality to correct genetic deficiencies in the brain such as lysosomal storage diseases.1–3 However, the toxic myeloablation required for allogeneic HCT can cause serious, life-threatening side effects limiting its applicability. Moreover, transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells are highly vulnerable to rejection even in an immune-privileged organ like the brain. Here we report a brain-restricted, high-efficiency microglia replacement approach without myeloablative preconditioning. Unlike previous assumptions, we found that hematopoietic stem cells are not required to repopulate the myeloid compartment of the brain environment. In contrast, Sca1- committed progenitor cells were highly efficient to replace microglia following intracerebral injection. This finding enabled the development of brain-restricted preconditioning and avoided long-term peripheral engraftment thus eliminating complications such as graft-vs-host disease. Evaluating its therapeutic potential, we found that our allogeneic microglia replacement method rescues the murine model of Sandhoff disease, a lysosomal storage disease caused by hexosaminidase B deficiency. In support of the translational relevance of this approach, we discovered that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myeloid progenitor cells display a similar engraftment potential following brain-restricted conditioning. Our results overcome current limitations of conventional HCT and may pave the way for the development of allogeneic microglial cell therapies for the brain.",

    "abstract": "There is ongoing debate about the vulnerability of arthropods to climate change1,2. Long-term impacts of climate change on arthropod communities could manifest through short-term weather patterns3. Arthropods in the tropics are hyper-diverse4,5 and contribute many crucial ecosystem functions6,7, but are comparatively less studied than in temperate regions1,8,9. Tropical forest arthropods and the functions that they provide may be vulnerable to intensified El Niño events under climate change10–12. Here we perform time-series analysis of data from primary tropical forests, which reveal long-term declines in arthropod diversity and function that were linked to El Niño occurrence. In the Americas, species losses correlated with El Niño sensitivity, and abundant species fluctuated according to feeding traits and level of ecological specialization. Parallel declines in butterflies in Southeast Asia suggested that impacts spanned continents. Predicted arthropod diversity changes correlated with observed rates of invertebrate-mediated decomposition and leaf herbivory, which were oscillating and crashing, respectively, across the tropics. Our analyses suggest that an intensified El Niño immediately threatens tropical forest arthropods and the ecosystem functions that they provide. The broader consequences remain unknown, but such widespread changes could fundamentally alter tropical forest ecosystems13. Long-term monitoring of arthropod diversity and forest functioning across the tropics is paramount, as is researching the potential mechanisms that underly this novel threat. Time-series data from tropical forests tracking weather and declines in arthropod diversity and function show that fluctuations in species were largely dependent on their El Niño sensitivity and ecological specialization.",

However, both methods face fundamental limitations, such as a limited Q factor and near-field enhancement control and the inability to achieve resonance on–off switching by completely coupling and decoupling the mode from the far field. Here we demonstrate temporal symmetry breaking in metasurfaces through ultrafast optical pumping, providing an experimental realization of radiative-loss-driven resonance tuning, allowing resonance creation, annihilation, broadening and sharpening. To enable this temporal control, we introduce restored symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum. Even though their unit cells are geometrically asymmetric, coupling to the radiation continuum remains fully suppressed, which, in this work, is achieved by two equally strong antisymmetric dipoles. By using selective Mie-resonant pumping in parts of these unit cells, we can modify their dipole balance to create or annihilate resonances as well as tune the linewidth, amplitude and near-field enhancement, leading to potential applications in optical and quantum communications, time crystals and photonic circuits. The ultrafast optical control of resonances in temporally symmetry-broken metasurfaces allows resonances to be created, annihilated or programmably manipulated, which is useful for applications that require active real-time tunability.",

    "abstract": "The standard scenario for the origin of jawed vertebrates depicts a transition from benthic grazers to nektonic predators1–3, facilitated by a suite of anatomical innovations, including elaborate sensory systems, a high-flow heart and the integration of jaw-opening muscles with the craniothoracic hinge4–7. However, the lamprey-like internal anatomy8–13 reconstructed for osteostracans, the sister group of jawed vertebrates, seem to lack these gnathostome traits, implying a morphological gap despite phylogenetic proximity. Here, using synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography on the model osteostracan Norselaspis glacialis, we reveal derived gnathostome traits straddling a uniquely ossified head–trunk interface in this jawless fish. The inner ear of Norselaspis shows sensory elaborations (enlarged pars inferior and sinus superior) acquired well before the origin of jaws. As in crown gnathostomes, paired venous drainage channels blood into a high-volume cardiac tract. We also confirm a feature not yet demonstrated in any other vertebrate, to our knowledge: the most anterior trunk nerve extends its single trunk to the pectoral fin. In this respect, our reconstruction challenges the hypotheses14–16 that the gnathostome shoulder evolved from the gill apparatus. Our observations highlight Norselaspis as a prelude to the intercalation of the muscular neck and throat that would power the early jaw apparatus. Therefore, the vertebrate jaw—often considered the functional driver for ‘gnathostome’ innovations1–3—evolved instead as a follower to the sensory enhancement, increased cardiac output and greater locomotory control now inferred in the jawless sister group. Imaging of a Devonian jawless fish reveals advanced features previously thought to be exclusive to jawed vertebrates, challenging the idea that jaws were the primary driver for the evolution of derived traits in the vertebrate body plan.",

These planets form two populations separated by a natural division at about 1.8 R⊕ termed the radius valley. It is uncertain whether these populations arose from separate dry versus water-rich formation channels, evolved apart because of long-term atmospheric loss or a combination of both5–14. Here we report observations of ongoing hydrogen loss from two sibling planets, TOI-776 b (1.85 ± 0.13 R⊕) and TOI-776 c (2.02 ± 0.14 R⊕), the sizes of which near the radius valley and mature (1–4 Gyr) age make them valuable for investigating the origins of the divided population of which they are a part. During the transits of these planets, absorption appeared against the Lyman-α emission of the host star, compatible with hydrogen escape at rates equivalent to 0.03–0.6% and 0.1–0.9% of the total mass per billion years of each planet, respectively. Observations of the outer planet, TOI-776 c, are incompatible with an outflow of dissociated steam, suggesting both it and its inner sibling formed in a dry environment. These observations support the strong role of hydrogen loss in the evolution of close-orbiting sub-Neptunes5–8,15,16. Ongoing hydrogen loss from two sibling exoplanets provides support for the role of such hydrogen loss in the evolution of close-orbiting sub-Neptunes.",

    "abstract": "Modular structure and function are ubiquitous in biology, from the organization of animal brains and bodies to the scale of ecosystems. However, the mechanisms of modularity emergence from non-modular precursors remain unclear. Here we introduce the principle of peak selection, a process by which purely local interactions and smooth gradients can drive the self-organization of discrete global modules. The process combines strengths of the positional and Turing pattern-formation mechanisms into a model for morphogenesis. Applied to the grid-cell system of the brain, peak selection results in the self-organization of functionally distinct modules with discretely spaced spatial periods. Applied to ecological systems, it results in discrete multispecies niches and synchronous spawning across geographically distributed coral colonies. The process exhibits self-scaling with system size and ‘topological robustness’1, which renders module emergence and module properties insensitive to most parameters. Peak selection ameliorates the fine-tuning requirement for continuous attractor dynamics in single grid-cell modules and it makes a detail-independent prediction that grid module period ratios should approximate adjacent integer ratios, providing a highly accurate match to the available data. Predictions for grid cells at the transcriptional, connectomic and physiological levels promise to elucidate the interplay of molecules, connectivity and function emergence in brains. The principle of peak selection is described, by which local interactions and smooth gradients drive self-organization of discrete global modules.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage promotes mutations that fuel cancer, ageing and neurodegenerative diseases1–3, but surprisingly, the causes and types of damage remain largely unknown. There are three identified mechanisms that damage DNA during transcription: collision of RNA polymerase (RNAP) with the DNA-replication machinery head-on and co-directionally4–6, and R-loop-induced DNA breakage7–10. Here we identify novel DNA damage reaction intermediates11,12 and uncover a fourth transcription-related source of DNA damage: endogenous DNA damage at sites of terminated transcripts. We engineered proteins to capture single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends with 3′ polarity in bacterial and human cells. In Escherichia coli, spontaneous 3′-ssDNA-end foci were unexpectedly frequent, at one or more per cell division, and arose via two identifiable pathways, both of which were dependent on DNA replication. A pathway associated with double-strand breaks was suppressed by overexpression of replicative DNA polymerase (pol) III, suggesting competition between pol III and DNA damage-promoting proteins. Mapping of recurrent 3′-ssDNA-ends identified distinct 3′-ssDNA-end-hotspots, mostly unrelated to double-strand breaks, next to the 5′-CCTTTTTT transcription-terminator-like sequence. These 3′-ssDNA-termini coincide with RNA 3′-termini identified by DirectRNA sequencing13 or simultaneous 5′ and 3′ end RNA sequencing (SEnd-seq)14 and were prevented by a mutant RNAP that reads through terminators. Our findings reveal that transcription termination or pausing can promote DNA damage and subsequent genomic instability. Transcription termination or pausing during DNA replication in bacteria and humans results in DNA damage with exposed 3′ single-stranded DNA ends and mutations.",

    "abstract": "Investigating glacial isostatic adjustment has been the standard method to decipher Earth’s interior viscosity structure1,2, but such an approach has been rarely applied to other planets because of a lack of observational data3,4. The north polar cap of Mars is the only millions-of-years-old surface feature that can induce measurable surface deformation on this planet, thereby holding clues to its present-day internal viscosity structure5,6. Here we investigate the emplacement of this ice cap by combining thermal evolution models7, viscoelastic deformation calculations8 and radar observations6. We show that downward motion of the northern regions is ongoing and can be constrained by analyses of the time-variable gravity field9 and NASA’s InSight seismic moment rate10. Only models with present-day high viscosities (2–6 × 1022 Pa s for depths greater than 500 km), strong mantle depletion in radiogenic elements (more than 90%) and thick average crusts (thicker than 40 km) are consistent with the negligible flexure beneath the polar cap seen by radars. The northern lithosphere must deform at less than 0.13 mm per year and have a seismic efficiency less than 0.3 to satisfy gravity and seismic constraints, respectively. Our models show that the north polar cap formed over the last 1.7–12.0 Myr and that glacial isostatic adjustment can be further constrained by future gravity recovery missions to Mars11,12. Emplacement of the north polar cap of Mars is investigated by combining viscoelastic deformation calculations and observations, showing that it formed over the last 1.7–12.0 Myr atop a stiff lithosphere and high-viscosity mantle (1022 Pa s), and that glacial isostatic adjustment could be further constrained.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the principal energy currency of all living cells1,2. Metabolically impaired obligate intracellular parasites, such as the human pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis and Rickettsia prowazekii, can acquire ATP from their host cells through a unique ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) translocator, which mediates the import of ATP into and the export of ADP and phosphate out of the parasite cells, thus allowing the exploitation of the energy reserves of host cells (also known as energy parasitism). This type of ATP/ADP translocator also exists in the obligate intracellular endosymbionts of protists and the plastids of plants and algae and has been implicated to play an important role in endosymbiosis3–31. The plastid/parasite type of ATP/ADP translocator is phylogenetically and functionally distinct from the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator, and its structure and transport mechanism are still unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of two plastid/parasite types of ATP/ADP translocators in the apo and substrate-bound states. The ATP/ADP-binding pocket is located at the interface between the N and C domains of the translocator, and a conserved asparagine residue within the pocket is critical for substrate specificity. The translocator operates through a rocker-switch alternating access mechanism involving the relative rotation of the two domains as rigid bodies. Our results provide critical insights for understanding ATP translocation across membranes in energy parasitism and endosymbiosis and offer a structural basis for developing drugs against obligate intracellular parasites. ATP/ADP translocators in obligate intracellular parasites and plastids facilitate energy parasitism and endosymbiosis by mediating ATP import and ADP export, with their cryo-EM structures and mechanisms revealed, providing insights for drug development against intracellular pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wavefunctions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. By contrast, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG), magnetism—manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavours1–7—originates from itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here we show experimentally that the electronic entropy in this system indicates signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments, unexpected for electrons in a fully itinerant metal. Specifically, we find a contribution ΔS ≈ 1 kB per charge carrier that begins at the Curie temperature and survives more than one order of magnitude in temperature. First-order phase transitions show an isospin ‘Pomeranchuk effect’ in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favoured over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid8,9. Our results imply that, despite the itinerant nature of the electron wavefunctions, the spin and valley polarization of individual electrons is decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He (ref. 10). Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite-temperature resistance minimum in the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron–phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two-dimensional flat-band systems. Itinerant magnetism in rhombohedral multilayer graphene shows a large excess entropy from magnetic fluctuations above its critical temperature—typically only associated with local moments—which implies the decoupling of charge and isospin degrees of freedom, and results in the isospin Pomeranchuk effect.",

    "abstract": "Under high electrical current, some materials can emit electromagnetic radiation beyond incandescence. This phenomenon, referred to as electroluminescence, leads to the efficient emission of visible photons and is the basis of domestic lighting devices (for example, light-emitting diodes)1,2. In principle, electroluminescence can lead to mid-infrared emission of confined light–matter excitations called phonon polaritons3,4, resulting from the coupling of photons with crystal lattice vibrations (optical phonons). In particular, phonon polaritons arising in the van der Waals crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) present hyperbolic dispersion, which enhances light–matter coupling5,6. For this reason, electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) has been proposed as an explanation for the peculiar radiative energy transfer within hBN-encapsulated graphene transistors7,8. However, as HPhPs are locally confined, they are inaccessible in the far field, and as such, any hint of electroluminescence has been based on indirect electronic signatures and has yet to be confirmed by direct observation. Here we demonstrate far-field mid-infrared (wavelength approximately 6.5 μm) electroluminescence of HPhPs excited by strongly biased high-mobility graphene within a van der Waals heterostructure, and we quantify the associated radiative energy transfer through the material. The presence of HPhPs is revealed by far-field mid-infrared spectroscopy owing to their elastic scattering at discontinuities in the heterostructure. The resulting radiative flux is quantified by mid-infrared pyrometry of the substrate receiving the energy. This radiative energy transfer is also shown to be reduced in hBN with nanoscale inhomogeneities, demonstrating the central role of the electromagnetic environment in this process. Far-field mid-infrared spectroscopy reveals both the electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons of hexagonal boron nitride excited by strongly biased graphene, and the associated radiative energy transfer through the material.",

    "abstract": "Carbohydrates are an abundant, inexpensive and renewable biomass feedstock that could be a cornerstone for sustainable chemical manufacturing, but scalable and environmentally friendly methods that leverage these feedstocks are lacking. For example, 1-allyl sorbitol is the foundational building block for the polypropylene clarifying agent Millad NX 8000, which is produced on the multi-metric ton scale annually, but the manufacturing process at present requires superstoichiometric amounts of tin1,2. The NX 8000 additives dominate about 80% of the global clarified polypropylene market3 and are used in concentrations of 0.01–1% during polypropylene production to improve its transparency and resistance to high temperatures, translating to 300–30,000 metric tons annually. The market volume of polypropylene in 2022 was approximately 79.01 million metric tons (MMT), with demand expected to rise by nearly 33% to 105 MMT by 2030 (ref. 4). The cost and sustainability benefits of clarified polypropylene are driving this demand, necessitating more clarifying agents5. Here we report a high-yielding allylation of unprotected carbohydrates in water using a catalytic amount of indium metal and either allylboronic acid or the pinacol ester (allylBpin) as donors. Aldohexoses, aminohexoses, ketohexoses and aldopentoses are all allylated in high yield under mild conditions and the indium metal is recoverable and reusable with no loss of catalytic activity. Leveraging these features, this process was translated to a scalable continuous synthesis of 1-allyl sorbitol in flow6 with high yield and productivity through Bayesian optimization of reaction parameters. A longstanding challenge in organic synthesis—the catalytic allylation of unprotected saccharides in an aqueous medium, a key step for the synthesis of Millad NX 8000—is achieved through a simple and efficient indium-catalysed nucleophilic allylation using a three-carbon-unit allylboronic acid or its pinacol ester.",

Dysfunctional RNA–RBP interactions contribute to the pathogenesis of human disease1,4,5; however, characterizing the nature and dynamics of multiprotein assemblies on RNA has been challenging. Here, to address this, non-isotopic ligation-based ultraviolet-light-induced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation6 was combined with mass spectrometry (irCLIP-RNP) to identify RNA-dependent associated proteins (RDAPs) co-bound to RNA with any RBP of interest. irCLIP-RNP defined landscapes of multimeric protein assemblies on RNA, revealing patterns of RBP–RNA associations, including cell-type-selective combinatorial relationships between RDAPs and primary RBPs. irCLIP-RNP also defined dynamic RDAP remodelling in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), revealing that EGF-induced recruitment of UPF1 adjacent to HNRNPC promotes splicing surveillance of cell proliferation mRNAs. To identify the RNAs simultaneously co-bound by multiple studied RBPs, a sequential immunoprecipitation irCLIP (Re-CLIP) method was also developed. Re-CLIP confirmed binding relationships observed in irCLIP-RNP and identified HNRNPC and UPF1 RBP co-binding on RND3 and DDX3X mRNAs. irCLIP-RNP and Re-CLIP provide a framework to identify and characterize dynamic RNA–protein assemblies in living cells.

    "abstract": "Although Earth, together with other terrestrial planets, must have had an early-formed protocrust, the chemical composition of this crust has received little attention. The protocrust was extracted from an extensive magma ocean formed by accretion and melting of asteroidal bodies1. Both experimental and chronological data suggest that the silicate melt ascending from this magma ocean formed in equilibrium with, or after, metal was extracted to form Earth’s core. Here we show that a protocrust formed under these conditions would have had incompatible (with respect to silicate minerals) trace-element characteristics remarkably similar to those of the current average continental crust. This has major implications for subsequent planetary evolution. Many geochemical arguments for when and how plate tectonics began implicitly assume that subduction is required to produce the continental trace-element signature. These arguments are severely compromised if this signature was already a feature of the Hadean protocrust. A modelling study shows that the trace-element composition of Earth’s Hadean protocrust is similar to that of the current average continental crust, severely compromising geochemical arguments for when and how plate tectonics began.",

    "abstract": "Photons can carry angular momentum, which is conventionally attributed to two constituents—spin angular momentum (SAM), which is an intrinsic property related to the polarization, and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is related to the photon spatial distribution. In paraxial optics, these two forms of angular momentum are separable1, such that entanglement can be induced between the SAM and the OAM of a single photon2,3 or of different photons in a multi-photon state4. In nanophotonic systems, however, the SAM and the OAM of a photon are inseparable5,6, so only the total angular momentum (TAM) serves as a good quantum number7–9. Here we present the observation of non-classical correlations between two photons in the near-field regime, giving rise to entanglement related to the TAM. We entangle those nanophotonic states by coupling photon pairs to plasmonic modes and use quantum imaging techniques10,11 to measure their correlations. We observe that entanglement in TAM leads to a completely different structure of quantum correlations of photon pairs, compared with entanglement related to the two constituent angular momenta. This work paves the way for on-chip quantum information processing using the TAM of photons as the encoding property for quantum information. Non-classical correlations between two photons in the near-field regime give rise to entanglement in their total angular momentum, leading to a completely different structure of quantum correlations of photon pairs.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are the densest stellar systems in the Universe. These clusters can be found at the centre of all galaxy types but tend to favour galaxies of intermediate stellar mass around 109M⊙ (refs. 1,2). At present, two main processes are under debate to explain their formation: in situ star formation from gas infall3 and migration and merging of globular clusters (GCs) caused by dynamical friction4. Studies5–9 of NSC stellar populations suggest that the former predominates in massive galaxies, whereas the latter prevails in dwarf galaxies, and both contribute equally at intermediate mass. However, until now, no ongoing merger of GCs has been observed to confirm this scenario. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of five dwarf galaxies with complex nuclear regions, characterized by multiple nuclei and tidal tails, using high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope. These structures have been reproduced in complementary N-body simulations, supporting the interpretation that they result from migrating and merging of star clusters. The small detection rate and short simulated timescales (below 100 Myr) of this process may explain why this has not been observed previously. This study highlights the need for large surveys with high resolution to fully map the migration scenario steps. High-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope show evidence of star cluster migration and merger in dwarf galaxies.",

    "abstract": "At subduction zones, lithospheric material descends through the upper mantle to the mantle transition zone (MTZ), where it may continue to sink into the lower mantle or stagnate1,2. Several factors may be important in influencing this flow, including chemical heterogeneity3–5. However, tight constraints on these mantle flows and the exact factors that affect them have proved challenging. We use P-to-S receiver functions to image the subducting slab and the MTZ beneath the Lesser Antilles subduction zone. We image a singular, superdeep (>700 km) 660-km discontinuity over a 200-km-wide zone within the slab, accompanied by nearby double 660 discontinuity phases (normal and superdeep). Combined geodynamic and waveform modelling shows that this observation cannot be explained by temperature effects in typical mantle compositions but requires a large basalt-rich chemical anomaly, strongest in the location of the singular, deep 660. The inferred basalt signature is near the proposed location of a subducted extinct spreading ridge6,7, where basalt is probably present in greater proportions. Our finding suggests that past tectonic events impart chemical heterogeneity into slabs, and the heterogeneities, in turn, may affect the inherent tendency of the slab to sink. Imaging of the mantle transition zone beneath the Lesser Antilles shows a basalt-rich region within the subducting slab near the proposed location of a subducted extinct spreading ridge, implying ancient tectonics play a role in influencing slab trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Despite the continuing progress in integrated optical frequency comb technology1, compact sources of short, bright pulses in the mid-infrared wavelength range from 3 to 12 μm so far remain beyond reach. The state-of-the-art ultrafast pulse emitters in the mid-infrared are complex, bulky and inefficient systems based on the downconversion of near-infrared or visible pulsed laser sources. Here we show a purely DC-driven semiconductor laser chip that generates 1-ps solitons at the centre wavelength of 8.3 μm at GHz repetition rates. The soliton generation scheme is akin to that of passive nonlinear Kerr resonators2. It relies on a fast bistability in active nonlinear laser resonators, unlike traditional passive mode-locking, which relies on saturable absorbers3, or active mode-locking by gain modulation in semiconductor lasers4. Monolithic integration of all components—drive laser, active ring resonator, coupler and pump filter—enables turnkey generation of bright solitons that remain robust for hours of continuous operation without active stabilization. Such devices can be readily produced at industrial laser foundries using standard fabrication protocols. Our work unifies the physics of active and passive microresonator frequency combs while simultaneously establishing a technology for nonlinear integrated photonics in the mid-infrared5. New fully integrated semiconductor laser architectures are shown to be able to generate bright and background-free picosecond solitons at GHz repetition rates in the mid-infrared range.",

    "abstract": "Poxviruses cause severe diseases, including smallpox and mpox, that pose major threats to human health. The poxvirus core protease (CorePro) is essential for viral maturation and is highly conserved in poxviruses, making it an attractive antiviral target1. However, the structure of CorePro remains unknown, hampering antiviral development. Here we determined the apo structure of monkeypox virus (MPXV) CorePro and the structure of CorePro in a complex with the inhibitor aloxistatin, a drug candidate for muscular dystrophy2. These structures show that CorePro forms a homodimer that features a unique ‘dancing couple’ fold. The catalytic intermediate state of CorePro was characterized by an aldehyde derivative from a natural substrate (I-G18). This derivative binds covalently to the catalytic Cys328, shifting the active site of the viral protease from a closed conformation in the apo form to a favourable open conformation upon substrate binding. On the basis of the CorePro–I-G18 complex, we designed a series of peptidomimetic inhibitors with a nitrile warhead, which could covalently anchor with the catalytic Cys328. These compounds inhibit CorePro with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 44.9–100.3 nM, and exhibit potent and broad anti-poxvirus activity. Our studies provide a basis for designing wide-spectrum inhibitors against poxvirus infections. Structural and biochemical studies of the monkeypox virus core protease show that it exists as an active homodimer and indicate that the substrate-binding sites of core proteases are a promising target for antiviral drugs.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in ultrathin, single-crystalline, freestanding complex oxide systems have sparked industry interest in their potential for next-generation commercial devices1,2. However, the mass production of these ultrathin complex oxide membranes has been hindered by the challenging requirement of inserting an artificial release layer between the epilayers and substrates3,4. Here we introduce a technique that achieves atomic precision lift-off of ultrathin membranes without artificial release layers to facilitate the high-throughput production of scalable, ultrathin, freestanding perovskite systems. Leveraging both theoretical insights and empirical evidence, we have identified the pivotal role of lead in weakening the interface. This insight has led to the creation of a universal exfoliation strategy that enables the production of diverse ultrathin perovskite membranes less than 10 nm. Our pyroelectric membranes demonstrate a record-high pyroelectric coefficient of 1.76 × 10−2 C m−2 K−1, attributed to their exceptionally low thickness and freestanding nature. Moreover, this method offers an approach to manufacturing cooling-free detectors that can cover the full far-infrared spectrum, marking a notable advancement in detector technology5. Atomic precision lift-off of ultrathin membranes without artificial release layers can be achieved to facilitate the high-throughput production of scalable, ultrathin, single-crystalline, freestanding perovskite systems.",

    "abstract": "Beneath oceanic spreading centres, the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (LAB) acts as a permeability barrier that focuses the delivery of melt from deep within the mantle towards the spreading axis1. At intermediate-spreading to fast-spreading ridge crests, the multichannel seismic reflection technique has imaged a nearly flat, 1–2-km-wide axial magma lens (AML)2 that defines the uppermost section of the LAB3, but the nature of the LAB deeper into the crust has been more elusive, with some clues gained from tomographic images, providing only a diffuse view of a wider halo of lower-velocity material seated just beneath the AML4. Here we present 3D seismic reflection images of the LAB extending deep (5–6 km) into the crust beneath Axial volcano, located at the intersection of the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Cobb–Eickelberg hotspot. The 3D shape of the LAB, which is coincident with a thermally controlled magma assimilation front, focuses hotspot-related and mid-ocean-spreading-centre-related magmatism towards the centre of the volcano, controlling both eruption and hydrothermal processes and the chemical composition of erupted lavas5. In this context, the LAB can be viewed as the upper surface of a ‘magma domain’, a volume within which melt bodies reside (replacing the concept of a single ‘magma reservoir’)6. Our discovery of a funnel-shaped, crustal LAB suggests that thermally controlled magma assimilation could be occurring along this surface at other volcanic systems, such as Iceland. 3D seismic reflection images of the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary beneath Axial volcano show a magma assimilation front that focuses magmatism towards the centre of the volcano, controlling both eruption and hydrothermal processes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in quantum communications have underscored the crucial role of optical coherence in developing quantum networks. This resource, which is fundamental to the phase-based architecture of the quantum internet1, has enabled the only successful demonstrations of multi-node quantum networks2–4 and substantially extended the range of quantum key distribution (QKD)5. However, the scalability of coherence-based quantum protocols remains uncertain owing to the specialized hardware required, such as ultra-stable optical cavities and cryogenic photon detectors. Here we implement the coherence-based twin-field QKD protocol over a 254-kilometre commercial telecom network spanning between Frankfurt and Kehl, Germany, achieving encryption key distribution at 110 bits per second. Our results are enabled by a scalable approach to optical coherence distribution, supported by a practical system architecture and non-cryogenic single-photon detection aided by off-band phase stabilization. Our results demonstrate repeater-like quantum communication in an operational network setting, doubling the distance for practical real-world QKD implementations without cryogenic cooling. In addition, to our knowledge, we realized one of the largest QKD networks featuring measurement-device-independent properties6. Our research aligns the requirements of coherence-based quantum communication with the capabilities of existing telecommunication infrastructure, which is likely to be useful to the future of high-performance quantum networks, including the implementation of advanced quantum communication protocols, quantum repeaters, quantum sensing networks and distributed quantum computing7. A twin-field quantum key distribution protocol based on optical coherence is deployed over a 254-kilometre commercial telecom network, demonstrating that coherence-based quantum communication can be aligned with existing telecommunication infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Glacial cycles significantly influenced Earth’s surface processes throughout the Quaternary, impacting the climate, sea level, and seismic and magmatic activity1–3. However, the effects of glaciation and deglaciation (that is, glacial forcing) on lithospheric motion are unknown. To study these effects, we formulated high-resolution numerical models with realistic lithospheric structures, including weak plate margins, lithospheric thickness variations and crustal structure. Our results show that glacial forcing significantly altered lithospheric motion and the spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges situated near major ice sheets in the last glacial cycle. For example, deglaciation-induced motion in the North American plate had a rotational part that was up to around 25% of its tectonic plate motion over 10,000-year timescales. The deglaciation in Greenland and Fennoscandia caused up to 40% fluctuations in the spreading rates of the Iceland Ridge between 12,000 and 6,000 years ago, which may explain the Holocene volcanism in Iceland. Our modelling also indicates increased (decreased) rates of global sea-floor production during the deglaciation (glaciation) periods with implications for mantle degassing rates. These results underscore the critical dynamic interplay between glacial cycles, lithospheric motion, ridge spreading and climate during ice ages. Realistic-lithosphere numerical models suggest glacial forcing in the last glacial cycle notably affected plate motions and mid-ocean-ridge spreading rates near major ice sheets, with implications for modern polar deglaciation enhancing magmatism and markedly impacting climate.",

    "abstract": "Somatosensory neurons encode detailed information about touch and temperature and are the peripheral drivers of pain1,2. Here by combining functional imaging with multiplexed in situ hybridization3, we determined how heat and mechanical stimuli are encoded across neuronal classes and how inflammation transforms this representation to induce heat hypersensitivity, mechanical allodynia and continuing pain. Our data revealed that trigeminal neurons innervating the cheek exhibited complete segregation of responses to gentle touch and heat. By contrast, heat and noxious mechanical stimuli broadly activated nociceptor classes, including cell types proposed to trigger select percepts and behaviours4–6. Injection of the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 caused long-lasting activity and thermal sensitization in select classes of nociceptors, providing a cellular basis for continuing inflammatory pain and heat hypersensitivity. We showed that the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 (ref. 7) has a central role in heat sensitization but not in spontaneous nociceptor activity. Unexpectedly, the responses to mechanical stimuli were minimally affected by inflammation, suggesting that tactile allodynia results from the continuing firing of nociceptors coincident with touch. Indeed, we have demonstrated that nociceptor activity is both necessary and sufficient for inflammatory tactile allodynia. Together, these findings refine models of sensory coding and discrimination at the cellular and molecular levels, demonstrate that touch and temperature are broadly but differentially encoded across transcriptomically distinct populations of sensory cells and provide insight into how cellular-level responses are reshaped by inflammation to trigger diverse aspects of pain. Functional imaging and multiplexed in situ hybridization were combined to investigate how trigeminal neurons encode heat and mechanical stimuli, revealing distinct cellular mechanisms for continuing pain, heat hypersensitivity and tactile allodynia during inflammation.",

Although disordered regions are integral to controlling mRNA stability and translation, the mechanisms underlying these regulatory effects remain unclear3.

Systematic mutagenesis across hundreds of regulatory disordered elements, combined with machine learning, reveals a complex pattern of molecular features important for their activity. The presence and arrangement of aromatic residues strongly predicts the ability of seemingly diverse protein sequences to influence mRNA stability and translation. We further show how many of these regulatory elements exert their effects by engaging core mRNA decay machinery. Our results define molecular features and biochemical pathways that explain how disordered regions control mRNA expression and shed light on broader principles within functional, unstructured proteins. Using high-throughput functional profiling, how disordered regions control mRNA stability and translation is explored.",

    "abstract": "Volcanic hotspots are thought to form by melting in an upwelling mantle plume head followed by melting of the plume tail. Plate motion then generates an age-progressive volcanic track originating from a large igneous province to a currently active hotspot. The most voluminous large igneous province, the approximately 120-million-year-old Ontong Java Nui Plateau (OJP-Nui) in the mid-Pacific, however, lacks an obvious volcanic track. Although the Louisville hotspot track was originally proposed as a candidate, limited constraints for Pacific absolute plate and plume motion before 80 million years ago (Ma) suggest a mismatch1. Existing Pacific models rely on age–distance data from the continuous Hawai‘i–Emperor and Louisville tracks, but their tracks older than approximately 80 Ma are subducted. Elsewhere on the Pacific Plate, only discontinuous seamount tracks that formed before 80 Ma are documented2–7. Currently, models require approximately 1,200 kilometres of latitudinal motion to link the Louisville plume to the OJP-Nui1, but palaeolatitude estimates from about 70 Ma to today remain within error of its present location8,9, suggesting that any substantial Louisville plume motion occurred earlier. Here, through a combination of geochemistry and geochronology9–14, we demonstrate that Samoa and Rurutu–Arago are the longest-lived Pacific hotspots, traceable to more than 100 Ma before subducting into the Mariana Trench. These tracks better constrain plate rotation between 80 Ma and 100 Ma, allowing us to update Pacific absolute plate motion models and link the Louisville volcanic track to OJP-Nui without requiring major plume motion. Geochemistry and geochronology show that Samoa and Rurutu–Arago are the longest-lived Pacific hotspots, providing better constraints on plate rotation and support for a link between the Louisville volcanic track and the Ontong Java Nui Plateau.",

    "abstract": "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average1 and plant communities are responding through shifts in species abundance, composition and distribution2–4. However, the direction and magnitude of local changes in plant diversity in the Arctic have not been quantified. Using a compilation of 42,234 records of 490 vascular plant species from 2,174 plots across the Arctic, here we quantified temporal changes in species richness and composition through repeat surveys between 1981 and 2022. We also identified the geographical, climatic and biotic drivers behind these changes. We found greater species richness at lower latitudes and warmer sites, but no indication that, on average, species richness had changed directionally over time. However, species turnover was widespread, with 59% of plots gaining and/or losing species. Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness. Despite changes in plant composition, Arctic plant communities did not become more similar to each other, suggesting no biotic homogenization so far. Overall, Arctic plant communities changed in richness and composition in different directions, with temperature and plant–plant interactions emerging as the main drivers of change. Our findings demonstrate how climate and biotic drivers can act in concert to alter plant composition, which could precede future biodiversity changes that are likely to affect ecosystem function, wildlife habitats and the livelihoods of Arctic peoples5,6. Warming temperatures and interactions between plants are the main drivers of changes in Arctic plant communities in response to climate change, and there is no evidence of overall biotic homogenization.",

We discuss constructing a life cycle assessment for a complex cloud ecosystem (including software, chips, servers and data centre buildings), analysing how different advanced cooling technologies interact with this ecosystem and evaluating each technology from a sustainability perspective to provide adoption guidelines. Life cycle assessment quantifies the benefits of advanced cooling methods, such as cold plates and immersion cooling, in reducing greenhouse gas emissions (15–21%), energy demand (15–20%) and blue water consumption (31–52%) in data centres. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the transformative potential of life cycle assessment in driving sustainable innovation across resource-intensive technologies. A life cycle assessment study is used to examine the impacts of advanced cooling technologies on cloud infrastructure, from virtual machines to server architecture, data centre buildings and the grid.",

    "abstract": "Animals learn to carry out motor actions in specific sensory contexts to achieve goals. The striatum has been implicated in producing sensory–motor associations1, yet its contributions to memory formation and recall are not clear. Here, to investigate the contribution of the striatum to these processes, mice were taught to associate a cue, consisting of optogenetic activation of striatum-projecting neurons in visual cortex, with the availability of a food pellet that could be retrieved by forelimb reaching. As necessary to direct learning, striatal neural activity encoded both the sensory context and the outcome of reaching. With training, the rate of cued reaching increased, but brief optogenetic inhibition of striatal activity arrested learning and prevented trial-to-trial improvements in performance. However, the same manipulation did not affect performance improvements already consolidated into short-term (less than 1 h) or long-term (days) memories. Hence, striatal activity is necessary for trial-to-trial improvements in performance, leading to plasticity in other brain areas that mediate memory recall. Activity in the striatum is necessary for trial-to-trial improvements in learning sensory–motor tasks but not memory recall.",

    "abstract": "Methane is an important greenhouse gas1 and its atmospheric concentration has almost tripled since pre-industrial times2–4. Atmospheric methane mixing ratios vary seasonally, with the seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) having decreased in northern high latitudes and increased in the subtropics and tropics since the 1980s5,6. These opposing SCA trends can help understanding of long-term changes in the global methane budget, as methane emissions and sinks have opposing effects on the SCA5. However, trends in the methane SCA have not yet been explored in detail5,6. Here we use a suite of atmospheric transport model simulations and attribute the observed trends in the seasonal amplitude of methane to changes in emissions and the atmospheric sink from reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). We find that the decreasing amplitude in the northern high latitudes is mainly caused by an increase in natural emissions (such as wetlands) owing to a warmer climate, adding evidence to previous studies suggesting a positive climate feedback7–9. In contrast, the enhanced methane amplitude in the subtropics and tropics is mainly attributed to strengthened OH oxidation. Our results provide independent evidence for an increase in tropospheric OH concentration10,11 of 10 ± 1% since 1984, which together with an increasing atmospheric methane concentration suggests a 21 ± 1% increase in the atmospheric methane sink. Model simulations show that the observed trends in the seasonal amplitude of methane can be attributed to changes in emissions and the atmospheric sink from reaction with the hydroxyl radical.",

    "abstract": "Precision measurements using low-energy antiprotons, exclusively available at the antimatter factory (AMF) of CERN1, offer stringent tests of charge–parity–time (CPT) invariance, which is a fundamental symmetry in the Standard Model of particle physics2. These tests have been realized, for example, in antiprotonic helium3 and antihydrogen4. In our cryogenic Penning-trap experiments5, we measure the magnetic moments6,7 and charge-to-mass ratios of protons and antiprotons and now provide the most precise test of CPT invariance in the baryon sector8. Our experiments are limited by magnetic field fluctuations imposed by the decelerators in the AMF; therefore, we are advancing the relocation of antiprotons to dedicated precision laboratories. Here we present the successful transport of a trapped proton cloud from the AMF using BASE-STEP9—a transportable, superconducting, autonomous and open Penning-trap system that can distribute antiprotons into other experiments. We transferred the trapped protons from our experimental area at the AMF onto a truck and transported them across the Meyrin site of CERN, demonstrating autonomous operation without external power for 4 h and loss-free proton relocation. We thereby confirm the feasibility of transferring particles into low-noise laboratories in the vicinity of the AMF and of using a power generator on the truck10 to reach laboratories throughout Europe. This marks the potential start of a new era in precision antimatter research, enabling low-noise measurements of antiprotons, the charged antimatter ions \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${\\bar{{\\rm{H}}}}^{+}$$\n                \n              11 and \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${\\bar{{\\rm{H}}}}_{2}^{-}$$\n                \n               (ref. 12), and other accelerator-produced ions, such as hydrogen-like lead or uranium ions13,14.

    "abstract": "Chromosomal rearrangements and gene fusions are the initial events in the development of many cancers. Astroblastoma (ABM), a brain cancer of unknown cellular origin and challenging to treat, is associated with diverse in-frame gene fusions, including MN1-BEND2 and MN1-CXXC5 (refs. 1,2). However, it remains unclear whether these gene fusions contribute to tumorigenesis. Here we show in mice that these two ABM-associated fusions converge on similar molecular activities and initiate malignancy specifically in ventral telencephalon neural progenitors. BEND2 and CXXC5 recognize similar DNA motifs, which indicates a convergence on downstream gene regulation. Expression of MN1-BEND2 in ventral telencephalon neural progenitors results in aberrant cell proliferation, impaired differentiation, a perivascular occupancy pattern of cells reminiscent of ABM and acquisition of an ABM-associated transcriptional signature. By contrast, MN1-BEND2 expression in dorsal telencephalon neural progenitors leads to extensive cell death. This cell-type-specific malignancy depends on OLIG2 expression. Mechanistically, both ABM-associated fusion proteins (MN1–BEND2 and MN1–CXXC5) induce overlapping transcriptional responses, including the activation of a therapeutically targetable PDGFRα pathway. Collectively, our data suggest that distinct ABM-associated fusions upregulate shared transcriptional networks to disrupt the normal development of ventral telencephalon neural progenitors, which leads to oncogenic transformation. These findings uncover new avenues for targeted ABM treatment. The molecular mechanisms of astroblastoma development are identified, whereby distinct gene fusions upregulate shared transcriptional networks to disrupt the normal development of ventral telencephalon neural progenitors, which leads to oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "A key function of brain systems mediating emotion is to learn to anticipate unpleasant experiences. Although organisms readily associate sensory stimuli with aversive outcomes, higher-order forms of emotional learning and memory require inference to extrapolate the circumstances surrounding directly experienced aversive events to other indirectly related sensory patterns that were not part of the original experience. This type of learning requires internal models of emotion, which flexibly track directly experienced and inferred aversive associations. Although the brain mechanisms of simple forms of aversive learning have been well studied in areas such as the amygdala1–4, whether and how the brain forms and represents internal models of emotionally relevant associations are not known5. Here we report that neurons in the rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) encode a flexible internal model of emotion by linking sensory stimuli in the environment with aversive events, whether they were directly or indirectly associated with that experience. These representations form through a multi-step encoding mechanism involving recruitment and stabilization of dmPFC cells that support inference. Although dmPFC population activity encodes all salient associations, dmPFC neurons projecting to the amygdala specifically represent and are required to express inferred associations. Together, these findings reveal how internal models of emotion are encoded in the dmPFC to regulate subcortical systems for recall of inferred emotional memories. Neurons in the rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encode a flexible internal model of emotion by linking directly experienced and inferred associations with aversive experiences.",

    "abstract": "Based on seminal work in placental species (eutherians)1–10, a paradigm of mammalian development has emerged wherein the genome-wide erasure of parental DNA methylation is required for embryogenesis. Whether such DNA methylation reprogramming is, in fact, conserved in other mammals is unknown. Here, to resolve this point, we generated base-resolution DNA methylation maps in gametes, embryos and adult tissues of a marsupial, the opossum Monodelphis domestica, revealing variations from the eutherian-derived model. The difference in DNA methylation level between oocytes and sperm is less pronounced than that in eutherians. Furthermore, unlike the genome of eutherians, that of the opossum remains hypermethylated during the cleavage stages. In the blastocyst, DNA demethylation is transient and modest in the epiblast. However, it is sustained in the trophectoderm, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function for DNA hypomethylation in the mammalian placenta. Furthermore, unlike that in eutherians, the inactive X chromosome becomes globally DNA hypomethylated during embryogenesis. We identify gamete differentially methylated regions that exhibit distinct fates in the embryo, with some transient, and others retained and that represent candidate imprinted loci. We also reveal a possible mechanism for imprinted X inactivation, through maternal DNA methylation of the Xist-like noncoding RNA RSX11. We conclude that the evolutionarily divergent eutherians and marsupials use DNA demethylation differently during embryogenesis. A study reports on the DNA methylation dynamics during embryogenesis in marsupials, showing that these differ from those occurring during embryogenesis in eutherian mammals.",

    "abstract": "Imposing incommensurable periodicity on the periodic atomic lattice can lead to complex structural phases consisting of locally periodic structure bounded by topological defects1–8. Twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) is an ideal material platform to study the interplay between different atomic periodicities, which can be tuned by twist angles between the layers, leading to moiré-of-moiré lattices9–26. Interlayer and intralayer interactions between two interfaces in TTG transform this moiré-of-moiré lattice into an intricate network of domain structures at small twist angles, which can harbour exotic electronic behaviours9–26. Here we report a complete structural phase diagram of TTG with atomic-scale lattice reconstruction. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with a new interatomic potential simulation27,28, we show several large-scale moiré lattices, including triangular, kagome and a corner-shared hexagram-shaped domain pattern. Each domain is bounded by a 2D network of domain-wall lattices. In the limit of small twist angles, two competing structural orders—rhombohedral and Bernal stackings—with a slight energy difference cause unconventional lattice reconstruction with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and nematic instability, highlighting the importance of long-range interlayer interactions across entire van der Waals layers. The diverse tessellation of distinct domains, whose topological network can be tuned by the adjustment of the twist angles, establishes TTG as a platform for exploring the interplay between emerging quantum properties and controllable nontrivial lattices. Examination of a complete structural phase diagram of twisted trilayer graphene shows that several large-scale moiré domain lattices can be formed, the physical properties of which can be tuned by the twist angles between layers.",

    "abstract": "Quasars, powered by gas accretion onto supermassive black holes1,2, rank among the most energetic objects in the Universe3,4. Although they are thought to be ignited by galaxy mergers5–11 and affect the surrounding gas12–15, observational constraints on both processes remain scarce16–18. Here we describe a major merging system at redshift z ≈ 2.7 and demonstrate that radiation from the quasar in one galaxy directly alters the gas properties in the other galaxy. Our findings reveal that the galaxies, with centroids separated by only a few kiloparsecs and approaching each other at a speed of approximately 550 km s−1, are massive, are forming stars and contain a substantial molecular mass. Yet, dusty molecular gas seen in absorption against the quasar nucleus is highly excited and confined within cloudlets with densities of approximately 105 to 106 cm−3 and sizes of less than 0.02 pc, several orders of magnitude more compact than those observed in intervening (non-quasar) environments. This is also approximately 105 times smaller than currently resolvable through molecular-line emission at high redshifts. We infer that, wherever it is exposed to the quasar radiation, the molecular gas is disrupted, leaving behind surviving dense clouds too small to give birth to new stars. Our results not only underscore the role of major galaxy mergers in triggering quasar activity but also reveal localized negative feedback as a profound alteration of the internal gas structure, which probably hampers star formation. We demonstrate that in a major merging system, radiation from the quasar in one galaxy directly alters the gas properties in the companion galaxy.",

Previous studies identified conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) as initiators of dietary pTreg cells3. However, here we report that food-specific pTreg cells are induced exclusively by the recently identified RORγt antigen-presenting cells4–8 and not by conventional dendritic cells. Instead, our data suggest that pTreg cell–cDC1 interactions during homeostasis limit the expansion of food-specific CD8αβ T cells. This regulation is disrupted by infection or food poisoning, enabling dietary CD8αβ T cells to expand and acquire effector functions in response to mimicked food antigens. Unlike in typical infections, after the pathogen is cleared, dietary CD8αβ T cells do not expand in response to their corresponding dietary antigens. Thus, we propose that, in response to dietary antigens, tolerance is mediated by a circuit of dedicated antigen-presenting cells and T cells. When the host is challenged by infection, this circuit permits the transient expansion of protective effector responses without compromising the overall strategy of tolerance that ensures safe food consumption. Immune tolerance to dietary antigens is mediated by a circuit of dedicated antigen-presenting cells and T cells, ensuring protective effector responses without compromising the overall strategy of tolerance that ensures safe food consumption.",

These events are coordinated by numerous transiently associated regulatory complexes and integral membrane components that contribute to organelle identity during endosome maturation3. Although a subset of the several hundred protein components and cargoes known to associate with endosomes have been studied at the biochemical and/or structural level, interaction partners and higher-order molecular assemblies for many endosomal components remain unknown. Here, we combine crosslinking and native gel mass spectrometry4–7 of purified early endosomes with AlphaFold8,9 and computational analysis to create a systematic human endosomal structural interactome. We present 229 structural models for endosomal protein pairs and additional higher-order assemblies supported by experimental crosslinks from their native subcellular context, suggesting structural mechanisms for previously reported regulatory processes. Using induced neurons, we validate two candidate complexes whose interactions are supported by crosslinks and structural predictions: TMEM230 as a subunit of ATP8 and ATP11 lipid flippases10 and TMEM9 and TMEM9B as subunits of the chloride–proton antiporters CLCN3, CLCN4 and CLCN5 (ref. 11). This resource and its accompanying structural network viewer provide an experimental framework for understanding organellar structural interactomes and large-scale validation of structural predictions. A study presents EndoMAP.v1, a resource that combines information on protein interactions and crosslink-supported structural predictions to map the interaction landscape of early endosomes.",

Here we present a cannabis pangenome, constructed with 181 new and 12 previously released genomes from a total of 144 biological samples including both male (XY) and female (XX) plants. We identified widespread regions of the cannabis pangenome that are surprisingly diverse for a single species, with high levels of genetic and structural variation, and propose a novel population structure and hybridization history. Across the ancient heteromorphic X and Y sex chromosomes, we observed a variable boundary at the sex-determining and pseudoautosomal regions as well as genes that exhibit male-biased expression, including genes encoding several key flowering regulators. Conversely, the cannabinoid synthase genes, which are responsible for producing cannabidiol acid and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, contained very low levels of diversity, despite being embedded within a variable region with multiple pseudogenized paralogues, structural variation and distinct transposable element arrangements. Additionally, we identified variants of acyl-lipid thioesterase genes that were associated with fatty acid chain length variation and the production of the rare cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabidivarin. We conclude that the C. sativa gene pool remains only partially characterized, the existence of wild relatives in Asia is likely and its potential as a crop species remains largely unrealized. A pangenome of the Cannabis genus including 193 genomes demonstrates high variability in most of the genome but low diversity in cannabinoid synthesis genes and provides a resource for future genetic studies and crop optimization.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia are fundamental to motor control and their dysfunction is linked to motor deficits1–8. Influential investigations on the primate oculomotor system posited that movement generally depends on transient pauses of tonically firing inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons releasing brainstem motor centres9,10. However, prominent increases in basal ganglia output neuron firing observed during other motor tasks cast doubts on the proposed mechanisms of movement regulation through basal ganglia circuitry11–22. Here we show that basal ganglia output neurons in the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) represent complex forelimb movements with highly granular and dynamic changes in spiking activity, tiling task execution at the population level. Single SNr neurons exhibit movement-specific firing pauses as well as increases, each occurring in concert with precise and different forelimb movements. Combining optogenetics and simultaneous recordings from basal ganglia output and postsynaptic brainstem neurons, we reveal the functional role of these dynamic firing-rate changes in releasing and suppressing movement through downstream targets. Together, our results demonstrate the existence and function of highly specific and temporally precise movement representations in basal ganglia output circuitry. We propose a model in which basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically to provide granular and bidirectional movement-specific signals for release and suppression of motor programs to downstream circuits. Basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically in bidirectional and movement-specific patterns to license forelimb movements.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapy offers a promising approach against cancer1–3. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CAR-NK cell activity remain unclear. Here we identify the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) as a crucial regulator of NK cell function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant induction of CREM in CAR-NK cells during the peak of effector function after adoptive transfer in a tumour mouse model, and this peak coincided with signatures of both activation and dysfunction. We demonstrate that both CAR activation and interleukin-15 signalling rapidly induce CREM upregulation in NK cells. Functionally, CREM deletion enhances CAR-NK cell effector function both in vitro and in vivo and increases resistance to tumour-induced immunosuppression after rechallenge. Mechanistically, we establish that induction of CREM is mediated by the PKA–CREB signalling pathway, which can be activated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signalling downstream of CAR activation or by interleukin-15. Finally, our findings reveal that CREM exerts its regulatory functions through epigenetic reprogramming of CAR-NK cells. Our results provide support for CREM as a therapeutic target to enhance the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells. The transcription factor CREM is a pivotal regulator of NK cell function, making CREM a valuable target to increase the efficacy of anticancer immunotherapies based on this cell population and chimeric antigen receptors.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodellers are pivotal in the regulation of nucleosome dynamics in cells, and they are important for chromatin packaging, transcription, replication and DNA repair1. Here we show that the human chromatin remodeller SMARCAD1 exhibits a substrate preference for subnucleosomal particles over the canonical nucleosome. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of SMARCAD1 bound to the nucleosome and hexasome provide mechanistic insights into the substrate selectivity. SMARCAD1 binds to the hexasome through multiple family-specific elements that are essential for the functions in vitro and in cells. The enzyme binds to the canonical nucleosome in an inactive conformation, which accounts for its diminished activity towards the nucleosome. Notably, the histone chaperone FACT complex acts synergistically with H2A–H2B to promote the activity of SMARCAD1 in nucleosome remodelling. Together, our findings reveal an avenue for chromatin regulation, whereby subnucleosomes are remodelled through an ATP-dependent process. Human chromatin remodeller SMARCAD1 exhibits a substrate preference for subnucleosomal particles over the canonical nucleosome.",

    "abstract": "To thrive in complex environments, animals and artificial agents must learn to act adaptively to maximize fitness and rewards. Such adaptive behaviour can be learned through reinforcement learning1, a class of algorithms that has been successful at training artificial agents2–5 and at characterizing the firing of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain6–8. In classical reinforcement learning, agents discount future rewards exponentially according to a single timescale, known as the discount factor. Here we explore the presence of multiple timescales in biological reinforcement learning. We first show that reinforcement agents learning at a multitude of timescales possess distinct computational benefits. Next, we report that dopaminergic neurons in mice performing two behavioural tasks encode reward prediction error with a diversity of discount time constants. Our model explains the heterogeneity of temporal discounting in both cue-evoked transient responses and slower timescale fluctuations known as dopamine ramps. Crucially, the measured discount factor of individual neurons is correlated across the two tasks, suggesting that it is a cell-specific property. Together, our results provide a new paradigm for understanding functional heterogeneity in dopaminergic neurons and a mechanistic basis for the empirical observation that humans and animals use non-exponential discounts in many situations9–12, and open new avenues for the design of more-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms. Individual dopaminergic neurons encode future rewards over distinct temporal horizons.",

    "abstract": "Studies of ancient DNA from cemeteries provide valuable insights into early human societies, and have strongly indicated patrilocality1–10. Here, we analysed ancient DNA alongside archaeological contexts and multiple stable isotopic data from 60 individuals in 2 separate cemeteries at the Fujia archaeological site in eastern China, dating between 2750 and 2500 bce. Our findings suggest the existence of an early-described matrilineal community in the Neolithic period, characterized by high endogamy and a population practicing millet agriculture near the coast. Evidence of intermarriage between individuals in the two cemeteries and the presence of both primary and secondary burials, organized strictly according to maternal clans, underscore a strong sense of social cohesion and identity at Fujia. Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates indicates that the two cemeteries were used for approximately 250 years, implying a stable matrilineal lineage spanning at least 10 generations. This study contributes to the ongoing debate in anthropology and archaeology11, not only suggesting the existence of a matrilineal society in early human history but also revealing a pair of Neolithic cemeteries organized around two matrilineal clans, furthering our understanding of the early evolution of human societies through kinship systems. Analysis of ancient DNA, stable isotope data and archaeological evidence from the Fujia archaeological site in eastern China suggests it was populated by a matrilineal Neolithic community between 2750 and 2500 bc.",

Direct detections have also been made for brown dwarfs8,9, but direct studies of young giant planets in the mid-infrared were not possible before James Webb Space Telescope10. With two exoplanets around a solar-type star, the YSES-1 system is an ideal laboratory for studying this early phase of exoplanet evolution. Here we report the direct observations of silicate clouds in the atmosphere of the exoplanet YSES-1 c through its 9–11 µm absorption feature, and the first circumplanetary disk silicate emission around its sibling planet, YSES-1 b. The clouds of YSES-1 c are composed of either amorphous iron-enriched pyroxene or a combination of amorphous MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4, with particle sizes of ≤0.1 μm at 1 millibar pressure. We attribute the emission from the disk around YSES-1 b to be from submicron olivine dust grains, which may have formed through collisions of planet-forming bodies in the disk. Direct observations of silicate clouds in the atmosphere of the exoplanet YSES-1 c and the first circumplanetary disk silicate emission around its sibling planet YSES-1 b are reported.",

    "abstract": "Type I interferons are essential for antiviral immunity1 but must be tightly regulated2. The conserved transcriptional repressor SP140 inhibits interferon-β (Ifnb1) expression through an unknown mechanism3,4. Here we report that SP140 does not directly repress Ifnb1 transcription. Instead, SP140 negatively regulates Ifnb1 mRNA stability by directly repressing the expression of a previously uncharacterized regulator that we call RESIST (regulated stimulator of interferon via stabilization of transcript; previously annotated as annexin 2 receptor). RESIST promotes Ifnb1 mRNA stability by counteracting Ifnb1 mRNA destabilization mediated by the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA-binding proteins and the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex. SP140 localizes within punctate structures called nuclear bodies that have important roles in silencing DNA-virus gene expression in the nucleus3. Consistent with this observation, we find that SP140 inhibits replication of the gammaherpesvirus MHV68. The antiviral activity of SP140 is independent of its ability to regulate Ifnb1. Our results establish dual antiviral and interferon regulatory functions for SP140. We propose that SP140 and RESIST participate in antiviral effector-triggered immunity5,6. The antiviral protein SP140 negatively regulates Ifnb1 mRNA stability by directly repressing the expression of the immune regulator RESIST.",

These reactions take place in a flexible ω-shaped framework composed of XRCC4 and XLF. Two broken DNA ends, each encircled by Ku70–Ku80 internally, are docked onto the ω frame, mediated by LIG4. DNA polymerase and ligase attached to each ω arm repair only one broken strand of a defined polarity; the final steps of NHEJ requires coordination and toggling of a pair of such enzymes. The facilitators XLF and PAXX additively stimulate NHEJ reactions. As DNA-end sensor and protector, LIG4 replaces DNA-PKcs for end joining and bridges the two DNA ends for polymerase to fill remaining gaps. These assemblies present new targets for NHEJ inhibition to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and accuracy of gene editing.

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells use inhibitory and activating immune receptors to differentiate between human cells and pathogens. Signalling by these receptors determines whether an NK cell becomes activated and destroys a target cell. In some cases, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, immune receptors are found in pairs, with inhibitory and activating receptors containing nearly identical extracellular ligand-binding domains coupled to different intracellular signalling domains1. Previous studies showed that repetitive interspersed family (RIFIN) proteins, displayed on the surfaces of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, can bind to inhibitory immune receptors and dampen NK cell activation2,3, reducing parasite killing. However, no pathogen-derived ligand has been identified for any human activating receptor. Here we identified a clade of RIFINs that bind to inhibitory immune receptor KIR2DL1 more strongly than KIR2DL1 binds to the human ligand (MHC class I). This interaction mediates inhibitory signalling and suppresses the activation of KIR2DL1-expressing NK cells. We show that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs are abundant in field-isolated strains from both Africa and Asia and reveal how the two RIFINs bind to KIR2DL1. The RIFIN binding surface of KIR2DL1 is conserved in the cognate activating immune receptor KIR2DS1. We find that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs can also bind to KIR2DS1, resulting in the activation of KIR2DS1-expressing NK cells. This study demonstrates that activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors can recruit NK cells to target a pathogen and reveals a potential role for activating immune receptors in controlling malaria infection. Certain RIFINs from Plasmodium falciparum can bind to both inhibitory (KIR2DL1) and activating (KIR2DS1) immune receptors on natural killer cells, demonstrating the potential role of activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors in targeting pathogens and controlling malaria infection.",

    "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed unexpectedly rapid galaxy assembly in the early Universe, in tension with galaxy-formation models1–3. At the low abundances of heavy elements (metals) and dust typical in early galaxies, the formation of molecular hydrogen and its connection to star formation remain poorly understood. Some models predict that stars form in predominantly atomic gas at low metallicity4,5, in contrast to molecular gas at higher metallicities6. Despite repeated searches7, cold molecular gas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% solar metallicity8. Here we report the detection of rotational emission from molecular hydrogen near the only O-type star in the 3% solar metallicity galaxy Leo P (refs. 9,10) with JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument/Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MIRI-MRS) observing mode. These observations place a lower limit on Leo P’s molecular gas content, and modelling of the photodissociation region illuminated by the O star suggests a compact (≤2.6 pc radius), approximately 104 M⊙ cloud. We also report a stringent upper limit on carbon monoxide (CO) emission from a deep search with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Our results highlight the power of MIRI-MRS to characterize even small ultraviolet-illuminated molecular clouds in the low-metallicity regime, in which the traditional observational tracer CO is uninformative. This discovery pushes the limiting metallicity at which molecular gas is present in detectable quantities more than a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance for models of the interstellar medium in early galaxies. Observations from the JWST MIRI-MRS instrument reveal the detection of rotational emission from molecular hydrogen near the only O-type star in the 3% solar metallicity galaxy Leo P, providing confirmation that significant quantities of molecular gas can form in such metal- and dust-poor environments.",

    "abstract": "Developing bioelectronics capable of stably tracking brain-wide, single-cell, millisecond-resolved neural activity in the developing brain is critical for advancing neuroscience and understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. During development, the three-dimensional structure of the vertebrate brain arises from a two-dimensional neural plate1,2. These large morphological changes have previously posed a challenge for implantable bioelectronics to reliably track neural activity throughout brain development3–9. Here we introduce a tissue-level-soft, submicrometre-thick mesh microelectrode array that integrates into the embryonic neural plate by leveraging the tissue’s natural two-dimensional-to-three-dimensional reconfiguration. As organogenesis progresses, the mesh deforms, stretches and distributes throughout the brain, seamlessly integrating with neural tissue. Immunostaining, gene expression analysis and behavioural testing confirm no adverse effects on brain development or function. This embedded electrode array enables long-term, stable mapping of how single-neuron activity and population dynamics emerge and evolve during brain development. In axolotl models, it not only records neural electrical activity during regeneration but also modulates the process through electrical stimulation. A soft mesh microelectrode array can seamlessly integrate in developing brains, enabling long-term, stable mapping of how single-neuron activity and population dynamics emerge and evolve during brain development.",

    "abstract": "Eutyrannosaurians were large predatory dinosaurs that dominated Asian and North American terrestrial faunas in latest Cretaceous times. These apex predators arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids during the ‘middle’ Cretaceous that are poorly known owing to the paucity of fossil material1–3. Here we report on a new tyrannosauroid, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis gen. et sp. nov., from lower Upper Cretaceous deposits of Mongolia that provides a new perspective on eutyrannosaurian origins and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses recover Khankhuuluu immediately outside Eutyrannosauria and recover the massive, deep-snouted Tyrannosaurini and the smaller, gracile, shallow-snouted Alioramini as highly derived eutyrannosaurian sister clades. Khankhuuluu and the late-diverging Alioramini independently share features related to a shallow skull and gracile build with juvenile eutyrannosaurians, reinforcing the key role heterochrony had in eutyrannosaurian evolution. Although eutyrannosaurians were mainly influenced by peramorphosis or accelerated growth4–10, Alioramini is revealed as a derived lineage that retained immature features through paedomorphosis and is not a more basal lineage as widely accepted11–19. Our results reveal that Asian tyrannosauroids (similar to Khankhuuluu) dispersed to North America, giving rise to Eutyrannosauria in the mid-Late Cretaceous. Eutyrannosauria diversified and remained exclusively in North America until a single dispersal to Asia in the latest Cretaceous that established Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini. Stark morphological differences between Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini probably evolved due to divergent heterochronic trends—paedomorphosis versus peramorphosis, respectively—allowing them to coexist in Asia and occupy different ecological niches. A new tyrannosauroid, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis gen. et sp. nov., from lower Upper Cretaceous deposits of Mongolia provides a new perspective on eutyrannosaurian origins and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for light-emitting diodes (LEDs)1–4. Spatially confining charge carriers using nanocrystal/quantum dots5–9, low-dimensional perovskites10–13 and ultrathin perovskite layers14 have all been used to improve the external quantum efficiency of perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). However, most strongly space-confined perovskites suffer from severe Auger recombination, ion migration and thermal instability, resulting in limited brightness and operational lifetime6,7,10–12,14–17. Here, we report an alternative strategy based on weakly space-confined, large-grained crystals of all-inorganic perovskite. Sacrificial additives, namely, hypophosphorous acid and ammonium chloride, were used to induce nucleation and crystallization of caesium lead bromide, resulting in monocrystal grains with minimized trap density and a high photoluminescence quantum yield. Benefiting from the high carrier mobility and suppressed Auger recombination, we obtained efficient PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency reaching 22.0%, which remained above 20% at a high current density near 1,000 mA cm−2 and a brightness of over 1,167,000 cd m−2. Furthermore, benefiting from the suppressed ion migration and better thermal stability, the extrapolated half-lifetime of the weakly space-confined PeLEDs increased to 185,600 h under an initial luminance of 100 cd m−2 at room temperature. Our work is a new approach for designing efficient, bright and stable PeLEDs for real applications. Weakly space-confined, large-grained crystals of all-inorganic perovskite were used to fabricate light-emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency and operational stability.",

    "abstract": "Since the invention of the laser, nonlinear effects such as filamentation1, Rabi cycling2,3 and collective emission4 have been explored in the optical regime, leading to a wide range of scientific and industrial applications5–8. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have extended many optical techniques to X-rays for their advantages of ångström-scale spatial resolution and elemental specificity9. An example is XFEL-driven inner-shell Kα1 (2p3/2 → 1s1/2) X-ray lasing in elements ranging from neon to copper, which has been used for nonlinear spectroscopy and development of new X-ray laser sources10–16. Here we show that strong lasing effects similar to those in the optical regime can occur at 1.5–2.1 Å wavelengths during high-intensity (>1019 W cm−2) XFEL-driven Kα1 lasing of copper and manganese. Depending on the temporal XFEL pump pulse substructure, the resulting X-ray pulses (about 106−108 photons) can exhibit strong spatial inhomogeneities and spectral splitting, inhomogeneities and broadening. Three-dimensional Maxwell–Bloch calculations17 show that the observed spatial inhomogeneities result from X-ray filamentation and that the broad spectral features are driven by sub-femtosecond Rabi cycling. Our simulations indicate that these X-ray pulses can have pulse lengths of less than 100 attoseconds and coherence properties that provide opportunities for quantum X-ray optics applications. Strong lasing effects similar to those in the optical regime can occur at 1.5–2.1 Å wavelengths during high-intensity XFEL-driven Kα1 lasing of copper and manganese.",

    "abstract": "Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models1, which are fundamental to modern condensed-matter physics2,3. Despite notable advancements4–6, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogues are still too high to address many open problems7–10. Here we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature6,11–13, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low-entropy product state into strongly correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters14,15, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically10. At half-filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturation, leading to a temperature of \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$T/t=0.0{5}_{-0.05}^{+0.06}$$\n                \n               based on comparisons with numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations9. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations16–18. Compared with the cuprates2,19,20, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, at which physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected3,19,21–24. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics8,10. A several-fold reduction in temperature is accomplished using a neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator by transforming a low-entropy product state into strongly correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters.",

    "abstract": "Long (>200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in diverse aspects of life. Over 20 classes of lncRNAs have been identified in bacteria and bacteriophages through comparative genomics analyses, but their biological functions remain largely unexplored1–3. Owing to the large sizes, the structural determinants of most lncRNAs also remain uncharacterized. Here, we report the structures of two natural RNA nanocages formed by the ROOL (rumen-originating, ornate, large) lncRNA found in bacterial and phage genomes. The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures at 2.9-Å resolution reveal that ROOL RNAs form an octameric nanocage with a diameter of 28 nm and an axial length of 20 nm, in which the hollow inside features poorly ordered regions. The octamer is stabilized by numerous tertiary and quaternary interactions, including triple-strand A-minors, for which we propose the term ‘A-minor staples’. The structure of an isolated ROOL monomer at 3.2-Å resolution indicates that nanocage assembly involves a strand-swapping mechanism resulting in quaternary kissing loops. Finally, we show that ROOL RNA fused to an RNA aptamer, transfer RNA or microRNA retains its structure, forming a nanocage with radially displayed cargoes. Our findings, therefore, may enable engineering of novel RNA nanocages as delivery vehicles for research and therapeutic applications. Three-dimensional structures of two natural RNA nanocages reveal unique quaternary structures without the contribution of proteins.",

    "abstract": "Climate change may amplify the frequency and severity of supply–demand mismatches in future power systems with high shares of wind and solar energy1,2. Here we use a dispatch optimization model to assess potential increases in hourly costs associated with the climate-intensified gaps under fixed, high penetrations of wind and solar energy generation. We further explore various strategies to enhance system resilience in the face of future climate change. We find that extreme periods—defined as hours in the upper decile of hourly costs (that is, the most costly 10% of hours)—are likely to become more costly in the future in most countries, mainly because of the increased need for investments in flexible energy capacity. For example, under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway SSP1–2.6 scenario, 47 countries that together account for approximately 43.5% of global future electricity generation are projected to experience more than a 5% increase in average hourly costs during extreme periods, with the largest reaching up to 23.7%. The risk of rising costs could be substantially mitigated through tailored, country-specific strategies involving the coordinated implementation of multiple measures to address supply–demand imbalances and enhance system flexibility. Our findings provide important insights for building future climate-resilient power systems while reducing system costs. Climate-intensified supply–demand imbalances may raise hourly costs of wind and solar power systems, but well-designed climate-resilient strategies can provide help.",

Consequently, FFA2 is a promising drug target for immunometabolic disorders1–4. Here we report cryogenic electronic microscopy structures of FFA2 in complex with two G proteins and three distinct classes of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), and describe noncanonical activation mechanisms that involve conserved structural features of class A GPCRs. Two PAMs disrupt the E/DRY activation microswitch5 and stabilize the conformation of intracellular loop 2 by binding to lipid-facing pockets near the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. By contrast, the third PAM promotes the separation of transmembrane helices 6 and 7 by interacting with transmembrane helix 6 at the receptor–lipid interface. Molecular dynamic simulations and mutagenesis experiments confirm these noncanonical activation mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the molecular basis for the Gi versus Gq bias, which is due to distinct conformations of intracellular loop 2 stabilized by different PAMs. These findings provide a framework for the design of tailored GPCR modulators, with implications that extend beyond FFA2 to the broader field of GPCR drug discovery. Structural, pharmacological and computational studies reveal how different classes of positive allosteric modulators bind to distinct allosteric sites and use noncanonical mechanisms to activate the free-fatty acid receptor FFA2.",

    "abstract": "Brain organoids enable the mechanistic study of human brain development and provide opportunities to explore self-organization in unconstrained developmental systems1–3. Here we establish long-term, live light-sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labelled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviours and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development4. We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labelling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track actin, tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue-state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization and brain regionalization. On the basis of imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrix-induced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signalling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the WNT ligand secretion mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of non-telencephalic brain regions. Together, our work provides an inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics have a central role during brain regionalization. Human brain morphodynamics are explored using organoids.",

Inspired by the natural filtration abilities of mucus-coated nasal hairs3,4, we introduce an efficient, biomimetic filter that exploits a thin liquid coating. Here we show that a stable thin liquid layer is formed on several filter media that generates enhanced particulate adhesion, driven by micronewton to sub-micronewton capillary forces5,6. Enhanced particle adhesion increases the filtration of airborne particulates while maintaining air permeability, providing longer filter lifetime and increased energy savings. Moreover, strong adhesion of the captured particles enables effective filtration under high-speed airflow as well as suppression of particle redispersion. We anticipate that these filters with thin liquid layers afford a new way to innovate particulate matter filtering systems. Stable coating of filters with a thin liquid layer enhances adhesion of airborne particulates while maintaining high air permeability, resulting in longer lifetimes and higher efficiency of these filters.",

Focusing on seven enhancers that are active in the developing brain, heart, limb and face, we created over 1,700 transgenic mice for over 260 mutagenized enhancer alleles. Systematic mutation of 12-base-pair blocks collectively altered each sequence feature in each enhancer at least once. We show that 69% of all blocks are required for normal in vivo activity, with mutations more commonly resulting in loss (60%) than in gain (9%) of function. Using predictive modelling, we annotated critical nucleotides at the base-pair resolution. The vast majority of motifs predicted by these machine learning models (88%) coincided with changes in in vivo function, and the models showed considerable sensitivity, identifying 59% of all functional blocks. Taken together, our results reveal that human enhancers contain a high density of sequence features that are required for their normal in vivo function and provide a rich resource for further exploration of human enhancer logic. Human enhancers contain a high density of sequence features that are required for their normal in vivo function.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death from an infectious disease1,2. Here we report the discovery of a first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor targeting PurF, the first enzyme in the mycobacterial de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. The lead candidate, JNJ-6640, exhibited nanomolar bactericidal activity in vitro. Comprehensive genetic and biochemical approaches confirmed that JNJ-6640 was highly selective for mycobacterial PurF. Single-cell-level microscopy demonstrated a downstream effect on DNA replication. We determined the physiologically relevant concentrations of nucleobases in human and mouse lung tissue, showing that these levels were insufficient to salvage PurF inhibition. Indeed, proof-of-concept studies using a long-acting injectable formulation demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of the compound. Finally, we show that inclusion of JNJ-6640 could have a crucial role in improving current treatment regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Together, we demonstrate that JNJ-6640 is a promising chemical lead and that targeting de novo purine biosynthesis represents a novel strategy for tuberculosis drug development. The validation of inhibitors targeting PurF, a novel drug target for tuberculosis drug discovery, is described.",

    "abstract": "Aromatic rings, also known as arenes, containing two or more adjacent different substituents are ubiquitously found in small-molecule drugs1. Strategies that can rapidly introduce diverse vicinal substituents to readily available precursors would greatly benefit the generation of analogues of biologically active compounds2, which, however, remain challenging to realize so far. The existing approaches for preparing vicinal difunctionalized arenes lack modularity, regioselectivity or generality. Here we report a nickel-catalysed arene vicinal diborylation method that can directly install two chemically differentiated boryl groups in a regioselective and site-selective manner using readily available aryl triflates or chlorides as substrates. This reaction operates under simple and mild conditions and is scalable. It also shows a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Given that each boryl group can be independently transformed into various functional groups, this method offers a modular, regioselective and divergent approach to access diverse vicinal difunctionalized arenes, showing promise for constructing analogue libraries. The combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal a highly unusual reaction pathway, involving the formation of a dearomatized gem-diboryl species and 1,2-boron migration. The site-selectivity and regioselectivity of this reaction are proposed to be controlled by steric interactions of the boryl groups with the nickel catalyst. The mechanistic insights gained in this investigation could have broad implications on developing other boron-mediated functionalization reactions. A nickel-catalysed vicinal diborylation method is described, which can install two different boron functional groups on aromatic rings in a regioselective and site-selective manner, enabling the rapid synthesis of complex molecular building blocks.",

    "abstract": "AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are integral to fast excitatory synaptic transmission and have vital roles in synaptic plasticity, motor coordination, learning and memory1. Whereas extensive structural studies have been conducted on recombinant AMPARs and native calcium-impermeable (CI)-AMPARs alongside their auxiliary proteins2–5, the molecular architecture of native calcium-permeable (CP)-AMPARs has remained undefined. Here, to determine the subunit composition, physiological architecture and gating mechanisms of CP-AMPARs, we visualize these receptors, immunoaffinity purified from rat cerebella, and resolve their structures using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results indicate that the predominant assembly consists of GluA1 and GluA4 subunits, with the GluA4 subunit occupying the B and D positions, and auxiliary subunits, including transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs) located at the B′ and D′ positions, and cornichon homologues (CNIHs) or TARPs located at the A′ and C′ positions. Furthermore, we resolved the structure of the noelin (NOE1)–GluA1–GluA4 complex, in which NOE1 specifically binds to the GluA4 subunit at the B and D positions. Notably, NOE1 stabilizes the amino-terminal domain layer without affecting gating properties of the receptor. NOE1 contributes to AMPAR function by forming dimeric AMPAR assemblies that are likely to engage in extracellular networks, clustering receptors in synaptic environments and modulating receptor responsiveness to synaptic inputs. Cryo-electron microscopy analyses of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors from rat brain show that they are composed primarily of GluA1 and GluA4 subunits, and biochemical studies show that noelin promotes inter-receptor interactions without modulating receptor function.",

    "abstract": "Aharonov–Bohm interference of fractional quasiparticles in the quantum Hall effect generally reveals their elementary charge (e*)1–15. Recently, our interferometry experiments with several ‘particle states’ reported flux periods of ΔΦ = (e/e*)Φ0 (with Φ0 the flux quantum) at moderate temperatures16. Here we report interference measurements of ‘particle–hole conjugated’ states at filling factors ν = 2/3, 3/5 and 4/7, which revealed unexpected flux periodicities of ΔΦ = ν−1Φ0. The measured shot-noise Fano factor (F) of the partitioned quasiparticles in each of the quantum point contacts of the interferometer was F = ν (ref. 17) rather than that of the elementary charge F = e*/e (refs. 18,19). These observations indicate that the interference of bunched (clustered) elementary quasiparticles occurred for coherent pairs, triples and quadruplets, respectively. A small metallic gate (top gate), deposited in the centre of the interferometer bulk, formed an antidot (or a dot) when charged, thus introducing local quasiparticles at the perimeter of the (anti)dot. Surprisingly, such charging led to a dissociation of the ‘bunched quasiparticles’ and, thus, recovered the conventional flux periodicity set by the elementary charge of the quasiparticles. However, the shot-noise Fano factor (of each quantum point contact) consistently remained at F = ν, possibly due to the neutral modes accompanying the conjugated states. The two observations—bunching and debunching (or dissociation)—were not expected by current theories. Similar effects may arise in Jain’s ‘particle states’ (at lower temperatures) and at even denominator fractional quantum Hall states20. The coherent bunching of anyons and their dissociation was observed in an interference experiment.",

    "abstract": "The Tweety homologues (TTYHs) constitute a family of eukaryotic membrane proteins that, on the basis of structural features, were recently proposed to contribute to lipid transfer between soluble carriers and cellular membranes1. However, in the absence of supporting data, this function was hypothetical. Here through pull-down of endogenous proteins, we identify APOE as the interaction partner of human TTYH2. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry assays showed that both proteins colocalize in endosomal compartments. Characterization of the specific interaction between APOE and TTYH2 through binding assays and structural studies enabled us to identify an epitope in an extended domain of TTYH2 that faces the endosomal lumen. Structures of complexes with APOE-containing lipoprotein particles revealed a binding mode that places lipids in a suitable position to facilitate their diffusion into the membrane. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed that lipid transfer is accelerated by TTYH2. Collectively, our findings indicate that TTYH2 has a role in the unloading of APOE-containing lipoproteins after they are endocytosed. These results define a new protein class that facilitates the extraction of lipids from and their insertion into cellular membranes. Although ubiquitous, this process could be of particular relevance in the brain, where APOE is involved in the transfer of lipids between astrocytes and neurons. The Tweety homologue TTYH2 is identified as the lipid transfer mediator for APOE-containing lipoproteins.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders represent a major medical challenge, with few effective therapies available. These disorders often result from dysfunction of inhibitory nitric oxide (NO)-producing motor neurons in the enteric nervous system, which are essential for regulating gut motility. Loss or dysfunction of NO neurons is linked to severe conditions, including achalasia, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction and chronic constipation1,2. Here we introduce a platform based on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for therapeutic development targeting GI motility disorders. Using an unbiased screen, we identified drug candidates that modulate NO neuron activity and enhance motility in mouse colonic tissue ex vivo. We established a high-throughput strategy to define developmental programs driving the specification of NO neurons and found that inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) promotes their differentiation from precursors of the enteric nervous system. Transplantation of these neurons into NO-neuron-deficient mice led to robust engraftment and improved GI motility, offering a promising cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative GI disorders. These studies provide a new framework for understanding and treating enteric neuropathies. A study presents a strategy based on human pluripotent stem cells for treating neurodegenerative disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.",

    "abstract": "Lanthanides have shown magnetic memory at both the atomic1,2 and molecular3,4 level. The magnetic remanence temperatures of lanthanide single-molecule magnets can surpass d-transition metal examples5,6, and since 2017, energy barriers to magnetic reversal (Ueff) from 1,237(28) cm–1 to 1,631(25) cm–1 and open magnetic hysteresis loops between 40 K and 80 K have typically been achieved with axial dysprosium(III) bis(cyclopentadienyl) complexes7–17. It has been predicted that linear dysprosium(III) compounds could deliver greater mJ (the projection of the total angular momentum, J, on a quantization axis labelled z) state splitting and therefore higher Ueff and hysteresis temperatures18–21, but as lanthanide bonding is predominantly ionic22,23, so far dysprosium bis(amide) complexes have shown highly bent geometries that promote fast magnetic reversal24,25. Here we report a dysprosium bis(amide)–alkene complex, [Dy{N(SiiPr3)[Si(iPr)2C(CH3)=CHCH3]}{N(SiiPr3)(SiiPr2Et)}][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] (1-Dy), that shows Ueff = 1,843(11) cm–1 and slow closing of soft magnetic hysteresis loops up to 100 K. Calculations show that the Ueff value for 1-Dy arises from the charge-dense amide ligands, with a pendant alkene taking a structural role to enforce a large N–Dy–N angle while imposing only a weak equatorial interaction. This leads to molecular spin dynamics up to 100 times slower than the current best single-molecule magnets above 90 K. A dysprosium amide–alkene complex shows soft magnetic hysteresis loops up to 100 kelvin, arising from the high charge density of the amide ligands and the structural role of the pendant alkene.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain malignancy1. Immunosuppression in the GBM tumour microenvironment (TME) is an important barrier to immune-targeted therapies, but our understanding of the mechanisms of immune regulation in the GBM TME is limited2. Here we describe a viral barcode interaction-tracing approach3 to analyse TME cell–cell communication in GBM clinical samples and preclinical models at single-cell resolution. We combine it with single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing analyses, human organotypic GBM cultures, in vivo cell-specific CRISPR–Cas9-driven genetic perturbations as well as human and mouse experimental systems to identify an annexin A1–formyl peptide receptor 1 (ANXA1–FPR1) bidirectional astrocyte–GBM communication pathway that limits tumour-specific immunity. FPR1 inhibits immunogenic necroptosis in tumour cells, and ANXA1 suppresses NF-κB and inflammasome activation in astrocytes. ANXA1 expression in astrocytes and FPR1 expression in cancer cells are associated with poor outcomes in individuals with GBM. The inactivation of astrocyte–glioma ANXA1–FPR1 signalling enhanced dendritic cell, T cell and macrophage responses, increasing infiltration by tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and limiting T cell exhaustion. In summary, we have developed a method to analyse TME cell–cell interactions at single-cell resolution in clinical samples and preclinical models, and used it to identify bidirectional astrocyte–GBM communication through ANXA1–FPR1 as a driver of immune evasion and tumour progression.  Using viral barcode tracing to detect interactions between glioblastoma cells and non-malignant astrocytes in patient samples, investigators discovered a pathway that reduces tumour-specific immunity and identified potential therapeutic targets.",

Whether the same coding principle holds for dynamic cognitive variables remains unknown because internal cognitive processes unfold with a unique time course on single trials observed only in the irregular spiking of heterogeneous neural populations3–8. Here we show the existence of such a population code for the dynamics of choice formation in the primate premotor cortex. We developed an approach to simultaneously infer population dynamics and tuning functions of single neurons to the population state. Applied to spike data recorded during decision-making, our model revealed that populations of neurons encoded the same dynamic variable predicting choices, and heterogeneous firing rates resulted from the diverse tuning of single neurons to this decision variable. The inferred dynamics indicated an attractor mechanism for decision computation. Our results reveal a unifying geometric principle for neural encoding of sensory and dynamic cognitive variables. A population code for the dynamics of choice formation in the primate premotor cortex is revealed, with diverse single-neuron tuning to a shared decision variable.",

    "abstract": "Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics1–4. Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware5–8, but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modelled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities and may change their material properties with use9–12. Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot’s actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots’ materials, actuation or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation. An approach that learns models of robots from video capture can predict the 3D motion outcomes of motor commands, enabling accurate control of a range of soft, biologically inspired robots from a single video camera.",

    "abstract": "AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain1. Assembled from combinations of four core subunits, GluA1–4 and around 20 auxiliary subunits, their molecular diversity tunes information transfer and storage in a brain-circuit-specific manner. GluA3, a subtype strongly associated with disease2, functions as both a fast-transmitting Ca2+-permeable AMPAR at sensory synapses3, and as a Ca2+-impermeable receptor at cortical synapses4,5. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Ca2+-permeable GluA3 homomer, which substantially diverges from other AMPARs. The GluA3 extracellular domain tiers (N-terminal domain (NTD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD)) are closely coupled throughout gating states, creating interfaces that impact signalling and contain human disease-associated mutations. Central to this architecture is a stacking interaction between two arginine residues (Arg163) in the NTD dimer interface, trapping a unique NTD dimer conformation that enables close contacts with the LBD. Rupture of the Arg163 stack not only alters the structure and dynamics of the GluA3 extracellular region, but also increases receptor trafficking and the expression of GluA3 heteromers at the synapse. We further show that a mammalian-specific GluA3 trafficking checkpoint determines the conformational stability of the LBD tier. Thus, specific design features define communication and biogenesis of GluA3, offering a framework to examine this disease-associated glutamate receptor. The GluA3 homomer substantially diverges from other AMPA-type glutamate receptors.",

    "abstract": "Alkenes are a central part of organic chemistry1–3. However, although most alkenes are easy to prepare, the controlled synthesis of tetrasubstituted alkenes, those with four groups around the central C=C bond, remains challenging1–5. Here we report the boron-mediated assembly of tetrasubstituted alkenes with complete control of the double-bond geometry. The migrating group and electrophile add syn across the alkyne. Mild oxidation leads to intermediate borinic esters6, which can be isolated and purified or reacted directly in a range of transformations, including cross-couplings and homologation reactions. In particular, subjecting the intermediate borinic esters to Zweifel7,8 olefination conditions can give either retention or inversion of the double-bond geometry, depending on whether base is present or not. Different positional and stereoisomers of the tetrasubstituted alkenes can be easily accessed, highlighting the breadth and versatility of the method. This was showcased through its successful application to the rapid synthesis of drug molecules and natural products with high yield and stereocontrol. Not only does this method provide efficient access to the long-standing challenge of the stereocontrolled synthesis of tetrasubstituted alkenes but it also introduces new concepts related to the intervention of non-classical borenium ions in the Zweifel olefination. A method based on boron-mediated assembly is described for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted alkenes, molecules with four substituents around the central C=C bond, with complete control over the double-bond geometry.",

    "abstract": "Natural chiral polymers, such as DNA, proteins, cellulose and poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] ((R)-P3HB), are prevalent in their enantiopure forms1,2. Existing methods to synthesize enantiopure polymers focus on enantiospecific polymerization, in which only one specific enantiomer is obtained from the corresponding chiral monomer3–6. Here we introduce a catalytic stereodivergent synthetic strategy to access all enantiopure di-isotactic poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) diastereomers from bacterial (R)-P3HB as the single chiral source. A series of enantiopure (R,R)-α-alkylated-β-butyrolactones are obtained from (R)-P3HB and then subjected to the catalyst-controlled diastereodivergent ring-opening polymerization (ROP) to enantiopure di-isotactic α-alkylated PHAs. Metal-catalysed coordination–insertion ROP results in threo-(R,R)-di-isotactic PHAs with chiral retention, whereas anionic ROP catalysed by an organic superbase produces erythro-(R,S)-di-isotactic PHAs with chiral inversion, achieving precision di-isotactic PHAs with exclusive regio- and stereoregularity. This strategy has also enabled the stereodivergent synthesis of all four [(R,R), (S,S), (R,S) and (S,R)] stereoisomers of α,α-dialkylated PHAs from (R)-P3HB, which can be depolymerized to chiral α,α-dialkylated-β-butyrolactones with high stereoselectivity. Overall, this catalyst-controlled regio- and stereoselective, stereodivergent synthetic methodology provides access to 16 enantiopure stereoisomers of α(α)-(di)substituted PHAs and enables the stereochemistry-defined structure–property relationship study of the di-isotactic PHAs, providing insights into the effects of main-chain stereoconfigurations and alkyl side chains on their thermal properties, melt processability, mechanical performance and supramolecular stereocomplexation. Stereoselective synthetic routes use P3HB (a polyester produced by bacteria) as a chiral feedstock for related polymers that have properties more amenable to processing and use.",

    "abstract": "Methanogenic archaea are the main producers of the potent greenhouse gas methane1,2. In the methanogenic pathway from CO2 and H2 studied under laboratory conditions, low-potential electrons for CO2 reduction are generated by a flavin-based electron-bifurcation reaction catalysed by heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr) complexed with the associated [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Mvh)3–5. F420-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Frh) provides electrons to the methanogenic pathway through the electron carrier F420 (ref. 6). Here we report that under strictly nickel-limited conditions, in which the nickel concentration is similar to those often observed in natural habitats7–11, the production of both [NiFe]-hydrogenases in Methanothermobacter marburgensis is strongly downregulated. The Frh reaction is substituted by a coupled reaction with [Fe]-hydrogenase (Hmd), and the role of Mvh is taken over by F420-dependent electron-donating proteins (Elp). Thus, Hmd provides all electrons for the reducing metabolism under these nickel-limited conditions. Biochemical and structural characterization of Elp–Hdr complexes confirms the electronic interaction between Elp and Hdr. The conservation of the genes encoding Elp and Hmd in CO2-reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens suggests that the Hmd system is an alternative pathway for electron flow in CO2-reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens under nickel-limited conditions. Two distantly related methanogens shift the methanogenic pathway under nickel limitation, suggesting that methanogens adapt to changing bioavailability of nickel by rerouting electron flow between two different pathways.",

    "abstract": "The North Eurasian forest and forest-steppe zones have sustained millennia of sociocultural connections among northern peoples, but much of their history is poorly understood. In particular, the genomic formation of populations that speak Uralic and Yeniseian languages today is unknown. Here, by generating genome-wide data for 180 ancient individuals spanning this region, we show that the Early-to-Mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers harboured a continuous gradient of ancestry from fully European-related in the Baltic, to fully East Asian-related in the Transbaikal. Contemporaneous groups in Northeast Siberia were off-gradient and descended from a population that was the primary source for Native Americans, which then mixed with populations of Inland East Asia and the Amur River Basin to produce two populations whose expansion coincided with the collapse of pre-Bronze Age population structure. Ancestry from the first population, Cis-Baikal Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Cisbaikal_LNBA), is associated with Yeniseian-speaking groups and those that admixed with them, and ancestry from the second, Yakutia Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Yakutia_LNBA), is associated with migrations of prehistoric Uralic speakers. We show that Yakutia_LNBA first dispersed westwards from the Lena River Basin around 4,000 years ago into the Altai-Sayan region and into West Siberian communities associated with Seima-Turbino metallurgy—a suite of advanced bronze casting techniques that expanded explosively from the Altai1. The 16 Seima-Turbino period individuals were diverse in their ancestry, also harbouring DNA from Indo-Iranian-associated pastoralists and from a range of hunter-gatherer groups. Thus, both cultural transmission and migration were key to the Seima-Turbino phenomenon, which was involved in the initial spread of early Uralic-speaking communities. Genome-wide sequencing of 180 ancient individuals shows a continuous gradient of ancestry in Early-to-Mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers from the Baltic to the Transbaikal region and distinct contemporaneous groups in Northeast Siberia, and provides insights into the origins of modern Uralic and Yeniseian speakers.",

    "abstract": "Ultimate limits for the sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor1–3. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits4–7. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for several applications. Here we demonstrate a tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative-mass or positive-mass oscillator, we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble enables targeting quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational-wave detectors (GWDs). Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing. A hybrid quantum network combining entangled light with an atomic spin ensemble engineered to act as a negative-mass oscillator enables frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for gravitational-wave detection.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) accounts for around 25% of all lung cancers1,2 and has been associated with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke and air pollution in observational studies3–5. Here we use data from the Sherlock-Lung study to evaluate mutagenic exposures in LCINS by examining the cancer genomes of 871 treatment-naive individuals with lung cancer who had never smoked, from 28 geographical locations. KRAS mutations were 3.8 times more common in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from North America and Europe than in those from East Asia, whereas a higher prevalence of EGFR and TP53 mutations was observed in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from East Asia. Signature SBS40a, with unknown cause6, contributed the largest proportion of single base substitutions in adenocarcinomas, and was enriched in cases with EGFR mutations. Signature SBS22a, which is associated with exposure to aristolochic acid7,8, was observed almost exclusively in patients from Taiwan. Exposure to secondhand smoke was not associated with individual driver mutations or mutational signatures. By contrast, patients from regions with high levels of air pollution were more likely to have TP53 mutations and shorter telomeres. They also exhibited an increase in most types of mutations, including a 3.9-fold increase in signature SBS4, which has previously been linked with tobacco smoking9, and a 76% increase in the clock-like10 signature SBS5. A positive dose–response effect was observed with air-pollution levels, correlating with both a decrease in telomere length and an increase in somatic mutations, mainly attributed to signatures SBS4 and SBS5. Our results elucidate the diversity of mutational processes shaping the genomic landscape of lung cancer in never smokers. An analysis of data from the Sherlock-Lung study provides insight into the mutational processes that contribute to lung cancer in never smokers, and looks at the possible role of factors such as air pollution and passive smoking.",

    "abstract": "Social interaction can be regarded as a dynamic feedback loop between interacting individuals as they act and react to each other1,2. Here, to understand the neural basis of these interactions, we investigated inter-brain neural dynamics across individuals in both mice and artificial intelligence systems. By measuring activities of molecularly defined neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of socially interacting mice, we find that the multi-dimensional neural space within each individual can be partitioned into two distinct subspaces—a shared neural subspace that represents shared neural dynamics across animals and a unique neural subspace that represents activity unique to each animal. Notably, compared with glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex contain a considerably larger shared neural subspace, which arises from behaviours of both self and others. We extended this framework to artificial intelligence agents and observed that, as social interactions emerged, so too did shared neural dynamics between interacting agents. Importantly, selectively disrupting the neural components that contribute to shared neural dynamics substantially reduces the agents’ social actions. Our findings suggest that shared neural dynamics represent a fundamental and generalizable feature of interacting neural systems present in both biological and artificial agents and highlight the functional significance of shared neural dynamics in driving social interactions. Shared inter-brain neural dynamics, reflecting aspects of social interaction including self and other’s behaviours, arise in GABAergic neurons of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of socially interacting mice, as well as in the neurons of socially interacting artificial intelligence agents.",

We developed an informatics-based platform for visualizing and sharing of the atlas images, offering services such as brain slice registration, neuronal circuit mapping and intelligent stereotaxic surgery planning. This atlas is interoperable with widely used stereotaxic atlases, supporting cross-atlas navigation of corresponding coronal planes in two dimensions and spatial mapping across atlas spaces in three dimensions.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous two-photon emission (STPE) is a second-order quantum radiation process with implications in astrophysics1, atomic physics2 and quantum technology3. In particular, on-demand STPE from single quantum emitters has long been predicted to revolutionize photonic quantum science and technology4,5. Here we report STPE with brightness comparable to that of competing single-photon radiation from a single semiconductor quantum dot deterministically coupled to a high-quality micropillar cavity. This is because of strong vacuum fluctuations in the microcavity, which drive a biexciton directly to the ground state. We show the quantum nature associated with STPE in the cavity quantum electrodynamics regime using photon statistics measurements. Furthermore, STPE is exploited to build unconventional entangled quantum light sources that can simultaneously achieve near-unity entanglement fidelity for spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources and on-demand photon emission for atomic quantum emitters. Our work provides insights into the two-photon process in the quantum regime, which could empower photonic quantum technology with nonlinear quantum radiation. Quantum correlations of spontaneous two-photon emission emitted from a bright quantum dot device are revealed, facilitating the creation of entangled photons with near-unity fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Cell functions across eukaryotes are driven by specific gene expression programs, which are dependent on chromatin structure1–3. Here we report a single-cell multi-omics atlas of rice, one of the world’s major crops. By simultaneously profiling chromatin accessibility and RNA expression in 116,564 cells from eight organs, we identified cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks and described novel cell states, such as a ‘transitional state’ in floral meristems. On the basis of our network analyses, we uncovered the function of the cell-type-specific regulatory hubs RSR1, F3H and LTPL120 during rice development. Our analysis revealed correlations between cell type and agronomic traits, as well as conserved and divergent cell-type functions during evolution. In summary, this study not only offers a unique single-cell multi-omics resource for a major crop but also advances our understanding of cell-type functions and the underlying molecular programs in rice. A single-cell multi-omics atlas of rice is revealed, providing insight into cell-type functions and molecular programs.",

    "abstract": "Decreased brain levels of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an endogenously synthesized lipophilic antioxidant1,2, underpin encephalopathy in primary CoQ10 deficiencies3,4 and are associated with common neurodegenerative diseases and the ageing process5,6. CoQ10 supplementation does not increase CoQ10 pools in the brain or in other tissues. The recent discovery of the mammalian CoQ10 headgroup synthesis pathway, in which 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein (HPDL) makes 4-hydroxymandelate (4-HMA) to synthesize the CoQ10 headgroup precursor 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB)7, offers an opportunity to pharmacologically restore CoQ10 synthesis and mechanistically treat CoQ10 deficiencies. To test whether 4-HMA or 4-HB supplementation promotes CoQ10 headgroup synthesis in vivo, here we administered 4-HMA and 4-HB to Hpdl−/− mice, which model an ultra-rare, lethal mitochondrial encephalopathy in humans. Both 4-HMA and 4-HB were incorporated into CoQ9 and CoQ10 in the brains of Hpdl−/− mice. Oral treatment of Hpdl−/− pups with 4-HMA or 4-HB enabled 90–100% of Hpdl−/− mice to live to adulthood. Furthermore, 4-HB treatment stabilized and improved the neurological symptoms of a patient with progressive spasticity due to biallelic HPDL variants. Our work shows that 4-HMA and 4-HB can modify the course of mitochondrial encephalopathy driven by HPDL variants and demonstrates that CoQ10 headgroup intermediates can restore CoQ10 synthesis in vivo. Decreased brain coenzyme Q10 levels cause encephalopathy and are associated with neurodegeneration; supplementation with 4-HMA or 4-HB restores coenzyme Q10 synthesis in mice and humans with HPDL variants, improving survival and neurological symptoms in HPDL-driven mitochondrial encephalopathy.",

    "abstract": "Reducing fibrous aggregates of the protein tau is a possible strategy for halting the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)1. Previously, we found that in vitro, the d-enantiomeric peptide (D-peptide) D-TLKIVWC disassembles ultra-stable tau fibrils extracted from the autopsied brains of individuals with AD (hereafter, these tau fibrils are referred to as AD-tau) into benign segments, with no energy source other than ambient thermal agitation2. To consider D-peptide-mediated disassembly as a potential route to therapeutics for AD, it is essential to understand the mechanism and energy source of the disassembly action. Here, we show that the assembly of D-peptides into amyloid-like (‘mock-amyloid’) fibrils is essential for AD-tau disassembly. These mock-amyloid fibrils have a right-handed twist but are constrained to adopt a left-handed twist when templated in complex with AD-tau. The release of strain that accompanies the conversion of left-twisted to right-twisted, relaxed mock-amyloid produces a torque that is sufficient to break the local hydrogen bonding between tau molecules, and leads to the fragmentation of AD-tau. This strain-relief mechanism seems to operate in other examples of amyloid fibril disassembly, and could inform the development of first-in-class therapeutics for amyloid diseases. Cryo-electron and atomic force microscopy shed light on how fibrils of the protein tau, which accumulate in the brain of people with Alzheimer’s disease, can be disassembled by short peptides, providing a possible route towards developing treatments.",

    "abstract": "Advances in deep learning and AlphaFold2 have enabled the large-scale prediction of protein structures across species, opening avenues for studying protein function and evolution1. Here we analyse 11,269 predicted and experimentally determined enzyme structures that catalyse 361 metabolic reactions across 225 pathways to investigate metabolic evolution over 400 million years in the Saccharomycotina subphylum2. By linking sequence divergence in structurally conserved regions to a variety of metabolic properties of the enzymes, we reveal that metabolism shapes structural evolution across multiple scales, from species-wide metabolic specialization to network organization and the molecular properties of the enzymes. Although positively selected residues are distributed across various structural elements, enzyme evolution is constrained by reaction mechanisms, interactions with metal ions and inhibitors, metabolic flux variability and biosynthetic cost. Our findings uncover hierarchical patterns of structural evolution, in which structural context dictates amino acid substitution rates, with surface residues evolving most rapidly and small-molecule-binding sites evolving under selective constraints without cost optimization. By integrating structural biology with evolutionary genomics, we establish a model in which enzyme evolution is intrinsically governed by catalytic function and shaped by metabolic niche, network architecture, cost and molecular interactions. By combining structural biology and evolutionary genomics analyses, the evolution of enzymes over 400 million years is shown to be governed by catalytic function, metabolic network architecture, cost and molecular interactions.",

However, conventional synthesis methods require harsh reaction conditions with high energy consumption6,7. Here we propose a versatile platform that takes advantage of heavy water dissociation in bipolar membranes (BPMs) to produce deuterated acids and bases under particularly mild conditions. Specifically, D2SO4 (2.75 mol l−1) and KOD (5.82 mol l−1), which are comparable with commercial products, were prepared using inexpensive D2O and K2SO4. We find that the deuteron generation rate is approximately 1.25 times greater than that of the protons, which is attributed to less co-ion leakage of D+ than H+ through the anion-exchange membrane (AEM), lower salt leakage within BPMs in D2O than in H2O and lower dehydration barrier of deuterons than proton clusters in the membrane phase. Compared with other contributing factors, salt leakage plays a relatively minor role in the observed H+/D+ concentration difference. This flexible and robust platform facilitates the synthesis of various deuterium-labelled compounds. A method making use of heavy water dissociation in bipolar membranes to synthesize deuterated acids and bases is described, which requires particularly mild conditions and inexpensive D2O and K2SO4 and is also environmentally friendly.",

    "abstract": "Integrated nanolasers have been explored for decades owing to their important role in many applications, ranging from optical information processing and communications to medical treatments1–6. Although polarization, orbital angular momentum and directivity of nanolasers have been successfully manipulated7–9, neither their laser wavefront nor radiation characteristics can be customized at will. More optical elements are often required to further modify the laser characteristics, making the lasing system bulky and restricted by inevitable speckle noise. Here we suggest and realize a new type of laser, a metalaser, by using the interplay between local and nonlocal responses of dielectric resonant metasurfaces. The lasing mode is confined by nonlocal interaction between meta-atoms of a planar structure and the beam wavefront is precisely shaped by locally varying dipole momenta. Consequently, the metalaser emission can directly have any desired profile, including focal spots, focal lines, vector beams, vortex beams and even holograms. Notably, the scattered waves of the metalaser do not undergo resonant amplification like laser modes, being orders of magnitude weaker. As a consequence, the speckle noise becomes negligibly small in our metalaser holograms, providing a viable solution to the speckle noise problem of conventional laser holograms. This finding enriches our understanding of lasers and promotes their performance for various optical and photonic applications. A metalaser is described, in which light can have an arbitrarily shaped wavefront, enabling the metalaser emission to have any desired profile, such as focal spots, focal lines, vector beams, vortex beams and even holograms.",

    "abstract": "Cryptic genetic variants exert minimal phenotypic effects alone but are hypothesized to form a vast reservoir of genetic diversity driving trait evolvability through epistatic interactions1–3. This classical theory has been reinvigorated by pan-genomics, which is revealing pervasive variation within gene families, cis-regulatory regions and regulatory networks4–6. Testing the ability of cryptic variation to fuel phenotypic diversification has been hindered by intractable genetics, limited allelic diversity and inadequate phenotypic resolution. Here, guided by natural and engineered cis-regulatory cryptic variants in a paralogous gene pair, we identified additional redundant trans regulators, establishing a regulatory network controlling tomato inflorescence architecture. By combining coding mutations with cis-regulatory alleles in populations segregating for all four network genes, we generated 216 genotypes spanning a wide spectrum of inflorescence complexity and quantified branching in over 35,000 inflorescences. Analysis of this high-resolution genotype–phenotype map using a hierarchical model of epistasis revealed a layer of dose-dependent interactions within paralogue pairs enhancing branching, culminating in strong, synergistic effects. However, we also identified a layer of antagonism between paralogue pairs, whereby accumulating mutations in one pair progressively diminished the effects of mutations in the other. Our results demonstrate how gene regulatory network architecture and complex dosage effects from paralogue diversification converge to shape phenotypic space, producing the potential for both strongly buffered phenotypes and sudden bursts of phenotypic change.

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, ocean warming and rapid loss of sea ice have dramatically changed the Pacific Arctic marine environment1–3. These changes are predicted to increase harmful algal bloom prevalence and toxicity, as rising temperatures and larger open water areas are more favourable for growth of some toxic algal species4. It is well known that algal toxins are transferred through food webs during blooms and can have negative impacts on wildlife and human health5–7. Yet, there are no long-term quantitative reports on algal toxin presence in Arctic food webs to evaluate increasing exposure risks. In the present study, algal toxins were quantified in bowel samples collected from 205 bowhead whales harvested for subsistence purposes over 19 years. These filter-feeding whales served as integrated food web samplers for algal toxin presence in the Beaufort Sea as it relates to changing environmental conditions over two decades. Algal toxin prevalences and concentrations were significantly correlated with ocean heat flux, open water area, wind velocity and atmospheric pressure. These results provide confirmative oceanic, atmospheric and biological evidence for increasing algal toxin concentrations in Arctic food webs due to warming ocean conditions. This approach elucidates breakthrough mechanistic connections between warming oceans and increasing algal toxin exposure risks to Arctic wildlife, which threatens food security for Native Alaskan communities that have been reliant on marine resources for subsistence for 5,000 years (ref. 8). An analysis of bowel samples from bowhead whales collected yearly from 2004–2022 indicates increasing algal toxin concentrations in Arctic food webs due to warming ocean conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive functions for navigation and memory rely on emergent properties of neural ensembles in the hippocampus, such as activity replay1–5 and theta sequences6–9. However, whether and how these phenomena generalize across species with distinct navigational demands and neurophysiological properties remains unclear. Here we wirelessly recorded neural activity from large populations of cells and local field potentials from the hippocampus of freely flying Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) engaged in free, spontaneous foraging behaviour. During rest, we identified time-compressed forward and reverse replays of multiple flight trajectories coinciding with sharp-wave ripples. Notably, replays occurred predominantly at locations that were both spatially and temporally distant from the replayed behaviour, and their speed scaled with trajectory length, challenging present models of replay mechanisms. During flight, neural ensembles exhibited fast representational sweeps, in which the decoded location moved ahead of the bat’s position cyclically. In contrast to reports in rodents, sweeps occurred in the absence of theta oscillations, and were instead phase locked to a prominent motor behavioural rhythm—the bat’s wing-beat cycle. This suggests that behaviourally relevant sensorimotor rhythms can interact with hippocampal ensemble dynamics in a highly structured manner. Combined, our findings challenge existing models of ensemble dynamics in the mammalian hippocampus, and highlight the importance of comparative studies in ethologically relevant conditions for elucidating brain function. Wireless large-scale recordings of neural activity in freely flying fruit bats reveal that hippocampal ensemble properties are associated with sensorimotor rhythms, and that previous models of replay and sequential dynamics, based on experiments in rodents, might not be applicable to other species.",

    "abstract": "Changing atmospheric circulations shift global weather patterns and their extremes, profoundly affecting human societies and ecosystems. Studies using atmospheric reanalysis and climate model data1–9 indicate diverse circulation changes in recent decades but show discrepancies in magnitude and even direction, underscoring the urgent need for validation with independent, climate-quality measurements3. Here we show statistically significant changes in tropospheric circulation over the past two decades using satellite-observed, height-resolved cloud motion vectors from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR)10,11. Upper tropospheric cloud motion speeds in the mid-latitudes have increased by up to about 4 m s−1 decade−1. This acceleration is primarily because of the strengthening of meridional flow, potentially indicating more poleward storm tracks or intensified extratropical cyclones. The Northern and Southern Hemisphere tropics shifted poleward at rates of 0.42 ± 0.22 and 0.02 ± 0.14° latitude decade−1 (95% confidence interval), respectively, whereas the corresponding polar fronts shifted at rates of 0.37 ± 0.31 and 0.31 ± 0.21° latitude decade−1. We also show that the widely used ERA5 (ref. 12) reanalysis winds subsampled to the MISR are in good agreement with the climatological values and trends of the MISR but indicate probable ERA5 biases in the upper troposphere. These MISR-based observations provide critical benchmarks for refining reanalysis and climate models to advance our understanding of climate change impacts on cloud and atmospheric circulations. Analysis of cloud motion vectors from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer over the past two decades indicates an acceleration and poleward shift of atmospheric circulation, and comparison with ERA5 reanalysis winds suggests probable ERA5 biases in the upper troposphere.",

    "abstract": "Immigrants to high-income countries often face considerable and persistent difficulties in the labour market1–6, whereas their native-born children typically experience economic progress6–9. However, little is known about the extent to which these immigrant–native earnings differences stem from unequal pay when doing the same work for the same employer versus labour market processes that sort immigrants into lower-paid jobs. Here, using data from nine European and North American countries, we show that the segregation of workers with immigrant backgrounds into lower-paying jobs accounts for about three-quarters of overall immigrant–native earnings differences. Although within-job pay inequality remains notable for immigrants in several countries, our results demonstrate that unequal access to higher-paying jobs is the primary driver of the immigrant–native pay gap across a range of institutionally and demographically diverse contexts. These findings highlight the importance of policies aimed at reducing between-job segregation, such as language training10–13, job training13–15, job search assistance programmes13,15, improving access to domestic education13,16,17, recognizing foreign qualifications18,19, and settlement programmes aimed at enhancing access to job-relevant information and networks13,20,21. Policies that target employer bias in hiring and promotion decisions are also likely to be effective, whereas measures aimed at ensuring equal pay for equal work may have more limited scope for further progress in closing the immigrant–native pay gap22–28. Data from nine European and North American countries reveal that the disparity in earnings between immigrants and natives is largely a result of segregation of immigrant workers into lower-paying jobs.",

    "abstract": "Solution-processed light-emitting diodes based on non-toxic copper–iodide hybrids1 are a compelling solution for efficient and stable deep-blue lighting, owing to their tunability, high photoluminescence efficiency and environmental sustainability2. Here we present a hybrid copper–iodide that shows near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (99.6%) with an emission wavelength of 449 nm and colour coordinates (0.147, 0.087), alongside its emission mechanism and charge transport characteristics. We use the thin film of this hybrid as the sole active emissive layer to fabricate deep-blue light-emitting diodes and subsequently enhance the device performance through a dual interfacial hydrogen-bond passivation strategy. This synergetic surface modification approach, integrating a hydrogen-bond-acceptor self-assembled monolayer with an ultrathin polymethyl methacrylate capping layer, effectively passivates both heterojunctions of the copper–iodide hybrid emissive layer and optimizes charge injections. We achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.57%, a maximum luminance of 3,970.30 cd m−2 with colour coordinates (0.147, 0.091) and an excellent operational stability (half-lifetime) of 204 hours under ambient conditions. We further showcase a large-area device of 4 cm2 that maintains high efficiency. Our findings reveal the potential of copper–iodide-based hybrid materials for applications in solid-state lighting3 and display technologies4, offering a versatile strategy for enhancing device performances. A dual interfacial hydrogen-bond passivation strategy and a hybrid copper–iodide are used to fabricate deep-blue light-emitting diodes with excellent external quantum efficiency and lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Birds have a sex chromosome system in which females are heterogametic (ZW) and males are homogametic (ZZ)1. The differentiation of avian sex chromosomes from ancestral autosomes entails the loss of most genes from the W chromosome during evolution1,2. However, the extent to which mechanisms evolved that counterbalance this substantial reduction in female gene dosage remains unclear. Here we report functional in vivo and evolutionary analyses of a Z-linked microRNA (miR-2954) with strong male-biased expression, previously proposed to mediate avian sex chromosome dosage compensation3. We knocked out miR-2954 in chicken, which resulted in early embryonic lethality in homozygous knockout males, probably driven by specific upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked target genes. Evolutionary gene expression analyses further revealed that these dosage-sensitive target genes underwent both transcriptional and translational upregulation on the single Z in female birds. Altogether, this work unveils a scenario in which evolutionary pressures following W gene loss drove transcriptional and translational upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked genes in females but also their transcriptional upregulation in males. The resulting excess of transcripts in males, resulting from the combined activity of two upregulated dosage-sensitive Z gene copies, was in turn offset by the emergence of a highly targeted miR-2954-mediated transcript degradation mechanism during avian evolution. This study uncovered a unique sex chromosome dosage compensation system in birds, in which a microRNA has become essential for male survival. Birds have evolved a unique sex chromosome dosage compensation mechanism involving the male-biased microRNA (miR-2954), which is essential for male survival by regulating the expression of dosage-sensitive Z-linked genes.",

    "abstract": "In microbial communities, viruses compete for host cells and have evolved diverse mechanisms to inhibit competitors. One strategy is superinfection exclusion, whereby an established viral infection prevents a secondary infection of the same cell1. This phenomenon has been shown to have an important role in the spread of eukaryotic viruses. Here we determine that superinfection exclusion proteins in bacterial viruses (bacteriophages, hereafter phages) perform a similar role, promoting viral spread through the bacterial community. We characterize a phage protein that alters the dynamics of a common phage receptor, the type IV pilus. This protein, known as Zip, does not abrogate pilus activity, but fine-tunes it, providing a strong phage defence without a fitness cost. Notably, Zip also prevents internalization and destruction of newly released phage progeny, a phenomenon that we call the anti-Kronos effect after the Greek god who consumed his offspring. Zip activity promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, thereby enhancing viral spread. We further demonstrate that the anti-Kronos effect is conserved across diverse prophage-encoded superinfection exclusion systems. Our results identify the mechanistic basis of a superinfection exclusion system that safeguards phage progeny and provide insights into the conservation of viral defence mechanisms among bacterial and eukaryotic systems. Zip promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, safeguarding phage progeny.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has significantly increased adverse effects on human health, and economic growth1–3. However, few studies have differentiated the impacts of extreme temperatures at the city level, and analysed the future implications for human health under various climate change scenarios.4–6 Here, data on historical relationship among six kinds of climate-sensitive diseases (CSD) hospitalizations and temperatures across 301 cities (over 90% of all cities) and more than 7,000 hospitals in China are leveraged, and a nonlinear distributed lag model is used. This study projects hospitalization risks associated with extreme temperatures through to the year 2100 and develops the Hospitalization Burden Economic Index to assess the burden under three carbon emission scenarios in cities. Five dimensions including spatial distribution, disease categories, population age groups, future time horizons, and carbon emission development pathways have been evaluated. Historical data specifically indicate more temperature-related risks among the CSDs in northwestern and southwestern China. Notably, gestation-related disease risk is associated with increased vulnerability to extreme heat in specific regions. The projections reveal that, under current thermal conditions with no adaptations, the excess hospitalizations from extreme heat will reach 5.1 million people by 2100 under the high emission scenario.These findings highlight the need for targeted climate change mitigation strategies to reduce uneven climate-related hospitalization risks and economic burdens while accounting for differences in city geography, extreme temperatures, population groups and carbon emission development pathways.",

    "abstract": "A pervasive dilemma in brain-wide association studies1 (BWAS) is whether to prioritize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan time or sample size. We derive a theoretical model showing that individual-level phenotypic prediction accuracy increases with sample size and total scan duration (sample size × scan time per participant). The model explains empirical prediction accuracies well across 76 phenotypes from nine resting-fMRI and task-fMRI datasets (R2 = 0.89), spanning diverse scanners, acquisitions, racial groups, disorders and ages. For scans of ≤20 min, accuracy increases linearly with the logarithm of the total scan duration, suggesting that sample size and scan time are initially interchangeable. However, sample size is ultimately more important. Nevertheless, when accounting for the overhead costs of each participant (such as recruitment), longer scans can be substantially cheaper than larger sample size for improving prediction performance. To achieve high prediction performance, 10 min scans are cost inefficient. In most scenarios, the optimal scan time is at least 20 min. On average, 30 min scans are the most cost-effective, yielding 22% savings over 10 min scans. Overshooting the optimal scan time is cheaper than undershooting it, so we recommend a scan time of at least 30 min. Compared with resting-state whole-brain BWAS, the most cost-effective scan time is shorter for task-fMRI and longer for subcortical-to-whole-brain BWAS. In contrast to standard power calculations, our results suggest that jointly optimizing sample size and scan time can boost prediction accuracy while cutting costs. Our empirical reference is available online for future study design (\n              https://thomasyeolab.github.io/OptimalScanTimeCalculator/index.html\n              \n            ). Although the number of participants is important for phenotypic prediction accuracy in brain-wide association studies using functional MRI, scanning for at least 30 min offers the greatest cost effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "The Standard Model of particle physics—the theory of particles and interactions at the smallest scale—predicts that matter and antimatter interact differently due to violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). Charge conjugation transforms particles into their antimatter particles, whereas the parity transformation inverts spatial coordinates. This prediction applies to both mesons, which consist of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are composed of three quarks. However, despite having been discovered in various meson decays, CP violation has yet to be observed in baryons, the type of matter that makes up the observable Universe. Here we report a study of the decay of the beauty baryon \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${\\varLambda }_{0}^{b}$$\n                \n               to the pK−π+π− final state, which proceeds through b → u or b → s quark-level transitions, and its CP-conjugated process, using data collected by the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment1 at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The results reveal significant asymmetries between the decay rates of the \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${\\varLambda }_{0}^{b}$$\n                \n               baryon and its CP-conjugated antibaryon, providing, to our knowledge, the first observation of CP violation in baryon decays and demonstrating the different behaviours of baryons and antibaryons. In the Standard Model, CP violation arises from the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa mechanism2, and new forces or particles beyond the Standard Model could provide further contributions. This discovery opens a new path in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. The LHCb experiment at CERN has observed significant asymmetries between the decay rates of the beauty baryon and its CP-conjugated antibaryon, thus demonstrating CP violation in baryon decays.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of enantiopure compounds is a central focus in organic chemistry owing to the prevalence of chiral centres in biological systems and the impact of homochirality on molecular properties. With growing recognition of electrochemistry as a powerful tool to improve the scope and sustainability of organic synthesis1, increasing efforts have been directed towards developing asymmetric electrocatalytic reactions to access challenging chiral molecules2–4. However, many useful electrochemical reactions rely on direct electrolysis without a catalyst, making them inherently difficult to render enantioselective. Supporting electrolytes are integral to electrochemical systems and, in addition to ensuring sufficient solution conductivity, they can influence the rate and selectivity of electrochemical transformations5. Chiral supporting electrolytes can mediate asymmetric reactions via direct electrolysis, but their use in organic electrosynthesis remains largely unexplored6,7. Here we describe the use of substoichiometric chiral phosphate salts as supporting electrolytes to facilitate the oxidation of racemic trivalent phosphines to afford enantioenriched phosphine oxides. Our approach relies on a dynamic-kinetic-resolution strategy that exploits the rapid pyramidal inversion of an anodically generated phosphoniumyl radical cation8, while a high concentration of chiral phosphate at the electrode–electrolyte interface9,10 enhances enantioselective control during rate-limiting nucleophilic addition. Our results highlight the promise of chiral supporting electrolytes for promoting radical-ion-mediated asymmetric transformations. Using a dynamic-kinetic-resolution strategy and chiral phosphate salts as supporting electrolytes, racemic trivalent phosphines can be oxidized to afford enantioenriched phosphine oxides.",

    "abstract": "Hybridized matter–photon excitations in hyperbolic crystals—anisotropic materials characterized by permittivity tensor components with opposite sign—have attracted substantial attention owing to their strong light–matter interactions in the form of hyperbolic polaritons1–3. However, these phenomena have been restricted to hyperbolic crystals, whose optical responses are confined to fixed spectral regions and lack tunability, thereby limiting their broader applicability4,5. Here we demonstrate the emergence of hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in a non-hyperbolic yttrium vanadate (YVO4) crystal. Using real-space nanoimaging combined with theoretical analyses, we visualize hyperbolic wavefronts of surface phonon polaritons on YVO4 crystal surfaces within its non-hyperbolic frequency range, where the permittivity tensor components of the material have the same negative sign. Furthermore, by varying the temperature from room temperature to cryogenic levels, we realize in situ manipulation of polariton dispersions, enabling a topological transition from hyperbolic to canalization and eventually to the elliptic regime. This temperature-controlled dispersion engineering not only provides precise control over polariton topology but also modulates their wavelength and group velocity, showing remarkable sensitivity alongside low-loss, long-range propagation. These findings extend the realm of hyperbolic nano-optics by removing the reliance on hyperbolic crystals, unlocking opportunities for applications in negative refraction6–10, superlensing11,12, polaritonic chemistry13, integrated photonics14–16 and beyond. Real-space nanoimaging and theoretical analyses show the emergence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons on the surface of a non-hyperbolic material and that the polariton dispersions can be manipulated by varying the temperature.",

    "abstract": "To gain a comprehensive, unbiased perspective on molecular changes in the brain that may underlie the need for sleep, we have characterized the transcriptomes of single cells isolated from rested and sleep-deprived flies. Here we report that transcripts upregulated after sleep deprivation, in sleep-control neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body1,2 (dFBNs) but not ubiquitously in the brain, encode almost exclusively proteins with roles in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. These gene expression changes are accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation, enhanced mitophagy and an increase in the number of contacts between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, creating conduits3,4 for the replenishment of peroxidized lipids5. The morphological changes are reversible after recovery sleep and blunted by the installation of an electron overflow6,7 in the respiratory chain. Inducing or preventing mitochondrial fission or fusion8–13 in dFBNs alters sleep and the electrical properties of sleep-control cells in opposite directions: hyperfused mitochondria increase, whereas fragmented mitochondria decrease, neuronal excitability and sleep. ATP concentrations in dFBNs rise after enforced waking because of diminished ATP consumption during the arousal-mediated inhibition of these neurons14, which augments their mitochondrial electron leak7. Consistent with this view, uncoupling electron flux from ATP synthesis15 relieves the pressure to sleep, while exacerbating mismatches between electron supply and ATP demand (by powering ATP synthesis with a light-driven proton pump16) precipitates sleep. Sleep, like ageing17,18, may be an inescapable consequence of aerobic metabolism. Research on Drosophila neurons shows links between the need to sleep and aerobic metabolism, indicating that the pressure to sleep may have a mitochondrial origin.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic activity of soil microbiomes has a central role in global nutrient cycles1. Understanding how soil metabolic activity responds to climate-driven environmental perturbations is a key challenge2,3. However, the ecological, spatial and chemical complexity of soils4–6 impedes understanding how these communities respond to perturbations. Here we address this complexity by combining dynamic measurements of respiratory nitrate metabolism7 with modelling to reveal functional regimes that define soil responses to environmental change. Measurements across more than 1,500 soil microcosms subjected to pH perturbations8,9 reveal regimes in which distinct mechanisms govern metabolite dynamics. A minimal model with two parameters, biomass activity and growth-limiting nutrient availability, predicts nitrate utilization dynamics across soils and pH perturbations. Parameter shifts under perturbation reveal three functional regimes, each linked to distinct mechanisms: (1) an acidic regime marked by cell death and suppressed metabolism; (2) a nutrient-limited regime in which dominant taxa exploit matrix-released nutrients; and (3) a resurgent growth regime driven by exponential growth of rare taxa in nutrient-rich conditions. We validated these model-derived mechanisms with nutrient measurements, amendment experiments, sequencing and isolate studies. Additional experiments and meta-analyses suggest that functional regimes are widespread in pH-perturbed soils. Experimental perturbation of soil pH leads to a generalizable model of the soil microcosm comprising three functional regimes with distinct mechanisms linking environmental change to metabolite dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Non-antibiotic drugs can alter the composition of the gut microbiome1, but they have largely unknown implications for human health2. Here we examined how non-antibiotics affect the ability of gut commensals to resist colonization by enteropathogens3. We also developed an in vitro assay to assess enteropathogen growth in drug-perturbed microbial communities. Pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria were more resistant to non-antibiotics than commensals and their post-treatment expansion was potentiated. For 28% of the 53 drugs tested, the growth of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. (S. Tm) in synthetic and human stool-derived communities was increased, and similar effects were observed for other enteropathogens. Non-antibiotics promoted pathogen proliferation by inhibiting the growth of commensals, altering microbial interactions and enhancing the ability of S. Tm to exploit metabolic niches. Drugs that promoted pathogen expansion in vitro increased the intestinal S. Tm load in mice. For the antihistamine terfenadine, drug-induced disruption of colonization resistance accelerated disease onset and increased inflammation caused by S. Tm. Our findings identify non-antibiotics as previously overlooked risk factors that may contribute to the development of enteric infections. Non-antibiotic drugs from a wide range of therapeutic classes can alter the ability of gut commensals to resist invasion by enteropathogens, a previously underappreciated side effect of such drugs.",

    "abstract": "Liquids comprising two coexisting phases can form a range of stable and metastable states, including wetting films, droplets and threads1–3. Processes that permit rapid and reversible transformations between these morphologies, however, have been difficult to realize because physical properties required for rapid shape change (for example, low interfacial tension or viscosity) provide pathways for relaxation that result in short-lived states. Fully reversible formation of long-lived microdomain states would expand the palette of properties that can be accessed dynamically using biphasic liquids (for example, tunable optical metamaterials). Here we report the discovery of shape-shifting and bistable microdomains of a biphasic liquid system consisting of an isotropic oil and a liquid crystalline oil. The isotropic oil forms stable wetting films (‘original’ shape) between solid surfaces and an overlying liquid crystal phase, and, when exposed to a transient (<1 s) a.c. electric field at low frequency (10 Hz), transforms into long-lived (>24 h) spherical domains (‘temporary’ shape) stabilized by topological defects in the liquid crystal1,4,5. Subsequent application of an a.c. electric field of high frequency (1 kHz) triggers solitons to form in the liquid crystal6–8, creating kinetic pathways that lead to remarkably rapid (<3 s) coalescence of the dispersed spherical domains and recovery of the original shape (wetting film)1,8,9. We show rapid and reversible switching between distinct optical states of the biphasic system, with each state persisting without continuous application of the field, thus providing a combination of optical properties long sought in thin liquid films10–17. The fully reversible and long-lived emulsion formation reported here appears promising for materials synthesis, microchemical systems and tunable optical metamaterials (for example, to control visibility and transmittance of light through windows)17–21. A liquid-crystal-in-oil emulsion system exhibits bistable opacity or transparency, with rapid switching between the two, faster than, for example, electrochromics that can be found in smart windows.",

    "abstract": "Tumour necrosis is associated with poor prognosis in cancer1,2 and is thought to occur passively when tumour growth outpaces nutrient supply. Here we report, however, that neutrophils actively induce tumour necrosis. In multiple cancer mouse models, we found a tumour-elicited Ly6GHighLy6CLow neutrophil population that was unable to extravasate in response to inflammatory challenges but formed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) more efficiently than classical Ly6GHighLy6CHigh neutrophils. The presence of these ‘vascular-restricted’ neutrophils correlated with the appearance of a ‘pleomorphic’ necrotic architecture in mice. In tumours with pleomorphic necrosis, we found intravascular aggregates of neutrophils and NETs that caused occlusion of the tumour vasculature, driving hypoxia and necrosis of downstream vascular beds. Furthermore, we found that cancer cells adjacent to these necrotic regions (that is, in ‘perinecrotic’ areas) underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, explaining the paradoxical metastasis-enhancing effect of tumour necrosis. Blocking NET formation genetically or pharmacologically reduced the extent of tumour necrosis and lung metastasis. Thus, by showing that NETs drive vascular occlusion, pleomorphic necrosis and metastasis, we demonstrate that tumour necrosis is not necessarily a passive byproduct of tumour growth and that it can be blocked to reduce metastatic spread. Neutrophils actively induce tumour necrosis, driving vascular occlusion, pleomorphic necrosis and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "A lithium (Li)-metal anode paired with a high-nickel cathode is considered to be a combination that holds promise to surpass the 500 Wh kg−1 threshold1,2. Approaching such high energy density, electrolytes capable of stabilizing both anode and cathode interphases are of importance to secure safe and long-term cycling3,4. Although anion-derived inorganic interphases have shown remarkable success at the Li side5–7, developing intrinsic strategies to concurrently protect both electrodes remains a key challenge. Here we report a micro-emulsion strategy for electrolyte design that bypasses the Li+ solvation regulation and produces fluoride-rich interphases for both electrodes. Specifically, liquid–liquid interfacial tension between the micelles and carbonate solvents, rather than the electric field, propels the motion of fluorinated droplets towards the anode and the cathode. In this way, the interphase construction of both electrodes can be enhanced and decoupled from the solvation structure strategy. Through use of the micro-emulsion electrolyte, two pouch full cells with energy densities of 531 Wh kg−1 and 547 Wh kg−1 retain 81% and 79% of their capacity after 189 and 155 cycles, respectively. The introduction of liquid–liquid interfacial tension provides a perspective for interphase regulation and electrolyte design, and paves the way for the development of high-voltage Li-metal batteries. Using an electrolyte micro-emulsion strategy, a lithium anode and high-voltage cathode can be simultaneously stabilized by liquid–liquid interfacial tension to achieve high-energy-density lithium-metal batteries.",

    "abstract": "The miniaturization of transistors is approaching its limits owing to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed1. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics2 are being developed, which make use of the electron’s spin as well as its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study spin-wave propagation at the nanoscale and atomic scale a key challenge3,4. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to investigate spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant length scales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by local features. Here we detect bulk THz magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). By using high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel electron detectors, we overcome the challenges posed by weak signals to map THz magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons and exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks a milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the development of spintronic devices. A method combining scanning transmission electron microscopy with high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy enables the observation of magnons and their dispersion, and provides a way to examine magnetic inhomogeneities with nanometre spatial resolution.",

    "abstract": "The multi-layered nucleolus serves as the primary site of ribosome biogenesis1,2, where successive maturation of small (SSU)3,4 and large (LSU)5 ribosomal subunit precursors occur. However, the spatio-functional relationship between pre-rRNA processing and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to changing cellular physiological demands have remained incompletely understood6,7. Here, our spatiotemporal analyses revealed a compartment-specific ribosomal subunit processing in human nucleoli, with SSU processomes maintained in fibrillar center/dense fibrillar component/periphery dense fibrillar component (FC/DFC/PDFC) domains while LSU pre-rRNAs largely transited to PDFC/granular component (GC) regions. Slow proliferating cells exhibited unexpected 5' external transcribed space (5' ETS)-centered SSU processing impairment, accompanied by FC/DFC structural remodeling and retarded SSU outflux. Direct 5' ETS processing perturbation at least partially recapitulated these FC/DFC alterations, supporting the functional interdependence between SSU processing and nucleolar architecture. Notably, anamniote bipartite nucleoli with merged FC/DFC compartments8,9 exhibited distinct 5' ETS distribution and slower pre-rRNA flux compared to multi-layered nucleoli in amniotes. Introducing a FC/DFC interface to bipartite nucleoli enhanced processing efficiency, indicating that evolutionary emergence of nested FC/DFC may have optimized pre-rRNA processing. Collectively, depicting the spatiotemporal distribution of pre-rRNAs revealed an essential role of 5' ETS-centered SSU processing in maintaining nucleolar substructures and suggested a possible evolutionary advantage of the multi-layered structure in amniotes.",

    "abstract": "Malaria remains a substantial global health challenge, causing approximately half a million deaths each year1. The mosquito fibrinogen-related protein 1 (FREP1) is required for malaria parasites to infect the midgut epithelium2. The naturally occurring FREP1Q allele has been reported to prevent parasite infection, while supporting essential physiological functions in the mosquito3. Here we generate congenic strains of Anopheles stephensi, edited to carry either the parasite-susceptible FREP1L224 or the putative-refractory FREP1Q224 alleles. The FREP1Q224 allele confers robust resistance to infection by both human and rodent malaria parasites, with negligible fitness costs. The protective FREP1Q224 allele can be efficiently driven into FREP1L224 mosquito populations using a novel linked allelic-drive system that selectively replaces the L224 codon with the parasite-refractory Q224 allele, thereby rendering populations refractory to parasite infection. This antimalaria drive system provides a novel genetic approach to aid in malaria elimination efforts. Coupling of a FREP1 variant to a gene-drive system allows the spread of a host malaria resistance allele through the mosquito population.",

    "abstract": "Since the advent of computing, humans have sought computer input technologies that are expressive, intuitive and universal. While diverse modalities have been developed, including keyboards, mice and touchscreens, they require interaction with a device that can be limiting, especially in on-the-go scenarios. Gesture-based systems use cameras or inertial sensors to avoid an intermediary device, but tend to perform well only for unobscured movements. By contrast, brain–computer or neuromotor interfaces that directly interface with the body’s electrical signalling have been imagined to solve the interface problem1, but high-bandwidth communication has been demonstrated only using invasive interfaces with bespoke decoders designed for single individuals2–4. Here, we describe the development of a generic non-invasive neuromotor interface that enables computer input decoded from surface electromyography (sEMG). We developed a highly sensitive, easily donned sEMG wristband and a scalable infrastructure for collecting training data from thousands of consenting participants. Together, these data enabled us to develop generic sEMG decoding models that generalize across people. Test users demonstrate a closed-loop median performance of gesture decoding of 0.66 target acquisitions per second in a continuous navigation task, 0.88 gesture detections per second in a discrete-gesture task and handwriting at 20.9 words per minute. We demonstrate that the decoding performance of handwriting models can be further improved by 16% by personalizing sEMG decoding models. To our knowledge, this is the first high-bandwidth neuromotor interface with performant out-of-the-box generalization across people. A high-bandwidth neuromotor interface offers performant out-of-the-box generalization across people.",

    "abstract": "Achieving long-term underwater adhesion to dynamic, regenerating soft substrates that undergo extreme fluctuations in pH and moisture remains a major unresolved challenge, with far-reaching implications for healthcare, manufacturing, robotics and marine applications1–16. Here, inspired by remoras—fish equipped with specialized adhesive discs—we developed the Mechanical Underwater Soft Adhesion System (MUSAS). Through detailed anatomical, behavioural, physical and biomimetic investigations of remora adhesion on soft substrates, we uncovered the key physical principles and evolutionary adaptations underlying their robust attachment. These insights guided the design of MUSAS, which shows extraordinary versatility, adhering securely to a wide range of soft substrates with varying roughness, stiffness and structural integrity. MUSAS achieves an adhesion-force-to-weight ratio of up to 1,391-fold and maintains performance under extreme pH and moisture conditions. We demonstrate its utility across highly translational models, including in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo settings, enabling applications such as ultraminiaturized aquatic kinetic temperature sensors, non-invasive gastroesophageal reflux monitoring, long-acting antiretroviral drug delivery and messenger RNA administration via the gastrointestinal tract. A remora-inspired mechanical underwater adhesive device adheres securely to a range of soft substrates and maintains performance under extreme pH and moisture conditions, with potential applications in biosensing and drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Many animals use vision to navigate their environment. The pattern of changes that self-motion induces in the visual scene, referred to as optic flow1, is first estimated in local patches by directionally selective neurons2–4. However, how arrays of directionally selective neurons, each responsive to motion in a preferred direction at specific retinal positions, are organized to support robust decoding of optic flow by downstream circuits is unclear. Understanding this global organization requires mapping fine, local features of neurons across an animal’s field of view3. In Drosophila, the asymmetrical dendrites of the T4 and T5 directionally selective neurons establish their preferred direction, which makes it possible to predict directional tuning from anatomy4,5. Here we show that the organization of the compound eye shapes the systematic variation in the preferred directions of directionally selective neurons across the entire visual field. To estimate the preferred directions across the visual field, we reconstructed hundreds of T4 neurons in an electron-microscopy volume of the full adult fly brain6, and discovered unexpectedly stereotypical dendritic arborizations. We then used whole-head micro-computed-tomography scans to map the viewing directions of all compound eye facets, and found a non-uniform sampling of visual space that explains the spatial variation in preferred directions. Our findings show that the global organization of the directionally selective neurons’ preferred directions is determined mainly by the fly’s compound eye, revealing the intimate connections between eye structure, functional properties of neurons and locomotion control. In Drosophila, the physical structure of the eye has a key role in the directional tuning of motion-sensitive neurons, showing how navigational behaviour is tightly associated with anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Although the role of cellular immunity in checkpoint immunotherapy (CPI) for cancer is well established1,2, the effect of antibody-mediated humoral immunity is comparably underexplored. Here we used rapid extracellular antigen profiling3 to map the autoantibody reactome within a cohort of 374 patients with cancer treated with CPIs and 131 healthy control participants for autoantibodies to 6,172 extracellular and secreted proteins (the ‘exoproteome’). Globally, patients with cancer treated with CPIs had diverse autoreactivities that were elevated relative to control individuals but changed minimally with treatment. Autoantibody signatures in patients treated with CPI strikingly distinguished them from healthy individuals. Although associations of specific autoantibodies with immune-related adverse events were sparse, we detected numerous individual autoantibodies that were associated with greatly altered odds ratios for response to therapy. These included autoantibodies to immunomodulatory proteins, such as cytokines, growth factors and immunoreceptors, as well as tumour surface proteins. Functional evaluation of several autoantibody responses indicated that they neutralized the activity of their target proteins, which included type I interferons (IFN-I), IL-6, OSM, TL1A, and BMPR1A and BMPR2. Modelling the effects of autoantibodies to IFN-I and TL1A in preclinical mouse tumour models resulted in enhanced CPI efficacy, consistent with their effects in patients. In conclusion, these findings indicate that autoantibodies to the exoproteome modify CPI responses and highlight therapeutically actionable pathways that can be exploited to augment immunotherapy. Rapid extracellular antibody profiling reveals a contribution of autoantibodies to the effectiveness of checkpoint immunotherapy for cancer.",

However, whether such ‘representational drift’ serves an intrinsic function, such as distinguishing similar experiences that occur at different times3,4, or is instead observed due to subtle differences in the sensory environment or behaviour5–7, remains unresolved. Here we used the experimental control offered by a multisensory virtual reality system to determine that differences in sensory environment or behaviour do not detectably change drift rate. We also found that the excitability of individual place cells was most predictive of their representational drift over subsequent days, with more excitable cells exhibiting less drift. These findings establish that representational drift occurs in mice even with highly reproducible environments and behaviour and highlight neuronal excitability as a key factor of long-term representational stability. Tracking of individual place cells in mouse CA1 shows that representational drift is not influenced by changes in environment or behaviour, and is lower for more excitable place cells.",

Here, using spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigate the role of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, NNMT-induced H3K27me3 hypomethylation drives complement secretion from CAFs, attracting immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumour. Nnmt knockout in immunocompetent mice impairs tumour growth in syngeneic ovarian, breast and colon tumour models through enhanced CD8+ T cell activation. Using high-throughput screening, we develop a potent and specific NNMT inhibitor that reduces the tumour burden and metastasis in multiple mouse cancer models and restores immune checkpoint blockade efficacy by decreasing CAF-mediated recruitment of MDSCs and reinvigorating CD8+ T cell activation. Our findings establish NNMT as a central CAF regulator and a promising therapeutic target to mitigate immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment. An NNMT inhibitor reduces tumour burden and metastasis in multiple mouse cancer models and restores immune checkpoint blockade efficacy by decreasing cancer-associated-fibroblast-mediated recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and reinvigorating CD8+ T cell activation.",

    "abstract": "Salicylic acid (SA) is the active ingredient in willow bark that has been used for anti-inflammation and pain relief for centuries. Aspirin, a derivative of SA, is the most widely used medication in human history. SA also acts as a key plant defence hormone1–4. Although SA was known to be produced from chorismate in the model plant Arabidopsis5,6, how it is biosynthesized in plant families outside Brassicaceae remains unclear. Here we report the identification of a conserved pathway for SA biosynthesis in seed plants. Using Nicotiana benthamiana as a model, we identified three key steps for the biosynthesis of SA. First, ligation of benzoyl coenzyme A (CoA) and benzyl alcohol by benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyl transferase (BEBT) gives rise to benzyl benzoate, which is then hydroxylated by benzyl benzoate oxidase (BBO) to produce benzyl salicylate. Subsequent cleavage of benzyl salicylate by benzyl salicylate hydrolase (BSH) yields SA. Notably, genes encoding these three enzymes are present in a broad range of plants, and the genes from dicots such as willow, poplar and soybean as well as the monocot rice can complement the phenotype of SA-deficient mutants of N. benthamiana. Moreover, knockout analysis of the Oryza sativa OsBEBT, OsBBO and OsBSH genes reveals that they are required for SA biosynthesis in rice. Our findings suggest that the SA biosynthesis pathway is highly conserved in plants. The salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis pathway—involving ligation of benzoyl coenzyme A and benzyl alcohol to give benzyl benzoate; hydroxylation of benzyl benzoate to give benzyl salicylate; and cleavage of benzyl salicylate to give SA—is highly conserved in plants.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for efficient and innovative therapies to treat brain disorders such as psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Immunotherapies have proved to be efficient in many medical areas, but have not been considered to treat brain diseases due to the poor brain penetration of immunoglobulins1,2. Here we developed a bivalent biparatopic antibody, made of two camelid heavy-chain antibodies (called nanobodies)3, one binding to, and the other potentiating the activity of, homodimeric metabotropic glutamate receptor 2. We show that this bivalent nanobody, given peripherally, reaches the brain and corrects cognitive deficits in two preclinical mouse models with endophenotypes resulting from NMDA receptor hypofunction. Notably, these in vivo effects last for at least 7 days after a single intraperitoneal injection and are maintained after subchronic treatment. Our results establish a proof of concept that nanobodies can target brain receptors, and pave the way for nanobody-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of brain disorders. A bivalent biparatopic nanobody penetrates the brain, binds to and potentiates the activity of homodimeric metabotropic glutamate receptor 2, correcting cognitive deficits in two preclinical mouse models with endophenotypes resulting from NMDA receptor hypofunction.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies have identified thousands of individual disease-associated non-coding alleles, but the identification of the causal alleles and their functions remains a critical bottleneck1. CRISPR–Cas editing has enabled targeted modification of DNA to introduce and test disease alleles. However, the combination of inefficient editing, heterogeneous editing outcomes in individual cells and nonspecific transcriptional changes caused by editing and culturing conditions limits the ability to detect the functional consequences of disease alleles2,3. To overcome these challenges, we present a multi-omic single-cell sequencing approach that directly identifies genomic DNA edits, assays the transcriptome and measures cell-surface protein expression. We apply this approach to investigate the effects of gene disruption, deletions in regulatory regions, non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles and multiplexed editing. We identify the effects of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including the state-specific effects of an IL2RA autoimmune variant in primary human T cells. Multimodal functional genomic single-cell assays, including DNA sequencing, enable the identification of causal variation in primary human cells and bridge a crucial gap in our understanding of complex human diseases. A plate-based assay called CRAFTseq has been developed that uses ‘multi-omic’ single-cell RNA sequencing and direct genotyping of CRISPR edits to test the functional effects of genetic variants on cell state and function.",

    "abstract": "Evading imminent threat from predators is critical for animal survival. Effective defensive strategies can vary, even between closely related species. However, the neural basis of such species-specific behaviours remains poorly understood1–4. Here we find that two sister species of deer mice (genus Peromyscus)5 show different responses to the same looming stimulus: Peromyscus maniculatus, which occupies densely vegetated habitats, predominantly escapes, whereas the open field specialist, Peromyscus polionotus, briefly freezes. This difference arises from species-specific escape thresholds, is largely context-independent, and can be triggered by both visual and auditory threat stimuli. Using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological recordings, we find that although visual threat activates the superior colliculus in both species, the role of the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG) in driving behaviour differs. Whereas dPAG activity scales with running speed in P. maniculatus, neural activity in the dPAG of P. polionotus correlates poorly with movement, including during visually triggered escape. Moreover, optogenetic activation of dPAG neurons elicits acceleration in P. maniculatus but not in P. polionotus, and their chemogenetic inhibition during a looming stimulus delays escape onset in P. maniculatus to match that of P. polionotus. Together, we trace species-specific escape thresholds to a central circuit node, downstream of peripheral sensory neurons, localizing an ecologically relevant behavioural difference to a specific region of the mammalian brain. Visual threat triggers contrasting freeze and escape defensive responses in two species of deer mice as a result of different activation thresholds downstream of the superior colliculus in the dorsal periaqueductal grey.",

    "abstract": "Coherent quantum transition spectroscopy is a powerful tool in metrology1, quantum information processing2, magnetometry3 and precision tests of the standard model4. It was applied with great success in proton and deuteron magnetic moment measurements5, which culminated in maser spectroscopy with sub-parts-per-trillion resolution6 and many other experiments at the forefront of physics7. All of these experiments were performed on macroscopic ensembles of particles, whereas the coherent spectroscopy of a ‘free’ single nuclear spin has, to our knowledge, never been reported before. Here we demonstrate coherent quantum transition spectroscopy of the spin of a single antiproton stored in a cryogenic Penning-trap system. We apply a multi-trap technique8, detect the antiproton spin state using the continuous Stern–Gerlach effect9 and transport the particle to the homogeneous magnetic field of a precision trap (PT). Here we induce the coherent dynamics and analyse the result by quantum-projection measurements in the analysis trap (AT)10. We observe, for the first time, Rabi oscillations of an antiproton spin and achieve in time-series measurements spin-inversion probabilities greater than 80% at spin coherence times of about 50 s. Scans of single-particle spin resonances show inversions greater than 70%, at transition linewidths 16 times narrower than in previous measurements8, limited by cyclotron frequency measurement decoherence. This achievement marks a notable step towards at least tenfold improved tests of matter/antimatter symmetry using proton and antiproton magnetic moments. Coherent quantum transition spectroscopy of the spin of a single antiproton is reported, demonstrating Rabi oscillations of the spin and enabling improved measurement of matter/antimatter symmetry using proton and antiproton magnetic moments.",

    "abstract": "Our knowledge of biogeographic patterns and processes in the deep sea has been limited by the lack of integrated datasets that cover its vast extent1. Here we analyse a new global dataset of genomic DNA sequences, spanning an entire taxonomic class of benthic invertebrates (Ophiuroidea), to obtain a broad understanding of phylogenetic divergence and biotic movement across all oceans, from coastal margins down to the abyssal plains. We show that regional faunas on the continental shelf are phylogenetically divergent, particularly at temperate and tropical latitudes. By contrast, assemblages in the deep sea are much more connected. Many temperate deep-sea lineages have achieved distribution ranges across the planet, including over the Quaternary period. A close relationship exists between deep-sea faunas of the northern Atlantic and, on the opposite side of the globe, southern Australia. Bathymetric interchange is not only reliant on vertical migration through isothermal polar waters but also occurs across the thermal depth gradients of tropical regions. The connected nature of deep-sea life should be an important consideration in marine conservation assessments. We analyse a global dataset of genomic DNA sequences for Ophiuroidea to gain an understanding of phylogenetic divergence and biotic movement across oceans, finding phylogentically divergent faunas at shelf depths but greater connectivity of species at deep-sea depths.",

    "abstract": "Science frequently benefits from teams of interdisciplinary researchers1–3, but many scientists do not have easy access to experts from multiple fields4,5. While large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains, their uses have been largely limited to answering specific scientific questions rather than performing open-ended research6–11. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM scientist agents through a series of research meetings, with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We apply the Virtual Lab to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants12,13 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation. This demonstrates how the Virtual Lab can rapidly make an impactful, real-world scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "Hadal trenches, some of the Earth’s least explored and understood environments, have long been proposed to harbour chemosynthesis-based communities1,2. Despite increasing attention, actual documentation of such communities has been exceptionally rare3,4. Here we report the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth during an expedition to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench and the western Aleutian Trench using the manned submersible Fendouzhe. The communities dominated by siboglinid Polychaeta and Bivalvia span a distance of 2,500 km at depths from 5,800 m to 9,533 m. These communities are sustained by hydrogen sulfide-rich and methane-rich fluids that are transported along faults traversing deep sediment layers in trenches, where methane is produced microbially from deposited organic matter, as indicated by isotopic analysis. Given geological similarities with other hadal trenches, such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated. These findings challenge current models of life at extreme limits and carbon cycling in the deep ocean. The discovery of chemosynthesis-based benthic communities at depths of 5,800 m to 9,533 m in the Kuril–Kamchatka and western Aleutian trenches challenges traditional perspectives on the energy sources sustaining hadal fauna.",

    "abstract": "The periodic table provides an intuitive framework for understanding chemical properties. However, its traditional patterns may break down for the heaviest elements occupying the bottom of the chart. The large nuclei of actinides (Z > 88) and superheavy elements (Z ≥ 104) give rise to relativistic effects that are expected to substantially alter their chemical behaviours, potentially indicating that we have reached the end of a predictive periodic table1. Relativistic effects have already been cited for the unusual chemistry of the actinides compared with those of their lanthanide counterparts2. Unfortunately, it is difficult to understand the full impact of relativistic effects, as research on the later actinides and superheavy elements is scarce. Beyond fermium (Z = 100), elements need to be produced and studied one atom at a time, using accelerated ion beams and state-of-the-art experimental approaches. So far, no experiments have been capable of directly identifying produced molecular species. Here ions of actinium (Ac, Z = 89) and nobelium (No, Z = 102) were synthesized through nuclear reactions at the 88-Inch Cyclotron facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and then exposed to trace amounts of H2O and N2. The produced molecular species were directly identified by measuring their mass-to-charge ratios using FIONA (For the Identification Of Nuclide A)3. These results mark the first, to our knowledge, direct identification of heavy-element molecular species using an atom-at-a-time technique and highlight the importance of such identifications in future superheavy-element chemistry experiments to deepen understanding of their chemical properties. Mass number measurements of the molecular species produced when ions of actinium (Ac) and nobelium (No) are exposed to trace amounts of H2O and N2 demonstrate direct species identification using an atom-at-a-time technique for heavy elements.",

    "abstract": "The dispersal of archaic hominins beyond mainland Southeast Asia (Sunda)1 represents the earliest evidence for humans crossing ocean barriers to reach isolated landmasses2–4. Previously, the oldest indication of hominins in Wallacea, the oceanic island zone east of Sunda, comprised flaked stone artefacts deposited at least 1.02 ± 0.02 million years ago (Ma) at Wolo Sege on Flores5. Early hominins were also established on the oceanic island of Luzon (Philippines), as indicated by both stone artefacts and cut marks on faunal remains dating to between 777 and 631 thousand years ago (ka) at Kalinga6. Moreover, fossils of extinct, small-bodied hominins occur on Flores (Homo floresiensis)7–12 and Luzon (Homo luzonensis)13. On Sulawesi, the largest Wallacean island, previous excavations revealed stone artefacts with a minimum age of 194 ka at the open site of Talepu in the Walanae Depression14, long preceding the earliest known presence of modern humans (Homo sapiens) in the region (73–63 ka in Sunda)15. Here we show that stone artefacts also occur at the nearby site of Calio in fossiliferous layers dated to at least 1.04 Ma and possibly up to 1.48 Ma, using palaeomagnetic dating of sedimentary rocks and coupled Uranium-series (U-series) and electron-spin resonance (US–ESR) dating of fossil teeth. The discovery of Early Pleistocene artefacts at Calio suggests that Sulawesi was populated by hominins at around the same time as Flores, if not earlier. Early Pleistocene artefacts at Calio suggest that Sulawesi was populated by hominins at around the same time as Flores, if not earlier.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is central to the localization and function of biomolecules1. We recently discovered that small RNAs undergo N-glycosylation2 at the modified RNA base 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) uridine (acp3U)3. However, the functional significance of N-glycosylation of RNAs is unknown. Here we show that the N-glycans on glycoRNAs prevent innate immune sensing of endogenous small RNAs. We found that de-N-glycosylation of cell-culture-derived and circulating human and mouse glycoRNA elicited potent inflammatory responses including the production of type I interferons in a Toll-like receptor 3- and Toll-like receptor 7-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that N-glycans on cell surface RNAs prevent apoptotic cells from triggering endosomal RNA sensors in efferocytes, thus facilitating the non-inflammatory clearance of dead cells. Mechanistically, N-glycans conceal the hypermodified uracil base acp3U, which we identified as immunostimulatory when exposed in RNA. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of an enzyme (DTWD2) that synthesizes acp3U abrogated innate immune activation by de-N-glycosylated small RNAs and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, synthetic acp3U-containing RNAs are sufficient to trigger innate immune responses. Thus, our study has uncovered a natural mechanism by which N-glycans block RNAs from inducing acp3U-dependent innate immune activation, demonstrating how glycoRNAs exist on the cell surface and in the endosomal network without inducing autoinflammatory responses. N-glycans on glycoRNAs prevent innate immune sensing of endogenous small RNAs, and the natural mechanism they use demonstrates how glycoRNAs exist on the cell surface and in the endosomal network without inducing autoinflammatory responses.",

    "abstract": "As tissue resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, microglia perform diverse essential functions during homeostasis and perturbations1. They primarily interact with neurons via synaptic engulfment and through the rapid elimination of apoptotic cells and nonfunctional synapses2. Here, by combining unbiased lipidomics and high resolution spatial lipid imaging, deep single-cell transcriptome analysis and novel cell type-specific mutants, we identified a previously unknown mode of microglial interaction with neurons. During homeostasis, microglia deliver the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase (Hex) to neurons for the degradation of the ganglioside GM2 that is integral to maintaining cell membrane organization and function. Absence of Hexb, encoding the β subunit of Hex, in both mice and patients suffering from neurodegenerative Sandhoff disease leads to a massive accumulation of GM2 derivatives in a characteristic spatiotemporal manner3. In mice, neuronal GM2 gangliosides subsequently engage the macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL)2 receptor on microglia via N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, leading to lethal neurodegeneration. Notably, replacement of microglia with peripherally derived microglia-like cells (MLCs) is able to break this degenerative cycle and fully restore CNS homeostasis. Our results reveal a novel mode of bidirectional microglia-neuron communication centred around GM2 ganglioside turnover, identify a novel microgliopathy and offer novel therapeutic avenues for these maladies.",

    "abstract": "The aridity index is widely used to indicate water availability on land. Balancing climatic water supply (precipitation, P) against demand (potential evapotranspiration, PET), it is often expressed as the P/PET ratio1 or humidity index. Water also flows laterally by rivers and groundwater, from hills to valleys and from mountains to plains, subsidizing the receiving lowlands2. Here, we show that this lateral subsidy reduces aridity in the receiving lowlands. We first estimate monthly subsidies (Qlat) by surface and groundwater at 30″ global grids with a global hydrology model. We then calculate the conventional global humidity index (GHI) as P/PET and a new GHI including Qlat as (P + Qlat)/PET. Termed GHI_topo, the latter reflects land topography, higher in hydrologically convergent lowlands. It also exhibits a delayed and dampened seasonality (relative to P) owing to delayed and diffused Qlat arrival at the receiving lowlands. Such spatiotemporal features of Qlat, arising from both the climate and the terrain, make GHI_topo a more realistic indicator of local water availability in downgradient societies and ecosystems, enabling life in arid locations and times. Global land area with GHI_topo ≥ 1 (supply meets or exceeds demand) is 33% greater than GHI ≥ 1 and far higher in arid and season-arid climates. Estimating lateral subsidies by river and groundwater using a global hydrology model and incorporating them into the conventional global humidity index reduces aridity in the receiving lowlands and better explains ecosystem patterns.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological data have identified Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection as the main environmental risk factor for multiple sclerosis, the predominant autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS)1. However, how EBV infection initiates multiple sclerosis pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that EBV expands oligoclonal T-bet+CXCR3+ B cells that home to the CNS in humanized mice. Effector memory CD8+ T cells and CD4+ TH1 cells as well as CD4+ TH17 cells co-migrate to the brain of EBV-infected humanized mice. T-bet+CXCR3+ B cells can colonize submeningeal brain regions in the absence of other lymphocytes and attract T cells. Depletion of B cells with rituximab or blocking of CXCR3 significantly decreases lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS. Thus, we suggest that symptomatic primary EBV infection generates B cell subsets that gain access to the CNS, attract T cells and thereby initiate multiple sclerosis. Epstein–Barr virus infection generates a neuroinvasive B cell subset, which recruits activated T cells to the central nervous system, promoting multiple sclerosis.",

We demonstrate that a single tree hosts approximately one trillion bacteria in its woody tissues, with microbial communities distinctly partitioned between heartwood and sapwood, each maintaining unique microbiomes with minimal similarity to other plant tissues or ecosystem components. The heartwood microbiome emerges as a particularly unique ecological niche, distinguished by specialized archaea and anaerobic bacteria driving consequential biogeochemical processes. Our findings support the concept of plants as ‘holobionts’3,4—integrated ecological units of host and associated microorganisms—with implications for tree health, disease and functionality. By characterizing the composition, structure and functions of tree internal microbiomes, our work opens up pathways for understanding tree physiology and forest ecology and establishes a new frontier in environmental microbiology. Microbiome analyses of living trees show that a single tree can host approximately one trillion bacteria, with microbial communities distinctly partitioned between heartwood and sapwood and with minimal similarity to other tissues or ecosystem components.",

    "abstract": "Action potentials are generated by opening of voltage-activated sodium (Nav) and potassium (Kv) channels1, which can rapidly inactivate to shape the nerve impulse and contribute to synaptic facilitation and short-term memory1–4. The mechanism of fast inactivation was proposed to involve an intracellular domain that blocks the internal pore in both Nav5,6 and Kv7–9 channels; however, recent studies in Nav10,11 and Kv12,13 channels support a mechanism in which the internal pore closes during inactivation. Here we investigate the mechanism of fast inactivation in the Shaker Kv channel using cryo-electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and electrophysiology. We resolved structures of a fully inactivated state in which the non-polar end of the N terminus plugs the internal pore in an extended conformation. The N-terminal methionine is deleted, leaving an alanine that is acetylated and interacts with a pore-lining isoleucine residue where RNA editing regulates fast inactivation14. Opening of the internal activation gate is required for fast inactivation because it enables the plug domain to block the pore and repositions gate residues to interact with and stabilize that domain. We also show that external K+ destabilizes the inactivated state by altering the conformation of the ion selectivity filter rather than by electrostatic repulsion. These findings establish the mechanism of fast inactivation in Kv channels, revealing how it is regulated by RNA editing and N-terminal acetylation, and providing a framework for understanding related mechanisms in other voltage-activated channels. This paper explores how voltage-gated potassium channels can plug the pore to prevent the conductance of ions during inactivation.",

    "abstract": "GABAergic neurons are essential cellular components of neural circuits. Their abundance and diversity have increased significantly in the human brain, contributing to the expanded cognitive capacity of humans1. However, the developmental mechanism underlying the extended production of GABAergic neurons in the human brain remains elusive. Here we uncovered the microglial regulation of the sustained proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and neuroblasts in the human medial ganglionic eminence (hMGE). We showed that microglia are preferentially distributed in the proliferating zone and identified insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor IGR1R as the predicted top ligand–receptor pair underlying microglia–progenitor communication in the prenatal hMGE. Using our newly developed neuroimmune hMGE organoids, which mimic the hMGE cytoarchitecture and developmental trajectory, we demonstrated that microglia-derived IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation and production of GABAergic neurons. Conversely, IGF1-neutralizing antibodies and IGF1 knockout human embryonic stem-cell-induced microglia abolish the induced microglia-mediated progenitor proliferation. Together, these findings revealed a previously unappreciated role of microglia-derived IGF1 in promoting the proliferation of neural progenitors and the development of GABAergic neurons in the human brain. Microglia-derived IGF1 promotes the proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and neuroblasts in the human medial ganglionic eminence, contributing to the extended production of GABAergic neurons and an expanded cognitive capacity in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Animals have developed many different solutions to survive, and these abilities are inspiring technological innovations in a wide range of fields including robotics1–3. However, biologically inspired robots, especially those mimicking octopus locomotion4,5, are based on limited in situ behavioural data owing to the complexity of collecting quantitative observations. Here we describe deployments of a remotely operated vehicle, equipped with a suite of imaging systems, to study the mechanics of locomotion in the octopus Muusoctopus robustus at the recently discovered 3,000-m deep Octopus Garden. Using a recently developed light-field imaging system called EyeRIS and an ultra-high-definition science camera, we were able to capture wide and zoomed-in views to characterize whole-animal gaits in a completely unconstrained environment across multiple individuals. Furthermore, the real-time volumetric data captured using EyeRIS yielded quantitative kinematics measurements of individual octopus arms during crawling, showing regions of high curvature and strain concentrated at distinct arm locations. Our results indicate that M. robustus crawling patterns showed several elements of simplified control, with implications for the design of future octopus-inspired robots. Further developments and deployments of technologies such as EyeRIS, coupled with capable robotic vehicles, will enable mining of the deep ocean for biological inspiration. Using an advanced imaging system called EyeRIS, locomotion in deep-sea octopuses could be studied, revealing simplified crawling patterns that could inspire the design of robots.",

    "abstract": "Exoplanets are organized in a broad array of orbital configurations1,2 that reflect their formation along with billions of years of dynamical processing through gravitational interactions3. This history is encoded in the angular momentum architecture of planetary systems—the relation between the rotational properties of the central star and the orbital geometry of planets. A primary observable is the alignment (or misalignment) between the rotational axis of the star and the orbital plane of its planets, known as stellar obliquity. Hundreds of spin–orbit constraints have been measured for giant planets close to their host stars4, many of which have revealed planets on misaligned orbits. A leading question that has emerged is whether stellar obliquity originates primarily from gravitational interactions with other planets or distant stars in the same system, or if it is ‘primordial’—imprinted during the star-formation process. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of primordial obliquities between the spin axes of young, isolated Sun-like stars and the orientation of the outer regions of their protoplanetary disks. Most systems are consistent with angular momentum alignment but about one-third of isolated young systems exhibit primordial misalignment. This suggests that some obliquities identified in planetary systems at older ages—including the Sun’s modest misalignment with planets in the Solar System—could originate from initial conditions of their formation. Assessment of the stellar obliquities of a sample of resolved protoplanetary disk systems indicates that one-third of Sun-like stars are born with misaligned planet-forming disks, suggesting that the origin of star–planet configurations, including many misaligned planetary orbits, may be primordial.",

Here we report on whole-genome sequencing of 490,640 UK Biobank participants, building on previous genotyping effort1. This advance deepens our understanding of how genetics associates with disease biology and further enhances the value of this open resource for the study of human biology and health. Coupling this dataset with rich phenotypic data, we surveyed within- and cross-ancestry genomic associations and identified novel genetic and clinical insights. Although most associations with disease traits were primarily observed in individuals of European ancestries, strong or novel signals were also identified in individuals of African and Asian ancestries. With the improved ability to accurately genotype structural variants and exonic variation in both coding and UTR sequences, we strengthened and revealed novel insights relative to whole-exome sequencing2,3 analyses. This dataset, representing a large collection of whole-genome sequencing data that is available to the UK Biobank research community, will enable advances of our understanding of the human genome, facilitate the discovery of diagnostics and therapeutics with higher efficacy and improved safety profile, and enable precision medicine strategies with the potential to improve global health. A study reports whole-genome sequences for 490,640 participants from the UK Biobank and combines these data with phenotypic data to provide new insights into the relationship between human variation and sequence variation.",

    "abstract": "NSD2 catalyses the epigenetic modification H3K36me2 (refs. 1,2) and is a candidate convergent downstream effector of oncogenic signalling in diverse malignancies3–5. However, it remains unclear whether the enzymatic activity of NSD2 is therapeutically targetable. Here we characterize a series of clinical-grade small-molecule catalytic NSD2 inhibitors (NSD2i) and show that the pharmacological targeting of NSD2 constitutes an epigenetic dependency with broad therapeutic efficacy in KRAS-driven preclinical cancer models. NSD2i inhibits NSD2 with single-digit nanomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration potency and high selectivity over related methyltransferases. Structural analyses reveal that the specificity of NSD2i for NSD2 is due to competitive binding with S-adenosylmethionine and catalytic disruption through a binary-channel obstruction mechanism. Proteo-epigenomic and single-cell strategies in pancreatic and lung cancer models support a mechanism in which sustained NSD2i exposure reverses pathological H3K36me2-driven chromatin plasticity, re-establishing silencing at H3K27me3-legacy loci to curtail oncogenic gene expression programs. Accordingly, NSD2i impairs the viability of pancreatic and lung cancer cells and the growth of patient-derived xenograft tumours. Furthermore, NSD2i, which is well-tolerated in vivo, prolongs survival in advanced-stage autochthonous KRASG12C-driven pancreatic and lung tumours in mouse models to a comparable level as KRAS inhibition with sotorasib6. In these models, treatment with both a NSD2 inhibitor and sotorasib synergize to confer sustained survival with extensive tumour regression and elimination. Together, our work uncovers targeting of the NSD2–H3K36me2 axis as an actionable vulnerability in difficult to treat cancers and provides support for the evaluation of NSD2 and KRAS inhibitor combination therapies in a clinical setting. A highly potent and selective small-molecule catalytic inhibitor of the protein lysine methyltransferase NSD2 shows therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer and lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "The enantioselective construction of small ring carbocycles provides organic chemists with an enduring challenge.1 Despite their commercial importance, enantioselective synthetic routes towards alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs), a class of small ring carbocycles, remain underdeveloped.2,3 Importantly, ACPs can be converted into cyclopropanes, a common feature in drug molecules (e.g. Nirmatrelvir, 1),4 as well as both naturally occurring and synthetic agrochemicals (e.q. permethrin 2).5,6 We now describe the facile synthesis of highly enantioenriched alkylidenecyclopropanes through the use of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalysed, stereo-controlled, strain-relieving deconjugation. Small modifications to the basic catalyst system were used to broaden the scope of the reaction to substrates containing ester, amide, phosphine oxide, and ketone functionalities. Through the design of a suitable substrate and re-tuning of the catalyst’s iminophosphorane moiety, the transformation was effectively applied to the synthesis of a single stereoisomer of the commonplace insecticide permethrin as well as a range of cyclopropane-based insecticide cores. State-of-the-art computational studies were performed to provide detailed insight into the mechanistic pathway and origin of both diastereo- and enantioselectivities.",

    "abstract": "T cells respond to cytokines through receptor dimers that have been selected over the course of evolution to activate canonical JAK–STAT signalling and gene expression programs1. However, the potential combinatorial diversity of JAK–STAT receptor pairings can be expanded by exploring the untapped biology of alternative non-natural pairings. Here we exploited the common γ chain (γc) receptor as a shared signalling hub on T cells and enforced the expression of both natural and non-natural heterodimeric JAK–STAT receptor pairings using an orthogonal cytokine receptor platform2–4 to expand the γc signalling code. We tested receptors from γc cytokines as well as interferon, IL-10 and homodimeric receptor families that do not normally pair with γc or are not naturally expressed on T cells. These receptors simulated their natural counterparts but also induced contextually unique transcriptional programs. This led to distinct T cell fates in tumours, including myeloid-like T cells with phagocytic capacity driven by orthogonal GSCFR (oGCSFR), and type 2 cytotoxic T (TC2) and helper T (TH2) cell differentiation driven by orthogonal IL-4R (o4R). T cells with orthogonal IL-22R (o22R) and oGCSFR, neither of which are natively expressed on T cells, exhibited stem-like and exhaustion-resistant transcriptional and chromatin landscapes, enhancing anti-tumour properties. Non-native receptor pairings and their resultant JAK–STAT signals open a path to diversifying T cell states beyond those induced by natural cytokines. Orthogonal chimeric receptors containing intracellular domains for IL-4R, IL-20R, IL-22R and GCSFR reprogram T cells to promote distinct natural and synthetic cell states with functional and therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Unravelling how genomes are spatially organized and how their three-dimensional (3D) architecture drives cellular functions remains a major challenge in biology1,2. In bacteria, genomic DNA is compacted into a highly ordered, condensed state called nucleoid3–5. Despite progress in characterizing bacterial 3D genome architecture over recent decades6–8, the fine structure and functional organization of the nucleoid remain elusive due to low-resolution contact maps from methods such as Hi-C9–11. Here we developed an enhanced Micro-C chromosome conformation capture, achieving 10-base pair (bp) resolution. This ultra-high-resolution analysis reveals elemental spatial structures in the Escherichia coli nucleoid, including chromosomal hairpins (CHINs) and chromosomal hairpin domains (CHIDs). These structures, organized by histone-like proteins H-NS and StpA, have key roles in repressing horizontally transferred genes. Disruption of H-NS causes drastic reorganization of the 3D genome, decreasing CHINs and CHIDs, whereas removing both H-NS and StpA results in their complete disassembly, increased transcription of horizontally transferred genes and delayed growth. Similar effects are observed with netropsin, which competes with H-NS and StpA for AT-rich DNA binding. Interactions between CHINs further organize the genome into isolated loops, potentially insulating active operons. Our Micro-C analysis reveals that all actively transcribed genes form distinct operon-sized chromosomal interaction domains (OPCIDs) in a transcription-dependent manner. These structures appear as square patterns on Micro-C maps, reflecting continuous contacts throughout transcribed regions. This work unveils the fundamental structural elements of the E. coli nucleoid, highlighting their connection to nucleoid-associated proteins and transcription machinery. An ultra-high-resolution chromatin organization map of E. coli, using Micro-C, reveals intricate chromatin structures involved in the silencing of horizontally transferred genes and those associated with active operons.",

    "abstract": "After fertilization, early embryos undergo dissolution of conventional chromatin organization, including topologically associating domains (TADs)1,2. Zygotic genome activation then commences amid unusually slow de novo establishment of three-dimensional chromatin architecture2. How chromatin organization is established and how it interplays with transcription in early mammalian embryos remain elusive. Here we show that CTCF occupies chromatin throughout mouse early development. By contrast, cohesin poorly binds chromatin in one-cell embryos, coinciding with TAD dissolution. Cohesin binding then progressively increases from two- to eight-cell embryos, accompanying TAD establishment. Unexpectedly, strong ‘genic cohesin islands’ (GCIs) emerge across gene bodies of active genes in this period. GCI genes enrich for cell identity and regulatory genes, display broad H3K4me3 at promoters, and exhibit strong binding of transcription factors and the cohesin loader NIPBL at nearby enhancers. We show that transcription is hyperactive in two- to eight-cell embryos and is required for GCI formation. Conversely, induced transcription can also create GCIs. Finally, GCIs can function as insulation boundaries and form contact domains with nearby CTCF sites, enhancing both the transcription levels and stability of GCI genes. These data reveal a hypertranscription state in early embryos that both shapes and is fostered by the three-dimensional genome organization, revealing an intimate interplay between chromatin structure and transcription. A study reveals progressive cohesin loading and a hypertranscription state responsible for the formation of genic cohesin islands at active regulatory genes in mouse embryos, highlighting an interplay between chromatin architecture and transcription as they are established for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically elastic thermoelectric generators with superior conformal coverage and shape adaptability are highly desirable for developing self-powered wearable electronics, soft bioelectronics and personal temperature regulators1,2. Until now, all reported high-performance thermoelectric materials have realized only flexibility, rather than elasticity3,4. Here we present one of the first n-type thermoelectric elastomers by integrating uniform bulk nanophase separation, thermally activated crosslinking and targeted doping into a single material. The thermoelectric elastomers could exhibit exceptional rubber-like recovery of up to 150% strains and high figure of merit values rivalling flexible inorganic materials even under mechanical deformations. Conventional wisdom suggests that incorporating insulating polymers should dilute the active component in organic thermoelectrics, resulting in lower performance. However, we demonstrate that carefully selected elastomers and dopants can promote the formation of uniformly distributed, elastomer-wrapped and heavily n-doped semiconducting polymer nanofibrils, leading to improved electrical conductivity and decreased thermal conductivity. These thermoelectric elastomers have the potential to make elastic thermoelectric generators in wearable applications much more conformable and efficient. A microphase crosslinking strategy, leveraging aziridine-based crosslinkers, is used to render organic thermoelectric materials stretchable and elastic.",

Proposed structures range from microscale engineered aerosols1, to centimetre-scale thin disks with variations in surface accommodation coefficients2,3, to sandwich structures with nanoscale thickness4,5 that might be extended to metre-scale width6,7. Quantitative understanding of how structural and surface properties determine photophoretic lofting forces is necessary to develop a practical flying device. Here we focus on thermal transpiration as the most promising photophoretic mechanism for lofting large devices8 and present a hybrid analytical–numerical model of the lofting force on a structure that consists of two perforated membranes spaced a small distance apart. We identify optimal structural parameters, including device size, membrane perforation density and distribution of the vertical ligaments that connect the two membranes, each as a function of atmospheric altitude. Targeting these optimal parameters, we fabricate structures with a heterogeneous ligament distribution, which efficiently compromises between structural rigidity and photophoretic performance. We measure how lofting forces generated by these structures depend on pressure using gases with three different molecular weights. We observed photophoretic levitation of a 1-cm-wide structure at an air pressure of 26.7 Pa when illuminated by 750 W m−2, about 55% the intensity of sunlight. Lastly, we describe the preliminary design of a 3-cm-radius device with 10-mg payload capacity at 75-km altitudes and discuss horizontal motion control, overnight settling, and applications in climate sensing, communications and Martian exploration. A photophoretic aircraft that can levitate via thermal transpiration is achieved under near-space conditions, providing a potential platform for climate sensing, communications and Martian exploration.",

    "abstract": "Developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts for cost-effective proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is challenging1–3. Fe/N–C catalysts are among the most promising alternatives to the platinum group metal catalysts, but their activity and durability still cannot meet the performance criteria due to the strong adsorption of oxygenated reaction intermediates and the demetallization of Fe species caused by the Fenton reaction4–8. Here we design and develop a new type of Fe/N–C catalyst that is composed of numerous nanoprotrusions dispersed on two-dimensional carbon layers with single Fe-atom sites primarily embedded within the inner curved surface of the nanoprotrusions. The graphitized outer carbon layer of the nanoprotrusions can not only effectively weaken the binding strength of the oxygenated reaction intermediates, but also reduce the hydroxyl radical production rate. As a result, the Fe/N–C catalyst delivers one of the best-performing platinum group metal-free proton-exchange membrane fuel cell performances, achieving a record high power density of 0.75 W cm−2 under 1.0 bar H2–air with 86% activity retention after more than 300 hours of continuous operation.

    "abstract": "Large earthquakes induce widespread landslides that fill river channels with sediment1,2, generating long-lasting fluvial hazards and reshaping mountain topography. However, riverine sediment fluxes after earthquakes remain poorly resolved, mostly because of a lack of data on bedload flux3,4. Here we construct a source-to-sink sediment budget following the 2008 Mw7.9 (where Mw is the moment magnitude) Wenchuan earthquake in the eastern Tibetan mountains. We measured sediment accumulation in a man-made reservoir downstream of the earthquake-affected region. Ten years after the earthquake, the Min Jiang River had exported about 9% of the sediment mass from earthquake-triggered landslides, with around 5.7 times increase in the total riverine sediment flux sustained over that time. Bedload flux increased by \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${27.4}_{-15.6}^{+14.6} \\% $$\n                \n               times compared with pre-earthquake levels, making up \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$6{5}_{-26}^{+12} \\% $$\n                \n               of the post-earthquake sediment export—a proportion much higher than typical of most mountainous rivers. At the current pace, the river system will remove most Wenchuan landslide debris over centennial timescales. However, future sediment export rates are likely to vary because of changes on hillslopes (for example, revegetation) and in hydrology, sediment characteristics and transport processes. Our findings demonstrate a decadal bedload-dominated sediment pulse driven by earthquake-triggered landslides, suggesting that increased vulnerability to cascading hazards such as aggradation and flooding could persist for decades in populated downstream regions after a large earthquake. Bedload can dominate river sediment flux after a major earthquake for a prolonged time period.",

    "abstract": "Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the largest reduced carbon reservoir in modern oceans1,2. Its dynamics regulate marine communities and atmospheric CO2 levels3,4, whereas 13C compositions track ecosystem structure and autotrophic metabolism5. However, the geologic history of marine DOC remains largely unconstrained6,7, limiting our ability to mechanistically reconstruct coupled ecological and biogeochemical evolution. Here we develop and validate a direct proxy for past DOC signatures using co-precipitated organic carbon in iron ooids. We apply this to 26 marine iron ooid-containing formations deposited over the past 1,650 million years to generate a data-based reconstruction of marine DOC signals since the Palaeoproterozoic. Our predicted DOC concentrations were near modern levels in the Palaeoproterozoic, then decreased by 90−99% in the Neoproterozoic before sharply rising in the Cambrian. We interpret these dynamics to reflect three distinct states. The occurrence of mostly small, single-celled organisms combined with severely hypoxic deep oceans, followed by larger, more complex organisms and little change in ocean oxygenation and finally continued organism growth and a transition to fully oxygenated oceans8,9. Furthermore, modern DOC is 13C-enriched relative to the Proterozoic, possibly because of changing autotrophic carbon-isotope fractionation driven by biological innovation. Our findings reflect connections between the carbon cycle, ocean oxygenation and the evolution of complex life. A direct proxy for past dissolved organic carbon signatures using co-precipitated organic carbon in iron ooids enables reconstruction of marine dissolved organic carbon signals dating back to the Palaeoproterozoic.",

    "abstract": "Both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) accumulate in cancer cells during tumour development, fuelling clonal evolution. However, accurate estimation of clone-specific copy numbers from bulk DNA-sequencing data is challenging. Here we present allele-specific phylogenetic analysis of copy number alterations (ALPACA), a method to infer SNV and SCNA coevolution by leveraging phylogenetic trees reconstructed from multi-sample bulk tumour sequencing data using SNV frequencies. ALPACA estimates the SCNA evolution of simulated tumours with a higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods1–4. ALPACA uncovers loss-of-heterozygosity and amplification events in minor clones that may be missed using standard approaches and reveals the temporal order of somatic alterations. Analysing clone-specific copy numbers in TRACERx421 lung tumours5,6, we find evidence of increased chromosomal instability in metastasis-seeding clones and enrichment for losses affecting tumour suppressor genes and amplification affecting CCND1. Furthermore, we identify increased SCNA rates in both tumours with polyclonal metastatic dissemination and tumours with extrathoracic metastases, and an association between higher clone copy number diversity and reduced disease-free survival in patients with lung cancer. A study presents ALPACA, a computational method for inferring clone- and allele-specific copy numbers of individual clones from multi-sample bulk DNA-sequencing data, and demonstrates its use to study metastasis trajectories.",

    "abstract": "The development of high-energy lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is essential for advances in next-generation energy storage and electric vehicle technologies1–3. Nevertheless, the practical applications of LMBs are constrained by current electrolyte designs that inherently rely on dominant solvation structures, preventing transformative progress in performance optimization4,5. Here, we address this limitation through a delocalized electrolyte design that fosters a more disordered solvation microenvironment, thereby mitigating dynamic barriers and stabilizing interphases. The resulting delocalized electrolyte delivers notable energy densities of 604.2 Wh kg−1 in a 5.5-Ah LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (Ni90)||Li pouch cell with a lean electrolyte design (1.0 g Ah−1) and 618.2 Wh kg−1 in a 5.2-Ah Ni90||Li pouch cell with an ultralean electrolyte design (0.9 g Ah−1), maintaining significant cycle stability over 100 and 90 cycles, respectively. In addition, the 70–104 V NCM811||Li battery pack (3,904 Wh) exhibits a high energy density of 480.9 Wh kg−1 and stable cycling over 25 cycles. These results demonstrate the need to circumvent inherent reliance on dominant solvation structures in electrolyte design to achieve the high-energy Battery600 and scalable Pack480 targets. Lithium metal battery performance is optimized using a delocalized electrolyte design that induces a disordered solvation microenvironment, thereby combining the advantages of the solvent-dominated and anion-dominated structures of conventional electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) class of drugs represents a remarkable advance in the treatment of patients with homologous recombination-deficient tumours, but resistance remains a challenge1–5. Although most research has focused on the downstream consequences of PARPi exposure to tackle resistance, the immediate effect of PARP inhibition on the chromatin environment and its contribution to PARPi toxicity remains elusive. Here we show that PARP inhibition induces histone release from the chromatin. This presents a vulnerability of PARPi-resistant cancer cells, which require histone homeostasis mechanisms to sustain elevated DNA replication rates and survival. Through functional genetic screens, we identified NASP as a key factor in maintaining the stability of evicted histones via its TPR motifs. Loss of NASP renders tumour cells hypersensitive to PARPi treatment in vitro and in vivo, impairs replication fork progression and elevates levels of replication-associated DNA damage. Moreover, NASP acts together with the INO80 complex and the chaperoning activity of PARP1 to ensure efficient histone turnover and prevent the accumulation of lethal DNA damage. Collectively, our work reports on histone eviction as an immediate cellular response to PARPi treatment and provides a promising avenue for targeting histone supply pathways to overcome PARPi resistance. PARP inhibitor treatment triggers histone release from the chromatin in cancer cells; consequently, targeting the histone chaperone NASP renders cells vulnerable to PARP inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)—the leading pattern of climate variability driving changes over the North Pacific and surrounding continents—is now thought to be generated by processes internal to the climate system1,2. According to this paradigm, the characteristic, irregular oscillations of the PDO arise from a collection of mechanisms involving ocean and atmosphere interactions in the North and tropical Pacific3–5. Recent variations in the coupled ocean–atmosphere system, such as the 2015 El Niño, ought to have shifted the PDO into its positive phase6. Yet, the PDO has been locked in a consistent downward trend for more than three decades, remanding nearby regions to a steady set of climate impacts. Here we show that the main multidecadal variations in the PDO index during the twentieth century, including the ongoing, decades-long negative trend, were largely driven by human emissions of aerosols and greenhouse gases rather than internal processes. This anthropogenic influence was previously undetected because the current generation of climate models systematically underestimate the amplitude of forced climate variability. A new attribution technique that statistically corrects for this error suggests that observed PDO impacts—including the ongoing multidecadal drought in the western United States—can be largely attributed to human activity through externally forced changes in the PDO. These results indicate that we need to rethink the attribution and projection of multidecadal changes in regional climate. The main multidecadal variations in the PDO index during the twentieth century, including the ongoing, decades-long negative trend, were largely driven by human emissions of aerosols and greenhouse gases rather than internal processes.",

    "abstract": "The time interval between about three and two million years ago is a critical period in human evolution—this is when the genera Homo and Paranthropus first appear in the fossil record and a possible ancestor of these genera, Australopithecus afarensis, disappears. In eastern Africa, attempts to test hypotheses about the adaptive contexts that led to these events are limited by a paucity of fossiliferous exposures that capture this interval. Here we describe the age, geologic context and dental morphology of new hominin fossils recovered from the Ledi-Geraru Research Project area, Ethiopia, which includes sediments from this critically underrepresented period. We report the presence of Homo at 2.78 and 2.59 million years ago and Australopithecus at 2.63 million years ago. Although the Australopithecus specimens cannot yet be identified to species level, their morphology differs from A. afarensis and Australopithecus garhi. These specimens suggest that Australopithecus and early Homo co-existed as two non-robust lineages in the Afar Region before 2.5 million years ago, and that the hominin fossil record is more diverse than previously known. Accordingly, there were as many as four hominin lineages living in eastern Africa between 3.0 and 2.5 million years ago: early Homo1, Paranthropus2, A. garhi3, and the newly discovered Ledi-Geraru Australopithecus. Hominin fossils from the Ledi-Geraru Research Project area, Ethiopia, suggest that early Homo and Australopithecus species co-existed in the region more than 2.5 million years ago.",

    "abstract": "While physical activity is critical to human health, most people do not meet recommended guidelines1,2. Built environments that are more walkable have the potential to increase activity across the population3–8. However, previous studies on the built environment and physical activity have led to mixed findings, possibly due to methodological limitations such as small cohorts, over-reliance on self-reported measures and cross-sectional designs5,7,9–11. Here we address these limitations by leveraging a large US cohort of smartphone users (N = 2,112,288) to evaluate within-person longitudinal behaviour changes that occurred over 248,266 days of objectively measured physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 US cities. By analysing the results of this natural experiment, which exposed individuals to differing built environments, we find that increases (decreases) in walkability are associated with significant increases (decreases) in physical activity after relocation. For example, moving from a less walkable (25th percentile) city to a more walkable city (75th percentile) increased walking by 1,100 daily steps, on average. These changes hold across different genders, ages and body mass index values, and are sustained over 3 months. The added activity is predominantly composed of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, which is linked to an array of associated health benefits1. Evidence against residential self-selection confounding is reported. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the importance of the built environment in directly improving health-enhancing physical activity and offer potential guidance for public policy activities in this area. By analysing the smartphone data of 2,112,288 participants, in particular observing and comparing the activity of the same individual in two different environments, we find that increases in the walkability of environments result in increases in daily physical activity, providing evidence of the importance of the built environment on physical health.",
