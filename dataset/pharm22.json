    "abstract": "Statins reduce cholesterol, prevent cardiovascular disease, and are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the world. Statin‐associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS) impact statin adherence and ultimately can impede the long‐term effectiveness of statin therapy. There are several identified pharmacogenetic variants that impact statin disposition and adverse events during statin therapy. SLCO1B1 encodes a transporter (SLCO1B1; alternative names include OATP1B1 or OATP‐C) that facilitates the hepatic uptake of all statins. ABCG2 encodes an efflux transporter (BCRP) that modulates the absorption and disposition of rosuvastatin. CYP2C9 encodes a phase I drug metabolizing enzyme responsible for the oxidation of some statins. Genetic variation in each of these genes alters systemic exposure to statins (i.e., simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin), which can increase the risk for SAMS. We summarize the literature supporting these associations and provide therapeutic recommendations for statins based on SLCO1B1 , ABCG2 , and CYP2C9 genotype with the goal of improving the overall safety, adherence, and effectiveness of statin therapy. This document replaces the 2012 and 2014 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines for SLCO1B1 and simvastatin‐induced myopathy.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) has been granted authorization or approval in several countries for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID‐19 at high risk of progression to severe disease and with no requirement for supplemental oxygen. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir will be primarily administered outside the hospital setting as a 5‐day course oral treatment. The ritonavir component boosts plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir through the potent and rapid inhibition of the key drug‐metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Thus nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, even given as a short treatment course, has a high potential to cause harm from drug–drug interactions (DDIs) with other drugs metabolized through this pathway. Options for mitigating risk from DDIs with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are limited due to the clinical illness, the short window for intervention, and the related difficulty of implementing clinical monitoring or dosage adjustment of the comedication. Pragmatic options are largely confined to preemptive or symptom‐driven pausing of the comedication or managing any additional risk through counseling. This review summarizes the effects of ritonavir on drug disposition (i.e., metabolizing enzymes and transporters) and discusses factors determining the likelihood of having a clinically significant DDI. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive list of comedications likely to be used in COVID‐19 patients which are categorized according to their potential DDI risk with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. It also discusses recommendations for the management of DDIs which balance the risk of harm from DDIs with a short course of ritonavir, against unnecessary denial of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a continued leading cause of hospitalization and death. Safe, efficacious COVID‐19 antivirals are needed urgently. Nirmatrelvir (PF‐07321332), the first orally bioavailable, severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) M pro inhibitor against the coronaviridae family, has demonstrated potent preclinical antiviral activity and benign safety profile. We report safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data of nirmatrelvir with and without ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, from an accelerated randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase I study. Two interleaving single‐ascending dose (SAD) cohorts were evaluated in a three‐period crossover. Multiple‐ascending dose (MAD) with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily (b.i.d.) dosing was evaluated over 10 days in five parallel cohorts. Safety was assessed, including in a supratherapeutic exposure cohort. Dose and dosing regimen for clinical efficacy evaluation in phase II/III clinical trials were supported by integrating modeling and simulations of SAD/MAD data with nonclinical data and a quantitative systems pharmacology model (QSP). In SAD, MAD, and supratherapeutic exposure cohorts, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was safe and well‐tolerated. Nirmatrelvir exposure and half‐life were considerably increased by ritonavir, enabling selection of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir dose and regimen for phase II/III trials (300/100 mg b.i.d.), to achieve concentrations continuously above those required for 90% inhibition of viral replication in vitro . The QSP model suggested that a 5‐day regimen would significantly decrease viral load in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients which may prevent development of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. In conclusion, an innovative and seamless trial design expedited establishment of phase I safety and pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, enabling high confidence in phase II/III dose selection and accelerated pivotal trials’ initiation (NCT04756531).",

    "abstract": "Depression is considered a major public health concern, where existing pharmacological treatments are not equally effective across all patients. The pathogenesis of depression involves the interaction of complex biological components, such as the immune system and the microbiota‐gut‐brain axis. Adjunctive lifestyle‐oriented approaches for depression, including physical exercise and special diets are promising therapeutic options when combined with traditional antidepressants. However, the mechanisms of action of these strategies are incompletely understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that physical exercise and specific dietary regimens can modulate both the immune system and gut microbiota composition. Here, we review the current information about the strategies to alleviate depression and their crosstalk with both inflammatory mechanisms and the gut microbiome. We further discuss the role of the microbiota‐gut‐brain axis as a possible mediator for the adjunctive therapies for depression through inflammatory mechanisms. Finally, we review existing and future adjunctive strategies to manipulate the gut microbiota with potential use for depression, including physical exercise, dietary interventions, prebiotics/probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.",

A systematic review was conducted using multiple biomedical literature databases from inception to June 2021. Full articles comparing PGx‐guided with nonguided treatment were included for data extraction. Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) was used to assess robustness of each study (0–100). Data are reported using descriptive statistics. Of 108 studies evaluating 39 drugs, 77 (71%) showed PGx testing was cost‐effective (CE) ( N = 48) or cost‐saving (CS) ( N = 29); 21 (20%) were not CE; 10 (9%) were uncertain. Clopidogrel had the most articles ( N = 23), of which 22 demonstrated CE or CS, followed by warfarin ( N = 16), of which 7 demonstrated CE or CS. Of 26 studies evaluating human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing for abacavir ( N = 8), allopurinol ( N = 10), or carbamazepine/phenytoin ( N = 8), 15 demonstrated CE or CS. Nine of 11 antidepressant articles demonstrated CE or CS. The median QHES score reflected high‐quality studies (91; range 48–100). Most studies evaluating cost‐effectiveness favored PGx testing. Limited data exist on cost‐effectiveness of preemptive and multigene testing across disease states.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing has emerged as a compelling strategy that clinicians can use to inform antidepressant medication selection and dosing, but the clinical efficacy of this strategy has been questioned. We systematically reviewed and meta‐analyzed clinical trials for an association between the use of PGx‐guided antidepressant therapy and depressive symptom remission in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). We included prospective, controlled clinical trials published in English up to July 12, 2022. Data extraction and synthesis adhered to the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines. Each trial was assessed for risk of bias and a random‐effects model was used to estimate pooled risk ratios. Thirteen trials comprising 4,767 patients were analyzed, including 10 randomized controlled trials, and three open label trials. Across all included trials, those that received PGx‐guided antidepressant therapy ( n = 2,395) were 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15–1.74, P = 0.001) more likely to achieve remission compared with those that received unguided antidepressant therapy ( n = 2,372). Pooled risk ratios for randomized controlled trials and open label trials were 1.46 (95% CI: 1.13–1.88) and 1.26 (95% CI = 0.84–1.88), respectively. These results suggest that PGx‐guided antidepressant therapy is associated with a modest but significant increase in depressive symptom remission in adults with MDD. Efforts to address the heterogeneity in PGx test composition (i.e., genes and alleles tested) and accompanying prescribing recommendations across trials will likely reduce the uncertainty about the efficacy of PGx‐guided antidepressant therapy in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Psilocybin is being investigated as a potential treatment for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Only a few studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of psilocybin and have used body weight‐adjusted dosing. Data on PKs and the PK‐pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of fixed doses that are commonly used are unavailable. The present study characterized the PKs and PK‐PD relationship of 15, 25, and 30 mg of orally administered psilocybin in 28, 23, and 28 healthy subjects, respectively. Plasma levels of unconjugated psilocin (the psychoactive metabolite of psilocybin) and corresponding subjective effects were repeatedly assessed up to 24 hours. PK parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Concentration‐subjective effect relationships were described using PK‐PD modeling. Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal psilocin concentrations were 11 ng/mL (10‐13), 17 ng/mL (16‐19), and 21 ng/mL (19‐24) after the administration of 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Maximal concentrations were reached after an average of 2 hours. Elimination half‐lives were 1.8 hours (1.7–2.0), 1.4 hours (1.2–1.7), and 1.8 hours (1.6–1.9) for 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Mean (± SD) durations of subjective effects were 5.6 ± 2.2 hours, 5.5 ± 1.6 hours, and 6.4 ± 2.2 hours, and maximal effects (“any drug” effects) were 58% ± 25%, 73% ± 27%, and 80% ± 18% after 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Psilocin exhibited dose‐proportional PKs. The duration and intensity of subjective effects were dose‐dependent. Body weight did not influence pharmacokinetics or the response to psilocybin. These data may serve as a reference for future clinical trials.",

In this study, we conducted semi‐structured interviews with 20 European regulators to identify regulatory challenges and opportunities for the implementation of DCTs in the European Union. The key opportunities for DCTs that were recognized by regulators include a reduced participation burden, which could facilitate the participation of underserved patients. In addition, regulators indicated that data collected in DCTs are expected to be more representative of the real world. Key challenges recognized by regulators for DCTs include concerns regarding investigator oversight and participants’ safety when physical examinations and face‐to‐face contact are limited. To facilitate future learning, hybrid clinical trials with both on‐site and decentralized elements are proposed by the respondents.",

    "abstract": "Nirmatrelvir coadministered with ritonavir is highly efficacious in reducing the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) adverse outcomes among patients at increased risk of progression to severe disease, including patients with chronic kidney disease. Because nirmatrelvir is eliminated by the kidneys when given with ritonavir, this phase I study evaluated the effects of renal impairment on pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Participants with normal renal function ( n = 10) or mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment ( n = 8 each) were administered a single 100‐mg nirmatrelvir dose with 100 mg ritonavir given 12 hours before, together with and 12 and 24 hours after the nirmatrelvir dose. Systemic nirmatrelvir exposure increased with increasing renal impairment, with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment groups having respective adjusted geometric mean ratio areas under the plasma concentration‐time profile from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time of 124%, 187%, and 304% vs. the normal renal function group. Corresponding ratios for maximum plasma concentration were 130%, 138%, and 148%. Apparent clearance was positively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate, and geometric mean renal clearance values were particularly lower for the moderate (47% decrease) and severe (80% decrease) renal impairment groups vs. the normal renal function group. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir exhibited an acceptable safety profile; treatment‐related adverse events were mild in severity, and there were no significant findings regarding laboratory measurements, vital signs, or electrocardiogram assessments. These findings led to a dose reduction recommendation for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients with moderate renal impairment (150/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir instead of 300/100 mg twice daily for 5 days).

While its contribution has been recognized for safety monitoring and disease epidemiology across medicines' life cycles, using RWD/RWE to demonstrate efficacy requires further evaluation. This study aimed to (i) characterize RWD/RWE presented by applicants to support claims on medicines' efficacy within initial marketing authorization applications (MAAs) and extension of indication applications (EoIs), and (ii) analyze the contribution of RWD/RWE to regulatory decisions on medicines' benefit–risk profile. RWD/RWE was included to support efficacy in 32 MAAs and 14 EoIs submitted 2018–2019. Of these, RWD/RWE was part of the preauthorization package of 16 MAAs and 10 EoIs, and was (i) considered supporting the regulatory decision in 10 applications (five MAAs, five EoIs), (ii) considered not supporting the regulatory decision in 11 (seven MAAs, four EoIs), and (iii) not addressed at all in the evaluation of 5 applications (four MAAs, one EoI). Common limitations of submitted RWD/RWE included missing data, lack of representativeness of populations, small sample size, absence of an adequate or prespecified analysis plan, and risk of several types of bias. The suitability of RWD/RWE in a given application still requires a case‐by‐case analysis considering its purpose of use, implying reflection on the data source, together with its assets and limitations, study objectives and designs, and the overall data package issued. Early interactions and continuous dialogues with regulators and relevant stakeholders is key to optimize fit‐for‐purpose RWE generation, enabling its broader use in medicines development.",

    "abstract": "Membrane transport proteins are involved in the absorption, disposition, efficacy, and/or toxicity of many drugs. Numerous mechanisms (e.g., nuclear receptors, epigenetic gene regulation, microRNAs, alternative splicing, post‐translational modifications, and trafficking) regulate transport protein levels, localization, and function. Various factors associated with disease, medications, and dietary constituents, for example, may alter the regulation and activity of transport proteins in the intestine, liver, kidneys, brain, lungs, placenta, and other important sites, such as tumor tissue. This white paper reviews key mechanisms and regulatory factors that alter the function of clinically relevant transport proteins involved in drug disposition. Current considerations with in vitro and in vivo models that are used to investigate transporter regulation are discussed, including strengths, limitations, and the inherent challenges in predicting the impact of changes due to regulation of one transporter on compensatory pathways and overall drug disposition. In addition, translation and scaling of in vitro observations to in vivo outcomes are considered. The importance of incorporating altered transporter regulation in modeling and simulation approaches to predict the clinical impact on drug disposition is also discussed. Regulation of transporters is highly complex and, therefore, identification of knowledge gaps will aid in directing future research to expand our understanding of clinically relevant molecular mechanisms of transporter regulation. This information is critical to the development of tools and approaches to improve therapeutic outcomes by predicting more accurately the impact of regulation‐mediated changes in transporter function on drug disposition and response.",

    "abstract": "During its fourth transporter workshop in 2021, the International Transporter Consortium (ITC) provided updates on emerging clinically relevant transporters for drug development. Previously highlighted and new transporters were considered based on up‐to‐date clinical evidence of their importance in drug–drug interactions and potential for altered drug efficacy and safety, including drug–nutrient interactions leading to nutrient deficiencies. For the first time, folate transport pathways (PCFT, RFC, and FRα) were examined in‐depth as a potential mechanism of drug‐induced folate deficiency and related toxicities (e.g., neural tube defects and megaloblastic anemia). However, routine toxicology studies conducted in support of drug development appear sufficient to flag such folate deficiency toxicities, whereas prospective prediction from in vitro folate metabolism and transport inhibition is not well enough established to inform drug development. Previous suggestion of a retrospective study of intestinal OATP2B1 inhibition to explain unexpected decreases in drug exposure were updated. Furthermore, when the absorption of a new molecular entity is more rapid and extensive than can be explained by passive permeability, evaluation of the OATP2B1 transport may be considered. Emerging research on hepatic and renal OAT2 is summarized, but current understanding of the importance of OAT2 was deemed insufficient to justify specific consideration for drug development. Hepatic, renal, and intestinal MRPs (MRP2, MRP3, and MRP4) were revisited. MRPs may be considered when they are suspected to be the major determinant of drug disposition (e.g., direct glucuronide conjugates); MRP2 inhibition as a mechanistic explanation for drug‐induced hyperbilirubinemia remains justified. There were no major changes in recommendations from previous ITC whitepapers.",

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, 25–30% of the patients treated with fluoropyrimidines experience severe fluoropyrimidine‐related toxicity. Extensively clinically validated DPYD genotyping tests are available to identify patients at risk of severe toxicity due to decreased activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the rate limiting enzyme in fluoropyrimidine metabolism. In April 2020, the European Medicines Agency recommended that, as an alternative for DPYD genotype‐based testing for DPD deficiency, also phenotype testing based on pretreatment plasma uracil levels is a suitable method to identify patients with DPD deficiency. Although the evidence for genotype‐directed dosing of fluoropyrimidines is substantial, the level of evidence supporting plasma uracil levels to predict DPD activity in clinical practice is limited. Notwithstanding this, uracil‐based phenotyping is now used in clinical practice in various countries in Europe. We aimed to determine the value of pretreatment uracil levels in predicting DPD deficiency and severe treatment‐related toxicity. To this end, we determined pretreatment uracil levels in 955 patients with cancer, and assessed the correlation with DPD activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and fluoropyrimidine‐related severe toxicity. We identified substantial issues concerning the use of pretreatment uracil in clinical practice, including large between‐center study differences in measured pretreatment uracil levels, most likely as a result of pre‐analytical factors. Importantly, we were not able to correlate pretreatment uracil levels with DPD activity nor were uracil levels predictive of severe treatment‐related toxicity. We urge that robust clinical validation should first be performed before pretreatment plasma uracil levels are used in clinical practice as part of a dosing strategy for fluoropyrimidines.",

    "abstract": "The role of membrane transporters on pharmacokinetics (PKs), drug–drug interactions (DDIs), pharmacodynamics (PDs), and toxicity of drugs has been broadly recognized. However, our knowledge of modulation of transporter expression and/or function in the diseased patient population or specific populations, such as pediatrics or pregnancy, is still emerging. This white paper highlights recent advances in studying the changes in transporter expression and activity in various diseases (i.e., renal and hepatic impairment and cancer) and some specific populations (i.e., pediatrics and pregnancy) with the focus on clinical implications. Proposed alterations in transporter abundance and/or activity in diseased and specific populations are based on (i) quantitative transporter proteomic data and relative abundance in specific populations vs. healthy adults, (ii) clinical PKs, and emerging transporter biomarker and/or pharmacogenomic data, and (iii) physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. The potential for altered PK, PD, and toxicity in these populations needs to be considered for drugs and their active metabolites in which transporter‐mediated uptake/efflux is a major contributor to their absorption, distribution, and elimination pathways and/or associated DDI risk. In addition to best practices, this white paper discusses current challenges and knowledge gaps to study and quantitatively predict the effects of modulation in transporter activity in these populations, together with the perspectives from the International Transporter Consortium (ITC) on future directions.",

    "abstract": "Many drugs are still prescribed off‐label to the pediatric population. Although off‐label drug use not supported by high level of evidence is potentially harmful, a comprehensive overview of the quality of the evidence pertaining off‐label drug use in children is lacking. The Dutch Pediatric Formulary (DPF) provides best evidence‐based dosing guidelines for drugs used in children. For each drug‐indication‐age group combination—together compiling one record—we scored the highest available level of evidence: labeled use, systematic review or meta‐analysis, randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparative research, noncomparative research, or consensus‐based expert opinions. For records based on selected guidelines, the original sources were not reviewed. These records were scored as guideline. A total of 774 drugs were analyzed comprising a total of 6,426 records. Of all off‐label records ( n = 2,718), 14% were supported by high quality evidence (4% meta‐analysis or systematic reviews, 10% RCTs of high quality), 20% by comparative research, 14% by noncomparative research, 37% by consensus‐based expert opinions, and 15% by selected guidelines. Fifty‐eight percent of all records were authorized, increasing with age from 30% in preterm neonates ( n = 110) up to 64% in adolescents ( n = 1,630). Many have advocated that off‐label use is only justified when supported by a high level of evidence. We show that this prerequisite would seriously limit available drug treatment for children as the underlying evidence is low across ages and drug classes. Our data identify the drugs and therapeutic areas for which evidence is clearly missing and could drive the global research agenda.",

    "abstract": "In response to a surge of deaths from synthetic opioid overdoses, there have been increased efforts to distribute naloxone products in community settings. Prior research has assessed the effectiveness of naloxone in the hospital setting; however, it is challenging to assess naloxone dosing regimens in the community/first‐responder setting, including reversal of respiratory depression effects of fentanyl and its derivatives (fentanyls). Here, we describe the development and validation of a mechanistic model that combines opioid mu receptor binding kinetics, opioid agonist and antagonist pharmacokinetics, and human respiratory and circulatory physiology, to evaluate naloxone dosing to reverse respiratory depression. Validation supports our model, which can quantitatively predict displacement of opioids by naloxone from opioid mu receptors in vitro , hypoxia‐induced cardiac arrest in vivo , and opioid‐induced respiratory depression in humans from different fentanyls. After validation, overdose simulations were performed with fentanyl and carfentanil followed by administration of different intramuscular naloxone products. Carfentanil induced more cardiac arrest events and was more difficult to reverse than fentanyl. Opioid receptor binding data indicated that carfentanil has substantially slower dissociation kinetics from the opioid receptor compared with nine other fentanyls tested, which likely contributes to the difficulty in reversing carfentanil. Administration of the same dose of naloxone intramuscularly from two different naloxone products with different formulations resulted in differences in the number of virtual patients experiencing cardiac arrest. This work provides a robust framework to evaluate dosing regimens of opioid receptor antagonists to reverse opioid‐induced respiratory depression, including those caused by newly emerging synthetic opioids.",

    "abstract": "The Pharmacogene Variation Consortium (PharmVar) is now providing star (*) allele nomenclature for the highly polymorphic human SLCO1B1 gene encoding the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) drug transporter. Genetic variation within the SLCO1B1 gene locus impacts drug transport, which can lead to altered pharmacokinetic profiles of several commonly prescribed drugs. Variable OATP1B1 function is of particular importance regarding hepatic uptake of statins and the risk of statin‐associated musculoskeletal symptoms. To introduce this important drug transporter gene into the PharmVar database and serve as a unified reference of haplotype variation moving forward, an international group of gene experts has performed an extensive review of all published SLCO1B1 star alleles. Previously published star alleles were self‐assigned by authors and only loosely followed the star nomenclature system that was first developed for cytochrome P450 genes. This nomenclature system has been standardized by PharmVar and is now applied to other important pharmacogenes such as SLCO1B1 . In addition, data from the 1000 Genomes Project and investigator‐submitted data were utilized to confirm existing haplotypes, fill knowledge gaps, and/or define novel star alleles. The PharmVar‐developed SLCO1B1 nomenclature has been incorporated by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) 2022 guideline on statin‐associated musculoskeletal symptoms.",

The goal of this state‐of‐the‐art article is to describe recent advances in research on membrane transporters that are particularly relevant to drug discovery and development. This review covers advances in basic, translational, and clinical research that has led to an increased understanding of membrane transporters at all levels. At the basic level, we describe the available crystal structures of membrane transporters in both the solute carrier (SLC) and ATP binding cassette superfamilies, which has been enabled by the development of cryogenic electron microscopy methods. Next, we describe new research on lysosomal and mitochondrial transporters as well as recently deorphaned transporters in the SLC superfamily. The translational section includes a summary of proteomic research, which has led to a quantitative understanding of transporter levels in various cell types and tissues and new methods to modulate transporter function, such as allosteric modulators and targeted protein degraders of transporters. The section ends with a review of the effect of the gut microbiome on modulation of transporter function followed by a presentation of 3D cell cultures, which may enable in vivo predictions of transporter function. In the clinical section, we describe new genomic and pharmacogenomic research, highlighting important polymorphisms in transporters that are clinically relevant to many drugs. Finally, we describe new clinical tools, which are becoming increasingly available to enable precision medicine, with the application of tissue‐derived small extracellular vesicles and real‐world biomarkers.",

Pharmacodynamic (PD) effects were explored using keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and tetanus toxoid (TT) immunizations. Sixty‐four healthy male subjects (26.5 ± 6.0 years) were randomized to single doses of 0.006, 0.018, or 0.05 mg/kg, or multiple doses of 0.15, 0.45, 1.35, 4, or 12 mg/kg KY1005, or placebo (6:2). Serum KY1005 concentrations were measured. Antibody responses upon KLH and TT immunizations and skin response upon intradermal KLH administration were performed. PD data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of covariances (ANCOVAs) and post hoc exposure‐response modeling. No serious adverse events occurred and all adverse events were temporary and of mild or moderate severity. A nonlinear increase in mean serum KY1005 concentrations was observed (median time to maximum concentration (T max ) ~ 4 hours, geometric mean terminal half‐life (t½) ~ 24 days). Cutaneous blood perfusion (estimated difference (ED) −13.4 arbitrary unit (AU), 95% confidence interval (CI) −23.0 AU to −3.8 AU) and erythema quantified as average redness (ED −0.23 AU, 95% CI −0.35 AU to −0.11 AU) decreased after KY1005 treatment at doses of 0.45 mg/kg and above. Exposure‐response analysis displayed a statistically significant treatment effect on anti‐KLH antibody titers (IgG maximum effect (E max ) −0.58 AU, 95% CI −1.10 AU to −0.06 AU) and skin response (erythema E max −0.20 AU, 95% CI −0.29 AU to −0.11 AU). Administration of KY1005 demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and PK analyses displayed a nonlinear profile of KY1005. Despite the observed variability, skin challenge response after KY1005 treatment indicated pharmacological activity of KY1005. Therefore, KY1005 shows potential as a novel pharmacological treatment in immune‐mediated disorders.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare disparities are a persistent societal problem. One of the contributing factors to this status quo is the lack of diversity and representativeness of research efforts, which result in nongeneralizable evidence that, in turn, provides suboptimal means to enable the best possible outcomes at the individual level. There are several strategies that research teams can adopt to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) of their efforts; these strategies span the totality of the research path, from initial design to the shepherding of clinical data through a potential regulatory process. These strategies include more intentionality and DEI‐based goal‐setting, more diverse research and leadership teams, better community engagement to set study goals and approaches, better tailored outreach interventions, decentralization of study procedures and incorporation of innovative technology for more flexible data collection, and self‐surveillance to identify and prevent biases. Within their remit of overlooking research efforts, regulatory authorities, as stakeholders, also have the potential for a positive effect on the DEI of emerging clinical evidence. All these are implementable tools and mechanisms that can make study participation more approachable to diverse communities, and ultimately generate evidence that is more generalizable and a conduit for better outcomes. The research community has an imperative to make DEI principles key foundational aspects in study conduct in order to pursue better personalized medicine for diverse patient populations.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models, such as physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic models, are used to predict, for example, drug disposition and toxicity. However, populations differ in the abundance of proteins involved in these processes. To improve the building and refinement of such models, they must take into account these interindividual variabilities. In this study, we used global proteomics to characterize the protein composition of jejunum and liver from 37 donors with obesity enrolled in the COCKTAIL study. Liver protein levels from the 37 donors were further compared with those from donors without obesity. We quantified thousands of proteins and could present the expression of several drug‐metabolizing enzymes, for the first time, in jejunum, many of which belong to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) (e.g., CYP2U1) and the amine oxidase (flavin‐containing) (e.g., monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)) families. Although we show that many metabolizing enzymes had greater expression in liver, others had higher expression in jejunum (such as, MAOA and CES2), indicating the role of the small intestine in extrahepatic drug metabolism. We further show that proteins involved in drug disposition are not correlated in the two donor‐matched tissues. These proteins also do not correlate with physiological factors such as body mass index, age, and inflammation status in either tissue. Furthermore, the majority of these proteins are not differently expressed in donors with or without obesity. Nonetheless, interindividual differences were considerable, with implications for personalized prediction models and systems pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "We investigated genetic determinants of single‐dose simvastatin pharmacokinetics in a prospective study of 170 subjects and a retrospective cohort of 59 healthy volunteers. In a microarray‐based genomewide association study with the prospective data, the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (p.Val174Ala, rs4149056) single nucleotide variation showed the strongest, genomewide significant association with the area under the plasma simvastatin acid concentration‐time curve (AUC; P = 6.0 × 10 −10 ). Meta‐analysis with the retrospective cohort strengthened the association ( P = 1.6 × 10 −17 ). In a stepwise linear regression candidate gene analysis among all 229 participants, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C ( P = 1.9 × 10 −13 ) and CYP3A4 c.664T>C (p.Ser222Pro, rs55785340, CYP3A4*2 , P = 0.023) were associated with increased simvastatin acid AUC. Moreover, the SLCO1B1 c.463C>A (p.Pro155Thr, rs11045819, P = 7.2 × 10 −6 ) and c.1929A>C (p.Leu643Phe, rs34671512, P = 5.3 × 10 −4 ) variants associated with decreased simvastatin acid AUC. Based on these results and the literature, we classified the volunteers into genotype‐predicted OATP1B1 and CYP3A4 phenotype groups. Compared with the normal OATP1B1 function group, simvastatin acid AUC was 273% larger in the poor (90% confidence interval (CI), 137%, 488%; P = 3.1 × 10 −6 ), 40% larger in the decreased (90% CI, 8%, 83%; P = 0.036), and 67% smaller in the highly increased function group (90% CI, 46%, 80%; P = 2.4 × 10 −4 ). Intermediate CYP3A4 metabolizers (i.e., heterozygous carriers of either CYP3A4*2 or CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367)), had 87% (90% CI, 39%, 152%, P = 6.4 × 10 −4 ) larger simvastatin acid AUC than normal metabolizers. These data suggest that in addition to no function SLCO1B1 variants, increased function SLCO1B1 variants and reduced function CYP3A4 variants may affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of simvastatin. Care is warranted if simvastatin is prescribed to patients carrying decreased function SLCO1B1 or CYP3A4 alleles.",

    "abstract": "Probenecid is used to treat gout and hyperuricemia as well as increase plasma levels of antiviral drugs and antibiotics. In vivo , probenecid mainly inhibits the renal SLC22 organic anion transporters OAT1 (SLC22A6), OAT3 (SLC22A8), and URAT1 (SLC22A12). To understand the endogenous role of these transporters in humans, we administered probenecid to 20 healthy participants and metabolically profiled the plasma and urine before and after dosage. Hundreds of metabolites were significantly altered, indicating numerous drug‐metabolite interactions. We focused on potential OAT1 substrates by identifying 97 metabolites that were significantly elevated in the plasma and decreased in the urine, indicating OAT‐mediated clearance. These included signaling molecules, antioxidants, and gut microbiome products. In contrast, urate was the only metabolite significantly decreased in the plasma and elevated in the urine, consistent with an effect on renal reuptake by URAT1. Additional support comes from metabolomics analyses of our Oat1 and Oat3 knockout mice, where over 50% of the metabolites that were likely OAT substrates in humans were elevated in the serum of the mice. Fifteen of these compounds were elevated in both knockout mice, whereas six were exclusive to the Oat1 knockout and 4 to the Oat3 knockout. These may be endogenous biomarkers of OAT function. We also propose a probenecid stress test to evaluate kidney proximal tubule organic anion transport function in kidney disease. Consistent with the Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory, the profound changes in metabolite levels following probenecid treatment support the view that SLC22 transporters are hubs in the regulation of systemic human metabolism.",

This study reviews various aspects of the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA’s) biomarker qualification procedure, including frequency and outcome, common challenges, and biomarker characteristics. Our findings provide insights into the EMA’s biomarker qualification process and will thereby support future applications. All biomarker‐related “Qualification of Novel Methodologies for Medicine Development” procedures that started from 2008 to 2020 were included. Procedural data were extracted from relevant documents and analyzed descriptively. In total, 86 biomarker qualification procedures were identified, of which 13 resulted in qualified biomarkers. Whereas initially many biomarker qualification procedures were linked to a single company and specific drug development program, a shift was observed to qualification efforts by consortia. Most biomarkers were proposed ( n = 45) and qualified ( n = 9) for use in patient selection, stratification, and/or enrichment, followed by efficacy biomarkers (37 proposed, 4 qualified). Overall, many issues were raised during qualification procedures, mostly related to biomarker properties and assay validation (in 79% and 77% of all procedures, respectively). Issues related to the proposed context of use and rationale were least common yet were still raised in 54% of all procedures. While few qualified biomarkers are currently available, procedures focus increasingly on biomarkers for general use instead of those linked to specific drug compounds. The issues raised during qualification procedures illustrate the thorough discussions taking place between applicants and regulators—highlighting aspects that need careful consideration and underlining the importance of an appropriate validation strategy.",

    "abstract": "Fluoropyrimidines (FP; 5‐fluorouracil, capecitabine, and tegafur) are a commonly prescribed class of antimetabolite chemotherapies, used for various solid organ malignancies in over 2 million patients globally per annum. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), encoded by the DPYD gene, is the critical enzyme implicated in FP metabolism. DPYD variant genotypes can result in decreased DPD production, leading to the development of severe toxicities resulting in hospitalization, intensive care admission, and even death. Management of toxicity incurs financial burden on both patients and healthcare systems alike. Upfront DPYD genotyping to identify variant carriers allows an opportunity to identify patients who are at high risk to suffer from serious toxicities and allow prospective dose adjustment of FP treatment. This approach has been shown to reduce patient morbidity, as well as improve the cost‐effectiveness of managing FP treatment. Upfront DPYD genotyping has been recently endorsed by several countries in Europe and the United Kingdom. This review summarizes current knowledge about DPD deficiency and upfront DPYD genotyping, including clinical and cost‐effectiveness outcomes, with the intent of supporting implementation of an upfront DPYD genotyping service with individualized dose‐personalization.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that active tubular secretory clearance (CL s ) may not decline proportionally with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to the overestimation of renal clearance (CL r ) when using solely GFR to approximate disease effect on renal elimination. The clinical pharmacokinetic data of 33 renally secreted OAT1/3 substrates were collated to investigate the impact of mild, moderate, and severe CKD on CL r , tubular secretion and protein binding ( f u,p ). The f u,p of the collated substrates ranged from 0.0026 to 1.0 in healthy populations; observed CKD‐related increase in the f u,p (up to 2.7‐fold) of 8 highly bound substrates ( f u,p ≤ 0.2) was accounted for in the analysis. Use of prediction equation based on disease‐related changes in albumin resulted in underprediction of the CKD‐related increase in f u,p of highly bound substrates, highlighting the necessity to measure protein binding in severe CKD. The critical analysis of clinical data for 33 OAT1/3 probes established that decrease in OAT1/3 activity proportional to the changes in GFR was insufficient to recapitulate effects of severe CKD on unbound tubular secretion clearance. OAT1/3‐mediated CL s was estimated to decline by an additional 50% relative to the GFR decline in severe CKD, whereas change in active secretion in mild and moderate CKD was proportional to GFR. Consideration of this additional 50% decline in OAT1/3‐mediated CL s is recommended for physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic models and dose adjustment of OAT1/3 substrates in severe CKD, especially for substrates with high contribution of the active secretion to CL r .",

    "abstract": "Precision dosing strategies require accounting for between‐patient variability in pharmacokinetics together with subsequent pharmacodynamic differences. Liquid biopsy is a valuable new approach to diagnose disease prior to the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms, potentially circumventing invasive tissue biopsies. However, the possibility of quantitative grading of biomarkers, as opposed to simply confirming their presence or absence, is relatively new. In this study, we aimed to verify expression measurements of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and the transporter P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp) in liquid biopsy against genotype and activity phenotype (assessed by the Geneva cocktail approach) in 30 acutely ill patients with cardiovascular disease in a hospital setting. After accounting for exosomal shedding, expression in liquid biopsy correlated with activity phenotype for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP3A, and P‐gp ( r = 0.44–0.70, P ≤ 0.05). Although genotype offered a degree of stratification, large variability (coefficient of variation (CV)) in activity (up to 157%) and expression in liquid biopsy (up to 117%) was observed within each genotype, indicating a mismatch between genotype and phenotype. Further, exosome screening revealed expression of 497 targets relevant to drug metabolism and disposition (159 enzymes and 336 transporters), as well as 20 molecular drug targets. Although there were no functional data available to correlate against these large‐scale measurements, assessment of disease perturbation from healthy baseline was possible. Verification of liquid biopsy against activity phenotype is important to further individualize modeling approaches that aspire to achieve precision dosing from the start of drug treatment without the need for multiple rounds of dose optimization.",

This study aimed to characterize the effect of asciminib exposure on disease progression and to elucidate factors influencing efficacy. Our analysis included 303 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase recruited in a phase I study with dose ranging from 10 to 200 mg twice a day (b.i.d.) or 40 to 200 mg once a day (q.d.)

(NCT03106779). A total of 67 patients harbored the T315I mutation. A longitudinal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was developed to characterize the exposure–efficacy relationship, in which the efficacy was assessed through BCR::ABL1 transcript levels over time. Specifically, a three‐compartment model representing quiescent leukemic stem cells, proliferating bone marrow cells, and resistant cells was developed. Drug killing of the proliferating cells by asciminib was characterized by a power model. A subgroup analysis was performed on the patients with the T315I mutation using a maximum drug effect model to characterize the drug effect. The model demonstrated the appropriateness of a total daily dose of asciminib 80 mg in patients without the T315I mutation and 200 mg b.i.d. in patients with the T315I mutation with further validation in light of safety data. This model captured key characteristics of patients' response to asciminib and helped inform dosing rationale for resistant and difficult‐to‐treat populations.",

    "abstract": "Prior to deployment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) vaccines in the European Union in 2021, a high vaccine uptake leading to an unprecedented volume of safety data from spontaneous reports and real‐world evidence, was anticipated. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) implemented specific activities to ensure enhanced monitoring of emerging vaccine safety information, including intensive monitoring of reports of adverse events of special interest and the use of observed‐to‐expected analyses. The EMA also commissioned several independent observational studies using a large network of electronic healthcare databases and primary data collection via mobile and web‐based applications. This preparedness was key for two high‐profile safety signals: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a new clinical entity associated with adenovirus‐vectored vaccines, and myocarditis/pericarditis with messenger RNA vaccines. With no existing case definition nor background rates, the signal of TTS posed particular challenges. Nevertheless, it was rapidly identified, evaluated, contextualized and the risk minimized thanks to close surveillance and an efficient use of available evidence, clinical expertise and flexible regulatory tools. The two signals illustrated the complementarity between spontaneous and real‐world data, the former enabling rapid risk identification and communication, the latter enabling further characterization. The COVID‐19 pandemic has tremendously enhanced the development of tools and methods to harness the unprecedented volume of safety data generated for the vaccines. Areas for further improvement include the need for better and harmonized data collection across Member States (e.g., stratified vaccine exposure) to support signal evaluation in all population groups, risk contextualization, and safety communication.",

To investigate the potential impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the initiation of clinical trials, we have descriptively analyzed the longitudinal change in phase II and III interventional clinical trials initiated in Europe and in the United States. Based on the public clinical trial register EU Clinical Trials Register and clinicaltrials.gov, we conducted (i) a yearly comparison of the number of initiated trials from 2010 to 2020 and (ii) a monthly comparison from January 2020 to February 2021 of the number of initiated trials. The analyses indicate that the COVID‐19 pandemic affected both the initiation of clinical trials overall and the initiation of non‐COVID‐19 trials. An increase in the overall numbers of clinical trials could be observed both in Europe and the United States in 2020 as compared with 2019. However, the number of non‐COVID‐19 trials initiated is reduced as compared with the previous decade, with a slightly larger relative decrease in the United States as compared to Europe. Additionally, the monthly trend for the initiation of non‐COVID‐19 trials differs between regions. In the United States, after a sharp decrease in April 2020, trial numbers reached the levels of 2019 from June 2020 onward. In Europe, the decrease was less pronounced, but trial numbers mainly remained below the 2019 average until February 2021.",

CysA 75 mg was also given with a 3‐hour interval (75 mg (−3 hours)) to examine the persistence of OATP1B1/1B3 inhibition. The area under the plasma concentration‐time curve ratios (AUCRs) were 1.63, 3.46, and 2.38 (pitavastatin), 1.39, 2.16, and 1.81 (rosuvastatin), and 1.42, 1.77, and 1.85 (valsartan), at 20 mg, 75 mg (−1 hour) and 75 mg (−3 hours) of CysA, respectively. CysA effect on OATP1B1/1B3 was unlikely to persist at the dose examined. Among 26 putative OATP1B1/1B3 biomarkers evaluated, AUCR and maximum concentration ratio ( C max R) of CP‐I showed the highest Pearson’s correlation coefficient with CysA AUC (0.94 and 0.93, respectively). Correlation between AUCR of pitavastatin, and C max R or AUCR of CP‐I were consistent between this study and our previous study using rifampicin as an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor. Nonlinear regression analysis of AUCR −1 of pitavastatin and CP‐I against CysA C max yielded K i,OATP1B1/1B3,app (109 ± 35 and 176 ± 42 nM, respectively), similar to the K i ,OATP1B1/1B3 estimated by our physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic model analysis described previously (107 nM). The endogenous OATP1B1/1B3 biomarkers, particularly C max R and AUCR of CP‐I, corroborates OATP1B1/1B3 inhibition and yields valuable information that improve accurate DDI predictions in drug development, and enhance our understanding of interindividual variability in the magnitude of DDIs.",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme in drug response owing to its involvement in the metabolism of ~ 25% of clinically prescribed medications. The encoding CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic, and many pharmacogenetics studies have been performed worldwide to investigate the distribution of CYP2D6 star alleles (haplotypes); however, African populations have been relatively understudied to date. In this study, the distributions of CYP2D6 star alleles and predicted drug metabolizer phenotypes—derived from activity scores—were examined across multiple sub‐Saharan African populations based on bioinformatics analysis of 961 high‐depth whole genome sequences. This was followed by characterization of novel star alleles and suballeles in a subset of the participants via targeted high‐fidelity Single‐Molecule Real‐Time resequencing (Pacific Biosciences). This study revealed varying frequencies of known CYP2D6 alleles and predicted phenotypes across different African ethnolinguistic groups. Twenty‐seven novel CYP2D6 star alleles were predicted computationally and two of them were further validated. This study highlights the importance of studying variation in key pharmacogenes such as CYP2D6 in the African context to better understand population‐specific allele frequencies. This will aid in the development of better genotyping panels and star allele detection approaches with a view toward supporting effective implementation of precision medicine strategies in Africa and across the African diaspora.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulating therapies, including elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor, are primarily eliminated through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A–mediated metabolism. This creates a therapeutic challenge to the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) due to the potential for significant drug–drug interactions (DDIs). However, the population with CF is more at risk of serious illness following COVID‐19 infection and hence it is important to manage the DDI risk and provide treatment options. CYP3A‐mediated DDI of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor was evaluated using a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic modeling approach. Modeling was performed incorporating physiological information and drug‐dependent parameters of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor to predict the effect of ritonavir (the CYP3A inhibiting component of the combination) on the pharmacokinetics of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor. The elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor models were verified using independent clinical pharmacokinetic and DDI data of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor with a range of CYP3A modulators. When ritonavir was administered on Days 1 through 5, the predicted area under the curve (AUC) ratio of ivacaftor (the most sensitive CYP3A substrate) on Day 6 was 9.31, indicating that its metabolism was strongly inhibited. Based on the predicted DDI, the dose of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor should be reduced when coadministered with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir to elexacaftor 200 mg–tezacaftor 100 mg–ivacaftor 150 mg on Days 1 and 5, with delayed resumption of full‐dose elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor on Day 9, considering the residual inhibitory effect of ritonavir as a mechanism‐based inhibitor. The simulation predicts a regimen of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor administered concomitantly with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir in people with CF that will likely decrease the impact of the drug interaction.",

    "abstract": "Solute carrier (SLC) transporters present as the loci of important drug–drug interactions (DDIs). Therefore, sponsors generate in vitro half‐maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) data and apply regulatory agency‐guided “static” methods to assess DDI risk and the need for a formal clinical DDI study. Because such methods are conservative and high false‐positive rates are likely (e.g., DDI study triggered when liver SLC R value ≥ 1.04 and renal SLC maximal unbound plasma ( C max,u )/IC 50 ratio ≥ 0.02), investigators have attempted to deploy plasma‐ and urine‐based SLC biomarkers in phase I studies to de‐risk DDI and obviate the need for drug probe‐based studies. In this regard, it was possible to generate in‐house in vitro SLC IC 50 data for various clinically (biomarker)‐qualified perpetrator drugs, under standard assay conditions, and then estimate “% inhibition” for each SLC and relate it empirically to published clinical biomarker data (area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) ratio (AUCR, AUC inhibitor /AUC reference ) and % decrease in renal clearance (ΔCL renal )). After such a “calibration” exercise, it was determined that only compounds with high R values (> 1.5) and C max,u /IC 50 ratios (> 0.5) are likely to significantly modulate liver (AUCR > 1.25) and renal (ΔCL renal > 25%) biomarkers and evoke DDI risk. The % inhibition approach supports integration of liver and renal SLC data and allows one to generate pan‐SLC inhibition signatures for different test perpetrators (e.g., SLC % inhibition ranking). In turn, such signatures can guide the selection of the most appropriate individual (or combinations of) biomarkers for testing in phase I studies.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic impairment (HI) is known to modulate drug disposition and may lead to elevated plasma exposure. The aim of this study was to quantitate the in vivo OATP1B‐mediated hepatic uptake activity in populations with varying degrees of HI. First, we measured baseline levels of plasma coproporphyrin‐I, an endogenous OATP1B biomarker, in an open‐label, parallel cohort study in adult subjects with normal liver function and mild, moderate, and severe HI ( n = 24, 6/cohort). The geometric mean plasma concentrations of coproporphyrin‐I were 1.66‐fold, 2.81‐fold ( P < 0.05), and 7.78‐fold ( P < 0.0001) higher in mild, moderate, and severe impairment than those healthy controls. Second, we developed a dataset of 21 OATP1B substrate drugs with HI data extracted from literature. Median disease‐to‐healthy plasma area under the curve (AUC) ratios for substrate drugs were ~ 1.4, 3.0, and 6.4 for mild, moderate, and severe HI, respectively. Additionally, significant linear relationship was noted between AUC ratios of substrate drugs without and with co‐administration of rifampin, a prototypic OATP1B inhibitor, and AUC ratios in moderate ( P < 0.01) and severe ( P < 0.001) HI. Third, a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic model analysis was conducted with 10 substrate drugs following estimation of relative OATP1B functional activity in virtual disease population models using coproporphyrin‐I data and verification of substrate models with rifampin drug–drug interaction data. This approach adequately predicted plasma AUC change particularly in moderate (9 of 10 within 2‐fold) and severe (5 of 5 within 2‐fold) HI. Collective findings indicate progressive reduction, by as much as 90–92%, in OATP1B activity in the HI population.",

    "abstract": "Delivery of biologics via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has demonstrated potential to access the tissues of the central nervous system (CNS) by circumventing the blood‐brain barrier and blood‐CSF barrier. Developing an effective CSF drug delivery strategy requires optimization of multiple parameters, including choice of CSF access point, delivery device technology, and delivery kinetics to achieve effective therapeutic concentrations in the target brain region, whereas also considering the biologic modality, mechanism of action, disease indication, and patient population. This review discusses key preclinical and clinical examples of CSF delivery for different biologic modalities (antibodies, nucleic acid‐based therapeutics, and gene therapy) to the brain via CSF or CNS access routes (intracerebroventricular, intrathecal‐cisterna magna, intrathecal‐lumbar, intraparenchymal, and intranasal), including the use of novel device technologies. This review also discusses quantitative models of CSF flow that provide insight into the effect of fluid dynamics in CSF on drug delivery and CNS distribution. Such models can facilitate delivery device design and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic translation from preclinical species to humans in order to optimize CSF drug delivery to brain regions of interest.",

We investigated the effect of NFIB expression in vitro using 3D liver spheroids, Huh7 cells, and the influence of the NFIB polymorphism on metabolism of risperidone in patients in vivo . We found that NFIB regulates several important pharmacogenes, including CYP2D6 . NFIB inhibited CYP2D6 gene expression in Huh7 cells and NFIB expression in livers was predominantly nuclear and reduced at the mRNA and protein level in carriers of the NFIB rs28379954 T>C allele. Based on 604 risperidone treated patients genotyped for CYP2D6 and NFIB , we found that the rate of risperidone hydroxylation was elevated in NFIB rs28379954 T>C carriers among CYP2D6 normal metabolizers, resulting in a similar rate of drug metabolism to what is observed in CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers, with no such effect observed in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers lacking functional enzyme. The results indicate that NFIB constitutes a novel nuclear factor in the regulation of cytochrome P450 genes, and that its polymorphism is a predictor for the rate of CYP2D6 dependent drug metabolism in vivo .",

P‐gp/BCRP inhibition by drugs in the gut has been reported to increase the systemic exposure to substrate drugs. A previous International Transporter Consortium (ITC) perspective discussed the feasibility of P‐gp/BCRP inhibition at the blood–brain barrier and its implications. This ITC perspective elaborates and discusses specifically the hepatic and renal P‐gp/BCRP (referred as systemic) inhibition of drugs and whether there is any consequence for substrate drug disposition. This perspective summarizes the clinical evidence‐based recommendations regarding systemic P‐gp and BCRP inhibition of drugs with a focus on biliary and active renal excretion pathways. Approaches to assess the clinical relevance of systemic P‐gp and BCRP inhibition in the liver and kidneys included (i) curation of DDIs involving intravenously administered substrates or inhibitors; (ii) in vitro ‐to‐ in vivo extrapolation of P‐gp‐mediated DDIs at the systemic level; and (iii) curation of drugs with information available about the contribution of biliary excretion and related DDIs. Based on the totality of evidence reported to date, this perspective supports limited clinical DDI risk upon P‐gp or BCRP inhibition in the liver or kidneys.",

    "abstract": "Use of hypnotics is often associated with next‐morning residual effects and a higher risk of motor vehicle accidents. Measuring next‐morning effects on driving performance is therefore advised by regulatory agencies. Here, we examined driving performance following administration of daridorexant, a new dual orexin receptor antagonist developed to treat insomnia. Sixty healthy male and female subjects (50–79 years of age) were randomized in a placebo‐ and active‐controlled, four‐way cross‐over study. Each subject received evening administration of daridorexant 50 and 100 mg, zopiclone 7.5 mg, and placebo, in separate treatment phases of 4 days. Simulated driving performance was assessed after initial (day 2) and repeated dosing (day 5), 9 hours postdose. Standard deviation of the lateral position (SDLP) was the main outcome. On both days, with zopiclone, SDLP increased significantly compared with placebo, which confirmed sensitivity of the simulator. With daridorexant, on day 2, the placebo‐corrected mean (97.5% confidence interval) SDLP increased by 2.19 cm (0.46–3.93) and 4.43 cm (2.72–6.15) for 50 and 100 mg, respectively. On day 5, SDLP values for both daridorexant doses were significantly below the prespecified threshold of impairment (2.6 cm) and statistically not different from placebo. Daridorexant showed a lower self‐rated driving quality and higher effort compared to placebo on day 2 but not on day 5. In non‐insomnia subjects, daridorexant impaired simulated driving after initial but not after repeated dosing. Subjects should be cautioned about driving until they know how daridorexant affects them.",

    "abstract": "Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) with cardiovascular diseases who are at higher risk of progressing to critical illness should be treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). Ritonavir, the booster in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, modulates multiple drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, complicating its use in real‐world clinics. We aimed to apply physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to simulate the complex drug–drug interactions (DDIs) of ritonavir with two anticoagulants, rivaroxaban and racemic warfarin, to address this important clinical conundrum. Simulations were implemented within Simcyp Simulator. Compound and population models were adopted from Simcyp and our previous studies. Upon verification and validation of the PBPK model of ritonavir, prospective DDI simulations with the anticoagulants were performed in both the general population (20–65 years) and geriatric subjects (65–85 years) with or without moderate renal impairment. Elevated rivaroxaban concentrations were simulated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment, where the impact was more profound among geriatric subjects with renal impairment. The overexposure of rivaroxaban was restored to normal range on day 4 post‐discontinuation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, corroborating with the recovery of enzyme activity. A lower 10 mg daily dose of rivaroxaban could effectively maintain acceptable systemic exposure of rivaroxaban during nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment. Treatment of ritonavir marginally declined simulated S‐warfarin concentrations, but substantially elevated that of R‐warfarin, resulting in a decrease in the international normalized ratio (INR). As INR only recovered 2 weeks post‐nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment, a longer surveillance INR for warfarin becomes important. Our PBPK‐guided simulations evaluated clinically important yet untested DDIs and supports clinical studies to ensure proper anticoagulation management of patients with COVID‐19 with chronic coagulative abnormalities when initiating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir therapy.",

    "abstract": "Epcoritamab is a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody (bsAb) that induces T‐cell–mediated cytotoxicity against CD20‐positive B cells. Target engagement and crosslinking of CD3 and CD20 (trimer formation) leads to activation and expansion of T cells and killing of malignant B cells. The primary objective of the dose‐escalation part of the phase I/II trial of epcoritamab was to determine the maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase II dose (RP2D), or both. For bsAbs, high target saturation can negatively affect trimer formation. The unique properties and mechanisms of action of bsAbs require novel pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling methods to predict clinical activity and inform RP2D selection. Traditional PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling approaches are inappropriate because they may not adequately predict exposure–response relationships. We developed a semimechanistic, physiologically‐based PK/PD model to quantitatively describe biodistribution, trimer formation, and tumor response using preclinical, clinical PK, biomarker, tumor, and response data from the dose‐escalation part of the phase I/II trial. Clinical trial simulations were performed to predict trimer formation and tumor response in patients with diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL). Model‐predicted trimer formation plateaued at doses of 48 to 96 mg. Simulation results suggest that the 48‐mg dose may achieve optimal response rates in DLBCL and FL. Exposure–safety analyses showed a flat relationship between epcoritamab exposure and risk of cytokine release syndrome in the dose range evaluated. This novel PK/PD modeling approach guided selection of 48 mg as the RP2D and provides a framework that may be applied to other CD3 bsAbs.",

    "abstract": "Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso‐cel) is an autologous, CD19‐directed, chimeric antigen receptor T‐cell product for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B‐cell lymphoma (LBCL) after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy. In vivo cellular expansion after single‐dose administration of liso‐cel has been characterized. In this article, in vivo liso‐cel expansion in the pivotal study TRANSCEND NHL 001 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02631044) was further characterized to assess the relationship between in vivo cellular expansion after single‐dose administration of liso‐cel and efficacy or safety after adjusting for key baseline characteristics. Two bioanalytical methods, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, were used for the assessment of cellular kinetics of liso‐cel, which showed high concordance for in vivo cellular expansion. Multivariable logistic regression analyses demonstrated that higher in vivo cellular expansion of liso‐cel was associated with a higher overall response and complete response rate, and a higher incidence of cytokine release syndrome and neurological events in patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL. Age and tumor burden (by sum of the product of perpendicular diameters) were likely to confound the relationship between in vivo cellular expansion and efficacy, where the association became stronger after controlling for these factors. Repeat dosing of liso‐cel was tested in the study; however, in vivo cellular expansion of liso‐cel was lower after repeat dosing than after the initial dose. These findings should enable a comprehensive understanding of the in vivo cellular kinetics of liso‐cel and the association with outcomes in relapsed/refractory LBCL.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), representing a clinical spectrum ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is rapidly evolving into a global pandemic. Patients with NAFLD are burdened with high rates of metabolic syndrome‐related comorbidities resulting in polypharmacy. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of NAFLD‐mediated changes in drug disposition and efficacy/toxicity. Despite extensive clinical pharmacokinetic data in cirrhosis, current knowledge concerning pharmacokinetic alterations in NAFLD, particularly at different stages of disease progression, is relatively limited. In vitro ‐to‐ in vivo extrapolation coupled with physiologically based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (IVIVE‐PBPK/PD) modeling offers a promising approach for optimizing pharmacologic predictions while refining and reducing clinical studies in this population. Use of IVIVE‐PBPK to predict intra‐organ drug concentrations at pharmacologically relevant sites of action is particularly advantageous when it can be linked to pharmacodynamic effects. Quantitative systems pharmacology/toxicology (QSP/QST) modeling can be used to translate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from PBPK/PD models into clinically relevant predictions of drug response and toxicity. In this review, a detailed summary of NAFLD‐mediated alterations in human physiology relevant to drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) is provided. The application of literature‐derived physiologic parameters and ADME‐associated protein abundance data to inform virtual NAFLD population development and facilitate PBPK/PD, QSP, and QST predictions is discussed along with current limitations of these methodologies and knowledge gaps. The proposed methodologic framework offers great potential for meaningful prediction of pharmacological outcomes in patients with NAFLD and can inform both drug development and clinical practice for this population.",

Significant changes have already been made in the design of the hADME study for many companies, but opportunity exists to continue to re‐think both the design and timing of the hADME study in light of the potential offered by newer technologies, that enable flexibility in particular to reducing the magnitude of the radioactive dose used.

    "abstract": "Ondansetron is commonly used in breastfeeding mothers to treat nausea and vomiting. There is limited information in humans regarding safety of ondansetron exposure to nursing infants and no adequate study looking at ondansetron pharmacokinetics during lactation. We developed a generic physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic lactation model for small molecule drugs and applied this model to predict ondansetron transfer into breast milk and characterize infant exposure. Drug‐specific model inputs were parameterized using data from the literature. Population‐specific inputs were derived from a previously conducted systematic literature review of anatomic and physiologic changes in postpartum women. Model predictions were evaluated using ondansetron plasma and breast milk concentration data collected prospectively from 78 women in the Commonly Used Drugs During Lactation and infant Exposure (CUDDLE) study. The final model predicted breast milk and plasma exposures following a single 4 mg dose of intravenous ondansetron in 1,000 simulated women who were 2 days postpartum. Model predictions showed good agreement with observed data. Breast milk median prediction error (MPE) was 18.4% and median absolute prediction error (MAPE) was 53.0%. Plasma MPE was 32.5% and MAPE was 43.2%. The model‐predicted daily and relative infant doses were 0.005 mg/kg/day and 3.0%, respectively. This model adequately predicted ondansetron passage into breast milk. The calculated low relative infant dose indicates that mothers receiving ondansetron can safely breastfeed. The model building blocks and population database are open‐source and can be adapted to other drugs.",

    "abstract": "This review addresses questions on how to accomplish successful central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery (i.e., having the right concentration at the right CNS site, at the right time), by understanding the rate and extent of blood‐brain barrier (BBB) transport and intra‐CNS distribution in relation to CNS target site(s) exposure. To this end, we need to obtain and integrate quantitative and connected data on BBB using the Combinatory Mapping Approach that includes in vivo and ex vivo animal measurements, and the physiologically based comprehensive LEICNSPK3.0 mathematical model that can translate from animals to humans. For small molecules, slow diffusional BBB transport and active influx and efflux BBB transport determine the differences between plasma and CNS pharmacokinetics. Obviously, active efflux is important for limiting CNS drug delivery. Furthermore, liposomal formulations of small molecules may to a certain extent circumvent active influx and efflux at the BBB. Interestingly, for CNS pathologies, despite all reported disease associated BBB and CNS functional changes in animals and humans, integrative studies typically show a lack of changes on CNS drug delivery for the small molecules. In contrast, the understanding of the complex vesicle‐based BBB transport modes that are important for CNS delivery of large molecules is in progress, and their BBB transport seems to be significantly affected by CNS diseases. In conclusion, today, CNS drug delivery of small drugs can be well assessed and understood by integrative approaches, although there is still quite a long way to go to understand CNS drug delivery of large molecules.",

    "abstract": "Dosing guidance for children with obesity is often unknown despite the fact that nearly 20% of US children are classified as obese. Enoxaparin, a commonly prescribed low‐molecular‐weight heparin, is dosed based on body weight irrespective of obesity status to achieve maximum concentration within a narrow therapeutic or prophylactic target range. However, whether children with and without obesity experience equivalent enoxaparin exposure remains unclear. To address this clinical question, 2,825 anti–activated factor X (anti‐Xa) surrogate concentrations were collected from the electronic health records of 596 children, including those with obesity. Using linear mixed‐effects regression models, we observed that 4‐hour anti‐Xa concentrations were statistically significantly different in children with and without obesity, even for children with the same absolute dose ( P = 0.004). To further mechanistically explore obesity‐associated differences in anti‐Xa concentration, a pediatric physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed in adults, and then scaled to children with and without obesity. This PBPK model incorporated binding of enoxaparin to antithrombin to form anti‐Xa and elimination via heparinase‐mediated metabolism and glomerular filtration. Following scaling, the PBPK model predicted real‐world pediatric concentrations well, with an average fold error (standard deviation of the fold error) of 0.82 (0.23) and 0.87 (0.26) in children with and without obesity, respectively. PBPK model simulations revealed that children with obesity have at most 20% higher 4‐hour anti‐Xa concentrations under recommended, total body weight–based dosing compared to children without obesity owing to reduced weight‐normalized clearance. Enoxaparin exposure was better matched across age groups and obesity status using fat‐free mass weight‐based dosing.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous biomarkers for transporter‐mediated drug‐drug interaction (DDI) predictions represent a promising approach to facilitate and improve conventional DDI investigations in clinical studies. This approach requires high sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers for the targets of interest (e.g., transport proteins), as well as rigorous characterization of their kinetics, which can be accomplished utilizing physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop PBPK models of the endogenous organic cation transporter (OCT)2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)1 substrates creatinine and N 1 ‐methylnicotinamide (NMN). Additionally, this study aimed to predict kinetic changes of the biomarkers during administration of the OCT2 and MATE1 perpetrator drugs trimethoprim, pyrimethamine, and cimetidine. Whole‐body PBPK models of creatinine and NMN were developed utilizing studies investigating creatinine or NMN exogenous administration and endogenous synthesis. The newly developed models accurately describe and predict observed plasma concentration‐time profiles and urinary excretion of both biomarkers. Subsequently, models were coupled to the previously built and evaluated perpetrator models of trimethoprim, pyrimethamine, and cimetidine for interaction predictions. Increased creatinine plasma concentrations and decreased urinary excretion during the drug‐biomarker interactions with trimethoprim, pyrimethamine, and cimetidine were well‐described. An additional inhibition of NMN synthesis by trimethoprim and pyrimethamine was hypothesized, improving NMN plasma and urine interaction predictions. To summarize, whole‐body PBPK models of creatinine and NMN were built and evaluated to better assess creatinine and NMN kinetics while uncovering knowledge gaps for future research. The models can support investigations of renal transporter‐mediated DDIs during drug development.",

    "abstract": "Typically human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies are executed using radiolabeled (e.g., carbon‐14) material, the synthesis of which is a time‐consuming activity. In this study, we were able to assess the metabolism and excretion of unlabeled nirmatrelvir (PF‐07321332) within the first‐in‐human study via a novel application of quantitative fluorine ( 19 F) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in place of a standard radiolabel ADME study. Six healthy participants received a single 300‐mg oral dose of nirmatrelvir (in combination with ritonavir), and excreta were collected up to 10 days. Virtually all drug‐related material was recovered within 5 days, and mass balance was achieved with 84.9 ± 8.9% (range = 70.7–95.5%) of the administered dose recovered in urine and feces. The excretion of fluorine‐containing material in urine and feces was 47.0% and 33.7%, respectively. Unchanged nirmatrelvir represented 82.5% of the normalized drug‐related material with a carboxylic acid metabolite M5, derived from hydrolysis of the P2 amide bond, present at 12.1% of dose. Nirmatrelvir was the only drug‐related entity observed in plasma. Approximately 4.2% of the dose was excreted as metabolite M8 (measured by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry), which was 19 F NMR silent due to hydrolysis of the trifluoroacetamide moiety. Hydrolysis of nirmatrelvir to M5 and M8 was shown to occur in cultures of human gut microflora. This successful demonstration of quantitative 19 F NMR spectroscopy to establish the mass‐balance, excretion, and metabolic profile of nirmatrelvir offers an advantageous means to execute human ADME studies for fluorine‐containing compounds early in drug development.",

We retrospectively analyzed the novel anticancer drugs approved in the United States (US) between 2010 and 2021 to assess the evolving landscape of the drug lags in China by taking Japan and the European Union (EU) as comparisons. The absolute and relative lags of drug initial approval (DIA) and indication approval were calculated between China (or Japan/European Union) and the US based on the US approval date of novel agents, the duration was divided into 2010–2015 and 2016–2021. Overall, 123 (244 indications) new molecular entities (NMEs) approved in the United States were included, of which 58 (94 indications), 72 (128 indications), and 99 (170 indications) NMEs were also approved in China, Japan, and the European Union, respectively. The absolute lags of DIA and indications for approval in China improved dramatically in 2016–2021 compared with 2010–2015. Similarly, the relative DIA and indication approval lags in China decreased significantly in 2016–2021. The median review lags for DIA of China in 2016–2021 were comparable to Japan but dramatically lower than that of the European Union. Nevertheless, China had significantly longer median submission lags for DIA (28 months) in 2016–2021 than that of Japan (6 months) and the European Union (1 month). Although the absolute and relative lags of anticancer drugs in China had been initially addressed, 53% of NMEs and 61% of indications were still not approved for cancers in China compared with the United States. Therefore, China should adopt steps to further reduce drug lags.",

Biosimilarity is mainly established on the basis of demonstrated similarity of relevant quality attributes (QAs), determined by comprehensive physiochemical and functional analyses, and demonstration of bioequivalence. In addition, comparative efficacy/safety studies have been requested for all approved biosimilar mAbs so far, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Guidelines state that such confirmatory clinical trials may not be necessary in specific circumstances. In order to evaluate the degree of analytical similarity, how residual uncertainty regarding biosimilarity was resolved, and the value of clinical data, we analyzed the quality and clinical data packages for authorized adalimumab (7 products) and bevacizumab (5 products) biosimilars. The percentage of biosimilar batches meeting the similarity range for QAs, as defined by the biosimilar manufacturer based on a comprehensive characterization of the EU reference product (RP), was determined and clinical data were reviewed. Our analyses show that QAs of approved adalimumab and bevacizumab biosimilars have varying concordance with the EU‐RP similarity range. In this study, we found that clinical efficacy data played a limited role in addressing quality concerns. Therefore, we encourage a regulatory review of the standards for clinical data requirements for mAb and fusion protein biosimilars. This study outlines a quality data driven approach for facilitating tailored clinical programs for biosimilars.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about infant’s safety of chemotherapy during breastfeeding where evidence is limited to a few case reports. This lack of knowledge has led to a general tendency to advise against breastfeeding during cytotoxic therapy despite the overwhelming benefits that breastfeeding offers to both the mothers and their children. In this case series, the presence of five chemotherapies in breast milk was determined. The aim was to obtain insight into the presence of these drugs in breast milk to inform and help clinicians in making informed decisions for women who want to breastfeed. Three patients collected 24‐hour samples of breast milk every day for 1, 2, or 3 weeks after chemotherapy, 210 in total. After determination of drug concentrations, the infant daily dose, relative daily infant dose (RID%) and cumulative RID were calculated. Cumulative RIDs in patients varied from 10% to values lower than 1%. Rich data allowed us to design a table which gives predictions on the amount of days that breast milk has to be discarded to reach cumulative RIDs below 5, 1, and 0.1% for each compound. For cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, cumulative RIDs below 1 or 0.1% are reached if breast milk is discarded for 1–3 days after administration. This might suggest that breastfeeding in between cycles is an option. However, other pharmacological parameters should also be taken into consideration. For doxorubicin, also the levels of the active metabolite doxorubicinol need quantification. Similarly, breastfeeding during treatment with cisplatin might give substantial exposure and we advise caution.",

    "abstract": "Coproporphyrin I (CPI) is an endogenous biomarker of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B transporter (OATP1B). CPI plasma baseline was reported to increase with severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Further, ratio of CPI area under the plasma concentration‐time curve (AUCR) in the presence/absence of OATP1B inhibitor rifampin was higher in patients with CKD compared with healthy participants, in contrast to pitavastatin (a clinical OATP1B probe). This study investigated mechanism(s) contributing to altered CPI baseline in patients with CKD by extending a previously developed physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to this patient population. CKD‐related covariates were evaluated in a stepwise manner on CPI fraction unbound in plasma ( f u,p ), OATP1B‐mediated hepatic uptake clearance ( CL active ), renal clearance ( CL R ), and endogenous synthesis ( k syn ). The CPI model successfully recovered increased baseline and rifampin‐mediated AUCR in patients with CKD by accounting for the following disease‐related changes: 13% increase in f u,p , 29% and 39% decrease in CL active in mild and moderate to severe CKD, respectively, decrease in CL R proportional to decline in glomerular filtration rate, and 27% decrease in k syn in severe CKD. Almost complete decline in CPI renal elimination in severe CKD increased its fraction transported by OATP1B, rationalizing differences in the CPI–rifampin interaction observed between healthy participants and patients with CKD. In conclusion, mechanistic modeling performed here supports CKD‐related decrease in OATP1B function to inform prospective PBPK modeling of OATP1B‐mediated drug‐drug interaction in these patients. Monitoring of CPI allows detection of CKD–drug interaction risk for OATP1B drugs with combined hepatic and renal elimination which may be underestimated by extrapolating the interaction risk based on pitavastatin data in healthy participants.",

    "abstract": "Real‐world data (RWD) and real‐world evidence (RWE) are becoming essential tools for informing regulatory decision making in health care and offer an opportunity for all stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem to evaluate medical products throughout their lifecycle. Although considerable interest has been given to regulatory decisions supported by RWE for treatment authorization, especially in rare diseases, less attention has been given to RWD/RWE related to in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products and clinical decision support systems (CDSS). This review examines current regulatory practices in relation to IVD product development and discusses the use of CDSS in assisting clinicians to retrieve, filter, and analyze patient data in support of complex decisions regarding diagnosis and treatment. The review then explores how utilizing RWD could augment regulatory body understanding of test performance, clinical outcomes, and benefit‐risk profiles, and how RWD could be leveraged to augment CDSS and improve safety, quality, and efficiency of healthcare practices. Whereas we present examples of RWD assisting in the regulation of IVDs and CDSS, we also highlight key challenges within the current healthcare system which are impeding the potential of RWE to be fully realized. These challenges include issues such as data availability, reliability, accessibility, harmonization, and interoperability, often for reasons specific to diagnostics. Finally, we review ways that these challenges are actively being addressed and discuss how private‐public collaborations and the implementation of standardized language and protocols are working toward producing more robust RWD and RWE to support regulatory decision making.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic proteins may first be developed as intravenous (i.v.) therapies with new subcutaneous (s.c.) dosage forms being subsequently developed to provide an alternative route of administration. As of August 2022, there have been 9 therapeutic proteins which were developed as a new s.c. dosage form after the approval of the corresponding i.v. product. This article provides a systematic review of prior experiences in the i.v. to s.c. switch development programs. We describe what types of clinical studies were conducted to support the i.v. to s.c. switch for these nine therapeutic proteins. Publicly available scientific advice from health authorities is summarized, particularly regarding recommendations on overall development strategy, dose selection, immunogenicity assessment, and indication extrapolation. The clinical data from these i.v. to s.c. development programs demonstrate that: (1) when switching from i.v. dosing to s.c. dosing, trough drug concentration ( C trough ) from s.c. dosing should not be inferior to i.v. dosing with average drug concentration ( C avg ; equivalent to AUC, area under the curve after correcting for dosing intervals between i.v. and s.c. administration) being matched or non‐inferior to i.v. dosing; and (2) with appropriate s.c. dose regimens, treatment with s.c. therapeutic proteins can generally achieve similar efficacy and safety as the corresponding i.v. products, suggesting that the much higher maximum concentration ( C max ) after i.v. infusion as compared with that from s.c. injection is often not relevant to the treatment effect.",

The objective of this study was to validate the ability of the ABCD‐GENE score to predict the risk for atherothrombotic events in a diverse, real‐world population of clopidogrel‐treated patients who underwent PCI and received clinical CYP2C19 genotyping to guide antiplatelet therapy. A total of 2,341 adult patients who underwent PCI, were genotyped for CYP2C19 , and received treatment with clopidogrel across four institutions were included (mean age 64 ± 12 years, 35% women, and 20% Black). The primary outcome was major atherothrombotic events, defined as the composite of all‐cause death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, stent thrombosis, or revascularization for unstable angina within 12 months following PCI. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or stent thrombosis, was assessed as the secondary outcome. Outcomes were compared between patients with an ABCD‐GENE score ≥ 10 vs. < 10. The risk of major atherothrombotic events was higher in patients with an ABCD‐GENE score ≥ 10 ( n = 505) vs. < 10 ( n = 1,836; 24.6 vs. 14.7 events per 100 patient‐years, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23–2.25, P < 0.001). The risk for MACE was also higher among patients with a score ≥ 10 vs. < 10 (16.7 vs. 10.1 events per 100 patient‐years, adjusted HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.11–2.30, P = 0.013). Our diverse, real‐world data demonstrate diminished clopidogrel effectiveness in post‐PCI patients with an ABCD‐GENE score ≥ 10.",

A multitude of strategies are available; however, it is unclear which strategies are effective and which metrics are used to quantify clinical utility. The objective of this scoping review was to aggregate previous studies into a cohesive depiction of the current state of PGx CDS implementations and identify areas for future research on PGx CDS. Articles were included if they (i) described electronic CDS tools for PGx and (ii) reported metrics related to PGx CDS. Twenty of 3,449 articles were included and provided data on PGx CDS metrics from 15 institutions, with 93% of programs located at academic medical centers. The most common tools in CDS implementations were interruptive post‐test alerts. Metrics for clinical response and alert response ranged from 12–73% and 21–98%, respectively. Few data were found on changes in metrics over time and measures that drove the evolution of CDS systems. Relatively few data were available regarding support of optimal approaches for PGx CDS. Post‐test alerts were the most widely studied approach, and their effectiveness varied greatly. Further research on the usability, effectiveness, and optimization of CDS tools is needed.",

    "abstract": "Transporters contribute to renal elimination of drugs; therefore drug disposition can be impacted if transporters are inhibited by comedicant drugs. Regulatory agencies have provided guidelines to assess potential drug–drug interaction (DDI) risk for renal organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 and 2‐K (MATE1/2‐K) transporters. Despite this, there are challenges with translating in vitro data using currently available tools to obtain a quantitative assessment of DDI risk in the clinic. Given the high number of drugs and new molecular entities showing in vitro inhibition toward OCT2 and/or MATE1/2‐K and the lack of translation to clinically significant effects, it is reasonable to question whether the current in vitro assay design and modeling practice has led to unnecessary clinical evaluation. The aim of this review is to assess and discuss available in vitro and clinical data along with prediction models intended to provide clinical context of risk, including static models proposed by regulatory agencies and physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic models, in order to identify best practices and areas of future opportunity. This analysis highlights that different in vitro assay designs, including substrate and cell systems used, strongly influence the derived concentration of drug producing 50% inhibition values and contribute to high variability observed across laboratories. Furthermore, the lack of sensitive index substrates coupled with specific inhibitors for individual transporters necessitates the use of complex models to evaluate clinical DDI risk.",

    "abstract": "Although the population in the United States is diverse, there are disparities in healthcare outcomes in some populations, for example, based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sex, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. Despite disproportionate healthcare outcomes, certain populations are frequently under‐represented in clinical trials intended to support applications requesting US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market a drug or biologic. Additionally, safety and efficacy of therapeutic products may vary based on intrinsic (e.g., sex, age, race, and ethnicity) and/or extrinsic (e.g., drug interactions and medical practice) factors. Enrolling diverse populations in clinical trials can aid in addressing disparities and better inform the use of medical products in all patients who will use them upon approval. Herein, we outline a few initiatives and activities, such as policy development, regulatory review, regulatory research, and stakeholder engagement, that the FDA has undertaken to promote diversity in clinical trials, to support submission of such information in marketing applications for subgroup analyses, and to communicate information to the public.",

Evaluation of alternate PrEP products will require innovation to avoid the unpractically large sample sizes in noninferiority trials. We propose estimating HIV incidence in people not on PrEP as an external counterfactual to which on‐PrEP incidence in trial subjects can be compared. HIV recent infection testing algorithms (RITAs), such as the limiting antigen avidity assay plus viral load used on specimens from untreated HIV positive people identified during screening, is one possible approach. Its feasibility is partly dependent on the sample size needed to ensure adequate power, which is impacted by RITA performance, the number of recent infections identified, the expected efficacy of the intervention, and other factors. Screening sample sizes to support detection of an 80% reduction in incidence for 3 key populations are more modest, and comparable to the number of participants in recent phase III PrEP trials. Sample sizes would be significantly larger in populations with lower incidence, where the false recency rate is higher or if PrEP efficacy is expected to be lower. Our proposed counterfactual approach appears to be feasible, offers high statistical power, and is nearly contemporaneous with the on‐PrEP population. It will be important to monitor the performance of this approach during new product development for HIV prevention. If successful, it could be a model for preventive HIV vaccines and prevention of other infectious diseases.",

PET is therefore a key tool for early phases of drug discovery programs. This review will summarize the main applications of PET in early drug development and discuss the usefulness of PET microdosing studies performed with direct labelling of the NCE and PET occupancy studies. The purpose of this review is also to propose an alignment of the nomenclatures used by drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic scientists and PET imaging scientists to indicate key pharmacokinetic parameters and to provide guidance in the performance and interpretation of PET studies.",

    "abstract": "Community‐centric approaches to engage underrepresented populations—including community engagement, community‐level consent practices, and capacity development for research—are means to enhance diversity in biomedical research populations in a more ethical way. Low diversity is a known problem in biomedical research that presents challenges in translating the benefits of research to the global population. Through long‐term partnerships built on trust and collaboration, communities who would otherwise avoid research may be more willing to participate. When communities are engaged in research as partners and research questions are motivated by community health priorities, research is more meaningful and research methods are more respectful. Conversely, a lack of consultation throughout the research process can further alienate the very communities that these efforts are designed to engage. A number of underserved populations—for example American Indian and Alaska Native peoples—may value the benefits of research to a community equally or more than individual benefits. A community's autonomy must be considered, particularly when that community is not adequately protected by traditional informed consent processes. Opportunities for capacity development to support collaborative partnerships between communities and researchers are required to support engagement and understanding of the research process. Changes to research processes and infrastructure that encourage a higher level of research oversight within the community should be supported. In this paper, we present approaches that may improve diversity and equitable access to research and the delivery of health innovations for people that have historically been left out of biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, genomewide association studies (GWASs) have identified the specific genetics variants contributing to many complex diseases by testing millions of genetic variations across the human genome against a variety of phenotypes. However, GWASs are limited in their ability to uncover mechanistic insight given that most significant associations are found in non‐coding region of the genome. Furthermore, the lack of diversity in studies has stymied the advance of precision medicine for many historically excluded populations. In this review, we summarize most popular multi‐omics approaches (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) related to precision medicine and highlight if diverse populations have been included and how their findings have advance biological understanding of disease and drug response. New methods that incorporate local ancestry have been to improve the power of GWASs for admixed populations (such as African Americans and Latinx). Because most signals from GWAS are in the non‐coding region, other machine learning and omics approaches have been developed to identify the potential causative single‐nucleotide polymorphisms and genes that explain these phenotypes. These include polygenic risk scores, expression quantitative trait locus mapping, and transcriptome‐wide association studies. Analogous protein methods, such as proteins quantitative trait locus mapping, proteome‐wide association studies, and metabolomic approaches provide insight into the consequences of genetic variation on protein abundance. Whereas, integrated multi‐omics studies have improved our understanding of the mechanisms for genetic association, we still lack the datasets and cohorts for historically excluded populations to provide equity in precision medicine and pharmacogenomics.",

The SLCO1B1*5 allele has previously been associated with simvastatin discontinuation and SAMSs. Prior analyses of the relationship between SLCO1B1*5 and atorvastatin muscle side effects have been inconclusive due to insufficient power. We now quantify the impact of SLCO1B1*5 on atorvastatin discontinuation and SAMSs in a large observational cohort using electronic medical record data from a single health care system. In our study cohort ( n = 1,627 patients exposed to atorvastatin during the course of routine clinical care), 56% ( n = 912 of 1,627 patients) discontinued atorvastatin and 18% ( n = 303 of 1,627 patients) developed SAMSs. A univariate model revealed that SLCO1B1*5 increased the likelihood that patients would stop atorvastatin during routine care (odds ratio 1.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1–1.5; P = 0.04). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model further demonstrated that this same variant was associated with time to atorvastatin discontinuation (hazard ratio 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.4; P = 0.004). Additional time‐to‐event analyses also revealed that SCLO1B1*5 was associated with SAMSs (hazard ratio 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7; P = 0.02). Atorvastatin discontinuation was associated with SAMSs (odds ratio 1.67; P = 0.0001) in our cohort.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested an association between sulfonylureas and an increased risk of cardiovascular death among patients with type 2 diabetes. A potential mechanism involves sulfonylurea‐induced ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). We conducted a systematic review of observational studies to determine whether the use of sulfonylureas, compared with the use of other antihyperglycemic drugs, is associated with the risk of VA (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and premature ventricular complexes), cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death among patients with type 2 diabetes. Two independent reviewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to July 2021 for observational studies comparing sulfonylureas vs. other antihyperglycemic therapies or intraclass comparisons of sulfonylureas. Our systematic review included 17 studies (1,607,612 patients). Per Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS)‐I, there were few high‐quality studies (2 studies at moderate risk of bias; 4 at serious risk; and 11 at critical risk). All studies at a moderate or serious risk of bias reporting comparisons with other therapies were consistent with an increased risk of VA. Sulfonylureas were associated with a higher risk of arrhythmia vs. dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27–1.80) and of VA vs. metformin (aHR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.10–2.13). One moderate quality study reported inconsistent results for a composite of cardiac arrest/VA in analyses of US Medicaid claims and Optum claims data. Our systematic review suggests that, among higher‐quality observational studies, sulfonylureas are associated with an increased risk of VA. However, we identified few methodologically rigorous studies, underscoring the need for additional real‐world studies.",

    "abstract": "PF‐06835919 is a first‐in‐class ketohexokinase inhibitor (KHKi), recently under development for the treatment of metabolic and fatty liver diseases, which inhibited organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 in vitro and presented drug–drug interaction (DDI) risk. This study aims to investigate the dose‐dependent effect of KHKi on OATP1B in vivo activity. We performed an open‐label study comparing pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin (OATP1B probe) dosed alone (20 mg single dose) and coadministered with two dose strengths of KHKi (50 and 280 mg once daily) in 12 healthy participants. Additionally, changes in exposure of coproporphyrin‐I (CP‐I), an endogenous biomarker for OATP1B, were assessed in the atorvastatin study (1.12‐fold and 1.49‐fold increase in area under the plasma concentration‐time profile (AUC) with once‐daily 50 and 280 mg, respectively), and a separate single oral dose study of KHKi alone (100–600 mg, n = 6 healthy participants; up to a 1.80‐fold increase in AUC). Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of atorvastatin AUC following 50 and 280 mg KHKi were 1.14 (1.00–1.30) and 1.54 (1.37–1.74), respectively. Physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic modeling of CP‐I plasma exposure following a single dose of KHKi predicted in vivo OATP1B inhibition from about 13% to 70% over the 100 to 600 mg dose range, while using the in vitro inhibition potency (1.9 µM). Model‐based analysis correctly predicted “no‐effect” (AUC ratio < 1.25) at the low dose range and “weak” effect (AUC ratio < 2) on atorvastatin pharmacokinetics at the high dose range of KHKi. This study exemplified the utility of biomarker‐informed model‐based approach in discerning even small effects on OATP1B activity in vivo , and to project DDI risk at the clinically relevant doses.",

    "abstract": "Abrocitinib is an oral Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor currently approved in the United Kingdom for the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe atopic dermatitis (AD). As patients with AD may use medications to manage comorbidities, abrocitinib could be used concomitantly with hepatic and/or renal transporter substrates. Therefore, we assessed the potential effect of abrocitinib on probe drugs and endogenous biomarker substrates for the drug transporters of interest. In vitro studies indicated that, among the transporters tested, abrocitinib has the potential to inhibit the activities of P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 and 2K (MATE1/2K). Therefore, subsequent phase I, two‐way crossover, open‐label studies in healthy participants were performed to assess the impact of abrocitinib on the pharmacokinetics of the transporter probe substrates dabigatran etexilate (P‐gp), rosuvastatin (BCRP and OAT3), and metformin (OCT2 and MATE1/2K), as well as endogenous biomarkers for MATE1/2K (N 1 ‐methylnicotinamide (NMN)) and OCT1 (isobutyryl‐ L ‐carnitine (IBC)). Co‐administration with abrocitinib was shown to increase the plasma exposure of dabigatran by ~ 50%. In comparison, the plasma exposure and renal clearance of rosuvastatin and metformin were not altered with abrocitinib co‐administration. Similarly, abrocitinib did not affect the exposure of NMN or IBC. An increase in dabigatran exposure suggests that abrocitinib inhibits P‐gp activity. By contrast, a lack of impact on plasma exposure and/or renal clearance of rosuvastatin, metformin, NMN, or IBC suggests that BCRP, OAT3, OCT1, and MATE1/2K activity are unaffected by abrocitinib.",

In addition, baricitinib has recently received Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, although the instruction provided dosing information only for adults. Geriatrics with organ dysfunction are one of the most vulnerable cohorts when combating the pandemic. The aim of the present work was to evaluate current dosing strategies of baricitinib and tofacitinib for potential COVID‐19 treatment for White and Chinese geriatric patients with chronic renal impairment. An established physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling framework for age‐dependent simulations was utilized. PBPK drug models adopted from literature were first verified. Several population models representing different age groups, ethnicities, and stages of renal impairment were used for prospective simulations. Notwithstanding the increase in systemic exposure of both drugs resulting from renal dysfunction was more pronounced for geriatrics than general White populations, our simulations confirmed their current dosage adjustments based on renal functions are broadly adequate. The exception being White older subjects with mild renal impairment where current recommendation of 4 mg baricitinib yielded a 2.31‐fold increase in systemic exposure, and reduction to 2 mg could mitigate the potential risk to an acceptable 1.15‐fold. Comparable relationships between systemic exposure and renal dysfunction were observed for both drugs in the Chinese population. In summary, PBPK modeling of both JAK inhibitors supports the rational and prudent dose adjustments of these COVID‐19 therapeutics among adult patients of different age groups and renal functions.",

    "abstract": "The impact of liver cancer metastasis on protein abundance of 22 drug‐metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and 25 transporters was investigated using liquid chromatography‐tandem accurate mass spectrometry targeted proteomics. Microsomes were prepared from liver tissue taken from 15 healthy individuals and 18 patients with cancer (2 primary and 16 metastatic). Patient samples included tumors and matching histologically normal tissue. The levels of cytochrome P450 (CYPs 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, and 3A5) and uridine 5′‐diphospho‐glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs 1A1, 1A6, 1A9, 2B15, 2B4, and 2B7) were lower in histologically normal tissue from patients relative to healthy controls (up to 6.6‐fold) and decreased further in tumors (up to 21‐fold for CYPs and 58‐fold for UGTs). BSEP and MRPs were also suppressed in histologically normal (up to 3.1‐fold) and tumorous tissue (up to 6.3‐fold) relative to healthy individuals. Abundance of OCT3, OAT2, OAT7, and OATPs followed similar trends (up to 2.9‐fold lower in histologically normal tissue and up to 16‐fold lower in tumors). Abundance of NTCP and OCT1 was also lower (up to 9‐fold). Interestingly, monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 was more abundant (3.3‐fold) in tumors, the only protein target to show this pattern. These perturbations could be attributed to inflammation. Interindividual variability was substantially higher in patients with cancer. Proteomics‐informed physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models of 50 drugs with different attributes and hepatic extraction ratios (Simcyp) showed substantially lower drug clearance with cancer‐specific parameters compared with default parameters. In conclusion, this study provides values for decreased abundance of DMEs and transporters in liver cancer, which enables using population‐specific abundance for these patients in PBPK modeling.",

    "abstract": "Delamanid and bedaquiline are two drugs approved to treat drug‐resistant tuberculosis, and each have been associated with corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation. We aimed to investigate the relationships between the drugs' plasma concentrations and the prolongation of observed QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) and to evaluate their combined effects on QTcF, using a model‐based population approach. Furthermore, we predicted the safety profiles of once daily regimens. Data were obtained from a trial where participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive delamanid, bedaquiline, or delamanid + bedaquiline. The effect on QTcF of delamanid and/or its metabolite (DM‐6705) and the pharmacodynamic interactions under coadministration were explored based on a published model between bedaquiline's metabolite (M2) and QTcF. The metabolites of each drug were found to be responsible for the drug‐related QTcF prolongation. The final drug‐effect model included a competitive interaction between M2 and DM‐6705 acting on the same cardiac receptor and thereby reducing each other's apparent potency, by 28% (95% confidence interval (CI), 22–40%) for M2 and 33% (95% CI, 24–54%) for DM‐6705. The generated combined effect was not greater but close to “additivity” in the analyzed concentration range. Predictions with the final model suggested a similar QT prolonging potential with simplified, once‐daily dosing regimens compared with the approved regimens, with a maximum median change from baseline QTcF increase of 20 milliseconds in both regimens. The concentrations–QTcF relationship of the combination of bedaquiline and delamanid was best described by a competitive binding model involving the two main metabolites. Model predictions demonstrated that QTcF prolongation with simplified once daily regimens would be comparable to currently used dosing regimens.",

    "abstract": "Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are commonly used to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Endorsed by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and the European Society of Cardiology, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have displaced warfarin as the OAC of choice for both conditions, due to improved safety profiles, fewer drug–drug and drug–diet interactions, and lack of monitoring requirements. Despite their widespread use and improved safety over warfarin, DOAC‐related bleeding remains a major concern for patients. DOACs have stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; however, variability in DOAC response is common and may be attributed to numerous factors, including patient‐specific factors, concomitant medications, comorbid conditions, and genetics. Although DOAC randomized controlled trials included patients of varying ages and levels of kidney function, they failed to include patients of diverse ancestries. Additionally, current evidence to support DOAC pharmacogenetic associations have primarily been derived from European and Asian individuals. Given differences in genotype frequencies and disease burden among patients of different biogeographic groups, future research must engage diverse populations to assess and quantify the impact of predictors on DOAC response. Current under‐representation of patients from diverse racial groups does not allow for proper generalization of the influence of clinical and genetic factors in relation to DOAC variability. Herein, we discuss factors affecting DOAC response, such as age, sex, weight, kidney function, drug interactions, and pharmacogenetics, while offering a new perspective on the need for further research including frequently excluded groups.",

We performed high‐throughput screening for clinically relevant DDIs with methadone or buprenorphine by combining pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacokinetic approaches. We conducted pharmacoepidemiologic screening via a series of self‐controlled case series studies (SCCS) in Optum claims data from 2000 to 2019. We included persons 18 years or older who experienced an outcome of interest during target drug treatment. Exposures were all overlapping medications (i.e., the candidate precipitants) during target drug treatment. Outcomes were opioid overdose, non‐overdose adverse effects, and cardiac arrest. We used conditional Poisson regression to calculate rate ratios, accounting for multiple comparisons with semi‐Bayes shrinkage. We explored the impact of key study design choices in analyses that varied the exposure definitions of the target drugs and the candidate precipitant drugs. Pharmacokinetic screening was conducted by incorporating published data on CYP enzyme metabolism into an equation‐based static model. In SCCS analysis, 1,432 events were included from 248,069 new users of methadone or buprenorphine. In the primary analysis, statistically significant DDIs included gabapentinoids with either methadone or buprenorphine; baclofen with methadone; and benzodiazepines with methadone. In sensitivity analysis, additional statistically significant DDIs included methocarbamol, quetiapine, or simvastatin with methadone. Pharmacokinetic screening identified two moderate‐to‐strong potential DDIs (clonidine and fluconazole with buprenorphine). The combination of clonidine and buprenorphine was also associated with a significantly increased risk of opioid overdose in pharmacoepidemiologic screening. These DDI signals may be the most important targets for future confirmation studies.",

    "abstract": "Intravenous busulfan doses are often personalized to a target plasma exposure (targeted busulfan) using an individual’s busulfan clearance (BuCL). We evaluated whether BuCL could be predicted by a predose plasma panel of 841 endogenous metabolomic compounds (EMCs). In this prospective cohort of 132 hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients, all had samples collected immediately before busulfan administration (preBU) and 96 had samples collected 2 weeks before busulfan (2‐week‐preBU). BuCL was significantly associated with 37 EMCs after univariate linear regression analysis and controlling for false discovery (< 0.05) in the 132 preBU samples. In parallel, with preBU samples, we included all 841 EMCs in a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator–penalized regression which selected 13 EMCs as predominantly associated with BuCL. Then, we constructed a prediction model by estimating coefficients for these 13 EMCs, along with sex, using ordinary least‐squares. When the resulting linear prediction model was applied to the 2‐week‐preBU samples, it explained 40% of the variation in BuCL (adjusted R 2 = 0.40). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed 18 pathways associated with BuCL. Lysine degradation followed by steroid biosynthesis, which aligned with the univariate analysis, were the top two pathways. BuCL can be predicted before busulfan administration with a linear regression model of 13 EMCs. This pharmacometabolomics method should be prioritized over use of a busulfan test dose or pharmacogenomics to guide busulfan dosing. These results highlight the potential of pharmacometabolomics as a precision medicine tool to improve or replace pharmacokinetics to personalize busulfan doses.",

    "abstract": "Selecting the right dose is a significant challenge in designing clinical development programs, especially for slowly progressing diseases lacking predictive biomarkers of efficacy that may require long‐term treatment to assess clinical benefit. Gantenerumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to aggregated amyloid‐beta, was tested in two 24‐month phase III studies (NCT01224106, NCT02051608) in participants with prodromal and mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD), respectively. Dosing in the first phase III study was suspended after a preplanned interim futility analysis in 2014. Subsequently, a dose–response relationship was observed in a subgroup of fast AD progressors that, together with contemporary aducanumab (another anti–amyloid‐beta mAb) data, indicated higher doses may be needed for clinical efficacy. The gantenerumab phase III studies were therefore transformed into dose‐finding, open‐label extension (OLE) trials. Two exposure–response models were developed to support dose selection via simulations for the OLEs: a pharmacokinetics (PK)/PET (positron emission tomography) model describing amyloid removal using PET data from low‐dose gantenerumab and high‐dose aducanumab, and a PK/ARIA‐E (amyloid‐related imaging abnormalities‐edema) model describing the occurrence of ARIA‐E events leveraging an existing bapineuzumab model. Multiple regimens were designed to gradually up‐titrate participants to the target dose of 1,200 mg gantenerumab every 4 weeks to mitigate the increased risk of ARIA‐E events that may be associated with higher doses of anti–amyloid‐beta antibodies. Favorable OLE data that matched well with model predictions supported the decision to continue the gantenerumab clinical development program and further apply model‐based analytical techniques to optimize the design of new phase III studies.",

    "abstract": "As the scientific research community along with healthcare professionals and decision makers around the world fight tirelessly against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, the need for comparative effectiveness research (CER) on preventive and therapeutic interventions for COVID‐19 is immense. Randomized controlled trials markedly under‐represent the frail and complex patients seen in routine care, and they do not typically have data on long‐term treatment effects. The increasing availability of electronic health records (EHRs) for clinical research offers the opportunity to generate timely real‐world evidence reflective of routine care for optimal management of COVID‐19. However, there are many potential threats to the validity of CER based on EHR data that are not originally generated for research purposes. To ensure unbiased and robust results, we need high‐quality healthcare databases, rigorous study designs, and proper implementation of appropriate statistical methods. We aimed to describe opportunities and challenges in EHR‐based CER for COVID‐19‐related questions and to introduce best practices in pharmacoepidemiology to minimize potential biases. We structured our discussion into the following topics: (1) study population identification based on exposure status; (2) ascertainment of outcomes; (3) common biases and potential solutions; and (iv) data operational challenges specific to COVID‐19 CER using EHRs. We provide structured guidance for the proper conduct and appraisal of drug and vaccine effectiveness and safety research using EHR data for the pandemic.

    "abstract": "Dual toll‐like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR8 inhibitor enpatoran is under investigation as a treatment for lupus and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pneumonia. Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PopPK/PD) model‐based simulations, using PK and PD (inhibition of ex vivo ‐stimulated interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) and interferon‐α (IFN‐α) secretion) data from a phase I study of enpatoran in healthy participants, were leveraged to inform dose selection for lupus and repurposed for accelerated development in COVID‐19. A two‐compartment PK model was linked to sigmoidal maximum effect (E max ) models with proportional decrease from baseline characterizing the PD responses across the investigated single and multiple doses, up to 200 mg daily for 14 days ( n = 72). Concentrations that maintain 50/60/90% inhibition (IC 50/60/90 ) of cytokine secretion (IL‐6/IFN‐α) over 24 hours were estimated and stochastic simulations performed to assess target coverage under different dosing regimens. Simulations suggested investigating 25, 50, and 100 mg enpatoran twice daily (b.i.d.) to explore the anticipated therapeutic dose range for lupus. With 25 mg b.i.d., > 50% of subjects are expected to achieve 60% inhibition of IL‐6. With 100 mg b.i.d., most subjects are expected to maintain almost complete target coverage for 24 hours (> 80% subjects IC 90,IL‐6 = 15.5 ng/mL; > 60% subjects IC 90,IFN‐α = 22.1 ng/mL). For COVID‐19, 50 and 100 mg enpatoran b.i.d. were recommended; 50 mg b.i.d. provides shorter IFN‐α inhibition (median time above IC 90 = 13 hours/day), which may be beneficial to avoid interference with the antiviral immune response. Utilization of PopPK/PD models initially developed for lupus enabled informed dose selection for the accelerated development of enpatoran in COVID‐19.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the survival outcomes associated with real‐world bisphosphonate use, stratified by fracture site, type, administration, and duration of treatment, among patients with osteoporosis. A systematic review that incorporates our findings was conducted to provide up‐to‐date evidence on survival outcomes with bisphosphonate treatment in real‐world settings. Patients diagnosed with osteoporosis who had been hospitalized for major fractures were identified from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database 2008–2017 and followed until 2018. There were 24,390 new bisphosphonate users who were classified and compared with 76,725 nonusers of anti‐osteoporosis medications in terms of survival outcomes using Cox model analysis. An inverse probability of treatment weighted Cox model and landmark analyses for minimizing immortal time bias were also performed. Bisphosphonate users vs. nonusers had a significantly lower mortality risk, regardless of fracture site (hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for patients with any major fracture, hip fracture, and vertebral fracture: 0.90 (0.88, 0.93), 0.83 (0.80, 0.86), and 0.86 (0.82, 0.89), respectively). Compared with nonuse, zoledronic acid (0.77 (0.73, 0.82)) was associated with the lowest mortality, followed by ibandronate (0.85 (0.78, 0.93)) and alendronate/risedronate (0.93 (0.91, 0.96)). Using bisphosphonates for ≥ 3 years had lower mortality (0.60 (0.53, 0.67)) than using bisphosphonates for < 3 years (0.98 (0.95, 1.01)). Intravenous bisphosphonates had a lower mortality than that of oral bisphosphonates. Our results are consistent with the systematic review findings among real‐world populations. In conclusion, bisphosphonate use, especially persistence to intravenous bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid), may reduce post‐fracture mortality among patients with osteoporosis, particularly those with hip/vertebral fractures. This supports the rational use of bisphosphonates in post‐fracture care.",

Ketamine PK/PD data were collected from 21 treatment‐refractory depressed participants who received ketamine (dose titration 0.1–0.5 mg/kg as single doses) by i.v., s.c., or i.m. administration. Model development used nonlinear mixed effect modeling. Ketamine and norketamine PK were best described using two‐compartment models with first‐order absorption after s.c. and i.m. administration. Estimated ketamine bioavailability after i.m. and s.c. was ~ 64% with indistinguishable first‐order absorption rate constants. Allometric scaling of body weight on all clearance and volumes of distribution improved the model fit. The delay in the concentration‐response relationship for MADRS scores was best described using a turnover model (turnover time ~ 42 hours), whereas for the BP and HR rates this was an immediate effect model. For all PD effects, ketamine alone was superior to models with norketamine concentration linked to an effect. No covariates were identified for PD effects. The estimated half‐maximal effective concentration from the MADRS score, BP, and HR were 0.44, 468, and 7,580 ng/mL, respectively. The integrated population models were able to effectively describe the PK/PD relationships for MADRS scores, BP, and HR after i.v., s.c., and i.m. ketamine administration. These findings allow for a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between route of ketamine administration and clinical response and safety.",

    "abstract": "Immuno‐oncology (IO) is a fast‐expanding field due to recent success using IO therapies in treating cancer. As IO therapies do not directly kill tumor cells but rather act upon the patients’ own immune cells either systemically or in the tumor microenvironment, new and innovative approaches are required to inform IO therapy research and development. Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling describes the biological mechanisms of disease and the mode of action of drugs with mathematical equations, which has significant potential to address the big challenges in the IO field, from identifying patient populations that respond to different therapies to guiding the selection, dosing, and scheduling of combination therapy. To assess the perspectives of the community on the impact of QSP modeling in IO drug development and to understand current applications and challenges, the IO QSP working group—under the QSP Special Interest Group (SIG) of the International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISoP)—conducted a survey among QSP modelers, non‐QSP modelers, and non‐modeling IO program stakeholders. The survey results are presented here with discussions on how to address some of the findings. One of the findings is the differences in perception among these groups. To help bridge this perception gap, we present several case studies demonstrating the impact of QSP modeling in IO and suggest actions that can be taken in the future to increase the real and perceived impact of QSP modeling in IO drug research and development.",

In parallel, complex innovative designs have gained increased popularity in drug development, in particular in early development phases or in difficult experimental situations. While the estimand framework is relevant to any study in which a treatment effect is estimated, experience is lacking as regards its application to these designs. In a basket trial for example, should a different estimand be specified for each subpopulation of interest, defined, for example, by cancer site? Or can a single estimand focusing on the general population (defined, for example, by the positivity to a certain biomarker) be used? In the case of platform trials, should a different estimand be proposed for each drug investigated? In this work we discuss possible ways of implementing the estimand framework for different types of complex innovative designs. We consider trials that allow adding or selecting experimental treatment arms, modifying the control arm or the standard of care, and selecting or pooling populations. We also address the potentially data‐driven, adaptive selection of estimands in an ongoing trial and disentangle certain statistical issues that pertain to estimation rather than to estimands, such as the borrowing of nonconcurrent information. We hope this discussion will facilitate the implementation of the estimand framework and its description in the study protocol when the objectives of the trial require complex innovative designs.",

    "abstract": "Access lag to innovative therapies in Asian populations continues to present a challenge to global health. Recent progressive changes in the global regulatory landscape, including newer guidelines, are enabling simultaneous global drug development and near‐simultaneous global drug registration. The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E17 guideline outlines general principles for the design and analysis of multiregional clinical trials (MRCTs). We posit that translational research and quantitative clinical pharmacology tools are core enablers for Asia‐inclusive global drug development aligned with ICH E17 principles. Assessment of ethnic sensitivity should be initiated early in the development lifecycle to inform the need for, and extent of, Asian phase I ethno‐bridging data. Relevant ethno‐bridging data may be generated as standalone Asian phase I trials, as part of Western First‐In‐Human trials, or under accelerated development settings as a lead‐in phase in an MRCT. Quantitative understanding of human clearance mechanisms and pharmacogenetic factors is vital to forecasting ethnic sensitivity in drug exposure using physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic models. Stratification factors to control heterogeneity in MRCTs can be identified by reverse translational research incorporating pharmacometric disease models and model‐based meta‐analyses. Because epidemiological variations can extend to the molecular level, quantitative systems pharmacology models may be useful in forecasting how molecular variation in therapeutic targets or pathway proteins across populations might impact treatment outcomes. Through prospective evaluation of conservation in drug‐ and disease‐related intrinsic and extrinsic factors, a pooled East Asian region can be implemented in Asia‐inclusive MRCTs to maximize efficiency in substantiating evidence of benefit‐risk for the region at‐large with a Totality of Evidence approach.",

This study aims to investigate the differences in the patent term extension (PTE) and regulatory exclusivity between China and the United States, and to evaluate their potential impact on the market exclusivity period of novel drugs. Small‐molecule novel drugs with their first indication approved in China and the United States between 2018 and 2021 were evaluated regarding their PTE and regulatory exclusivity. The PTE length of the China‐approved drugs was calculated by simulation, whereas that of the US‐approved drugs was extracted from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Thirty‐two and 107 novel drugs approved in China and the United States, respectively, were included in the study. The PTE length of the US‐approved drugs calculated by the China‐PTE method was significantly longer than that calculated by the US‐PTE method. Patent extensions should be granted for 91% of new drugs in China and 82% in the United States. The simulated median PTE length of novel drugs approved in China was significantly higher than that of the United States (5.0 vs. 2.9 years, P < 0.05). It can be expected that the implementation of the PTE policy in China would significantly extend the period of market exclusivity for novel drugs similar to that of the United States. China should fully evaluate the potential impact of the PTE policy on the market exclusivity of novel drugs and provide better incentives to the development of novel drugs in addressing unmet clinical needs when developing its regulatory exclusivity policy.",

    "abstract": "Available data have shown an association between direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) plasma concentration and clinical, particularly bleeding, events. Factors that may influence DOAC plasma concentration are therefore the focus of particular attention. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analyses can help in identifying such factors while providing predictive models. The main aim of the present study was to identify all the PopPK models to date for the four most frequently used DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). The secondary aim was to use these models to simulate different DOAC plasma concentration–time profiles in relevant clinical scenarios. The results of our model‐based simulations confirm the clinical relevance of the known major factors influencing DOAC exposure and support the current approved dose adaptation, at least for atrial fibrillation. They also highlight how the accumulation of covariates, not currently considered for dose adaptation due to their seemingly minor influence on DOAC exposure, lead to supratherapeutic blood concentrations and could thus enhance the risk of major bleeding. The present results therefore question DOAC dose adaptation in the presence of these covariates, such as drug–drug interaction or genotypes, alongside the known existing covariates. As the overall effect of accumulation of several covariates could be difficult to apprehend for the clinicians, PopPK modeling could represent an interesting approach for informed precision dosing and to improve personalized prescription of DOACs.",

    "abstract": "Midazolam is a benzodiazepine frequently used for sedation in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). This drug is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) isoenzymes. Several studies have suggested that inflammation, frequently observed in these patients, could modulate CYP3A activity. The objective of this work was to study the impact of inflammation on midazolam pharmacokinetics in patients with COVID‐19. Forty‐eight patients hospitalized in the ICU for COVID‐19 and treated with midazolam administered by continuous infusion were included in this study. Midazolam and α‐hydroxymidazolam concentrations were measured and patient data, including the use of CYP3A inhibitors, were collected. Total and unbound concentrations of midazolam and α‐hydroxymidazolam were measured in plasma using a validated liquid‐chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry method. Inflammatory condition was evaluated by C‐reactive protein (CRP) level measurement. Both drug concentrations and CRP measurements were performed on 354 plasma samples. CRP elevation was significantly associated with the α‐hydroxymidazolam/midazolam plasma ratio decrease, whether for the unbound fraction or for the total fraction. Conversely, inflammation was not associated with protein binding modifications. Logically, α‐hydroxymidazolam/midazolam plasma ratio was significantly reduced when patients were treated with CYP3A inhibitors. In this study, we showed that inflammation probably reduces the metabolism of midazolam by CYP3A. These results suggest that molecules with narrow therapeutic margins and metabolized by CYP3A should be administrated with care in case of massive inflammatory situations.",

A cross‐sectional analysis of European Medicines Agency (EMA) marketing authorization dossiers for new medicines approved through centralized procedures in the European Union between 2010 and 2020 was performed. Data were extracted from European Public Assessment Reports and Clinical Study Reports. Clinical trials covering five therapeutic areas were included: diabetes, respiratory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, and oncology. Outcomes included adherence assessment, measurement methods, and rates. Overall, 102 medicines studied in 253 clinical trials were reviewed. All but one study reported measuring adherence. Two hundred twenty trials (87%) measured adherence using quantitative methods, while 32 (13%) trials monitored adherence but did not further quantify. Reported adherence rates were high (> 90%) across trials yet marked disparities in measurement methods and definitions were found. The most frequently used adherence measurement method was pill/dose count (single method: 52.7%; in combination: 37.7%; with patient diary/report: 17.3%; electronic methods: 1.4%; bioanalytical methods: 4.1%). Patient diary/report (6.4%) and electronic methods (2.7%) were also used as single methods. Electronic methods were more often used in respiratory and anti‐infective trials, while bioanalytical methods were more frequently used in diabetes. Overall, adherence is measured in EMA registration trials, yet the methods used and the way in which adherence rates are presented vary widely between trials and therapeutic areas. To better understand and compare efficacy of medicines, standardization of adherence definitions and measurement methods is needed.",

Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the phase II trial SOCRATES‐REDUCED (Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulator in Heart Failure Study) and the phase III trial VICTORIA (Vericiguat Global Study in Patients With Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction) were used to characterize vericiguat PK. A total of 8,092 concentration records from 2,321 participants (362 from SOCRATES‐REDUCED and 1,959 from VICTORIA) were utilized for the development of the population PK model. The final PK model was a one‐compartment model with first‐order absorption and linear elimination. Baseline body weight and time‐varying body weight were identified as statistically significant covariates affecting apparent clearance (CL/ F ) and volume of distribution, respectively. Age, sex, race, bilirubin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albumin did not affect vericiguat PK. Baseline disease‐related factors, such as left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and N‐terminal pro B‐type natriuretic peptide, also did not influence vericiguat PK. Since vericiguat is a titrated drug, the impact of vericiguat PK on the titration to and maintenance of the target dose in VICTORIA was assessed. The distribution of steady‐state doses in VICTORIA was similar across CL/ F quartiles, suggesting that the ability to reach and maintain dosing at the target 10‐mg dose was not related to vericiguat exposure.",

    "abstract": "Important discoveries by academic drug developers hold the promise of bringing innovative treatments that address unmet medical needs to the market. However, the drug development process has proved to be challenging and demanding for academic researchers, and regulatory challenges are an important barrier to implementing academic findings in clinical practice. European regulators offer varying degrees of support services to help drug developers meet regulatory standards and requirements. “Strengthening Training of Academia in Regulatory Sciences and Supporting Regulatory Scientific Advice” (STARS) is a European Commission–funded consortium aiming to strengthen the training of academics in regulatory science and requirements. Here, we report the results of four surveys that investigated the awareness and utilization of support tools offered by European regulators and identified the regulatory challenges and support needs of researchers. The surveys targeted four main European stakeholders in academic medicines research: academic research groups (706 respondents), academic research centers (99), funding organizations (49), and regulators (22). The results show that while European regulators provide various regulatory support tools, less than half of the responding academic researchers were aware of these tools and many experienced challenges in reaching a sufficient level of regulatory knowledge. There was a general lack of understanding of the regulatory environment that was aggravated by poor communication between stakeholders. The results of this study form a foundation for an improved European medicines regulatory network, in which regulatory challenges faced by academia are tackled.",

    "abstract": "The aging processes alter the body's response to a medicine's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and susceptibility to adverse effects. In addition, older adults, especially the oldest age category (85+ years) or those with multiple chronic health conditions, polypharmacy, or frailty, are under‐represented in clinical trials of new medicines. Evidence‐based prescribing guidelines based on these trials might result in inappropriate prescription, increasing the risk of drug interactions and adverse drug reactions. Regulators face a conundrum between acquiring sufficient data and putting susceptible patients at risk in the early stages of a development program, when little is known about a medicine's effects. Healthcare professionals and patients deserve to have access to clear information on the knowledge and evidence gaps leading to the approval of a new medicinal product. This should also include proper consideration of the population of older patients. In the present article, we outline the approach taken by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulators in the assessment of a new medicine's dossier.",

A two‐compartment model with first‐order absorption and first‐order elimination adequately described risankizumab PK. Covariates including sex, baseline fecal calprotectin, corticosteroid use, baseline creatinine clearance, body weight, and baseline albumin were statistically correlated with risankizumab clearance, but their impact on exposure was not clinically relevant for efficacy or safety. Exposure–response analyses showed that exposures associated with the 600 mg intravenous (i.v.) induction dose at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 achieved a near maximal response for all efficacy end points evaluated, with negligible added benefit from the 1,200 mg i.v. regimen. By Week 52 of the maintenance treatment, trends of higher responses were observed for the exposure range associated with the 360 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) every‐8‐weeks (Q8W) regimen for most of the evaluated efficacy end points, particularly for the more stringent end points, such as endoscopic remission and ulcer‐free endoscopy. Exposure–response analyses for safety did not identify any apparent relationship between exposure and safety. These results supported the final dose recommendation of 600 mg i.v. at Weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by 360 mg s.c. at Week 12 and Q8W thereafter in patients with CD.",

    "abstract": "Current clinical research does not reflect the diversity of patient populations, despite continued recommendations to increase enrollment of under‐represented racial and ethnic groups. The ramifications of this lack of trial diversity are important because of potential differences between races and ethnicities in response to therapies, which have been observed for drugs across indications. Nonrepresentative research populations limit the generalizability of study results, which may lead to questions about safety and efficacy in certain subgroups of patients and hinder regulators, healthcare providers, and patients in their ability to adequately consider the benefits and risks of a therapeutic treatment across all populations. Renewed efforts to address healthcare disparities and increase diversity in clinical trials have demonstrated that inclusive trials are achievable and can provide scientifically rigorous results, and, thus, should stimulate greater action across all stakeholders. Ensuring that studies throughout the clinical development process include representative populations is a scientific imperative to advance health equity, racial justice, and trust in the safety and efficacy of medical therapies. This article reviews the long‐standing lack of diversity and barriers to enrollment of diverse and representative populations in clinical trials, outlines the current evolving trial landscape and the efforts of stakeholders, and provides examples from scientifically rigorous inclusive trials. The goal is to share learnings in a wider context of opportunities to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in clinical development while ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical therapies in all populations of patients, and in doing so, provide wider patient access to therapeutic treatments.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenetic dosing improves the accuracy of warfarin dosing, but current pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms are less accurate in populations of African ancestry. The cytochrome P450 2C9*5 ( CYP2C9*5 ) allele is found almost exclusively in populations of African ancestry, and in vitro studies suggest CYP2C9*5 is associated with reduced clearance of warfarin. The clinical relevance of this single‐nucleotide variation (SNV) (formerly SNP) is uncertain. In this multicentered study of 2,298 patients (49% female, 35% Black) taking warfarin, we quantified the association between the CYP2C9*5 allele and warfarin requirements. The CYP2C9*5 SNV was present in 2.3% of Black and 0.07% of White patients. Without taking CYP2C9*5 into account, pharmacogenetic algorithms that include other SNVs overestimated the warfarin dose by 30% (95% confidence interval (19–40%), P < 0.001), an average of 1.87 mg/day (SD 1.64) in heterozygotes ( P < 0.001). Noncarriers required a slightly (0.23 mg/day, SD 2.09) higher than predicted dose. Genotyping for CYP2C9*5 corrected the potential overdose and halved overall dosing error in heterozygotes. Patients carrying CYP2C9*5 require a clinically relevant reduction in warfarin dose. Given the potential to improve the accuracy and safety of warfarin dosing in populations of African ancestry, we have incorporated this SNV into a nonprofit website to assist warfarin initiation ( www.WarfarinDosing.org ).",

    "abstract": "Antidepressants are known to cause hyponatremia, but conflicting evidence exists regarding specific antidepressants. To identify antidepressants less likely to cause hyponatremia, we conducted a triangulation study integrating retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic studies. In the retrospective cohort study of patients (≥ 60 years) in Nihon University School of Medicine’s Clinical Data Warehouse (2004–2020), a significant decrease in serum sodium levels was observed within 30 days after initiation of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; mean change −1.00 ± 0.23 mmol/L, P < 0.001) or serotonin‐noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI; −1.01 ± 0.31 mmol/L, P = 0.0013), whereas no decrease was found for a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (mirtazapine; +0.55 ± 0.47 mmol/L, P = 0.24). Within‐class comparison revealed no decrease in serum sodium levels for fluvoxamine (+0.74 ± 0.75 mmol/L, P = 0.33) among SSRIs and milnacipran (+0.08 ± 0.87 mmol/L, P = 0.93) among SNRIs. In the disproportionality analysis of patients (≥ 60 years) in the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (2004–2020), a significant increase in hyponatremia reports was observed for SSRIs (reporting odds ratio 4.41, 95% confidence interval 3.58–5.45) and SNRIs (5.66, 4.38–7.31), but not for mirtazapine (1.08, 0.74–1.58), fluvoxamine (1.48, 0.94–2.32), and milnacipran (0.85, 0.45–1.62). Finally, pharmacoepidemiological–pharmacodynamic analysis revealed a significant correlation between the decrease in serum sodium levels and binding affinity for serotonin transporter (SERT; r = −0.84, P = 0.02), suggesting that lower binding affinity of mirtazapine, fluvoxamine, and milnacipran against SERT is responsible for the above difference. Although further research is needed, our data suggest that mirtazapine, fluvoxamine, and milnacipran are less likely to cause hyponatremia.",

We included individuals aged 65 years or older with epilepsy who redeemed their first prescription of valproate after the diagnosis of epilepsy and had at least one valproate plasma concentration measured. A long short‐term memory neural network (LSTM) was developed using the training data set to fit the LSTM and the test data set to validate the model. Predictions from the LSTM were compared with those obtained from the population predictions from a pharmacometric model by Birnbaum et al . which had the best predictive performance for population predictions of valproate concentrations in Danish databases. We used the cutoff of ± 20 mg/L of prediction error to define good predictions. A total of 1,252 individuals were included in the study. The LSTM fitted using the training data set had poor predictive performance in the test data set, but better than that of the pharmacometric model. The proportion of individuals with at least one predicted concentration within ± 20 mg/L of observed concentration was largest in case of the LSTM (64.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 58.4–70.2%) compared with the pharmacometric model by Birnbaum et al . (49.8%, 95% CI: 47.0–52.6%). LSTM shows better predictive performance to predict valproate plasma concentrations compared with a traditional pharmacometric model in the investigated setting with real‐world data in older patients with epilepsy where information on exact timepoints for both dosing and plasma concentration measurement are missing.",

This approach identified 3 drugs, including topoisomerase II (TOP2) inhibitor mitoxantrone, CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, and pan‐CDK inhibitor PHA‐793887. These drugs significantly suppressed the growth of abiraterone‐resistant cell lines and PDX models. Moreover, we identified 11 genes targeted by all 3 drugs that were associated with worse outcomes in both the PROMOTE and Stand Up To Cancer cohorts. This 11‐gene panel might also function as biomarkers to select the 3 alternative therapies for this subgroup of patients with CRPC, warranting further clinical investigation.",

These exposure–response analyses assessed potential relationships between exposure and efficacy or safety outcomes in platinum‐pretreated patients with EGFR ex20ins‐positive mNSCLC who received mobocertinib 160 mg once daily (q.d.) in a pivotal phase I/II study. A statistically significant relationship between the independent review committee‐assessed objective response rate and molar sum exposure to mobocertinib and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) was not discernable using a longitudinal model of clinical response driven by normalized dynamic molar sum exposure or a static model of best clinical response based on time‐averaged molar sum exposure. However, the longitudinal model suggested a trend for decreased probability of response with the change in mobocertinib molar sum exposure between the 160‐ and 120‐mg doses (odds ratio: 0.78; 95% confidence interval: 0.55–1.10; P = 0.156). Time‐averaged molar sum exposure was a significant predictor of the rate of grade ≥ 3 treatment‐emergent adverse events (AEs). Taken together, these exposure–efficacy and exposure–safety results support a favorable benefit‐risk profile for the approved mobocertinib 160‐mg q.d. dose and dose modification guidelines for patients experiencing AEs.",

Radioiodine, bone‐seeking radioligands and norepinephrine analogs have been used for many years for diagnostic imaging and radioligand therapy of thyroid carcinoma, bone metastases, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and neuroblastoma, respectively. In recent years, radiolabeled somatostatin analogs and prostate‐specific membrane antigen ligands have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer, respectively. Several candidate compounds are targeting novel theranostic targets such as fibroblast activation protein, C‐X‐C chemokine receptor 4, and gastrin‐releasing peptide receptor. In addition, several strategies to improve efficacy of radioligand therapy are being evaluated, including dosimetry‐based dose optimization, multireceptor targeting, upregulation of target receptors, radiosensitization, pharmacogenomics, and radiation genomics. Design and evaluation of novel radioligands and optimization of dose and dose schedules, within the complex context of individualized multimodal cancer treatment, requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes clinical pharmacology. Significant increases in the use of these radiopharmaceuticals in routine oncological practice can be expected, which will have major impact on patient care as well as (radio)pharmacy utilization.",

    "abstract": "Therapy of molybdenum cofactor (Moco) deficiency has received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2021. Whereas urothione, the urinary excreted catabolite of Moco, is used as diagnostic biomarker for Moco‐deficiency, its catabolic pathway remains unknown. Here, we identified the urothione‐synthesizing methyltransferase using mouse liver tissue by anion exchange/size exclusion chromatography and peptide mass fingerprinting. We show that the catabolic Moco S‐methylating enzyme corresponds to thiopurine S‐methyltransferase (TPMT), a highly polymorphic drug‐metabolizing enzyme associated with drug‐related hematotoxicity but unknown physiological role. Urothione synthesis was investigated in vitro using recombinantly expressed human TPMT protein, liver lysates from Tpmt wild‐type and knock‐out ( Tpmt −/− ) mice as well as human liver cytosol. Urothione levels were quantified by liquid‐chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in the kidneys and urine of mice. TPMT‐genotype/phenotype and excretion levels of urothione were investigated in human samples and validated in an independent population‐based study. As Moco provides a physiological substrate (thiopterin) of TPMT, thiopterin‐methylating activity was associated with TPMT activity determined with its drug substrate (6‐thioguanin) in mice and humans. Urothione concentration was extremely low in the kidneys and urine of Tpmt −/− mice. Urinary urothione concentration in TPMT‐deficient patients depends on common TPMT polymorphisms, with extremely low levels in homozygous variant carriers ( TPMT*3A/*3A ) but normal levels in compound heterozygous carriers ( TPMT*3A/*3C ) as validated in the population‐based study. Our work newly identified an endogenous substrate for TPMT and shows an unprecedented link between Moco catabolism and drug metabolism. Moreover, the TPMT example indicates that phenotypic consequences of genetic polymorphisms may differ between drug‐ and endogenous substrates.",

Patients also received nitroglycerin (0.4 mg sublingual). In total, 31 patients completed the study (vericiguat + nitroglycerin, n = 21; placebo + nitroglycerin, n = 10). There was no increase in treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with vericiguat + nitroglycerin vs. placebo + nitroglycerin; three patients discontinued due to TEAEs (vericiguat + nitroglycerin, n = 1; placebo + nitroglycerin, n = 2). Decreases in mean blood pressure (BP; 6–10 mmHg systolic BP (SBP); 4–6 mmHg diastolic BP (DBP)) were independent of vericiguat exposure and occurred to a similar extent at trough and peak concentrations with all vericiguat doses and placebo. Coadministration of vericiguat with nitroglycerin in patients with CCSs was well tolerated, and the combination is unlikely to cause significant adverse effects beyond those known for nitroglycerin.",

    "abstract": "This review presents a European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Association/PreClinical Development Expert Group (EFPIA‐PDEG) topic group consensus on a data‐driven approach to harmonized contraception recommendations for clinical trial protocols and product labeling. There is no international agreement in pharmaceutical clinical trial protocols or product labeling on when/if female and/or male contraception is warranted and for how long after the last dose. This absence of consensus has resulted in different recommendations among regions. For most pharmaceuticals, contraception recommendations are generally based exclusively on nonclinical data and/or mechanism. For clinical trials, contraception is the default position and is maintained for women throughout clinical development, whereas appropriate information can justify removing male contraception. Conversely, contraception is only recommended in product labeling when warranted. A base case rationale is proposed for whether or not female and/or male contraception is/are warranted, using available genotoxicity and developmental toxicity data. Contraception is generally warranted for both male and female subjects treated with mutagenic pharmaceuticals. We propose as a starting point that contraception is not typically warranted when the margin is 10‐fold or greater between clinical exposure at the maximum recommended human dose and exposure at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for purely aneugenic pharmaceuticals and for pharmaceuticals that induce fetal malformations or embryo‐fetal lethality. Other factors are discussed, including contraception methods, pregnancy testing, drug clearance, options for managing the absence of a developmental toxicity NOAEL, drug‐drug interactions, radiopharmaceuticals, and other drug modalities. Overall, we present a data‐driven rationale that can serve as a basis for consistent contraception recommendations in clinical trials and in product labeling across regions.",

    "abstract": "Green tea (GT) alters the disposition of a number of drugs, such as nadolol and lisinopril. However, it is unknown whether GT affects disposition of hydrophilic anti‐allergic drugs. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine are affected by catechins, major GT components. A randomized, open, 2‐phase crossover study was conducted in 10 healthy Japanese volunteers. After overnight fasting, subjects were simultaneously administered fexofenadine (60 mg) and pseudoephedrine (120 mg) with an aqueous solution of green tea extract (GTE) containing (−)‐epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) of ~ 300 mg or water (control). In vitro transport assays were performed using HEK293 cells stably expressing organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1A2 to evaluate the inhibitory effect of EGCG on OATP1A2‐mediated fexofenadine transport. In the GTE phase, the area under the plasma concentration‐time curve and the amount excreted unchanged into urine for 24 hours of fexofenadine were significantly decreased by 70% ( P < 0.001) and 67% ( P < 0.001), respectively, compared with control. There were no differences in time to maximum plasma concentration and the elimination half‐life of fexofenadine between phases. Fexofenadine was confirmed to be a substrate of OATP1A2, and EGCG (100 and 1,000 μM) and GTE (0.1 and 1 mg/mL) inhibited OATP1A2‐mediated uptake of fexofenadine. On the contrary, the concomitant administration of GTE did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pseudoephedrine. These results suggest that intake of GT may result in a markedly reduced exposure of fexofenadine, but not of pseudoephedrine, putatively by inhibiting OATP1A2‐mediated intestinal absorption.",

    "abstract": "In this report, we describe our scientific approach for including effluent flow rate ( Q E )–based dosing recommendations of cefiderocol for patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the product labeling. The total clearance (CL) of cefiderocol in patients receiving CRRT was estimated as the sum of patients’ nonrenal clearance (CL nonrenal ) and extracorporeal clearance by CRRT (CL CRRT ), based on the following rationale: (a) The renal clearance (CL renal ) of cefiderocol is assumed to be negligible in patients receiving CRRT, (b) CL nonrenal represents the CRRT patients’ own remaining systemic clearance and is estimated from the observed clearance in participants with creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 15 mL/minute without undergoing hemodialysis, and (c) CL CRRT was estimated by the product of unbound (free) fraction of plasma drug concentration ( f u ) and Q E because the free fraction of low‐molecular‐weight compounds like cefiderocol (752 Da) can be completely filtered by CRRT, regardless of CRRT modality. Hence, cefiderocol CL in CRRT patients was calculated by the equation of CL = CL nonrenal + f u × Q E . Accordingly, the cefiderocol dosing regimens for patients receiving CRRT in clinically relevant ranges of Q E were determined with the goal of achieving an average daily area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) observed in patients not receiving CRRT. Subsequently, pharmacokinetic (PK) simulations demonstrated that cefiderocol PK profiles following the Q E ‐based dosing in patients receiving CRRT would be similar to those in patients not receiving CRRT.",

Route of administration is an important consideration to improve treatment access. We assessed pharmacokinetics (PKs) of AZD7442 absorption following 600 mg administered intramuscularly (i.m.) in the thigh compared with 300 mg intravenously (i.v.) in ambulatory adults with symptomatic COVID‐19. PK analysis included 84 of 110 participants randomized to receive i.m. AZD7442 and 16 of 61 randomized to receive i.v. AZD7442. Serum was collected prior to AZD7442 administration and at 24 hours and 3, 7, and 14 days later. PK parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods. Following 600 mg i.m., the geometric mean maximum concentration ( C max ) was 38.19 μg/mL (range: 17.30–60.80) and 37.33 μg/mL (range: 14.90–58.90) for tixagevimab and cilgavimab, respectively. Median observed time to maximum concentration ( T max ) was 7.1 and 7.0 days for tixagevimab and cilgavimab, respectively. Serum concentrations after i.m. dosing were similar to the i.v. dose (27–29 μg/mL each component) at 3 days. The area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) 0–7d geometric mean ratio was 0.9 for i.m. vs. i.v. Participants with higher weight or body mass index were more likely to have lower concentrations with either route. Women appeared to have higher interparticipant variability in concentrations compared with men. The concentrations of tixagevimab and cilgavimab after administration i.m. to the thigh were similar to those achieved with i.v. after 3 days from dosing. Exposure in the i.m. group was 90% of i.v. over 7 days. Administration to the thigh can be considered to provide consistent mAb exposure and improve access.",

We sought to determine how statin effectiveness is modified by CHD polygenic risk score in a real‐world cohort of participants without previous myocardial infarction. We determined CHD polygenic risk scores in participants of the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. Covariate‐adjusted Cox regression models were used to compare the risk of cardiovascular outcomes between statin users and matched nonusers. Statin effectiveness on incident myocardial infarction showed no gradient with increasing 10‐year Pooled Cohort Equations atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk across low, borderline, intermediate, and high ASCVD risk score groups. In contrast, statin effectiveness by polygenic risk was largest in the high polygenic risk score group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31–0.53; P = 1.5E‐11), intermediate in the intermediate polygenic risk score group (HR 0.56, 95% CI, 0.47–0.66; P = 8.4E‐12), and smallest in the low polygenic risk score group (HR 0.67, 95% CI, 0.47–0.97; P = 0.03; P for high vs. low = 0.01). ASCVD risk and statin low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) lowering did not differ across polygenic risk score groups. In patients undergoing routine care, CHD polygenic risk modified statin relative risk reduction of incident myocardial infarction independent of LDL‐C lowering. Our findings extend prior work by identifying a subset (i.e., self‐identified White individuals with low CHD polygenic risk scores) with attenuated clinical benefit from statins.",

    "abstract": "Azathioprine (AZA) is commonly used for many autoimmune disorders; however, the limitation of its clinical use is due to potential toxicities, including severe leukopenia. Recent studies have identified genetic NUDT15 variants strongly associated with AZA‐induced leukopenia in Asian patients. This study aimed to investigate the strength of above genetic association and evaluate the usefulness of prospective screening of the NUDT15 variants to prevent AZA‐induced leukopenia in Chinese patients. AZA‐induced leukopenia in patients with autoimmune disorders were enrolled from multiple medical centers in Taiwan/China between 2012 and 2017 to determine the strength of genetic association of NUDT15 or TPMT variants by whole exome sequencing (WES). Furthermore, a prospective study was conducted between 2018 and 2021 to investigate the incidence of AZA‐induced leukopenia with and without genetic screening. The WES result showed the genetic variants of NUDT15 R139C ( rs116855232 ) ( P = 3.7 × 10 −25 , odds ratio (OR) = 21.7, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 12.1–38.8) and NUDT15 rs746071566 ( P = 4.2 × 10 −9 , OR = 7.1, 95% CI = 3.7–13.7), but not TPMT , were associated with AZA‐induced leukopenia and NUDT15 R139C variant shows the highest sensitivity with 92.5%. Furthermore, the targeted screening of 1,013 participants for NUDT15 R139C enabled those identified as carriers to use alternative immunosuppressants. This strategy resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of AZA‐induced leukopenia compared with historical incidence (incidence rate = from 7.6% decreased to 0.4%; P = 9.3 × 10 −20 ). In conclusion, the NUDT15 R139C variant was strongly associated with AZA‐induced leukopenia in Chinese patients. The genetic screening of NUDT15 R139C followed by use of alternative immunosuppressants in identified carriers effectively decreased the incidence of AZA leukopenia for patients with autoimmune disorders.",

The recommended dosing regimen is a 360‐mg loading dose followed by a 120‐mg daily dose. Relugolix and testosterone concentration data and clinical information from two phase I studies, two phase II studies, and the phase III safety and efficacy study (HERO) were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model and a semimechanistic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PopPK/PD) model that characterized relugolix exposure and its relationship to testosterone concentrations. Age, body weight, and Black/African American race had at most minimal effects on relugolix exposure or testosterone concentrations with no clinical relevance. Simulations using the PopPK/PD model confirmed the recommended dosing regimen of relugolix, with the median simulated testosterone concentrations predicted to achieve castration levels (< 50 ng/dL) and profound castration levels (< 20 ng/dL) by day 2 and day 9, respectively, and demonstrated that 97.3% and 85.5% of the patients remained at castration levels (< 50 ng/dL) upon temporary interruption of treatment for 7 days and 14 days, respectively. Collectively, simulations based on the PopPK and PopPK/PD models were consistent with actual data from clinical studies, reflecting the high predictiveness of the models and supporting the reliability of model‐based simulations. These models can be used to provide guidance regarding dosing recommendations under various circumstances (e.g., temporary interruption of treatment, if needed) for relugolix.",

This study evaluated effects of the HER2‐targeted antibody–drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T‐DXd, DS‐8201a) on QT/QTc interval and its pharmacokinetics. Patients with heavily pretreated, metastatic HER2‐expressing breast cancer were enrolled at seven study sites in Japan. T‐DXd was administered intravenously at 6.4 mg/kg on day 1 of each 21‐day cycle. Primary end points were baseline‐adjusted QTcF interval and pharmacokinetics parameters. Key secondary end points included safety events, serum concentration of T‐DXd and DXd at the time of electrocardiographic measurements, and antitumor activity parameters. Among 51 total patients, 47 (92.2%) had HER2‐low breast cancer (immunohistochemistry 1+ or 2+ and in situ hybridization–negative/equivocal/missing). Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single dose of T‐DXd were consistent with previous studies. After multiple doses, T‐DXd showed moderate accumulation (accumulation ratio (cycle 3/cycle 1), 1.35), but DXd showed minimal accumulation (1.09). The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for mean ΔQTcF interval was < 10 ms at all timepoints, and at mean maximum serum concentration was also < 10 ms. Based on concentration‐QT analysis, ΔQTcF increased with increasing concentrations of T‐DXd and DXd. No clinically meaningful QTcF prolongation was observed. T‐DXd had a manageable safety profile and showed antitumor activity in HER2‐low breast cancer. In this study, a T‐DXd dose of 6.4 mg/kg, higher than the 5.4‐mg/kg dose currently approved for breast cancer, was not associated with clinically relevant QTcF prolongation in heavily pretreated patients with HER2‐expressing metastatic breast cancer. This study adds to our understanding of T‐DXd for treatment of HER2‐low breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Typically, therapeutic proteins (TPs) have a low risk for eliciting meaningful drug interactions (DIs). However, there are select instances where TP drug interactions (TP‐DIs) of clinical concern can occur. This white paper discusses the various types of TP‐DIs involving mechanisms such as changes in disease state, target‐mediated drug disposition, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), or antidrug antibodies formation. The nature of TP drug interaction being investigated should determine whether the examination is conducted as a standalone TP–DI study in healthy participants, in patients, or assessed via population pharmacokinetic analysis. DIs involving antibody–drug conjugates are discussed briefly, but the primary focus here will be DIs involving cytokine modulation. Cytokine modulation can occur directly by certain TPs, or indirectly due to moderate to severe inflammation, infection, or injury. Disease states that have been shown to result in indirect disease–DIs that are clinically meaningful have been listed (i.e., typically a twofold change in the systemic exposure of a coadministered sensitive cytochrome P450 substrate drug). Type of disease and severity of inflammation should be the primary drivers for risk assessment for disease–DIs. While more clinical inflammatory marker data needs to be collected, the use of two or more clinical inflammatory markers (such as C‐reactive protein, albumin, or interleukin 6) may help broadly categorize whether the predicted magnitude of inflammatory disease–DI risk is negligible, weak, or moderate to strong. Based on current knowledge, clinical DI studies are not necessary for all TPs, and should no longer be conducted in certain disease patient populations such as psoriasis, which do not have sufficient systemic inflammation to cause a meaningful indirect disease–DI.",

Clinical decision support software (CDSS) plays a crucial role in mediating this process, translating knowledge derived from clinical trials and real‐world data (RWD) into actionable insights for clinicians to use at the point of care. However, not all patient populations are proportionally represented in clinical trials and other data sources that inform CDSS tools, limiting the applicability of these tools for underrepresented populations. Here, we review some of the limitations of existing CDSS tools and discuss methods for overcoming these gaps. We discuss considerations for study design and modeling to create more inclusive CDSS, particularly with an eye toward better incorporation of biological indicators in place of race, ethnicity, or sex. We also review inclusive practices for collection of these demographic data, during both study design and in software user interface design. Because of the role CDSS plays in both recording routine clinical care data and disseminating knowledge derived from data, CDSS presents a promising opportunity to continuously improve precision dosing algorithms using RWD to better reflect the diversity of patient populations.",

In particular, the ratio of substrate area under the plasma concentration‐time curve (AUCR) under and not under the effect of inducers is predicted by the Michaelis–Menten (MM) model, where the MM constant () of a drug is implicitly assumed to be sufficiently higher than the concentration of CYP enzymes that metabolize the drug () in both the liver and small intestine. Furthermore, the fraction absorbed from gut lumen () is also assumed to be one because  is usually unknown. Here, we found that such assumptions lead to serious errors in predictions of AUCR. To resolve this, we propose a new framework to predict AUCR. Specifically,  was re‐estimated from experimental permeability values rather than assuming it to be one. Importantly, we used the total quasi‐steady‐state approximation to derive a new equation, which is valid regardless of the relationship between  and , unlike the MM model. Thus, our framework becomes much more accurate than the original FDA equation, especially for drugs with high affinities, such as midazolam or strong inducers, such as rifampicin, so that the ratio between  and  becomes low (i.e., the MM model is invalid). Our work greatly improves the prediction of clinical DDIs, which is critical to preventing drug toxicity and failure.",

    "abstract": "To assess efficacy and toxicity of a drug in humans, it is important to measure the tissue concentration of a drug at the target site. For a drug that is transported into or out of the tissue, the tissue unbound steady‐state concentration can be dramatically different from its corresponding unbound steady‐state plasma concentration. Because routine measurement of drug tissue concentrations is not possible, using rosuvastatin as a model transporter substrate drug, we compared the ability of the proteomics‐informed relative expression factor (REF) approach and sandwich‐cultured human hepatocytes (SCH) to accurately predict rosuvastatin human hepatobiliary clearances and hepatic concentrations. REF‐predicted rosuvastatin biliary clearance (CL bile ), estimated using BCRP‐overexpressing, MDR1‐overexpressing, and MRP2‐overexpressing vesicles, together with our previously published REF‐predicted rosuvastatin hepatic sinusoidal uptake clearance (CL uptake ) and physiologically scaled sinusoidal passive uptake and efflux clearance (CL s,efflux ), were used to predict rosuvastatin hepatic concentrations. For SCH, the estimated rosuvastatin CL bile , CL uptake , and CL s,efflux were scaled using physiological scaling. The REF‐predicted CL bile (6.39 ± 1.56 mL/minute) and hepatic rosuvastatin area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) fell within our a priori defined success criterion, i.e., within twofold of the observed positron emission tomography–imaged values. In contrast, as expected, SCH dramatically overpredicted (predicted/observed ratio P/O = 8.38–10.41) rosuvastatin CL bile , and underpredicted hepatic AUC (P/O = 0.08–0.14). For both approaches, predictions were improved by using the parallel tube model vs. well‐stirred model. Overall, using rosuvastatin as a model drug, this study demonstrates the success of the REF approach in predicting in vivo CL bile and hepatic concentration of drugs, and highlights the shortcomings of the SCH approach in making such predictions.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus depends on gestational age (GA) and might be delayed in preterm infants, resulting in patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Ibuprofen can be administered to enhance closure, but the exposure‐response relationship between ibuprofen and the closure of PDA remains uncertain. We investigated the influence of patient characteristics and ibuprofen exposure on ductus closure. A cohort of preterm infants with PDA and treated with ibuprofen was analyzed. Ibuprofen exposure was based on a previously developed population pharmacokinetic study that was in part based on the same study population. Logistic regression analyses were performed with ductus closure (yes/no) as outcome, to analyze the contribution of ibuprofen exposure and patient characteristics. In our cohort of 263 preterm infants (median GA 26.1 (range: 23.7–30.0) weeks, birthweight 840 (365–1,470) g) receiving ibuprofen treatment consisting of 3 doses that was initiated at a median postnatal age (PNA start ) of 5 (1–32) days, PDA was closed in 55 (21%) patients. Exposure to ibuprofen strongly decreased with PNA start . Overall, the probability of ductus closure decreased with PNA start (odds ratio (OR): 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6–0.8) and Z ‐score for birthweight ( Z Birthweight‐for‐GA ; OR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6‐1.0), and increased with GA (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1–1.9). For patients with PNA start < 1 week, concentrations of ibuprofen, GA, and Z Birthweight‐for‐GA predicted probability of ductus closure. During a window of opportunity for ductus closure within the first days of life, probability of closure depends on GA, Z Birthweight‐for‐GA , and ibuprofen exposure. Increased, yet unstudied dosages might increase the effectivity of ibuprofen beyond the first week of life.",

    "abstract": "Drug–drug interactions (DDIs) frequently trigger adverse drug events or reduced efficacy. Most DDI alerts, however, are overridden because of irrelevance for the specific patient. Basic DDI clinical decision support (CDS) systems offer limited possibilities for decreasing the number of irrelevant DDI alerts without missing relevant ones. Computerized decision tree rules were designed to context‐dependently suppress irrelevant DDI alerts. A crossover study was performed to compare the clinical utility of contextualized and basic DDI management in hospitalized patients. First, a basic DDI‐CDS system was used in clinical practice while contextualized DDI alerts were collected in the background. Next, this process was reversed. All medication orders (MOs) from hospitalized patients with at least one DDI alert were included. The following outcome measures were used to assess clinical utility: positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), number of pharmacy interventions (PIs)/1,000 MOs, and the median time spent on DDI management/1,000 MOs. During the basic DDI management phase 1,919 MOs/day were included, triggering 220 DDI alerts/1,000 MOs; showing 57 basic DDI alerts/1,000 MOs to pharmacy staff; PPV was 2.8% with 1.6 PIs/1,000 MOs costing 37.2 minutes/1,000 MOs. No DDIs were missed by the contextualized CDS system (NPV 100%). During the contextualized DDI management phase 1,853 MOs/day were included, triggering 244 basic DDI alerts/1,000 MOs, showing 9.6 contextualized DDIs/1,000 MOs to pharmacy staff; PPV was 41.4% ( P < 0.01), with 4.0 PIs/1,000 MOs ( P < 0.01) and 13.7 minutes/1,000 MOs.

Clinical data from trials for eight drugs (levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, lamotrigine, gabapentin, perampanel, tiagabine, and vigabatrin) approved in both adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of POS were analyzed. Comparisons of exposures at approved doses, placebo response, and model‐based exposure‐response relationships were performed. Based on disease similarity, similar response to intervention, and similar exposure‐response relationships in adults and pediatric patients, it was concluded that extrapolation of efficacy in pediatric patients aged 1 month and above is acceptable. PK analysis to determine pediatric dose and regimens that provide drug exposure similar to that known to be effective in adult patients with POS will be required, along with long‐term open‐label safety data in pediatric patients.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common disorder in pregnancy. Although sertraline is the most frequently prescribed antidepressant for pregnant people in the United States, limited information about its pharmacokinetics in pregnancy is available. Our objectives were to characterize plasma sertraline concentration to dose (C/D) ratios across pregnancy and postpartum and investigate the effect of pharmacogenetic variability on sertraline elimination. We performed a prospective observational cohort study in people with a singleton pregnancy ≤ 18 weeks gestation and a lifetime diagnosis of MDD at the 3 Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)‐funded Obstetrical‐Fetal Pharmacology Research Center sites. Subjects ( N = 47) were receiving maintenance sertraline therapy and chose to continue it during pregnancy. Blood samples were obtained 24‐hours postdose every 4 weeks across pregnancy and twice postpartum for measurement of plasma concentrations of sertraline and desmethylsertraline. Overall mean sertraline C/D ratios were decreased at study onset and remained consistently low until after delivery. During the last 4 weeks of pregnancy the mean sertraline C/D ratio (95% confidence interval (CI)), 0.25 (95% CI, 0.19, 0.3) ng/mL/dose (mg/day), was smaller than the mean ratio at ≥ 8 weeks after delivery, 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27, 0.37) ng/mL/dose (mg/day), a 22% difference. Mean sertraline/desmethylsertraline ratios were highest after birth, which confirmed increased sertraline elimination during pregnancy. Sertraline C/D ratios in participants with functional CYP2C19 activity did not change significantly during pregnancy, whereas ratios in participants with poor or intermediate CYP2C19 activity decreased by 51%. Exploratory pharmacogenomic analysis indicated that pregnant people with poor or intermediate CYP2C19 activity are at risk for subtherapeutic sertraline concentrations during pregnancy.",

The development and approval of biosimilars is critical to enhancing the availability of safe, effective, and affordable treatment options for patients. Utilization of pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers can help streamline biosimilar development programs as the current process can be costly and time‐consuming. Whereas PD biomarkers have not been prominently used across biosimilar approvals to date, moving forward, there is ample opportunity to increase the use of PD biomarkers in biosimilar development programs in place of comparative clinical studies with efficacy end point(s). This includes utilizing PD biomarkers that were not used as surrogate end points in approval of reference products. This mini‐review summarizes how PD biomarkers have been used in biosimilar development programs to date and then discusses evidentiary considerations for PD biomarkers. In addition, study design considerations for clinical pharmacokinetic and PD assessment of proposed biosimilars are discussed. Finally, the FDA's applied regulatory science activities related to PD biomarkers for biosimilars conducted in support of the FDA's Biosimilars Action Plan are reviewed. This included conducting three clinical studies to address information gaps about PD biomarkers for biosimilars and inform general methodological best practices. In summary, enhancing our understanding of key evidentiary considerations and optimal study designs for incorporating PD biomarkers in the evaluation of proposed biosimilars can help bring more treatment options to patients faster.",

    "abstract": "The approval and adoption of biosimilar products are essential to contain increasing healthcare costs and provide more affordable choices for patients. Despite steady progress in the number of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) biosimilar approvals over the years, biosimilar adoption in the United States has been slow and gradual, largely driven by payers rather than clinicians. In order to better understand the barriers to biosimilar adoption in the clinic, the University of Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M‐CERSI) and the FDA jointly hosted a virtual workshop on April 13, 2022, titled “Biosimilars: A Decade of Experience and Future Directions – Strategies for Improving Biosimilar Adoption and the Potential Role of Clinical Pharmacology.” This summary documents the experiences of four leading academic clinicians with specialties in oncology, rheumatology, gastroenterology, and endocrinology and their perspectives on how to increase biosimilar adoption, including the role of clinical pharmacology. Besides systemic changes in pricing and reimbursement, there is a need for additional education of a broad range of providers, including advanced care practitioners, and patients themselves. Educational efforts highlighting the rigor of the studies that support the approval of biosimilars—including the clinical pharmacology studies—and the benefits of biosimilars, can play a major role in improving biosimilar acceptance.",

Seventy‐two healthy participants ( n = 8 per arm) received either placebo or one of four doses of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors alirocumab (15–100 mg) or evolocumab (21–140 mg) to evaluate the maximum change from baseline (ΔPD max ) and the baseline‐adjusted area under the effect curve (AUEC) for the biomarkers low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) in serum. We investigated approaches to minimize variability in PD measures. Coefficient of variation was lower for LDL‐C than apoB at therapeutic doses. Modeling and simulation were used to establish the dose–response relationship and provided support that therapeutic doses for these products are adequately sensitive and are on the steep part of the dose–response curves. Similar dose–response relationships were observed for both biomarkers. ΔPD max plateaued at lower doses than AUEC.

Qualification of pediatric physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (P‐PBPK) models is an essential step toward enabling precision dosing of these vulnerable groups. Twenty‐two manuscripts involving P‐PBPK predictions and corresponding observed PK data (e.g., area under the curve and clearance) for 22 small‐molecule compounds metabolized by CYP (3A4, 1A2, and 2C9), UGT (1A9 and 2B7), FMO3, renal, non‐renal, and complex routes were identified; ratios of mean predicted/observed (P/O) PK parameters were calculated. Seventy‐eight of 115 mean predicted PK parameters were within 0.8 to 1.25‐fold of observed data, 98 within 0.67 to 1.5‐fold, 109 within 2‐fold, and only 6 P/O ratios were outside of these bounds. A set of 12 CYP3A4‐metabolized compounds and a set of 6 metabolized by other enzymes, CYP1A2 (1 compound), CYP2C9 (2 compounds), UGT1A9 (1 compound) and UGT2B7 (2 compounds) had 56 of 59 and 22 of 25 mean P/O ratios, respectively, that fell within the > 0.5 and < 2.0‐fold boundaries. For compounds covering renal, non‐renal, complex, and FM03 routes of elimination, 29 of 31 mean P/O ratios fell within the 0.67 to 1.5‐fold bounds, including 4 of 5 P/O ratios from newborns. P‐PBPK modeling and simulation is a strategic component of the complement of precision dosing methods and has a vital role to play in dose adjustment in vulnerable pediatric populations, such as those with disease or in different ethnic groups. Qualification of such models is an essential step toward acceptance of this methodology by regulators.",

Both PD biomarkers increased following product administration with clear separation from baseline (neopterin: 3.4‐fold and 3.9‐fold increase for interferon β‐1a and pegylated interferon β‐1a, respectively; myxovirus resistance protein 1: 19.0‐fold and 47.2‐fold increase for interferon β‐1a and pegylated interferon β‐1a, respectively). The dose–response curves support that therapeutic doses were adequately sensitive to detect differences in both PD biomarkers for consideration in a PD similarity study design. Because baseline levels of both biomarkers are low compared with on‐treatment values, there was little difference in using PD measures adjusted to baseline compared with the results without baseline adjustment. This study illustrates potential methodologies for evaluating PD biomarkers and an approach to address information gaps when limited information is publicly available for one or more PD biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Comparative effectiveness evaluation of newer P2Y12 inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor) compared with clopidogrel after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is limited in real‐world US populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular events based on ticagrelor, prasugrel, and clopidogrel use in a real‐world patient setting. This retrospective cohort study used the IBM MarketScan database (January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018) to create three propensity score‐matched pairs: ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel ( N = 21,719), prasugrel vs. clopidogrel ( N = 11,513), and prasugrel vs. ticagrelor ( N = 11,065). The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial ischemia, unstable angina, stroke, and heart failure hospitalization. These groups were compared in a time‐to‐event analysis for the primary outcome at 30, 90, and 180 days following P2Y12 inhibitors initiation after percutaneous coronary intervention. Compared with clopidogrel, ticagrelor use suggested a 10% reduction in the primary outcome at 90 days (hazard ratio (HR): 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82–0.99). There were no differences for all other matched pairs or follow‐up combinations. In the subgroup analysis of females, the results suggested a risk reduction of 27% for prasugrel at 30 days (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.53–1.00) and 17% for ticagrelor at 90 days (HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70–0.98) when compared with clopidogrel. Among patients treated with bare‐metal stents, the results suggested that prasugrel vs. ticagrelor was associated with a 55% and 33% reduced risk for the primary outcome at 30 days and 180 days, respectively. With limited evidence in the United States comparing these drugs, this study helps inform clinicians when choosing P2Y12 inhibitors after ACS.",

    "abstract": "In order to achieve health equity, we must implement innovative health system, public health, and policy‐level interventions to address the historical root causes of structural and institutional racism embedded in our medical and social systems. A history of unconsented medical and research experimentation on vulnerable groups and residual healthcare provider biases toward minoritized patients has led to patient distrust of medical systems and poor quality of care. Historical discriminatory housing and lending policies resulted in racial residential segregation and neighborhoods with inadequate housing, healthy food access, and educational resources, resulting in present‐day social determinants of health (SDOH). To reduce these disparities and achieve health equity, four disruptive healthcare innovations are recommended: (i) infuse health equity principles into clinical workflows by implementing National Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services Standards; (ii) address poverty‐related SDOH; (iii) deliver care and recruit for research in nonclinical settings to reach marginalized communities; and (iv) leverage health system subject matter experts to advocate for health equity policies. During the COVID‐19 pandemic we leveraged the diversity of our workforce to deliver bilingual and culturally tailored COVID‐19 testing, education, and vaccines to the Hispanic and Black communities in nonclinical settings, the primary marginalized communities served by our health system that were also disproportionately impacted by COVID‐19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Now that we understand the importance of using innovative health equity strategies to reach marginalized communities, we must continue to re‐engineer our healthcare systems to deliver care outside of our brick and mortar to overcome barriers in access to care and mistrust in the healthcare establishment stemming from past abuses and remaining experiences of bias.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rapidly progressive disease leading to death in, on average, 3–5 years after first symptom onset. Consequently, there are frequently a non‐negligible number of patients who die during the course of a clinical trial. This introduces bias in end points such as daily functioning, muscle strength, and quality of life. In this paper, we outline how the choice of strategy to handle death affects the interpretation of the trial results. We provide a general overview of the considerations, positioned in the estimand framework, and discuss the possibility that not every strategy provides a clinically relevant answer in each setting. The relevance of a strategy changes as a function of the intended trial duration, hypothesized treatment effect, and population included. It is important to consider this trade‐off at the design stage of a clinical trial, as this will clarify the exact research question that is being answered, and better guide the planning, design, and analysis of the study.",

    "abstract": "Symptom refractoriness of patients treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) might be explained by polymorphism in CYP2C19. This is a retrospective cohort study in which we used the computerized database of Clalit Health Services to compose a cohort from cancer case‐control studies’ participants that had been genotyped, and that have been dispensed PPI (January 1, 2002 to November 10, 2020). We retrieved demographic and clinical variables on date of PPI initiation (cohort entry), and studies’ questionnaires‐reported consumption of foods/beverages known to increase peptic‐related symptoms. Primary outcome was an abdominal pain diagnosis; secondary outcome was a composite of abdominal pain, visit to a gastroenterology clinic, change to another PPI, PPI dose increase, or metoclopramide prescription, reflecting symptoms persistence/recurrence; in a 2‐year follow‐up. We also evaluated the association between genetic groups and hip/wrist/spine fractures, in a long‐term follow‐up. Of 3,326 PPI initiators, there were 66 (2.0%), 739 (22.2%), 1394 (41.9%), 947 (28.5%), and 180 (5.4%) CYP2C19 poor, intermediate, normal, rapid, and ultra‐rapid metabolizers, respectively. Being a poor metabolizer was associated with lower risk for the primary outcome, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27–0.91), HR = 0.52 (95% CI 0.28–0.94); and for the secondary outcome, HR = 0.57 (95% CI 0.38–0.86), HR = 0.58 (95% CI 0.39–0.87), in univariate and multivariable cox regression analyses, respectively. In long‐term follow‐up with 20,142 person‐years of follow‐up: 7.6% (5 cases) within the poor metabolizers group, and 11.6%, 12.9%, 12.8%, and 11.1% in the normal, intermediate, rapid, and ultra‐rapid metabolizers groups, respectively, had a new fracture (nonsignificant). We conclude that CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status is associated with higher effectiveness of PPIs, and is not associated with higher risk for fractures.",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of about 15% of commonly used drugs, some of which are characterized by a narrow therapeutic window. CYP2C9 is highly polymorphic, and over 60 alleles have been described. CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 are the most common polymorphisms among White patients and both are associated with decreased activity. The evidence concerning the functional importance of less frequent variant alleles is scarce. The objective of the current study was to characterize the in vivo activity of CYP2C9 among carriers of CYP2C9*11 , one of the \"African\" alleles and the fourth most common CYP2C9 variant allele among White patients by using two prototype substrates, phenytoin and ( S )‐warfarin. Single 300‐mg phenytoin and 20‐mg warfarin doses were given to 150 healthy Ethiopian Jewish participants who were nonsmokers, at least one week apart. ( S )‐warfarin oral clearance and phenytoin metabolic ratio (PMR) derived from the ratio of 5‐(4‐hydroxyphenyl)‐5‐phenylhydantoin in 24‐hour urine collection to plasma phenytoin 12 hours (PMR 24/12) or 24 hours (PMR 24/24) post dosing, were used as markers of CYP2C9 activity. PMR 24/12 and PMR 24/24 were reduced by 50% and 62.2%, respectively, among carriers of CYP2C9*1/*11 ( n = 13) as compared with carriers of CYP2C9*1/*1 ( n = 127) (false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.001). The respective decrease in ( S )‐warfarin oral clearance was 52.6% (FDR q < 0.001). In conclusion, the enzyme encoded by CYP2C9*11 is characterized by a more than 50% decrease in the enzymatic activity, resembling the extent of decrease associated with CYP2C9*3 (\"no‐function allele\"). Among patients of African ancestry, CYP2C9*11 genetic analysis should be considered prior to prescribing of narrow therapeutic window drugs such as phenytoin, warfarin, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, or siponimod.",

    "abstract": "To address unresolved questions about drug safety and efficacy at the time of approval, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) may require that manufacturers conduct additional studies during the postmarketing period. As a growing proportion of new cancer drugs are approved on the basis of limited evidence of clinical benefit, timely completion of postmarketing requirements is important. We used publicly available regulatory documents to evaluate key characteristics of pivotal studies supporting EMA‐approved cancer drugs from 2004–2014 and assessed completion rates of postmarketing data collection requirements after a minimum of 5 years. From 2004–2014, 79% (45/57) of EMA‐approved cancer drugs had to fulfill postmarketing requirements. Pivotal trials supporting the approval of cancer drugs with postmarketing requirements were less likely to have randomized designs (41/61, 67% vs. 11/11, 100%), include an active comparator (20/61, 33% vs. 10/11, 91%), or measure overall survival as the primary study end point (18/61, 30% vs. 6/11, 55%) compared with pivotal trials for drugs without postmarketing requirements. Among 200 postmarketing requirements, almost half were designed to assess drug safety. After a minimum of 5 years, 60% (121/200) of requirements were completed, 10% (19/200) were ongoing, and 30% (60/200) were delayed. About half (40/75, 53%) of postmarketing requirements for new clinical studies were completed on time. Delays in the completion of postmarketing requirements often did not impact the likelihood of drugs receiving permanent marketing authorization (87%, 39/45) after 5 years. Our findings highlight the need for EMA to better enforce its authority to require timely completion of postmarketing requirements and studies.",

    "abstract": "During pharmacotherapy, knowledge about the actual drug and metabolite concentrations in plasma is often critical. Individual dose adjustments can be performed based on pre‐emptive genotyping of certain absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) genes but also using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Analyses of liquid biopsies for tumor‐derived components are well‐established and have been found to be a good complement to biopsy examinations. Recently, liquid biopsy‐based quantification of cell‐free RNA (cfRNA) in plasma exosomes was proposed as a proxy measurement for the expression of different hepatic ADME genes and for the rate of drug metabolism, constituting an alternative to TDM. In this study, we validated these findings by examining the correlation between mRNA expression of eight different CYP genes in liver and the corresponding rate of enzyme‐specific drug metabolism in 96 donor‐matched liver samples. Analyses of CYP‐dependent drug metabolism in liver microsomes in comparison to the level of mRNA expression for the different CYP genes revealed a mean Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.28. The highest correlations (0.33–0.34) were obtained for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and the weakest correlations were observed for CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 (0.18–0.21). In all cases, the correlations obtained were too weak to demonstrate a predictive relationship, likely due to different regulatory and post‐translational events controlling the rate of enzyme activity. Our results reinforce the notion that, whilst liquid biopsy‐based approaches might have utility for prediction of hepatic CYP protein expression, they are not currently an important substitute for TDM.",

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first insulin biosimilar interchangeable product in 2021 for improving glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Several recombinant insulin products are available in the United States, including the recently approved biosimilar insulins. The approval of the biosimilar insulin products was based on comparative analytical characterizations and comparative pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data. The primary objective of this review is to discuss the scientific considerations in the demonstration of biosimilarity of a proposed insulin biosimilar to a reference product and the role of clinical pharmacology studies in the determination of biosimilarity and interchangeability. Euglycemic clamp studies are considered a “gold standard” for insulin PK and PD characterization and have been widely used to determine the time‐action profiles of rapid‐acting, intermediate‐acting, and long‐acting insulin products. Clinical pharmacology aspects of study design, including selection of appropriate dose, study population, PK, and PD end points, are presented. Finally, the role of clinical pharmacology studies in the interchangeability assessment of insulin and the regulatory pathways used for insulin and the experience with follow‐on insulins and the two recently approved biosimilar insulin products is discussed.",

Pilot studies and modeling can inform dosing for such PD studies. To that end, we conducted a randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled, single‐dose, parallel‐arm clinical study in healthy participants to evaluate approaches to address information gaps, inform best practices for analysis of biomarker samples and study results, and apply emerging technologies in biomarker characterization. Seventy‐two healthy participants ( n = 8 per arm) received either placebo or 1 of 4 doses of the interleukin‐5 inhibitors mepolizumab (3–24 mg) or reslizumab (0.1–0.8 mg/kg). A clinical study using doses lower than approved therapeutic doses was combined with modeling and simulation to evaluate the dose–response relationship of the biomarker eosinophils. There was no dose–response relationship for eosinophil counts due to variability, although the mepolizumab 24 mg and reslizumab 0.8 mg/kg doses showed clear effects. Published indirect‐response models were used to explore eosinophil data across doses from this study and the unstudied therapeutic doses. Simulations were used to calculate typical PD metrics, such as baseline‐adjusted area under the effect curve and maximum change from baseline. The simulation results demonstrate sensitivity of eosinophils as a PD biomarker and indicate doses lower than the approved doses would have PD responses overlapping with variability in the placebo arm. The simulation results further highlight the utility of model‐based approaches in supporting use of PD biomarkers in biosimilar development.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between race and biology is complex. In contemporary medical science, race is a social construct that is measured via self‐identification of study participants. But even though race has no biological essence, it is often used as variable in medical guidelines (e.g., treatment recommendations specific for Black people with hypertension). Such recommendations are based on clinical trials in which there was a significant correlation between self‐identified race and actual, but often unmeasured, health‐related factors such as (pharmaco)genetics, diet, sun exposure, etc. Many teachers are insufficiently aware of this complexity. In their classes, they (unintentionally) portray self‐reported race as having a biological essence. This may cause students to see people of shared race as biologically or genetically homogeneous, and believe that race‐based recommendations are true for all individuals (rather than reflecting the average of a heterogeneous group). This medicalizes race and reinforces already existing healthcare disparities. Moreover, students may fail to learn that the relation between race and health is easily biased by factors such as socioeconomic status, racism, ancestry, and environment and that this limits the generalizability of race‐based recommendations. We observed that the clinical case vignettes that we use in our teaching contain many stereotypes and biases, and do not generally reflect the diversity of actual patients. This guide, written by clinical pharmacology and therapeutics teachers, aims to help our colleagues and teachers in other health professions to reflect on and improve our teaching on race‐based medical guidelines and to make our clinical case vignettes more inclusive and diverse.",

    "abstract": "Contrast‐induced nephropathy (CIN) is a major complication of imaging in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The publication of an academic randomized controlled trial (RCT; n = 83) reporting oral (N)‐acetylcysteine (NAC) to reduce CIN led to > 70 clinical trials, 23 systematic reviews, and 2 large RCTs showing no benefit. However, no mechanistic studies were conducted to determine how NAC might work; proposed mechanisms included renal artery vasodilatation and antioxidant boosting. We evaluated the proposed mechanisms of NAC action in participants with healthy and diseased kidneys. Four substudies were performed. Two randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, three‐period crossover studies ( n = 8) assessed the effect of oral and intravenous (i.v.) NAC in healthy kidneys in the presence/absence of iso‐osmolar contrast (iodixanol). A third crossover study in patients with CKD stage III (CKD3) ( n = 8) assessed the effect of oral and i.v. NAC without contrast. A three‐arm randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled parallel‐group study, recruiting patients with CKD3 ( n = 66) undergoing coronary angiography, assessed the effect of oral and i.v. NAC in the presence of contrast. We recorded systemic (blood pressure and heart rate) and renal (renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)) hemodynamics, and antioxidant status, plus biomarkers of renal injury in patients with CKD3 undergoing angiography. Primary outcome for all studies was RBF over 8 hours after the start of i.v. NAC/placebo. NAC at doses used in previous trials of renal prophylaxis was essentially undetectable in plasma after oral administration. In healthy volunteers, i.v. NAC, but not oral NAC, increased blood pressure (mean area under the curve (AUC) mean arterial pressure (MAP): mean difference 29 h⋅mmHg, P = 0.019 vs. placebo), heart rate (28 h⋅bpm, P < 0.001), and RBF (714 h⋅mL/min, 8.0% increase, P = 0.006). Renal vasodilatation also occurred in the presence of contrast (RBF 917 h⋅mL/min, 12% increase, P = 0.005). In patients with CKD3 without contrast, only a rise in heart rate (34 h⋅bpm, P = 0.010) and RBF (288 h⋅mL/min, 6.0% increase, P = 0.001) occurred with i.v. NAC, with no significant effect on blood pressure (MAP rise 26 h⋅mmHg, P = 0.156). Oral NAC showed no effect. In patients with CKD3 receiving contrast, i.v. NAC increased blood pressure (MAP rise 52 h⋅mmHg, P = 0.008) but had no effect on RBF (151 h⋅mL/min, 3.0% increase, P = 0.470), GFR (29 h⋅mL/min/1.73m², P = 0.122), or markers of renal injury. Neither i.v. nor oral NAC affected plasma antioxidant status. We found oral NAC to be poorly absorbed and have no reno‐protective effects. Intravenous, not oral, NAC caused renal artery vasodilatation in healthy volunteers but offered no protection to patients with CKD3 at risk of CIN. These findings emphasize the importance of mechanistic clinical studies before progressing to RCTs for novel interventions. Thousands were recruited to academic clinical trials without the necessary mechanistic studies being performed to confirm the approach had any chance of working.",

To address this drug development need, the T1D Consortium (i) acquired, remapped, integrated, and curated existing patient‐level data from relevant observational studies, and (ii) used a model‐based approach to evaluate the utility of islet autoantibodies (AAs) against insulin/proinsulin autoantibody, GAD65, IA‐2, and ZnT8 as biomarkers to enrich subjects for T1D prevention. The aggregated dataset was used to construct an accelerated failure time model for predicting T1D diagnosis. The model quantifies presence of islet AA permutations as statistically significant predictors of the time‐varying probability of conversion to a diagnosis of T1D. Additional sources of variability that greatly improved the accuracy of quantifying the time‐varying probability of conversion to a T1D diagnosis included baseline age, sex, blood glucose measurements from the 120‐minute timepoints of oral glucose tolerance tests, and hemoglobin A1c. The developed models represented the underlying evidence to qualify islet AAs as enrichment biomarkers through the qualification of novel methodologies for drug development pathway at the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Additionally, the models are intended as the foundation of a fully functioning end‐user tool that will allow sponsors to optimize enrichment criteria for clinical trials in T1D prevention studies.",

    "abstract": "Tofacitinib is an oral small molecule JAK inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Relationships between plasma tofacitinib concentration and efficacy were characterized using exposure‐response (E‐R) models, with demographic and disease covariates evaluated as potential predictors of efficacy. Data were from phase II and III (OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2) induction studies, and a phase III maintenance study (OCTAVE Sustain). Induction studies included 1,355 patients (tofacitinib 0.5, 3, 10, or 15 mg b.i.d. or placebo). The maintenance study included 592 patients (tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg b.i.d. or placebo). E‐R models, including induction patients predicted placebo‐adjusted remission rates of 6.4% and 12.7% at week 8 for tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg b.i.d., respectively; corresponding rates in patients without prior tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) failure were 12.8% and 20.4%. Estimates to achieve/maintain remission at week 52 of maintenance were 29% and 18% (tofacitinib 5 mg b.i.d.), and 41% and 26% (tofacitinib 10 mg b.i.d.), for patients in remission or not following induction, respectively. During maintenance, patients with prior TNFi failure had lower probability of remission on 5 mg b.i.d. (24.9%) than 10 mg b.i.d. (35.0%). Results indicated tofacitinib 10 mg b.i.d. was an appropriate induction dose but suggested efficacy with 5 mg b.i.d. in patients without prior TNFi failure. Tofacitinib 5 mg b.i.d. was efficacious for maintenance, although patients with prior TNFi failure might see additional benefit on 10 mg b.i.d. Per product labeling, recommended tofacitinib induction dose is 10 mg b.i.d., then maintenance at 5 mg b.i.d. For patients who lose response during maintenance, 10 mg b.i.d. may be considered, limited to the shortest duration. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00787202; NCT01465763; NCT01458951; and NCT01458574.",

Although the possibility of PD biomarkers replacing the to‐date routine comparative phase III confirmatory study currently expected by the FDA was discussed, the motivation and feasibility for biosimilar sponsors developing such markers and the regulatory risks entailed largely were not. Even more fundamental is the already established greater comparative value of the pharmacokinetic (PK) study as the most sensitive clinical assay for detecting subtle differences between two products. Consequently, the comparative analytical assessment and the head‐to‐head PKs will have already answered the core questions as to the biosimilarity of the candidate product to its reference. No further actionable information is obtained with either a PD study or a comparative clinical phase III study even as they may provide some reassurance of what is already known. When a suitable PD biomarker is available for the originator reference product they have already been used for biosimilar development. We must carefully consider the core requirements and timelines inherent in biosimilar development and how they occur in parallel rather than in the series we see for originator products. In order to improve the efficiency of biosimilar development, we need to ask the right questions based on a full understanding of how biosimilars have been developed to date and can be in the future.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinin‐based combination therapies (ACTs) are the primary treatment for malaria. It is essential to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of ACTs in vulnerable populations at risk of suboptimal dosing. We developed a population PK/PD model using data from our previous study of artemether‐lumefantrine in HIV‐uninfected and HIV‐infected children living in a high‐transmission region of Uganda. HIV‐infected children were on efavirenz‐, nevirapine‐, or lopinavir‐ritonavir‐based antiretroviral regimens, with daily trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. We assessed selection for resistance in two key parasite transporters, pfcrt and pfmdr1 , over 42‐day follow‐up and incorporated genotyping into a time‐to‐event model to ascertain how resistance genotype in relation to drug exposure impacts recurrence risk. Two hundred seventy‐seven children contributed 364 episodes to the model (186 HIV‐uninfected and 178 HIV‐infected), with recurrent microscopy‐detectable parasitemia detected in 176 episodes by day 42. The final model was a two‐compartment model with first‐order absorption and an estimated age effect on bioavailability. Systemic lumefantrine exposure was highest with lopinavir‐ritonavir, lowest with efavirenz, and equivalent with nevirapine and HIV‐uninfected children. HIV status and lumefantrine concentration were significant factors associated with recurrence risk. Significant selection was demonstrated for pfmdr1 N86 and pfcrt K76 in recurrent infections, with no evidence of selection for pfmdr1 Y184F. Less sensitive parasites were able to tolerate lumefantrine concentrations ~ 3.5‐fold higher than more sensitive parasites. This is the first population PK model of lumefantrine in HIV‐infected children and demonstrates selection for reduced lumefantrine susceptibility, a concern as we confront the threat to ACTs posed by emerging artemisinin resistance in Africa.",

In this study, with 36 healthy participants randomized to therapeutic doses of interferon‐beta 1a products (IFNβ‐1a) or pegylated‐IFNβ‐1a (pegIFNβ‐1a) approved to treat multiple sclerosis or placebo, we evaluated the utility of a proteomic assay that profiles > 7,000 plasma proteins. IFNβ‐1a and pegIFNβ‐1a resulted in 248 and 528 differentially expressed protein analytes, respectively, between treatment and placebo groups over the time course. Thirty‐one proteins were prioritized based on a maximal fold change ≥ 2 from baseline, baseline adjusted area under the effect curve (AUEC) and overlap between the 2 products. Of these, the majority had a significant AUEC compared with placebo in response to either product; 8 proteins showed > 4‐fold maximal change from baseline. We identified previously reported candidates, beta‐2microglobulin and interferon‐induced GTP‐binding protein (Mx1) with ~ 50% coefficient of variation (CV) for AUEC, and many new candidates (including I‐TAC, C1QC, and IP‐10) with CVs ranging from 26%–129%. Upstream regulator analysis of differentially expressed proteins predicted activation of IFNβ1 signaling as well as other cytokine, enzyme, and transcription signaling networks by both products. Although independent replication is required to confirm present results, our study demonstrates the utility of proteomics for the identification of individual and composite candidate PD biomarkers that may be leveraged to support clinical pharmacology studies for biosimilar approvals, especially when biologics have complex mechanisms of action or do not have previously characterized PD biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Black patients suffer worse outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) than White patients. Inequities in antiplatelet prescribing may contribute to this health disparity. We compared P2Y 12 inhibitor prescribing by race following CYP2C19 genotyping to guide antiplatelet therapy selection after PCI. Patients from 9 sites that performed clinical CYP2C19 genotyping after PCI were included. Alternative therapy (e.g., prasugrel or ticagrelor) was recommended for CYP2C19 no‐function allele carriers, in whom clopidogrel is predicted to be less effective. The primary outcome was choice of P2Y 12 inhibitor (clopidogrel vs. alternative therapy) based on genotype. Of 3,342 patients included, 2,448 (73%) were White, and 659 (20%) were Black. More Black than White patients had a no‐function allele (34.3% vs. 29.7%, P = 0.024). At hospital discharge following PCI, 44.2% of Black and 44.0% of White no‐function allele carriers were prescribed alternative therapy. At the time of the last follow‐up within 12 months, numerically fewer Black (51.8%) than White (56.7%) no‐function allele carriers were prescribed alternative therapy ( P = 0.190). However, the difference was not significant after accounting for other factors associated with P2Y 12 inhibitor selection (odds ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.58–1.08). Alternative therapy use did not differ between Black (14.3%) and White (16.7%) patients without a no‐function allele ( P = 0.232). Among real‐world patients who received CYP2C19 testing after PCI, P2Y 12 inhibitor prescribing rates did not differ between Black and White patients. Our data suggest an absence of racial disparity in genotype‐guided antiplatelet prescribing among patients receiving CYP2C19 testing.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of CYP2D6 phenotype from genotype information is important to support safe and efficacious pharmacotherapy with CYP2D6 substrates. To facilitate accurate CYP2D6 genotype–phenotype translation, there remains a need to investigate the enzyme activity associated with individual CYP2D6 alleles using large clinical data sets. This study aimed to quantify and compare the in vivo function of different CYP2D6 alleles through population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling of brexpiprazole using data from 13 clinical studies. A PopPK model of brexpiprazole and its two metabolites, DM‐3411 and DM‐3412, was developed based on plasma concentration samples from 826 individuals. As the minor metabolite, DM‐3412, is formed via CYP2D6, the metabolic ratio of DM‐3412:brexpiprazole calculated from the PopPK parameter estimates was used as a surrogate measure of CYP2D6 activity. A CYP2D6 genotype–phenotype analysis based on 496 subjects showed that the CYP2D6*2 allele ( n = 183) was associated with only 10% enzyme activity relative to the wild‐type allele ( CYP2D6*1 ) and a low enzyme activity was consistently observed across genotypes containing CYP2D6*2 . Among the decreased function alleles, the following enzyme activities relative to CYP2D6*1 were estimated: 23% for CYP2D6*9 ( n = 20), 32% for CYP2D6*10 ( n = 62), 64% for CYP2D6*14 ( n = 1), 4% for CYP2D6*17 ( n = 37), 4% for CYP2D6*29 ( n = 13), and 9% for CYP2D6*41 ( n = 64). These findings imply that a lower functional value would more accurately reflect the in vivo function of many reduced function CYP2D6 alleles in the metabolism of brexpiprazole. The low enzyme activity observed for CYP2D6*2 , which has also been reported by others, suggests that the allele exhibits substrate‐specific enzyme activity.",

The public workshop was a forum for global regulators, biopharmaceutical developers, and academic researchers to discuss the current and future role of PD biomarkers in improving the efficiency of biosimilar development and approval. The workshop objectives included: (i) discuss the current and potential future state of leveraging PD biomarkers for biosimilar development and approval; (ii) summarize the FDA's initiatives to advance biosimilar development; (iii) describe stakeholders' experience with PD biomarkers in biosimilar development; and (iv) explain research efforts to promote broader application of PD biomarkers in biosimilar development.

    "abstract": "Although at least 25 million adults are transgender worldwide, few phase III clinical trials have enrolled transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people. HIV is the only therapeutic area to include TGD people intentionally in phase III randomized clinical trials during the development of certain newer HIV pharmacologic prevention interventions. Pharmacologic assessments for HIV prevention efficacy in TGD populations are important, as there may be specific considerations for product use and potential interactions with hormone therapies. Herein, we summarize ongoing and completed phase III HIV trials that included TGD people as part of the study population, we examine investigators’ strategies for recruiting and engaging TGD priority populations in these phase III trials, and we comment on the implications of these studies for prioritizing TGD populations in clinical pharmacology research within the phase III clinical trial landscape.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trial participant populations fail to adequately represent target populations that drugs are intended to serve. Improving racial and ethnic diversity of clinical trial participants is essential for generalizable, quality clinical research results and ensuring social and medical equity. Site‐level clinical research professionals (CRPs) have unique insights on diversity improvement strategies for clinical trial enrollment. A survey was distributed to current CRPs working at clinical research sites in the United States to describe current practices and perceptions of the impact these practices have on participant diversity. Subsequently, descriptive quantitative analysis and inductive content analysis were performed. For the practices surveyed, there are discrepancies between frequency of use and perceived impact on diversity enrollment. Common current practices include phone‐based or telemedicine study visits, electronic/digital data collection, and participant compensation. However, we report travel reimbursement and services, translated documents and translator services, and adequate participant compensation as most impactful on diverse enrollment. A multistakeholder approach is necessary to enhance diversity and inclusion (D&I) of study participants. Besides large‐scale solutions such as countering community distrust, actionable steps are needed by sponsors and study sites to improve D&I of trial participants. Study leadership at the sponsor, contract research organization (CRO), and site‐level should create diversity plans prior to study start, and CRO and sponsor budgets should consider D&I strategies during study planning. Planning should incorporate strategies to improve D&I including adequate participant compensation, translated documents and translator services, and travel reimbursements.",

    "abstract": "Global regulatory agencies have transformed their approach to approvals in their processes for formal review of the safety and efficacy of new drugs. Opportunities for innovation have expanded because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. Several regulatory‐led initiatives have progressed rapidly during the past year, including patient‐focused drug development, model‐informed drug development, real‐world evidence, and complex innovative trial designs. Collectively, these initiatives have accelerated the rate of approvals. Despite demands to focus on urgent needs imposed by the COVID‐19 pandemic, the number of new drug approvals over the past year, particularly for rare diseases, has outpaced expectations. Advancing therapeutics for nervous system disorders requires adaptive strategies that align with rapid developments in the field. Three relentlessly progressive diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Parkinson’s disease are in urgent need of new treatments. Herein, we propose new regulatory initiatives, including innovative trial designs and patient‐focused drug development that accelerate clinical trial conduct while meeting critical regulatory requirements for therapeutic approval.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize and assess the current status of the compassionate use program’s application in Japan by evaluating expanded access clinical trials (EACTs) conducted between 2016 and 2021. In this study, a data set containing all EACTs, and pivotal clinical trials (PCTs) conducted in Japan between February 2016 and April 2021 was obtained from the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency, systemically reviewed, and analyzed. During the 5 years since EACTs began in Japan, out of 2,031 PCTs, 31 EACTs were conducted in Japan. Twenty‐four trials (77.4%) of the 31 EACTs used anticancer drugs and 5 of those trials (16.1%) were conducted in children. Furthermore, we conducted an EACT survey for drugs with a high degree of social and patient demands as recommended in the EACT notification. Among the 2,031 PCTs, we found 152 trials with high degree of social and patient demands. Of these, EACT was implemented in 17 trials (11.2%). Days from the start of the EACT to the submission of new drug applications and the approval were 9.0 (67.0–56.5) and 208.0 (172.8–308.8) days, respectively. Of the 31 EACTs conducted, 24 (77.4%) drugs have been approved as of August 2021. This first comprehensive study on EACTs clarified the current status and issues of Japan’s compassionate use system and the 5 years since the program initiated.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, 922 million women of reproductive age (or their partners) use some sort of contraception to prevent pregnancy. Oral combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) typically utilize a combination of a progestin and an estrogen. CHCs are potentially at risk to metabolic drug–drug interaction (DDI) via CYP3A4, the main enzyme involved in the oxidative metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and most progestins (e.g., levonorgestrel (LNG) and drospirenone (DRSP)). Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a guidance addressing metabolic DDIs in the realm of CHC, establishing an overall class‐based recommendation with respect to avoidance of CYP3A4 induction interactions. Given that different progestins have varying magnitudes of fraction metabolized by CYP3A4 (fm CYP3A4 ), it would be of clinical benefit to determine if all progestins are at the same risk to CYP3A4‐mediated metabolic DDIs. LNG and DRSP are commonly used progestins that are at the margins of the rifampicin induction effect observed in vivo because they have the relatively lowest and highest fm CYP3A4 among commonly used CHC formulations containing norgestimate, desogestrel, norgestrel, and norethindrone. Therefore, we applied a multi‐pronged strategy (i.e., (i) development of the physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic models; (ii) comparison of the effect of CYP3A inducers and inhibitors on DRSP vs. LNG; and (iii) providing the clinical‐practice context based on real‐world data, to explore the difference in DDI risk for oral CHCs.",

    "abstract": "Thiopurine dose optimization by thiopurine‐S‐methyltransferase ( TPMT ) or nudix hydrolase‐15 ( NUDT15 ) significantly reduced early leucopenia in Asia. However, it fails to avoid the late incidence (> 2 months). Although laboratory monitoring of 6‐thioguanine nucleotides (6TGN) to optimize thiopurine dose was suggested in White patients the exact association between leucopenia and 6TGN was controversial in Asian patients. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether DNA‐thioguanine nucleotides (DNA‐TGs) in leukocytes, compared with 6TGN in erythrocytes, can be a better biomarker for late leucopenia. This was a prospective, observational study. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prescribed thiopurine from February 2019 to December 2019 were recruited. Thiopurine dose was optimized by NUDT15 C415T (rs116855232). DNA‐TG and 6TGN levels were determined at the time of late leucopenia or 2 months after the stable dose was obtained. A total of 308 patients were included. Thiopurine induced late leucopenia (white blood cells < 3.5 × 10 9 /L) were observed in 43 patients (14.0%), who had significantly higher DNA‐TG concentration than those without leucopenia ( P = 4.1 × 10 –9 , 423.3 (~ 342.2 to 565.7) vs. 270.5 (~ 188.1 to 394.3) fmol/μg DNA). No difference in 6TGN concentrations between leucopenia and non‐leucopenia was found. With a DNA‐TG threshold of 340.1 fmol/μg DNA, 83.7% of leucopenia cases could be identified. Multivariate analysis showed that DNA‐TG was an independent risk factor for late leucopenia. Quantification of DNA‐TG, rather than 6TGN, can be applied to gauge thiopurine therapy after NUDT15 screening in Chinese patients with IBD.",

    "abstract": "Eliglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor indicated as a long‐term substrate reduction therapy for adults with type 1 Gaucher disease, a lysosomal rare disease. It is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), and variants in the gene encoding this enzyme are important determinants of eliglustat pharmacokinetics (PK) and drug–drug interactions (DDIs). The existing drug label addresses the DDIs to some extent but has omitted scenarios where both metabolizing CYPs (2D6 and 3A4) are mildly or moderately inhibited. The objectives of this study were (i) to develop and validate an eliglustat physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model with and without drug interactions, (ii) to simulate untested DDI scenarios, and (iii) to explore potential dosing flexibility using lower dose strength of eliglustat (commercially not available). PK data from healthy adults receiving eliglustat with or without interacting drugs were obtained from literature and used for the PBPK model development and validation. The model‐predicted single‐dose and steady‐state maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) of eliglustat were within 50–150% of the observed values when eliglustat was administered alone or coadministered with ketoconazole or paroxetine. Then as model‐based simulations, we illustrated eliglustat exposure as a victim of interaction when coadministered with fluvoxamine following the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dosing recommendations. Second, we showed that with lower eliglustat doses (21 mg, 42 mg once daily) the exposure in participants of intermediate and poor metabolizer phenotypes was within the outlined safety margin (C max <250 ng/mL) when eliglustat was administered with ketoconazole, where the current recommendation is a contraindication of coadministration (84 mg). The present study demonstrated that patients with CYP2D6 deficiency may benefit from lower doses of eliglustat.",

    "abstract": "After market exclusivity ends for biologic drugs, biosimilars—follow‐on versions made by other manufacturers—can compete with lower prices. Biosimilars have modestly reduced prescription drug spending for US payers, but it is unclear whether patients have directly experienced any savings. In this study we assessed whether availability of biosimilar infliximab was associated with lower out‐of‐pocket (OOP) costs, using claims from a national data set of commercially insured patients from 2014 to 2018. We used two‐part models, adjusting for patient demographics, clinical characteristics, insurance plan type, and calendar month. Compared with the reference biologic, there was no difference in the percentage of biosimilar claims with OOP costs (30.1% vs. 30.8%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.84–1.15, P = 0.84) or the average nonzero OOP cost (median $378 vs. $538, adjusted mean ratio (aMR) 0.97, 95% CI, 0.80–1.18, P = 0.77). The percentage of claims with OOP costs was lower after biosimilar competition (30.7% vs. 35.0%, aOR 0.96, 95% CI, 0.94–0.99, P = 0.003), but average nonzero costs increased (median $534 vs. $520, aMR 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01–1.07, P = 0.004). Thus, early biosimilar infliximab competition did not improve affordability for patients. Policymakers need to better assure that competition in the biosimilar market translates to lower costs for patients using these medications.",

Inclisiran's GalNAc attachment results in a rapid uptake into the liver, and thus a short plasma half‐life, but long duration of effects on PCSK9 inhibition and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) lowering. The effects on PCSK9 inhibition and consequent LDL‐C reduction are sustained for more than 6 months following a single subcutaneous (s.c.) dose, despite inclisiran being detectable in the plasma only for up to 48 hours. A kinetic‐pharmacodynamic (K‐PD) model was developed to characterize inclisiran's dose‐related LDL‐C lowering effects and to evaluate the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on LDL‐C lowering. To accommodate the long duration of action, the K‐PD model incorporated an effect compartment which represents the liver. Inclisiran concentration in the liver leads to decreased production of the PCSK9 protein and allow recycling of more LDL‐C receptors on the hepatocyte cell surface, which results in a reduction of circulating LDL‐C. The analysis of covariates identified PCSK9 and LDL‐C baseline levels as important factors for the effects of LDL‐C lowering. Observations and modeling and simulation results demonstrated that PCSK9 and LDL‐C reductions are achieved rapidly after dosing and sustained when patients are treated with a 300 mg s.c. dose once every 6 months.",

This work provides a retrospective evaluation of a single critical quality attribute—high mannose glycans for monoclonal antibody biosimilars. Given the well‐established conclusion that high mannose glycans can impact pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, we performed a retrospective evaluation of 21 monoclonal antibody biosimilar programs (those licensed before April 2022), their levels of glycans, and the methods used to study them. We provide herein a summary of the methods used and their relative performance. We also present a subset analysis for seven biosimilar products with levels of high mannose that differ from the corresponding reference product (and where other differences in quality attributes between the two that may influence PK profile were not observed or considered minor) and compared the PK profiles. Critically, this analysis has demonstrated that the measurement of glycan profiles is highly precise, reproducible within and across programs, and can detect differences in mannose levels, even those that do not impact PK. These results provide support that analytics rather than pharmacokinetic data may be sufficient to predict whether differences within a certain magnitude of this attribute are likely to impact PK. This work enhances the Agency's understanding of this issue allowing for better understanding of challenges faced by the biotechnology industry developing biosimilars.",

    "abstract": "Understanding persistence of humoral immune responses elicited by vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is critical for informing the duration of protection and appropriate booster timing. We developed a mechanistic model to characterize the time course of humoral immune responses in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)–seronegative adults after primary vaccination with the Janssen COVID‐19 vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S. The persistence of antibody responses was quantified through mechanistic modeling‐based simulations. Two biomarkers of humoral immune responses were examined: SARS‐CoV‐2 neutralizing antibodies determined by wild‐type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA) and spike protein‐binding antibodies determined by indirect spike protein enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (S‐ELISA). The persistence of antibody responses was defined as the period of time during which wtVNA and S‐ELISA titers remained above the lower limit of quantification. A total of 442 wtVNA and 1,185 S‐ELISA titers from 82 and 220 participants, respectively, were analyzed following administration of a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5 × 10 10 viral particles). The mechanistic model adequately described the time course of observed wtVNA and S‐ELISA serum titers and its associated variability up to 8 months following vaccination. Mechanistic model‐based simulations show that single‐dose Ad26.COV2.S elicits durable but waning antibody responses up to 24 months following immunization. Of the estimated model parameters, the production rate of memory B cells was decreased in older adults relative to younger adults, and the antibody production rate mediated by long‐lived plasma cells was increased in women relative to men. A steeper waning of antibody responses was predicted in men and in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Antiviral treatments against hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppress viral replication but do not eradicate the virus, and need therefore to be taken lifelong to avoid relapse. Mathematical models can be useful to support the development of curative anti‐HBV agents; however, they mostly focus on short‐term HBV DNA data and neglect the complex host‐pathogen interaction. This work aimed to characterize the effect of treatment with lamivudine and/or pegylated interferon (Peg‐IFN) in 1,300 patients (hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)–positive and HBeAg‐negative) treated for 1 year. A mathematical model was developed incorporating two populations of infected cells, namely , with a high transcriptional activity, that progressively evolve into , at a rate , representing cells with integrated HBV DNA that have a lower transcriptional activity. Parameters of the model were estimated in patients treated with lamivudine or Peg‐IFN alone ( N = 894), and the model was then validated in patients treated with lamivudine plus Peg‐IFN ( N = 436) to predict the virological response after a year of combination treatment. Lamivudine had a larger effect in blocking viral production than Peg‐IFN (99.4–99.9% vs. 91.8–95.1%); however, Peg‐IFN had a significant immunomodulatory effect, leading to an enhancement of the loss rates of  (×1.7 in HBeAg‐positive patients),  (> ×7 irrespective of HBeAg status), and  (×4.6 and ×2.0 in HBeAg‐positive and HBeAg‐negative patients, respectively). Using this model, we were able to describe the synergy of the different effects occurring during treatment with combination and predicted an effect of 99.99% on blocking viral production. This framework can therefore support the optimization of combination therapy with new anti‐HBV agents.",

    "abstract": "Neutropenia is a dose‐related treatment‐limiting and costly adverse event of pemetrexed. We postulate that individualized dosing reduces the incidence of neutropenia. The aims of this study were (i) to investigate the costs of pemetrexed‐related neutropenia and (ii) to determine the pharmacoeconomic benefits of individualized dosing of pemetrexed in terms of budget impact, yearly cost savings, and reduction in severe neutropenia. Retrospective data on the treatment of grade 3 or higher neutropenia during pemetrexed‐based chemotherapy were collected from three Dutch hospitals to determine the mean healthcare consumption during a neutropenic episode. Subsequently, Monte Carlo simulations were performed using a validated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to predict the neutropenia incidence during four cycles for standard dosing of pemetrexed and individualized dosing. The mean costs per neutropenia and the expected neutropenia incidence were combined to calculate the budget impact and cost savings. We found that the average costs per pemetrexed‐associated neutropenic episode to be €1,490 (US $1,674). The neutropenia incidence for the standard and individualized pemetrexed dosing strategies were 12.7% and 9.9%, respectively. This resulted in total expected neutropenia‐related costs of ~ €3.0 million (US $3.372 million) and €2.4 million (US $2.697 million), respectively. Taking the number of patients eligible for pemetrexed treatment into account, individualized dosing could result in saving €686,000 (US $770,995) on a yearly basis in the Netherlands alone. Individualized dosing of pemetrexed can decrease the incidence of neutropenia and thus result in a significant decrease in neutropenia‐related costs and decreased risk of hospitalization or even death while maintaining therapeutic exposure.",

    "abstract": "Chloroquine and azithromycin were developed in combination for the preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, and more recently were proposed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) treatment options. Billions of doses of chloroquine have been administered worldwide over the past 70 years but concerns regarding cardiotoxicity, notably the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP), remain. This investigation aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics and electrocardiographic effects of chloroquine and azithromycin observed in a large previously conducted healthy volunteer study. Healthy adult volunteers ( n = 119) were randomized into 5 arms: placebo, chloroquine alone (600 mg base), or chloroquine with either 500 mg, 1,000 mg, or 1,500 mg of azithromycin all given daily for 3 days. Chloroquine and azithromycin levels, measured using liquid‐chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and electrocardiograph intervals were recorded at frequent intervals. Time‐matched changes in the PR, QRS, and heart rate‐corrected JT, and QT intervals were calculated and the relationship with plasma concentrations was evaluated using linear and nonlinear mixed‐effects modeling. Chloroquine and azithromycin pharmacokinetics were described satisfactorily by two‐ and three‐compartment distribution models, respectively. No drug–drug interaction between chloroquine and azithromycin was observed. Chloroquine resulted in concentration‐dependent prolongation of the PR, QRS, JTc and QTc intervals with a minimal additional effect of azithromycin. QRS widening contributed ~ 28% of the observed QT prolongation. Chloroquine causes significant concentration‐dependent delays in both ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Co‐administration of azithromycin did not significantly increase these effects. The arrhythmogenic risk of TdP associated with chloroquine may have been substantially overestimated in studies which did not separate electrocardiograph QRS and JT prolongation.",

    "abstract": "High saturated fat diets have been shown to raise blood levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) and induce nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). CCK receptors are expressed on stellate cells and are responsible for hepatic fibrosis when activated. The purpose of this study was to test the safety and dose of a CCK receptor antagonist, proglumide, in human participants with NASH. An open‐label single ascending dose study was conducted in 18 participants with clinical NASH based upon steatosis by liver ultrasound, elevated hepatic transaminases, and a component of the metabolic syndrome. Three separate cohorts ( N = 6 each) were treated with oral proglumide for 12 weeks in a sequential ascending fashion with 800 (Cohort 1), 1,200 (Cohort 2), and 1,600 (Cohort 3) mg/day, respectively. Blood hematology, chemistries, proglumide levels, a biomarker panel for fibrosis, and symptom surveys were determined at baseline and every 4 weeks. Abdominal ultrasounds and transient elastography utilizing FibroScan were obtained at baseline and at Week 12. Proglumide was well tolerated at all doses without any serious adverse events. There was no change in body weight from baseline to Week 12. For Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, the median percent change in alanine aminotransferase was 8.42, −5.05, and −22.23 and median percent change in fibrosis score by FibroScan was 8.13, −5.44, and −28.87 (kPa), respectively. Hepatic steatosis as measured by controlled attenuation parameter score significantly decreased with proglumide, ( P < 0.05). Blood microRNA biomarkers and serum 4‐hydroxyproline were consistent with decreased fibrosis at Week 12 compared with baseline. These findings suggest proglumide exhibits anti‐inflammatory and anti‐fibrotic properties and this compound is well tolerated in participants with NASH.",

    "abstract": "Myostatin, a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth, is a therapeutic target in muscle‐wasting diseases. Domagrozumab, a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody, binds myostatin and inhibits activity. Domagrozumab was investigated in a phase II trial (NCT02310763) as a potential treatment for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling is vital in clinical trial design, particularly for determining dosing regimens in pediatric populations. This analysis sought to establish the PK/PD relationship between free domagrozumab and total myostatin concentrations in pediatric patients with DMD using a prior semimechanistic model developed from a phase I study in healthy adult volunteers (NCT01616277) and following inclusion of phase II data. The refined model was developed using a multiple‐step approach comprising structural, random effects, and covariate model development; assessment of model adequacy (goodness‐of‐fit); and predictive performance. Differences in PKs/PDs between healthy adult volunteers and pediatric patients with DMD were quantitatively accounted for and evaluated by predicting myostatin coverage (the percentage of myostatin bound by domagrozumab). The final model parameter estimates and semimechanistic target‐mediated drug disposition structure sufficiently described both domagrozumab and myostatin concentrations in pediatric patients with DMD, and most population parameters were comparable with the prior model (in healthy adult volunteers). Predicted myostatin coverage for phase II patients with DMD was consistently > 90%. Baseline serum myostatin was ~ 65% lower than in healthy adult volunteers. This study provides insights into the regulation of myostatin in healthy adults and pediatric patients with DMD. Clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: NCT01616277 and NCT02310763.",

    "abstract": "Model‐informed dose selection has been drawing increasing interest in oncology early clinical development. The current paper describes the example of FGF401, a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) inhibitor, in which a comprehensive modeling and simulation (M&S) framework, using both pharmacometrics and statistical methods, was established during its first‐in‐human clinical development using the totality of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers, and safety and efficacy data in patients with cancer. These M&S results were used to inform FGF401 dose selection for future development. A two‐compartment population PK (PopPK) model with a delayed 0‐order absorption and linear elimination adequately described FGF401 PK. Indirect PopPK/PD models including a precursor compartment were independently established for two biomarkers: circulating FGF19 and 7α‐hydroxy‐4‐cholesten‐3‐one (C4). Model simulations indicated a close‐to‐maximal PD effect achieved at the clinical exposure range. Time‐to‐progression was analyzed by Kaplan–Meier method which favored a trough concentration ( C trough )–driven efficacy requiring C trough above a threshold close to the drug concentration producing 90% inhibition of phospho‐FGFR4. Clinical tumor growth inhibition was described by a PopPK/PD model that reproduced the dose‐dependent effect on tumor growth. Exposure–safety analyses on the expected on‐target adverse events, including elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and diarrhea, indicated a lack of clinically relevant relationship with FGF401 exposure. Simulations from an indirect PopPK/PD model established for alanine aminotransferase, including a chain of three precursor compartments, further supported that maximal target inhibition was achieved and there was a lack of safety‐exposure relationship. This M&S framework supported a dose selection of 120 mg once daily fasted or with a low‐fat meal and provides a practical example that might be applied broadly in oncology early clinical development.",

    "abstract": "The association between proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and dementia remains controversial. This cohort study re‐examines this issue, addressing shortcomings identified in previous publications using a population‐based and a high‐dimension propensity‐score matched cohort to follow patients for up to 22 years. Cox regression models using baseline characteristics, a lag period, and time‐varying variables were used to examine the risk of dementia by cumulative PPI exposure. High‐dose PPI users (> 180 days of use) had significantly higher risk of dementia in crude Cox models. After adjustment for medical diagnoses and prescription drug use, these associations disappeared. Among high‐dose users starting PPI therapy between 46 and 55 years old, the unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14, 2.10); the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.80, 1.51). For high‐dose users starting therapy between 56 and 65 years, HR = 1.22 (95% CI1.03, 1.44); aHR = 0.99 (95% CI 0.83, 1.17). High‐dose users between the ages of 66 and 75 years had no association with the risk of dementia. The use of lag models or time‐varying parameters similarly found some association with dementia in crude, but not multivariable Cox models. Although high‐dose PPI users were more likely to develop dementia, they were more likely to be diagnosed with dementia risk factors, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which are risk factors for dementia. Controlling for these conditions using multivariable models or a propensity‐score matched cohort eliminated this association.",

The dysregulation of the hemostatic pathways revealed to play a pivotal role. Here, we review the numerous findings providing evidence on the involvement of hemostasis components in MS pathogenesis to highlight why they might be considered potential therapeutic targets in the disease. A literature search for articles from January 1950 to September 2021 was conducted in PubMed and Scopus. A consistent body of evidence supports the pro‐inflammatory activity of activated platelets in MS pathogenesis and the beneficial effect of aspirin administration on the EAE clinical course. Further, neuropathological findings in subjects with MS and experimental studies in EAE have revealed dysregulation of coagulation/fibrinolysis system in autoimmune demyelination. Fibrin deposition in the central nervous system and its interaction with the CD11b receptor on microglia cells seems to drive neuroinflammation and autoimmune demyelination. However, at present, few and controversial clinical data are available on the implementation of drugs targeting fibrin deposition in MS therapy. In conclusion, targeting platelet activation and receptors for fibrin(ogen) deserve further research to hopefully purpose new drugs in the pharmacologic paraphernalia of MS neurologists.",

    "abstract": "Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs) do not have an increased risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) compared with the general population. However, it remains uncertain whether subgroups of patients with IRD using different immunosuppressive antirheumatic drugs carry a higher risk for severe COVID‐19 compared with other patients with IRD. The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for severe COVID‐19, requiring hospitalization in patients with IRD. This is a multicenter nested case control study conducted in the Netherlands. Cases are hospital known patients with IRD requiring hospitalization for COVID‐19 between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020. Controls are hospital known patients with IRD not requiring hospitalization for COVID‐19 in this period, included at a 4:1 ratio. Patient, disease, and treatment characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records and a questionnaire. Potential risk factors were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression, corrected for confounders and multiple testing. Eighty‐one cases and 396 controls were included. General risk factors of older age and obesity apply to patients with IRD as well (odds ratio (OR) for age ≥ 75 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9–6.3, OR for body mass index ≥ 40 4.5, 95% CI 1.5–14). No significantly increased ORs for COVID‐19 hospitalization were found for any antirheumatic agent or IRD. A protective effect was found for use of methotrexate (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31–0.92). In conclusion, similar to the general population, elderly and obese patients with IRD have a higher risk for hospitalization for COVID‐19. We did not identify a specific antirheumatic agent or IRD to increase the risk of COVID‐19 hospitalization in patients with IRD, except for a possible protective effect of methotrexate.",

Patient‐specific predictions on treatment response are, however, urgently needed, given the severe side effects of alemtuzumab. This study developed a multidimensional prediction model with the aim of generating clinically useful prognostic scores for the response to alemtuzumab. Clinical and histological characteristics were collected retrospectively from patients who were treated with alemtuzumab for AR. In addition, targeted gene expression profiling of AR biopsy tissues was performed. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression modeling was used to construct the ALEMtuzumab for Acute Rejection (ALEMAR) prognostic score. Response to alemtuzumab was defined as patient and allograft survival and at least once an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 during the first 6 months after treatment. One hundred fifteen patients were included, of which 84 (73%) had a response to alemtuzumab. The ALEMAR‐score accurately predicted the chance of response. Gene expression analysis identified 13 differentially expressed genes between responders and nonresponders. The combination of the ALEMAR‐score and selected genes resulted in improved predictions of treatment response. The present preliminary prediction model is potentially helpful for the development of stratified alemtuzumab treatment for acute kidney transplant rejection but requires validation.",

Reliance on more limited evidence means that there is often greater uncertainty about risks and benefits. Using a modified Delphi process, we sought to identify promising policy approaches that address physician‐patient decision‐making needs about the use of such drugs and medical devices. We convened 13 national leaders from academia, government, nonprofits, payors, and industry who had expertise in medical product regulation, payor policymaking, bioethics, physician practice, patient advocacy, public health expertise/advocacy, clinical trials, the pharmaceutical and device industry, institutional review board oversight, and real‐world evidence. Through multiple rounds of voting and meetings focused on evaluating the feasibility and impact of various interventions, the 13 participants reached the broadest consensus on 4 interventions: strengthening FDA post‐approval study requirements to ensure postmarket evidence is generated in a timely manner, better informing patients about the risks and benefits and level of evidence supporting therapies via simplified and patient‐centered product information “boxes” modeled on nutrition labels, limiting prices for drugs and medical devices approved based on surrogate end point data until confirmatory clinical evidence is generated, and improving health professional education about FDA regulation to better support clinician use of drugs and devices as well as communication with patients.",

    "abstract": "Selective voltage‐gated sodium channel blockers are of growing interest as treatment for pain. For drug development of such compounds, it would be critical to have a biomarker that can be used for proof‐of‐mechanism. We aimed to evaluate whether drug‐induced changes in sodium conductance can be detected in the peripheral nerve excitability profile in 18 healthy subjects. In a randomized, double‐blind, 3‐way crossover study, effects of single oral doses of 333 mg mexiletine and 300 mg lacosamide were compared with placebo. On each study visit, motor and sensory nerve excitability measurements of the median nerve were performed (predose; and 3 and 6 hours postdose) using Qtrac. Treatment effects were calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline as covariate. Mexiletine and lacosamide had significant effects on multiple motor and sensory nerve excitability variables. Depolarizing threshold electrotonus (TEd 40 (40–60 ms)) decreased by mexiletine (estimated difference (ED) −1.37% (95% confidence interval (CI): −2.20, −0.547; P = 0.002) and lacosamide (ED −1.27%, 95% CI: −2.10, −0.443; P = 0.004) in motor nerves. Moreover, mexiletine and lacosamide decreased superexcitability (less negative) in motor nerves (ED 1.74%, 95% CI: 0.615, 2.87; P = 0.004, and ED 1.47%, 95% CI: 0.341, 2.60; P = 0.013, respectively). Strength‐duration time constant decreased after lacosamide in motor‐ (ED −0.0342 ms, 95% CI: −0.0571, −0.0112; P = 0.005) and sensory nerves (ED −0.0778 ms, 95% CI: −0.116, −0.0399; P < 0.001). Mexiletine and lacosamide significantly decrease excitability of motor and sensory nerves, in line with their suggested mechanism of action. Results of this study indicate that nerve excitability threshold tracking can be an effective pharmacodynamic biomarker. The method could be a valuable tool in clinical drug development.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenetic implementation programs are increasingly feasible due to the availability of clinical guidelines for implementation research. The utilization of these resources has been reported with selected drug–gene pairs; however, little is known about how prescribers respond to pharmacogenetic recommendations for statin therapy. We prospectively assessed prescriber interaction with point‐of‐care clinical decision support (CDS) to guide simvastatin therapy for a diverse cohort of primary care patients enrolled in a clinical pharmacogenetics program. Of the 1,639 preemptively genotyped patients, 298 (18.2%) had an intermediate function (IF) OATP1B1 phenotype and 25 (1.53%) had a poor function (PF) phenotype, predicted by a common single nucleotide variant in the SLCO1B1 gene (c.521T>C; rs4149056). Clinicians were presented with CDS when simvastatin was prescribed for patients with IF or PF through the electronic health record. Importantly, 64.2% of the CDS deployed at the point‐of‐care was accepted by the prescribers and resulted in prescription changes. Statin intensity was found to significantly influence prescriber adoption of the pharmacogenetic‐guided CDS, whereas patient gender or race, prescriber type, or pharmacogenetic training status did not significantly influence adoption. This study demonstrates that primary care providers readily adopt pharmacogenetic information to guide statin therapy for the majority of patients with preemptive genotype data.",

    "abstract": "Limited real‐world evidence exists for effectiveness and safety of extended oral anticoagulation beyond 6 months of initial treatment in prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and adverse major bleeding events among patients with VTE. Using MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases (2013–2019), we conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare the risk of recurrent VTE and major bleeding events during extended treatment among patients with VTE who completed the 6‐month initial treatment and received extended oral anticoagulant treatment with apixaban, warfarin, or no extended treatment. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards modeling with inverse probability treatment weighting. We identified 14,818 patients with extended treatment of apixaban ( n = 4,338), warfarin ( n = 5,298), or no extended treatment ( n = 5,182). Compared with no extended treatment, apixaban use was associated with decreased risk of recurrent VTE (HR: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.04–0.26) without increased risk of major bleeding events (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.52–2.17); warfarin use was associated with decreased risk of recurrent VTE (HR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.12–0.44) but with increased risk of major bleeding events (HR: 2.64, 95% CI: 1.51–4.59). Compared with warfarin, apixaban use was associated with decreased risk of major bleeding events (HR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.22–0.80) but no difference in risk of recurrent VTE (HR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.15–1.36). In a real‐world clinical setting, extended anticoagulation with apixaban or warfarin was associated with decreased risk of recurrent VTE compared with no extended treatment, and apixaban had a better safety profile with fewer major bleeding events compared with warfarin among commercially insured patients with VTE.",

    "abstract": "In closely monitored randomized controlled trials (RCTs), newer P2Y12 agents (ticagrelor and prasugrel) reduced cardiovascular outcomes compared with clopidogrel following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in acute coronary syndrome. However, these RCTs indicated a higher bleeding risk with these newer agents. This study evaluated the comparative safety of each P2Y12 inhibitor on hospitalizations due to major bleeding in a real‐world population. This retrospective, propensity score‐matched (PSM) cohort study utilized the IBM MarketScan database over 6 years (2013–2018) to identify incident users of P2Y12 inhibitors with age ≥18 years. The primary safety outcome was hospitalization due to any major bleeding event including gastrointestinal, intracranial, and other serious forms of bleeding. In pairwise comparisons using Cox‐proportional hazards models, ticagrelor, prasugrel, and clopidogrel users were compared for the primary safety outcome at 30, 90, and 180 days following the first prescription of P2Y12 inhibitor after PCI. There were 21,719 (ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel), 11,513 (prasugrel vs. clopidogrel), and 11,065 (prasugrel vs. ticagrelor) PSM pairs. Overall, the risk of major bleeding was similar for all P2Y12 inhibitors. Hospitalization for major bleeding was generally lower among ticagrelor users vs. clopidogrel and higher among prasugrel users compared with clopidogrel. Importantly, a 66% higher risk of major bleeding at 90 days is suggested with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel (hazard ratio 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.48). This study indicated a higher short‐term bleeding risk with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel, which concurs with the results of RCTs.",

Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) is used as a measure of lung function and to help diagnose and monitor lung diseases, including asthma. An exponential longitudinal model has been previously developed to adequately describe the FEV1 response in asthma patients with placebo. This model was the basis of a longitudinal model‐based meta‐analysis which was undertaken to describe the trough FEV1 responses ranging up to 1 year from nine clinical studies in a population with asthma ( N = 3,896), following placebo, dual combination (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol), and triple combination (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol) given via inhalation. Numerical, graphical and simulation‐based diagnostics showed that a Weibull model adequately characterized the longitudinal trough FEV1 response with time. Automatic covariate selection supported by statistically based regression models identified a range of patient characteristics influencing the model parameters. Race was a significant covariate on baseline but not on the parameters that impact the FEV1 trajectory. Based on the trough FEV1, all active treatments were found to be significantly different when compared with placebo and showed clinically meaningful improvement in FEV1. The model was able to predict the longitudinal FEV1 response in Chinese patients with inadequately controlled asthma and was used to provide additional support with respect to the design for a shorter‐duration phase III study to the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA).",

    "abstract": "Severe neutropenia is the major dose‐liming toxicity of irinotecan‐based chemotherapy. The objective was to assess to what extent a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model including patient‐specific demographic/clinical characteristics, individual pharmacokinetics, and absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) can predict irinotecan‐induced grade 4 neutropenia. A semimechanistic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was developed to describe neutrophil response over time in 197 patients with cancer receiving irinotecan. For covariate analysis, sex, race, age, pretreatment total bilirubin, and body surface area were evaluated to identify significant covariates on system‐related parameters (mean transit time (MTT) and ɣ) and sensitivity to neutropenia effects of irinotecan and SN‐38 (SLOPE). The model‐based simulation was performed to assess the contribution of the identified covariates, individual pharmacokinetics, and baseline ANC alone or with incremental addition of weekly ANC up to 3 weeks on predicting irinotecan‐induced grade 4 neutropenia. The time course of neutrophil response was described using the model assuming that irinotecan and SN‐38 have toxic effects on bone marrow proliferating cells. Sex and pretreatment total bilirubin explained 10.5% of interindividual variability in MTT. No covariates were identified for SLOPE and γ. Incorporating sex and pretreatment total bilirubin (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC‐ROC): 50%, 95% CI 50–50%) or with the addition of individual pharmacokinetics (AUC‐ROC: 62%, 95% CI 53–71%) in the model did not result in accurate prediction of grade 4 neutropenia. However, incorporating ANC only at baseline and week 1 in the model achieved a good prediction (AUC‐ROC: 78%, 95% CI 69–88%). These results demonstrate the potential applicability of a model‐based approach to predict irinotecan‐induced neutropenia, which ultimately allows for personalized intervention to maximize treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a common bevacizumab‐induced toxicity. No markers are available to predict patients at risk of developing hypertension. We hypothesized that genetic risk of essential hypertension, as measured by a blood pressure polygenic risk score (PRS), would be associated with risk of severe bevacizumab‐induced hypertension. PRSs were calculated for 1,027 bevacizumab‐treated patients of European descent with cancer from four clinical trials (Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance) / Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 80303, 40503, 90401, 40502) using summary systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) genome‐wide association results obtained from 757,601 individuals of European descent. The association between PRS and grade 3 bevacizumab‐induced hypertension (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3) in each trial was performed by multivariable logistic regression. Fixed‐effect meta‐analyses odds ratios (ORs) per standard deviation (SD) of the association of PRS (quantitative) and hypertension across trials were estimated by inverse‐variance weighting. PRSs were additionally stratified into quintiles, with the bottom quintile as the referent group. The OR of the association between hypertension and each quintile vs. the referent group was determined by logistic regression. The most significant PRS (quantitative)‐hypertension association included up to 67 single‐nucleotide variants (SNPs) associated with SBP ( P = 0.0077, OR per SD = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07–1.60), and up to 53 SNPs associated with DBP ( P = 0.0209, OR per SD = 1.27, 95% CI, 1.04–1.56). Patients in the top quintile had a higher risk of developing bevacizumab‐induced hypertension compared with patients in the bottom quintile using SNPs associated with SBP ( P = 4.75 × 10 −4 , OR = 3.72, 95% CI, 1.84–8.16) and DBP ( P = 0.076, OR = 1.83, 95% CI, 0.95–3.64).

    "abstract": "In vitro signals indicate that ziritaxestat is a weak cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor and inducer. Therefore, potential drug–drug interactions (DDIs) with oral contraceptives were examined at a time when ziritaxestat was under development for treatment of fibrotic diseases. This open‐label, crossover (fixed sequence) DDI study enrolled healthy, nonpregnant women aged 18–65 years ( n = 15) who were using highly effective contraception, such as a nonhormonal intrauterine device, bilateral tubal occlusion, or sexual abstinence. A single dose of oral contraceptive (0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP)) was administered on days 1, 8, and 18, and ziritaxestat 600 mg once daily was administered from days 8 to 23. Co‐administration resulted in a 2.8‐fold and 2.4‐fold increase in EE maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the plasma drug concentration–time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0–inf ), respectively (day 18 vs. day 1). DRSP C max and AUC 0–inf increased by 1.1‐fold and 1.2‐fold, respectively. DRSP is a CYP3A4 substrate, meaning increased EE exposure with ziritaxestat was not due to CYP3A4 inhibition. Ziritaxestat inhibition of EE glucuronidation and sulfation was quantified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry in day 1 and day 18 plasma samples after EE conjugate hydrolysis. The ratio of EE AUC from time of administration up to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC last ) with/without hydrolysis by arylsulfatase was substantially lower on day 18 vs. day 1, suggesting ziritaxestat is a potent inhibitor of sulfation; EE glucuronidation was largely unaffected by ziritaxestat. In vitro assessment confirmed ziritaxestat is a potent inhibitor of sulfotransferase family 1E member 1 (half‐maximal inhibitory concentration < 0.8 μM). These findings highlight the importance of assessing enzymes other than CYP3A4 when investigating potential DDIs with oral contraceptives.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing interactions between new molecular entities (NMEs) and drug transporters is a critical element of drug development that helps in assessing potential transporter‐based drug–drug interactions (DDIs). However, not all NME new drug applications (NDAs) include a full characterization of NMEs transporter‐based DDIs, which necessitates the issuance of post‐marketing requirement (PMR)/post‐marketing commitment (PMC) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to characterize these potential interactions. The objective of this analysis is to identify trends in transporter‐based PMRs/PMCs issued by the FDA between 2012 and 2021. A decrease in the number of transporter‐based PMRs/PMCs was observed from 2012 to 2016 and an increasing trend in the number of PMRs/PMCs was observed after 2017. The majority of these transporter‐based PMRs/PMCs requested clinical evaluation (48%), some requested in vitro assessment (38%), and 2.5% requested modeling and simulation assessment. Most of the PMRs/PMCs requested evaluation of NMEs as perpetrator with the efflux transporters, P‐gp and/or BCRP (53%). Forty‐eight percent of the PMRs/PMCs were fulfilled with 67% resulted in labeling updates. On average, 2.5 years were needed for the information related to PMRs/PMCs to show in NMEs labeling. In conclusion, this analysis highlights the increased emphasis from the FDA on proper characterization of transporter‐based DDI and call for the need of early characterization of NMEs‐transporters interaction before initial NDA approval.",

    "abstract": "Plasma exposure of the endothelin receptor antagonist atrasentan varies between individuals and is associated with nephroprotective effects and the risk of heart failure. We examined the influence of genetic polymorphisms on atrasentan plasma exposure and pharmacodynamic effects. We performed a substudy of the Study of Diabetic Nephropathy With Atrasentan (SONAR) trial which enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate: 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and a urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio of 300–5,000 mg/g). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined for prespecified membrane transporters, metabolizing enzymes, and the endothelin‐1 peptide. The associations among genotype, atrasentan plasma exposure, and the effect of atrasentan on the prespecified kidney and heart failure hospitalization (HHF) outcomes was assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression models. Of 3,668 patients randomized, 2,329 (63.5%) consented to genotype analysis. Two SNPs in the SLCO1B1 gene (rs4149056 and rs2306283), encoding the hepatic organic anion transporter 1B1 (OATP1B1), showed the strongest association with atrasentan plasma exposure. Based on their SLCO1B1 genotype, patients were classified into normal (atrasentan area under the plasma‐concentration time curve from zero to infinity (AUC 0−inf ) 41.3 ng·h/mL) or slow (atrasentan AUC 0−inf 49.7 ng·h/mL, P < 0.001) OATP1B1 transporter phenotypes. Among patients with a normal OATP1B1 phenotype, the hazard ratio (HR) with atrasentan for the primary kidney and HHF outcomes were 0.61 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45–0.81) and 1.35 (95% CI: 0.84–2.13), respectively. In the slow transporter phenotype, HRs for kidney and HHF outcomes were 1.95 (95% CI: 0.95–4.03, P ‐interaction normal phenotype = 0.004), and 4.18 (95% CI: 1.37–12.7, P ‐interaction normal phenotype = 0.060), respectively.

    "abstract": "Coadministration with acid‐reducing agents (ARAs), including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine H 2 ‐receptor antagonists (H 2 blockers), and antacids has been demonstrated to reduce antiviral exposure and efficacy. Therefore, it is essential that US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels include recommendations to manage these drug–drug interactions (DDIs). This investigation analyzed information in FDA drug labels to manage DDIs between ARAs and antivirals approved from 1998 to 2019. To ascertain clinical adoption, we assessed whether FDA label recommendations were incorporated into current antiviral clinical practice guidelines. We identified 82 label recommendations for 43 antiviral approvals. Overall, 56.1% of recommendations were deemed clinically actionable, with the most common actionable management strategies being dose adjustment during coadministration (40.2%) and coadministration not recommended (9.8%). The sources informing DDI recommendations were clinical DDI studies (59.8%) and predictions of altered exposure (40.2%). Antivirals with low aqueous solubility were more likely to have label recommendations and were more commonly investigated using clinical DDI studies ( P < 0.01). For recommendations informed by clinical DDI studies, changes in drug exposure were associated with actionable label recommendations ( P < 0.01). The frequency of exposure changes in clinical DDI studies was similar across antiviral indications, but exposure changes were numerically higher for antacids (71.4%) relative to PPIs (42.9%) and H 2 blockers (28.6%). Of DDI pairs identified within drug labels, 76.8% were included in guidelines, and recommended management strategies were concordant in 90.5% of cases. Our findings demonstrate that current regulatory oversight mostly (but not completely) results in actionable label recommendations to manage DDIs for high‐risk antivirals.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal tobacco use among Alaska Native (AN) women has decreased substantially over the past two decades. Previous research suggests that providing AN women with feedback regarding fetal exposure to tobacco may further promote cessation. Transporters in the placenta regulate fetal exposure to nutrients and xenobiotics, including compounds associated with tobacco use. We examined whether prenatal tobacco use impacts transporter expression in the placenta, and whether this is influenced by fetal sex, degree of tobacco exposure, or transporter genotype. At delivery, we obtained placental samples from AN research participants who smoked cigarettes, used commercial chew or iqmik (oral tobacco), or did not use tobacco during pregnancy. Transporter expression was evaluated using qRT‐PCR and Western blotting and tested for correlations between transcript levels and urinary biomarkers of tobacco use. The impact of BCRP/ABCG2 and OATP2B1/SLCO2B1 genotypes on protein expression was also examined. Oral tobacco use was associated with decreased P‐gp and increased MRP1 , MRP3 , LAT1 , and PMAT mRNA expression. Transcript levels of multiple transporters significantly correlated with tobacco biomarkers in maternal and fetal urine. In women carrying male fetuses, both smoking and oral tobacco were associated with decreased P‐gp. Oral tobacco was also associated with decreased LAT1 in women carrying female fetuses. BCRP and OATP2B1 genotypes did not appear to impact protein expression. In conclusion, prenatal tobacco use is associated with altered expression of multiple placental transporters which differs by fetal sex. As transcript levels of multiple transporters were significantly correlated with tobacco use biomarkers, eliminating prenatal tobacco use should alleviate these changes.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics (PGx) investigates the genetic influence on drug response and is an integral part of precision medicine. While PGx testing is becoming more common in clinical practice and may be reimbursed by Medicare/Medicaid and commercial insurance, interpreting PGx testing results for clinical decision support is still a challenge. The Pharmacogenomics Clinical Annotation Tool (PharmCAT) has been designed to tackle the need for transparent, automatic interpretations of patient genetic data. PharmCAT incorporates a patient's genotypes, annotates PGx information (allele, genotype, and phenotype), and generates a report with PGx guideline recommendations from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and/or the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG). PharmCAT has introduced new features in the last 2 years, including a variant call format (VCF) Preprocessor, the inclusion of DPWG guidelines, and functionalities for PGx research. For example, researchers can use the VCF Preprocessor to prepare biobank‐scale data for PharmCAT. In addition, PharmCAT enables the assessment of novel partial and combination alleles that are composed of known PGx variants and can call CYP2D6 genotypes based on single and deletions in the input VCF file. This tutorial provides materials and detailed step‐by‐step instructions for how to use PharmCAT in a versatile way that can be tailored to users' individual needs.",

    "abstract": "Omalizumab is widely used in clinical practice; however, knowledge gaps in the dosage of omalizumab for children aged 2–6 years with moderate‐to‐severe persistent allergic asthma have been identified. The aim of this study was to explore dosing regimens for moderately‐to‐severely allergic pediatric patients aged 2–6 years. The physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of omalizumab was developed and verified in adult patients, extrapolated to pediatric patients, and simulated for omalizumab by adding two observation chambers (free IgE and total IgE). The simulation results showed that the fold errors of the predicted and observed values of the area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration ( C max ) were between 0.5 and 2.0, and the average folding error and the absolute average folding error values for all concentration‐time data points were 1.09 and 1.48, respectively. The PBPK model combined with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of omalizumab demonstrated that both the model‐derived dose and the original dose could control the average free IgE of 2–6‐year‐old children with moderate‐to‐severe allergic asthma below 25 ng/mL, and some of the model‐derived doses were lower. This conclusion provides a basis for the selection of dosage in clinical practice reference.",

However, current applications are difficult to scale. We used unsupervised NLP to generate high‐dimensional feature spaces from FTNs to improve prediction of drug exposure and outcomes compared with claims‐based analyses. We linked Medicare claims with EHR data to generate three cohort studies comparing different classes of medications on the risk of various clinical outcomes. We used “bag‐of‐words” to generate features for the top 20,000 most prevalent terms from FTNs. We compared machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms using different sets of candidate predictors: Set1 (39 researcher‐specified variables), Set2 (Set1 + ML‐selected claims codes), and Set3 (Set1 + ML‐selected NLP‐generated features), vs. Set4 (Set1 + 2 + 3). When modeling treatment choice, we observed a consistent pattern across the examples: ML models utilizing Set4 performed best followed by Set2, Set3, then Set1. When modeling the outcome risk, there was little to no improvement beyond models based on Set1. Supplementing claims data with NLP‐generated features from free text notes improved prediction of prescribing choices but had little or no improvement on clinical risk prediction. These findings have implications for strategies to improve confounding using EHR data in pharmacoepidemiologic studies.",

    "abstract": "Among patients treated with irinotecan, homozygous carriers of the UGT1A1 *28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia, but UGT1A1 genotype alone does not account for irinotecan‐induced toxicity. Our aim was to study the association between single‐nucleotide variants in genes encoding for efflux transporters of irinotecan ( ABCG2 , ABCB1 , and ABCC2 ) and toxicity in real life. The source population was a cohort of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) in Northern Israel, who had undergone genome‐wide association study. From the source population we chose the patients with CRC prescribed irinotecan, and a comparative cohort of patients with CRC treated with other anticancer systemic therapies. Using Clalit Health Services electronic medical records (including laboratory results) we ascertained hematological and gastrointestinal adverse effects and mortality, within 90 days of the first dose, as a composite outcome. There were 601 patients with CRC who received irinotecan, and 756 patients with CRC treated with other anticancer regimens. The minor allele in rs2231142 ( ABCG2 ) was associated with lower incidence of the composite outcome (odds ratio (OR) = 0.54 (0.33, 0.91); P = 0.02) in irinotecan‐treated patients with CRC, but not in patients with CRC treated with other regimens. ABCB1 rs1045642 and ABCC2 rs3740066 were not associated with the composite outcome. In a sensitivity analysis, adjusted for UGT1A1 status and for possible demographic and clinical confounders, adjusted OR was 0.56 (0.33, 0.94) for the association between rs2231142 ( ABCG2 ) and the composite outcome. In conclusion, we describe a novel association between the minor allele of rs2231142 in the efflux transporter gene ABCG2 and protection against severe side effects in CRC patients treating with irinotecan.",

    "abstract": "The integrated glucose‐insulin model is a semimechanistic model describing glucose and insulin after a glucose challenge. Similarly, a semiphysiologic model of the postprandial triglyceride (TG) response in chylomicrons and VLDL‐V6 was recently published. We have developed the triglyceride‐insulin‐glucose‐GLP‐1 (TIGG) model by integrating these models and active GLP‐1. The aim was to characterize, using the TIGG model, the postprandial response over 13 hours following a high‐fat meal in 3 study populations based on body mass index categories: lean, obese, and very obese. Differential glucose and lipid regulation were observed between the lean population and obese or very obese populations. A population comparison revealed further that fasting glucose and insulin were elevated in obese and very obese when compared with lean; and euglycemia was achieved at different times postmeal between the obese and very obese populations. Postprandial insulin was incrementally elevated in the obese and very obese populations compared with lean. Postprandial chylomicrons TGs were similar across populations, whereas the postprandial TGs in VLDL‐V6 were increased in the obese and very obese populations compared with lean. Postprandial active GLP‐1 was diminished in the very obese population compared with lean or obese. The TIGG model described the response following a high‐fat meal in individuals who are lean, obese, and very obese and provided insight into the possible regulation of glucose homeostasis in the extended period after the meal by utilizing lipids. The TIGG‐model is the first model to integrate glucose and insulin regulation, incretin effect, and postprandial TGs response in chylomicrons and VLDL‐V6.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we present the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Research and Standards’ current thinking, challenges, and opportunities for comparative clinical endpoint bioequivalence (BE) studies of orally inhaled drug products (OIDPs). Given the product‐associated complexities of OIDPs, the FDA currently uses an aggregate weight‐of‐evidence approach to demonstrate that a generic OIDP is bioequivalent to its reference listed drug. The approach utilizes comparative clinical endpoint BE or pharmacodynamic BE studies, pharmacokinetic BE studies, and in vitro BE studies to demonstrate equivalence, in addition to formulation sameness and device similarity. For the comparative clinical endpoint BE studies, metrics based on forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1 ) are often the recommended clinical endpoints. However, the use of FEV 1 can pose a challenge due to its large variability and a relatively flat dose‐response relationship for most OIDPs. The utility of applying dose‐scale analysis was also investigated by the FDA but often not recommended, due to either flat dose‐response relationships or insufficient clinical study data. As a potential way to reduce sample size, we found adapting covariate analysis only explained a limited portion of the variation based on further investigation. The FDA continues to develop alternative methods to make BE assessment of OIDPs more cost‐ and time‐efficient. Prospective generic drug applicants and academia are encouraged to participate in this effort by proposing new approaches in pre‐abbreviated new drug application meeting requests and collaborating in the form of grants and contracts under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) Regulatory Science and Research Program.",

    "abstract": "Data on venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are scarce and conflicting. This study investigated the risk of reporting VTEs associated with ICIs in comparison with all other anticancer drugs. The World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database (VigiBase), comprising >30 million individual case safety reports, was queried. All reports on patients with cancer, involving at least one anticancer drug as a suspect or interacting drug and registered from January 1, 2008, to May 31, 2021, were included. The association between ICIs and the risk of reporting VTEs was estimated using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) as a measure of disproportionality with all other anticancer drugs as comparators. RORs were estimated as crude and adjusted RORs for age, sex, and other medications (excluding anticancer drugs) associated with risk of VTEs. Among 1,196 patients experiencing VTEs after ICI treatment, the median age was 65 years and 57.6% were men. Anti‐PD‐1 agents (62.5%) were the most frequently reported. ICIs were not associated with higher reporting of VTEs when compared with other anticancer drugs (crude ROR 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.67 and adjusted ROR 0.70, 95% CI 0.65–0.74). No signal of disproportionate reporting was found when considering each class of ICIs. In conclusion, ICIs were not associated with higher reporting of VTEs, in comparison with all other anticancer drugs in a large‐scale pharmacovigilance database. Owing to the limitations inherent to pharmacovigilance studies, prospective studies, including an adequate comparison group, are needed to assess the risk of VTEs in ICI‐treated patients.",

Here, a pharmacokinetics–time to alleviation of symptoms (PK–TTAS) model was developed and used to (I) characterize the PK–TTAS relationship, (II) quantify the impact of covariates, and (III) predict TTAS in different ethnic groups. Data from 1781 otherwise‐healthy (OwH) or high‐risk (HR) patients included in phase II (JapicCTI‐153090) and III studies (NCT02954354 and NCT02949011) were used; patients received either placebo or oral baloxavir marboxil. The natural distribution of TTAS in placebo‐treated patients was modeled, then TTAS data from the baloxavir marboxil arms were added to model the impact of baloxavir acid concentration on TTAS. PK parameters estimated by a population PK model and informed by phase I data (NCT03959332 and KCT0003535) were included to simulate TTAS in Chinese and South Korean patients. Composite symptom score at baseline (TSS0), ethnicity, sex, and patient type (OwH or HR) significantly impacted the natural TTAS distribution. TTAS reduced with increasing baloxavir acid concentrations. Compared with placebo, high and low baloxavir acid exposures (AUC 0‐inf 5.13–16.65 and 0.72–5.13 μg.hr/mL, respectively) significantly reduced TTAS; no covariates affected the drug effect on TTAS. Simulated TTAS was similar between OwH or HR Chinese, South Korean, and other Asian patients, with median reductions from placebo between 18.3–18.8 hours and 21.2–22.0 hours in OwH and HR patients, respectively, assuming TSS0 > 10. Ethnicity (Asian vs. non‐Asian) did not significantly impact the drug effect on TTAS; predicted TTAS was similar across different Asian populations. This suggests Chinese and South Korean patients may benefit from similar efficacy as other Asian patients.",

    "abstract": "With the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), there is an urgent need to accelerate the traditional drug development process. Many studies identified potential COVID‐19 therapies based on promising nonclinical data. However, the poor translatability from nonclinical to clinical settings has led to failures of many of these drug candidates in the clinical phase. In this study, we propose a mechanism‐based, quantitative framework to translate nonclinical findings to clinical outcome. Adopting a modularized approach, this framework includes an in silico disease model for COVID‐19 (virus infection and human immune responses) and a pharmacological component for COVID‐19 therapies. The disease model was able to reproduce important longitudinal clinical data for patients with mild and severe COVID‐19, including viral titer, key immunological cytokines, antibody responses, and time courses of lymphopenia. Using remdesivir as a proof‐of‐concept example of model development for the pharmacological component, we developed a pharmacological model that describes the conversion of intravenously administered remdesivir as a prodrug to its active metabolite nucleoside triphosphate through intracellular metabolism and connected it to the COVID‐19 disease model. After being calibrated with the placebo arm data, our model was independently and quantitatively able to predict the primary endpoint (time to recovery) of the remdesivir clinical study, Adaptive Covid‐19 Clinical Trial (ACTT). Our work demonstrates the possibility of quantitatively predicting clinical outcome based on nonclinical data and mechanistic understanding of the disease and provides a modularized framework to aid in candidate drug selection and clinical trial design for COVID‐19 therapeutics.",

A previously published model was adapted to better describe pegfilgrastim PK and PD data in healthy subjects and used in simulation. Nonlinear CL accounts for 98% and 77%, respectively, of the total CL of pegfilgrastim at 2 and 6 mg. The sensitivity analyses showed: (i) PK of 2 and 6 mg doses are similarly sensitive to detect differences for a 5% change in dose; (ii) PK of 2 mg dose is more sensitive to changes in receptor binding affinity, a model parameter for nonlinear CL, and a product quality attribute characterized with orthogonal methods as part of demonstrating analytical similarity between products; (iii) PK of approved 6 mg dose is more sensitive to changes in linear CL, which has not been associated with any specific product quality attributes, and (iv) the PDs are not sensitive to changes in linear or nonlinear CL. Taken together, our analyses support that the approved pegfilgrastim dose of 6 mg is appropriate for detecting differences between a biosimilar and the reference products in pegfilgrastim PK and PD similarity studies. The described M&S approaches can be adopted to support dose selection for biosimilars with nonlinear PK and complex PK–PD interplay.",

    "abstract": "Legislative and technological advancements over the past decade have given rise to the proliferation of healthcare data generated from routine clinical practice, often referred to as real‐world data (RWD). These data have piqued the interest of healthcare stakeholders due to their potential utility in generating evidence to support clinical and regulatory decision making. In the oncology setting, studies leveraging RWD offer distinct advantages that are complementary to randomized controlled trials (RCTs). They also permit the conduct of investigations that may not be possible through prospective designs due to ethics or feasibility. Despite its promise, the use of RWD for the generation of clinical evidence remains controversial due to concerns of unmeasured confounding and other sources of bias that must be carefully addressed in the study design and analysis. To facilitate a better understanding of when RWD can provide reliable conclusions on drug effectiveness, we seek to conduct 10 RWD‐based studies that emulate RCTs in oncology using a systematic, protocol‐driven approach described herein. Results of this investigation will help inform clinical, scientific, and regulatory stakeholders on the applications of RWD in the context of product labeling expansion, drug safety, and comparative effectiveness in oncology.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies are often considered unreliable for evaluating relative treatment effectiveness, but it has been suggested that following target trial protocols could reduce bias. Using observational data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register (SRQ), between 2006 and 2020, we emulated the protocol of the Swedish Farmacotherapy trial (SWEFOT) and compared the results. SWEFOT was a pragmatic trial nested in SRQ, between 2002 and 2005, where methotrexate (MTX) insufficient responders were randomized to receive additional infliximab or sulfasalazine (SSZ) + hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with RA initiating infliximab ( N = 313) or SSZ + HCQ ( N = 196) after MTX were identified in SRQ and the Prescribed Drugs Register, mimicking the SWEFOT eligibility criteria. The primary outcome was the proportion of European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) good responders at 9 months, classifying patients who discontinued treatment as “nonresponders.” Through sensitivity analyses, we assessed the impact of relaxing eligibility criteria. The observed proportions reaching EULAR good response were close to those reported in SWEFOT: 39% (vs. 39% in SWEFOT) for infliximab and 28% (vs. 25%) for SSZ + HCQ. The crude observed response ratio was 1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–1.86), increasing to 1.48 (95% CI 0.98–2.24) after confounding adjustment, compared to 1.59 (95% CI 1.10–2.30) in SWEFOT. Results remained close to SWEFOT when relaxing eligibility criteria until allowing prior disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drug (DMARD) use which reduced the observed difference between treatments. By applying a prespecified trial emulation protocol to observational clinical registry data, we could replicate the results of SWEFOT, favoring infliximab over SSZ + HCQ combination therapy at 9 months.",

Because of the predominantly renal clearance of ceftazidime and avibactam, dose adjustments (reductions) are required for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCL) ≤ 50 mL/min. We describe the application of combined adult and pediatric population pharmacokinetic models in developing ceftazidime‐avibactam dose recommendations for pediatric patients ≥ 2 to < 18 years old with body surface area‐normalized CrCL ≤ 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , including moderate, severe, or very severe renal impairment, or end‐stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, and for patients ≥ 3 months to < 2 years old with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. Models included allometric scaling for all subjects and simulations (1,000 subjects per age group, renal function group, and indication) were performed nonparametrically using post hoc random effects. Doses were selected based on simulated pediatric patients achieving steady‐state exposures similar to adults and high probability of target attainment (using a simultaneous joint target for both ceftazidime and avibactam). Because there were few children with renal impairment in the ceftazidime‐avibactam clinical trials, selected pediatric doses were guided by extrapolation and matching of adult exposures associated with efficacy and within established safety margins. The recommended doses for pediatric patients with estimated CrCL ≤ 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 use equivalent adjustments in dose quantity and/or administration interval (vs. the corresponding age group with normal renal function) as those for adults.",

Study of more diverse and special populations is necessary to validate findings and improve health equity. However, there are significant barriers to recruitment of diverse populations for genetic studies, such as mistrust of researchers due to a history of unethical research and ongoing social inequities. Engaging communities and understanding community members' perspectives may help to overcome these barriers and improve research quality. Here, we highlight one method for engaging communities, the Community Engagement Studio (CES), a consultative session that allows researchers to obtain guidance and feedback based on community members' lived experiences. We also provide an example of its use in pharmacogenetic studies. In designing a survey study of knowledge and attitudes around pharmacogenetic testing among children with chronic conditions and pregnant individuals, we sought input from diverse community stakeholders through CESs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We participated in two CESs with community stakeholders representing study target populations. Our goals were to learn specific concerns about pharmacogenetic testing and preferred recruitment strategies for these communities. Concerns were expressed about how genetic information would be used beyond the immediate study. Participants emphasized the importance of clarity and transparency in communication to overcome participation hesitancy and mistrust of the study team. Recruitment strategy recommendations ranged from informal notices posted in healthcare settings to provider referrals. The CES enabled us to modify our recruitment methods and research materials to better communicate with populations currently under‐represented in pharmacogenetics research.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated drug–drug interactions (DDIs) between antibiotic and nonantibiotic drugs listed with warnings of severe outcomes in the British National Formulary based on adverse drug reaction (ADR) detectable with routine International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision coding. Data sources were Clinical Practice Research Databank GOLD and Aurum anonymized electronic health records from English general practices linked to hospital admission records. In propensity‐matched case‐control study, outcomes were ADR or emergency admissions. Analyzed were 121,546 ADR‐related admission cases matched to 638,238 controls. For most antibiotics, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for ADR‐related hospital admission were large (aOR for trimethoprim 4.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.97–4.30). Of the 51 DDIs evaluated for ADR‐related admissions, 38 DDIs (74.5%) had statistically increased aORs of concomitant exposure compared with nonexposure (mean aOR 3.96; range 1.59–11.42); for the 89 DDIs for emergency hospital admission, the results were 75 (84.3%) and mean aOR 2.40; range 1.43–4.17. Changing reference group to single antibiotic exposure reduced aORs for concomitant exposure by 76.5% and 83.0%, respectively. Medicines listed to cause nephrotoxicity substantially increased risks that were related to number of medicines (aOR was 2.55 (95% CI, 2.46–2.64) for current use of 1 and 10.44 (95% CI, 7.36–14.81) for 3 or more medicines). In conclusion, no evidence of substantial risk was found for multiple DDIs with antibiotics despite warnings of severe outcomes in a national formulary and flagging in electronic health record software. It is proposed that the evidence base for inclusion of DDIs in national formularies be strengthened and made publicly accessible and indiscriminate flagging, which compounds alert fatigue, be reduced.",

    "abstract": "The anticoagulant warfarin is commonly used to control and prevent thrombotic disorders, such as venous thromboembolism (VTE), which disproportionately afflicts African Americans. Despite the importance of copy number variants (CNVs), few studies have focused on characterizing and understanding their role in drug response and disease risk among African Americans. In this study, we conduct the first genome‐wide analysis of CNVs to more comprehensively account for the contribution of genetic variation in warfarin dose requirement and VTE risk among African Americans. We used hidden Markov models to detect CNVs from high‐throughput single‐nucleotide polymorphism arrays for 340 African American participants in the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium. We identified 11,570 CNVs resulting in 2,038 copy number variable regions (CNVRs) and found 3 CNVRs associated with warfarin dose requirement and 3 CNVRs associated with VTE risk in African Americans. CNVRs 1q31.2del and 6q14.1del were associated with increased warfarin dose requirement (β = 11.18 and 4.94, respectively; P emp = < 0.002); CNVR 19p13.31del was associated with decreased warfarin dose requirement (β = −1.41, P emp = 0.0004); CNVRs (2p22.1del and 5q35.1‐q35.2del) were found to be associated with increased risk of VTE (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.88 and 14.9, respectively; P emp ≤0.02); and CNVR 10q26.12del was associated with a decreased risk of VTE (OR = 0.6; P emp = 0.05). Modeling of the 10q26.12del in HepG2 cells revealed that this deletion results in decreased fibrinogen gene expression, decreased fibrinogen and WDR11 protein levels, and decreased secretion of fibrinogen into the extracellular matrix. We found robust evidence that CNVRs could contribute to warfarin dose requirement and risk of VTE in African Americans and for 10q26.3del describe a possible pathogenic mechanism.",

A previous pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic model developed in healthy participants was updated using data from phase II and III trials conducted in patients with MS. Clinically relevant covariates were assessed. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the impact of the lack of adherence to ponesimod treatment and provide guidance in cases of treatment re‐initiation. The maximal effect parameter of the PK/HR model was lower in patients with MS (23.5% decrease) compared with healthy volunteers (43.2%). The effect of patient covariates on PK/HR was similar to those identified in healthy participants and not clinically relevant in patients with MS. The population PK/HR model well characterized the effect of ponesimod on the time course of HR in patients with MS. After 2 weeks of treatment with 10 mg or higher doses, the model indicated full tolerance development. After repeated dosing at 20 mg, tolerance was maintained > 60% of the steady‐state tolerance for up to 4 days after the last dose. Re‐initiating with gradual uptitration is recommended if drug discontinuation lasts ≥ 4 days. This managed the negative chronotropic effects of ponesimod. No bradycardia events were observed within the first 2 weeks of treatment in patients with relapsing MS with a baseline HR > 55 bpm. This justifies the recommendation included in the human prescription drug labeling to monitor HR after the first ponesimod dose in these patients.",

BAT product is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic botulism following documented or suspected exposure to botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A to G in adults and pediatric patients. Pharmacokinetic and exposure‐response models were used to explore the relationship between BAT product exposure and the probability of survival, and the occurrence of relevant moderate clinical signs observed during the preclinical development of BAT product to justify the clinical dose. The predicted probability of survival in humans for all serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin was more than 95.9% following intravenous administration of one vial of BAT product. Furthermore, this BAT product dose is expected to result in significant protection against clinical signs in human adults for all botulinum neurotoxin serotypes. Our exposure response model indicates that we have sufficient antitoxin levels to give full protection at various theoretical exposure levels and, based on neutralization capacity/potency of one dose of BAT product, it is expected to exceed the amount of circulating botulinum neurotoxin.",

MK‐1092 is a synthetic insulin dimer with favorable properties demonstrated in preclinical studies. Here, we report the results of the first‐in‐human, randomized, double‐blind, active‐control, single ascending dose trial of MK‐1092, conducted in healthy adults, adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). MK‐1092 was well tolerated in all study populations, and no dose‐related adverse events were identified across the evaluated dose range (4–64 nmol/kg). Circulating concentrations of MK‐1092 were approximately dose‐proportional. Maximum glucose infusion rate (GIR) and 24‐hour time‐weighted average GIR were evaluated under euglycemic clamp conditions. These pharmacodynamic measurements were approximately dose‐proportional in all study populations; at similar doses, the GIR parameters were lower in adults with T2D than in healthy adults or adults with T1D, likely due to the influence of insulin resistance. At doses ≥ 16 nmol/kg, MK‐1092 had similar or greater effects than glargine 3 nmol/kg (0.5 units/kg) on increasing GIR in each study population and on suppressing free fatty acids and ketone generation in adults with T1D. MK‐1092 did not prevent a subsequent high dose of lispro from increasing the GIR in healthy adults. Additional studies in adults with T1D and T2D are needed to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy profile of MK‐1092 and its potential for differentiation from more conventional insulins.

    "abstract": "To assess the combined role of anti‐viral monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines in reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) transmission and mortality in the United States, an agent‐based model was developed that accounted for social contacts, movement/travel, disease progression, and viral shedding. The model was calibrated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) mortality between October 2020 and April 2021 (aggressive pandemic phase), and projected an extended outlook to estimate mortality during a less aggressive phase (April–August 2021). Simulated scenarios evaluated mAbs for averting infections and deaths in addition to vaccines and aggregated non‐pharmaceutical interventions. Scenarios included mAbs as a treatment of COVID‐19 and for passive immunity for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) during a period when variants were susceptible to the mAbs. Rapid diagnostic testing paired with mAbs was evaluated as an early treatment‐as‐prevention strategy. Sensitivity analyses included increasing mAb supply and vaccine rollout. Allocation of mAbs for use only as PEP averted up to 14% more infections than vaccine alone, and targeting individuals ≥ 65 years averted up to 37% more deaths. Rapid testing for earlier diagnosis and mAb use amplified these benefits. Doubling the mAb supply further reduced infections and mortality. mAbs provided benefits even as proportion of the immunized population increased. Model projections estimated that ~ 42% of expected deaths between April and August 2021 could be averted. Assuming sensitivity to mAbs, their use as early treatment and PEP in addition to vaccines would substantially reduce SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission and mortality even as vaccination increases and mortality decreases. These results provide a template for informing public health policy for future pandemic preparedness.",

    "abstract": "Accuracy of warfarin dose prediction algorithms may be improved by including data from diverse populations in genetic studies of dose variability. Here, we surveyed single nucleotide polymorphisms in vitamin K‐related genetic pathways for association with warfarin dose requirements in two admixed Latino populations in standard‐principal component adjusted and contemporary‐local ancestry adjusted regression models. A total of five variants from vitamin K‐related genes/pathways were associated with warfarin dose in both cohorts ( P < 0.0125) in standard models. Local ancestry‐adjusted analysis unveiled 35 associated variants with absolute effects ranging from β = 9.04 ( ±2.23) to 39.18 ( ±10.89) per ancestral allele in the discovery cohort and β = 6.47 (± 2.02) to 17.82 (± 6.83) in the replication cohort. Importantly, we demonstrate the technical validity of the Tractor model in cohorts with admixed ancestry from three founder populations and bring attention to the technical hurdles obstructing the inclusion of diverse, especially admixed, populations in pharmacogenomic research.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory authorities put major emphasis on QT (interval)–prolonging properties of new molecular entities. Product information/Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) of multiple drugs contain warnings or contraindications regarding QT prolongation, e.g., on coadministration of QT‐prolonging drugs (QT drugs). To characterize the development of the QT drug burden, we performed a trend analysis of prescriptions and co‐prescriptions of QT drugs in a large geriatric inpatient cohort. The German SmPCs (status of 2014 and of 2021) and the year‐wise listings in the CredibleMeds ® database from 2011 to 2021 were used as sources. There were 402,631 geriatric cases included. The group of QT drugs according to SmPCs in 2014, which must not be combined with other QT drugs, was less frequently involved in contraindicated co‐prescriptions in 2021 compared with 2015 (3.0% (2.5–3.7%) of cases with at least one of those drugs in 2021 vs. 4.0% (3.5–4.5%) in 2015), with citalopram, escitalopram, and amiodarone involved in nearly 90% of the co‐prescriptions. The number of CredibleMeds‐QT‐drugs per patient increased from 0.4 (SD=1.1) in 2011 to 1.8 (SD=3.9) in 2021. The percentage of contraindicated co‐prescriptions of drugs with known risk for torsade de pointes according to CredibleMeds ® listings at the beginning of the respective years increased from 1.7% in 2011 to 6.1% in 2021. Considering the regularly updated CredibleMeds ® QT drugs list, the contraindicated co‐prescriptions of QT drugs markedly increased in the last decade. If prescribers considered only the few most frequently (co‐) prescribed QT drugs, then most of the medication errors regarding QT drugs could be prevented.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to compare the risks of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, and major bleeding across different antithrombotic regimens in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with stent insertions. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database and National Mortality Registry. A total of 10,208 patients with nonvalvular AF who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stents for the first time in 2007–2017 were identified. Most patients (68.4%) were prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) at discharge. During follow‐up, the use of anticoagulants increased, and double therapy (an antiplatelet plus an anticoagulant) was the most frequently prescribed therapy. The risks of MACEs were comparable in double therapy and had a similar risk of MACEs compared with DAPT (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67–1.11). Triple therapy (DAPT plus an anticoagulant) also had similar effectiveness to double therapy (aHR 1.23, 95% CI 0.84–1.80) or DAPT (aHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77–1.45). However, triple therapy was associated with a nearly twofold higher major bleeding risk than DAPT and double therapy (aHR 1.97, 95% CI 1.31–2.94 and aHR 1.80, 95% CI 1.10–2.95, respectively). DAPT was the most frequently prescribed antithrombotic regimen at discharge for Asian patients with AF who had undergone stent insertions. DAPT and double and triple therapy had comparable effectiveness, but triple therapy had a significantly higher major bleeding risk than either DAPT or double therapy.",

    "abstract": "The angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan slows progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), yet many patients remain at high risk for progressive kidney function loss. The underlying mechanisms for this response variation might be attributed to differences in angiotensin‐1 receptor occupancy (RO), resulting from individual variation in plasma drug exposure, tissue drug exposure, and receptor availability. Therefore, we first assessed the relationship between plasma telmisartan exposure and urinary‐albumin‐to‐creatinine‐ratio (UACR) in 10 patients with T2D and albuminuria (mean age 66 years, median UACR 297 mg/g) after 4 weeks treatment with 80 mg telmisartan once daily. Increasing telmisartan exposure associated with a larger reduction in UACR (Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) = −0.64, P = 0.046, median change UACR: −40.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): −22.9 to −77.4%, mean telmisartan area under the curve (AUC) = 2927.1 ng·hour/mL, 95% CI: 723.0 to 6501.6 ng·hour/mL). Subsequently, we assessed the relation among plasma telmisartan exposure, kidney distribution, and angiotensin‐1 RO in five patients with T2D (mean age 60 years, median UACR 72 mg/g) in a separate positron emission tomography imaging study with [ 11 C]Telmisartan. Individual plasma telmisartan exposure correlated with telmisartan distribution to the kidneys (PCC = 0.976, P = 0.024). A meaningful RO could be calculated in three patients receiving 120 mg oral telmisartan, and although high exposure seems related to higher RO, with AUC 0–last of 31, 840, and 274 ng·hour/mL and corresponding RO values 5.5%, 44%, and 59%, this was not significant ( P = 0.64). Together these results indicate, for the first time, a relationship among interindividual differences in plasma exposure, kidney tissue distribution, RO, and ultimately UACR response after telmisartan administration.",
