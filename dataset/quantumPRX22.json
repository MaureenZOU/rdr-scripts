    "abstract": "Parameterized quantum circuits serve as ans\\\"{a}tze for solving variational problems and provide a flexible paradigm for programming near-term quantum computers. Ideally, such ans\\\"{a}tze should be highly expressive so that a close approximation of the desired solution can be accessed. On the other hand, the ansatz must also have sufficiently large gradients to allow for training. Here, we derive a fundamental relationship between these two essential properties: expressibility and trainability. This is done by extending the well established barren plateau phenomenon, which holds for ans\\\"{a}tze that form exact 2-designs, to arbitrary ans\\\"{a}tze. Specifically, we calculate the variance in the cost gradient in terms of the expressibility of the ansatz, as measured by its distance from being a 2-design. Our resulting bounds indicate that highly expressive ans\\\"{a}tze exhibit flatter cost landscapes and therefore will be harder to train. Furthermore, we provide numerics illustrating the effect of expressiblity on gradient scalings, and we discuss the implications for designing strategies to avoid barren plateaus.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive architectural analysis for a fault-tolerant quantum computer based on cat codes concatenated with outer quantum error-correcting codes. For the physical hardware, we propose a system of acoustic resonators coupled to superconducting circuits with a two-dimensional layout. Using estimated near-term physical parameters for electro-acoustic systems, we perform a detailed error analysis of measurements and gates, including CNOT and Toffoli gates. Having built a realistic noise model, we numerically simulate quantum error correction when the outer code is either a repetition code or a thin rectangular surface code. Our next step toward universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a protocol for fault-tolerant Toffoli magic state preparation that significantly improves upon the fidelity of physical Toffoli gates at very low qubit cost. To achieve even lower overheads, we devise a new magic-state distillation protocol for Toffoli states. Combining these results together, we obtain realistic full-resource estimates of the physical error rates and overheads needed to run useful fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. We find that with around 1,000 superconducting circuit components, one could construct a fault-tolerant quantum computer that can run circuits which are intractable for classical supercomputers. Hardware with 32,000 superconducting circuit components, in turn, could simulate the Hubbard model in a regime beyond the reach of classical computing.",

    "abstract": "Twin-ﬁeld quantum key distribution can overcome the secret key capacity of repeaterless quantum key distribution via single-photon interference. However, to compensate for the channel ﬂuctuations and lock the laser ﬂuctuations, the techniques of phase tracking and phase locking are indispensable in experiment, which drastically increase experimental complexity and hinder free-space realization. We herein present an asynchronous measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol that can surpass the secret key capacity even without phase tracking and phase locking. Lever-aging the concept of time multiplexing, asynchronous two-photon Bell-state measurement is realized by postmatching two interference detection events. For a 1 GHz system, the new protocol reaches a transmission distance of 450 km without phase tracking. After further removing phase locking, our protocol is still capable of breaking the capacity at 270 km. Intriguingly, when using the same experimental techniques, our protocol has a higher key rate than the phase-matching-type twin-ﬁeld protocol. In the presence of imperfect intensity modulation, it also has a signiﬁcant advantage in terms of the transmission distance over the sending-or-not-sending type twin-ﬁeld protocol. With high key rates and accessible technology, our work provides a promising candidate for practical scalable quantum communication networks.",

However, QPE requires a large number of ancilla qubits and large circuit depth, as well as the ability to perform inverse quantum Fourier transform, making it expensive to implement on an early fault-tolerant quantum computer. We propose an alternative method to estimate the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian with Heisenberg-limited precision scaling, which employs a simple quantum circuit with one ancilla qubit, and a classical post-processing procedure. Besides the ground state energy, our algorithm also produces an approximate cumulative distribution function of the spectral measure, which can be used to compute other spectral properties of the Hamiltonian.",

In this Perspective, I argue that quantum technologies must urgently plan for the creation and structuration of a transverse quantum energy initiative, connecting quantum thermodynamics, quantum information science, quantum physics and engineering.

This is in fact a curious choice: Today's machine learning algorithms are notoriously powerful in practice, but remain theoretically difficult to study. Quantum computing, in contrast, does not offer practical benchmarks on realistic scales, and theory is the main tool we have to judge whether it could become relevant for a problem. In this perspective we explain why it is so difficult to say something about the practical power of quantum computers for machine learning with the tools we are currently using. We argue that these challenges call for a critical debate on whether quantum advantage and the narrative of 'beating' classical machine learning should continue to dominate the literature the way it does, and highlight examples for how other perspectives in existing research provide an important alternative to the focus on advantage.",

Here, we report algorithms for the digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of open quantum systems governed by a Lindblad equation using adaptations of the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm.

    "abstract": "Present protocols of criticality-enhanced sensing with open quantum sensors assume direct measurement of the sensor and omit the radiation quanta emitted to the environment, thereby poten-tially missing valuable information. Here we propose a protocol for criticality-enhanced sensing via continuous observation of the emitted radiation quanta. Under general assumptions, we establish a scaling theory for the global quantum Fisher information of the joint system and environment state at dissipative critical points. We derive universal scaling laws featuring transient and long-time behavior governed by the underlying critical exponents. Importantly, such scaling laws exceed the standard quantum limit and can in principle saturate the Heisenberg limit. To harness such advantageous scaling, we propose a practical sensing scheme based on continuous detection of the emitted quanta as realized experimentally in various quantum-optical setups. In such a scheme a single interrogation corresponds to a (stochastic) quantum trajectory of the open system evolving under the nonunitary dynamics dependent on the parameter to be sensed and the backaction of the continuous measurement. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the associated precision scaling signif-icantly exceeds that based on direct measurement of the critical steady state, thereby establishing the metrological value of the continuous detection of the emitted quanta at dissipative criticality. We illustrate our protocol via counting the photons emitted by the open Rabi model, a paradigmatic model for the study of dissipative phase transition with ﬁnite components. Our protocol is applicable to generic quantum-optical open sensors permitting continuous readout, and may ﬁnd applications at the frontier of quantum sensing, such as the human-machine interface, magnetic diagnosis of heart disease, and zero-ﬁeld nuclear magnetic resonance.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models are aimed at learning from data encoded in quantum states. Recently, it has been shown that models with little to no inductive biases (i.e., with no assumptions about the problem embedded in the model) are likely to have trainability and generalization issues, especially for large problem sizes. As such, it is fundamental to develop schemes that encode as much information as available about the problem at hand. In this work we present a simple, yet powerful, framework where the underlying invariances in the data are used to build QML models that, by construction, respect those symmetries. These so-called group-invariant models produce outputs that remain invariant under the action of any element of the symmetry group G associated to the dataset. We present theoretical results underpinning the design of G -invariant models, and exemplify their application through several paradigmatic QML classiﬁcation tasks including cases when G is a continuous Lie group and also when it is a discrete symmetry group. Notably, our framework allows us to recover, in an elegant way, several well known algorithms for the literature, as well as to discover new ones. Taken together, we expect that our results will help pave the way towards a more geometric and group-theoretic approach to QML model design.",

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms are promising algorithms for achieving quantum advantage on near-term devices. The quantum hardware is used to implement a variational wave function and measure observables, whereas the classical computer is used to store and update the variational parameters. The optimization landscape of expressive variational ansätze is however dominated by large regions in parameter space, known as barren plateaus, with vanishing gradients, which prevents eﬃcient optimization. In this work we propose a general algorithm to avoid barren plateaus in the initialization and throughout the optimization. To this end we deﬁne a notion of weak barren plateaus (WBPs) based on the entropies of local reduced density matrices. The presence of WBPs can be eﬃciently quantiﬁed using recently introduced shadow tomography of the quantum state with a classical computer. We demonstrate that avoidance of WBPs suﬃces to ensure sizable gradients in the initialization. In addition, we demonstrate that decreasing the gradient step size, guided by the entropies allows WBPs to be avoided during the optimization process. This paves the way for eﬃcient barren plateau-free optimization on near-term devices. (LW). LW encounters a WBP for both learning rates that we consider (green star). In contrast, SA avoids the WBP for both learning rates. Good performance and further convergence in the local minimum is only achieved through a smaller learning rate of η = 0.01. We use a system size of N = 10 and a random circuit from Eq. (1) with circuit depth p = 100. Data is averaged over 100 random instances.",

The three classes are inspired by distinct physical insights, including tensor-network constructions, multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), and parton constructions. A large class of topological orders, including chiral topological order, can be prepared in constant depth or time, and one-dimensional CFT states and non-abelian topological orders with both solvable and non-solvable groups can be prepared in depth scaling logarithmically with system size. We also build on a recently discovered correspondence between symmetry-protected topological phases and long-range entanglement to derive efficient protocols for preparing symmetry-enriched topological order and arbitrary CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) codes. Our work illustrates the practical and conceptual versatility of measurement for state preparation.",

    "abstract": "The entanglement entropy of subsystems of typical eigenstates of quantum many-body Hamiltonians has been recently conjectured to be a diagnostic of quantum chaos and integrability. In quantum chaotic systems it has been found to behave as in typical pure states, while in integrable systems it has been found to behave as in typical pure Gaussian states. In this tutorial, we provide a pedagogical introduction to known results about the entanglement entropy of subsystems of typical pure states and of typical pure Gaussian states. They both exhibit a leading term that scales with the volume of the subsystem, when smaller than one half of the volume of the system, but the prefactor of the volume law is fundamentally different. It is constant (and maximal) for typical pure states, and it depends on the ratio between the volume of the subsystem and of the entire system for typical pure Gaussian states. Since particle-number conservation plays an important role in many physical Hamiltonians, we discuss its effect on typical pure states and on typical pure Gaussian states. We prove that while the behavior of the leading volume-law terms does not change qualitatively, the nature of the subleading terms can change. In particular, subleading corrections can appear that depend on the square root of the volume of the subsystem. We unveil the origin of those corrections. Finally, we discuss the connection between the entanglement entropy of typical pure states and analytical results obtained in the context of random matrix theory, as well as numerical results obtained for physical Hamiltonians.",

Here, we integrate quantum error correction and quantum error mitigation into an efficient FTQC architecture that effectively increases the code distance and $T$-gate count at the cost of constant sampling overheads in a wide range of quantum computing regimes. For example, while we need $10^4$ to $10^{10}$ logical operations for demonstrating quantum advantages from optimistic and pessimistic points of view, we show that we can reduce the required number of physical qubits by $80\\%$ and $45\\%$ in each regime. From another perspective, when the achievable code distance is up to about 11, our scheme allows executing $10^3$ times more logical operations. This scheme will dramatically alleviate the required computational overheads and hasten the arrival of the FTQC era.",

    "abstract": "Magic (non-stabilizerness) is a necessary but \"expensive\" kind of \"fuel\" to drive universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. To properly study and characterize the origin of quantum \"complexity\" in computation as well as physics, it is crucial to develop a rigorous understanding of the quantification of magic. Previous studies of magic mostly focused on small systems and largely relied on the discrete Wigner formalism (which is only well behaved in odd prime power dimensions). Here we present an initiatory study of the magic of genuinely many-body quantum states (with focus on the important case of many qubits) at a quantitative level. We first address the basic question of how magical a many-body state can be, and show that the maximum and typical magic of an $n$-qubit state is essentially $n$, simultaneously for a range of natural resource measures. As a corollary, we show that the resource theory of magic with stabilizer-preserving free operations is asymptotically reversible. In the quest for explicit, scalable cases of highly entangled states whose magic can be understood, we connect the magic of hypergraph states with the second-order nonlinearity of their underlying Boolean functions. Next, we go on and investigate many-body magic in practical and physical contexts. We first consider Pauli measurement-based quantum computation, in which magic is a necessary feature of the initial resource state. We show that $n$-qubit states with nearly $n$ magic, or indeed almost all states, cannot supply nontrivial speedups over classical computers. We then present an example of analyzing the magic of \"natural\" condensed matter systems. We apply the Boolean function techniques to derive explicit bounds on the magic of the ground states of certain 2D symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, and comment on possible further connections between magic and the quantum complexity of matter.",

    "abstract": "Under suitable assumptions, the algorithms in [Lin, Tong, Quantum 2020] can estimate the ground state energy and prepare the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian with near-optimal query complexities. However, this is based on a block encoding input model of the Hamiltonian, whose implementation is known to require a large resource overhead. We develop a tool called quantum eigenvalue transformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QET-U), which uses a controlled Hamiltonian evolution as the input model, a single ancilla qubit and no multi-qubit control operations, and is thus suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. This leads to a simple quantum algorithm that outperforms all previous algorithms with a comparable circuit structure for estimating the ground state energy. For a class of quantum spin Hamiltonians, we propose a new method that exploits certain anti-commutation relations and further removes the need of implementing the controlled Hamiltonian evolution. Coupled with Trotter based approximation of the Hamiltonian evolution, the resulting algorithm can be very suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm using IBM Qiskit for the transverse field Ising model. If we are further allowed to use multi-qubit Toffoli gates, we can then implement amplitude amplification and a new binary amplitude estimation algorithm, which increases the circuit depth but decreases the total query complexity. The resulting algorithm saturates the near-optimal complexity for ground state preparation and energy estimating using a constant number of ancilla qubits (no more than 3).",

    "abstract": "The term randomized benchmarking refers to a collection of protocols that in the past decade have become the gold standard for characterizing quantum gates. These protocols aim at efficiently estimating the quality of a set of quantum gates in a way that is resistant to state preparation and measurement errors, and over the years many versions have been devised. In this work, we develop a comprehensive framework of randomized benchmarking general enough to encompass virtually all known protocols. Overcoming previous limitations on e.g. error models and gate sets, this framework allows us to formulate realistic conditions under which we can rigorously guarantee that the output of a randomized benchmarking experiment is well-described by a linear combination of matrix exponential decays. We complement this with a detailed discussion of the fitting problem associated to randomized benchmarking data. We discuss modern signal processing techniques and their guarantees in the context of randomized benchmarking, give analytical sample complexity bounds and numerically evaluate their performance and limitations. In order to reduce the resource demands of this fitting problem, we moreover provide scalable post-processing techniques to isolate exponential decays, significantly improving the practical feasibility of a large set of randomized benchmarking protocols. These post-processing techniques generalize several previously proposed methods such as character benchmarking and linear-cross entropy benchmarking. Finally we discuss, in full generality, how and when randomized benchmarking decay rates can be used to infer quality measures like the average fidelity. On the technical side, our work significantly extends the recently developed Fourier-theoretic perspective on randomized benchmarking and combines it with the perturbation theory of invariant subspaces and ideas from signal processing.",

Cooperative effects can find applications, among other areas, in topological quantum optics, in quantum metrology or in quantum information. This tutorial provides a set of theoretical tools to tackle the behavior responsible for the onset of cooperativity by extending open quantum system dynamics methods, such as the master equation and quantum Langevin equations, to electron-photon interactions in strongly coupled and correlated quantum emitter ensembles. The methods are illustrated on a wide range of current research topics such as the design of nanoscale coherent light sources, highly-reflective quantum metasurfaces or low intracavity power superradiant lasers. The analytical approaches are developed for ensembles of identical two-level quantum emitters and then extended to more complex systems where frequency disorder or vibronic couplings are taken into account. The relevance of the approach ranges from atoms in optical lattices to quantum dots or molecular systems in solid-state environments.",

    "abstract": "In this work we present a detailed analysis of variational quantum phase estimation (VQPE), a method based on real-time evolution for ground and excited state estimation on near-term hardware. We derive the theoretical ground on which the approach stands, and demonstrate that it provides one of the most compact variational expansions to date for solving strongly correlated Hamiltonians. At the center of VQPE lies a set of equations, with a simple geometrical interpretation, which provides conditions for the time evolution grid in order to decouple eigenstates out of the set of time evolved expansion states, and connects the method to the classical filter diagonalization algorithm. Further, we introduce what we call the unitary formulation of VQPE, in which the number of matrix elements that need to be measured scales linearly with the number of expansion states, and we provide an analysis of the effects of noise which substantially improves previous considerations. The unitary formulation allows for a direct comparison to iterative phase estimation. Our results mark VQPE as both a natural and highly efficient quantum algorithm for ground and excited state calculations of general many-body systems. We demonstrate a hardware implementation of VQPE for the transverse field Ising model. Further, we illustrate its power on a paradigmatic example of strong correlation (Cr2 in the SVP basis set), and show that it is possible to reach chemical accuracy with as few as ~50 timesteps.",

    "abstract": "Characterisation protocols have so far played a central role in the development of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers capable of impressive quantum feats. This trajectory is expected to continue in building the next generation of devices: ones that can surpass classical computers for particular tasks – but progress in characterisation must keep up with the complexities of intricate device noise. A missing piece in the zoo of characterisation procedures is tomography which can completely describe non-Markovian dynamics over a given time frame. Here, we formally introduce a generalisation of quantum process tomography, which we call process tensor tomography. We detail the experimental requirements, construct the necessary post-processing algorithms for maximum-likelihood estimation, outline the best-practice aspects for accurate results, and make the procedure eﬃcient for low-memory processes. The characterisation is a pathway to diagnos-tics and informed control of correlated noise. As an example application of the hardware-agnostic technique, we show how its predictive control can be used to substantially improve multi-time circuit ﬁdelities on superconducting quantum devices. Our methods could form the core for carefully developed software that may help hardware consistently pass the fault-tolerant noise threshold.",

The fifth problem requires checking whether a certain state of a two-ququart system is two-copy distillable.Received 21 December 2020Revised 1 December 2021DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.010101Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "When a quantum system couples strongly to multiple baths then it is generally no longer possible to describe the resulting system dynamics by simply adding the individual effects of each bath. However, capturing such multi-bath system dynamics has up to now required approximations that can obscure some of the non-additive effects. Here we present a numerically-exact and efficient technique for tackling this problem that builds on the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) representation. We test the method by applying it to a simple model system that exhibits non-additive behaviour: a two-level dipole coupled to both a vibrational and an optical bath. Although not directly coupled, there is an effective interaction between the baths mediated by the system that can lead to population inversion in the matter system when the vibrational coupling is strong. We benchmark and validate multi-bath TEMPO against two approximate methods - one based on a polaron transformation, the other on an identification of a reaction coordinate - before exploring the regime of simultaneously strong vibrational and optical coupling where the approximate techniques break down. Here we uncover a new regime where the quantum Zeno effect leads to a fully mixed state of the electronic system.",

    "abstract": "The technological development of hardware heading toward universal fault-tolerant quantum computation requires a large-scale processing unit with high performance. While fluxonium qubits are promising with high coherence and large anharmonicity, their scalability has not been systematically explored. In this work, we propose a superconducting quantum information processor based on compact high-coherence fluxoniums with suppressed crosstalk, reduced design complexity, improved operational efficiency, high-fidelity gates, and resistance to parameter fluctuations. In this architecture, the qubits are readout dispersively using individual resonators connected to a common bus and manipulated via combined on-chip RF and DC control lines, both of which can be designed to have low crosstalk. A multi-path coupling approach enables exchange interactions between the high-coherence computational states and at the same time suppresses the spurious static ZZ rate, leading to fast and high-fidelity entangling gates. We numerically investigate the cross resonance controlled-NOT and the differential AC-Stark controlled-Z operations, revealing low gate error for qubit-qubit detuning bandwidth of up to 1 GHz. Our study on frequency crowding indicates high fabrication yield for quantum processors consisting of over thousands of qubits. In addition, we estimate low resource overhead to suppress logical error rate using the XZZX surface code. These results promise a scalable quantum architecture with high performance for the pursuit of universal quantum computation.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining or even improving gate performance with growing numbers of parallel controlled qubits is a vital requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computing. For superconducting quantum processors, though isolated one- or two-qubit gates have been demonstrated with high-fidelity, implementing these gates in parallel commonly shows worse performance. Generally, this degradation is attributed to various crosstalks between qubits, such as quantum crosstalk due to residual inter-qubit coupling. An understanding of the exact nature of these crosstalks is critical to figuring out respective mitigation schemes and improved qubit architecture designs with low crosstalk. Here we give a theoretical analysis of quantum crosstalk impact on simultaneous gate operations in a qubit architecture, where fixed-frequency transmon qubits are coupled via a tunable bus, and sub-100-ns controlled-Z (CZ) gates can be realized by applying a baseband flux pulse on the bus. Our analysis shows that for microwave-driven single-qubit gates, the dressing from the qubit-qubit coupling can cause non-negligible cross-driving errors when qubits operate near frequency collision regions. During CZ gate operations, although unwanted near-neighbor interactions are nominally turned off, sub-MHz parasitic next-near-neighbor interactions involving spectator qubits can still exist, causing considerable leakage or control error when one operates qubit systems around these parasitic resonance points. To ensure high-fidelity simultaneous operations, there could raise a request to figure out a better way to balance the gate error from target qubit systems themselves and the error from non-participating spectator qubits. Overall, our analysis suggests that towards useful quantum processors, the qubit architecture should be examined carefully in the context of high-fidelity simultaneous gate operations in a scalable qubit lattice.",

    "abstract": "Fault-tolerant quantum error correction is essential for implementing quantum algorithms of significant practical importance. In this work, we propose a highly effective use of the surface-GKP code, i.e., the surface code consisting of bosonic GKP qubits instead of bare two-dimensional qubits. In our proposal, we use error-corrected two-qubit gates between GKP qubits and introduce a maximum likelihood decoding strategy for correcting shift errors in the two-GKP-qubit gates. Our proposed decoding reduces the total CNOT failure rate of the GKP qubits, e.g., from $0.87\\%$ to $0.36\\%$ at a GKP squeezing of $12$dB, compared to the case where the simple closest-integer decoding is used. Then, by concatenating the GKP code with the surface code, we find that the threshold GKP squeezing is given by $9.9$dB under the the assumption that finite-squeezing of the GKP states is the dominant noise source. More importantly, we show that a low logical failure rate $p_{L}<10^{-7}$ can be achieved with moderate hardware requirements, e.g., $291$ modes and $97$ qubits at a GKP squeezing of $12$dB as opposed to $1457$ bare qubits for the standard rotated surface code at an equivalent noise level (i.e., $p=0.36\\%$). Such a low failure rate of our surface-GKP code is possible through the use of space-time correlated edges in the matching graphs of the surface code decoder. Further, all edge weights in the matching graphs are computed dynamically based on analog information from the GKP error correction using the full history of all syndrome measurement rounds. We also show that a highly-squeezed GKP state of GKP squeezing $\\gtrsim 12$dB can be experimentally realized by using a dissipative stabilization method, namely, the Big-small-Big method, with fairly conservative experimental parameters. Lastly, we introduce a three-level ancilla scheme to mitigate ancilla decay errors during a GKP state preparation.",

    "abstract": "Hosting non-classical states of light in three-dimensional microwave cavities has emerged as a promising paradigm for continuous-variable quantum information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate high-fidelity generation of a range of Wigner-negative states useful for quantum computation, such as Schr\\\"{o}dinger-cat states, binomial states, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, as well as cubic phase states. The latter states have been long sought after in quantum optics and were never achieved experimentally before. To do so, we use a sequence of interleaved selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates and displacements. We optimize the state preparation in two steps. First we use a gradient-descent algorithm to optimize the parameters of the SNAP and displacement gates. Then we optimize the envelope of the pulses implementing the SNAP gates. Our results show that this way of creating highly non-classical states in a harmonic oscillator is robust to fluctuations of the system parameters such as the qubit frequency and the dispersive shift.",

Designing good variational circuits or predicting how well they perform for given learning or optimization tasks is still unclear. Here we discuss these problems, analyzing variational quantum circuits using the theory of neural tangent kernels. We define quantum neural tangent kernels, and derive dynamical equations for their associated loss function in optimization and learning tasks. We analytically solve the dynamics in the frozen limit, or lazy training regime, where variational angles change slowly and a linear perturbation is good enough. We extend the analysis to a dynamical setting, including quadratic corrections in the variational angles. We then consider hybrid quantum-classical architecture and define a large-width limit for hybrid kernels, showing that a hybrid quantum-classical neural network can be approximately Gaussian. The results presented here show limits for which analytical understandings of the training dynamics for variational quantum circuits, used for quantum machine learning and optimization problems, are possible. These analytical results are supported by numerical simulations of quantum machine learning experiments.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers solve ever more complex tasks using steadily growing system sizes. Characterizing these quantum systems is vital, yet becoming increasingly challenging. The gold-standard is quantum state tomography (QST), capable of fully reconstructing a quantum state without prior knowledge. Measurement and classical computing costs, however, increase exponentially in the system size — a bottleneck given the scale of existing and near-term quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate a scalable and practical QST approach that uses a single measurement setting, namely symmetric informationally complete (SIC) positive operator-valued measures (POVM). We implement these nonorthogonal measurements on an ion trap device by utilizing more energy levels in each ion - without ancilla qubits. More precisely, we locally map the SIC POVM to orthogonal states embedded in a higher-dimensional system, which we read out using repeated in-sequence detections, pro-viding full tomographic information in every shot. Combining this SIC tomography with the recently developed randomized measurement toolbox (‘classical shadows’) proves to be a powerful combination. SIC tomography alleviates the need for choosing measurement settings at random (‘derandomization’), while classical shadows enable the estimation of arbitrary polynomial functions of the density matrix orders of magnitudes faster than standard methods. The latter enables in-depth entanglement studies, which we experimentally showcase on a 5-qubit absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state. Moreover, the fact that the full tomography information is available in every shot enables online QST in real time. We demonstrate this on an 8-qubit entangled state, as well as for fast state identiﬁcation. All in all, these features single out SIC-based classical shadow estimation as a highly scalable and convenient tool for quantum state characterization.",

In this work, we first introduce a decoder capable of correcting spacelike and timelike errors during lattice surgery protocols. Afterwards, we compute logical failure rates of a lattice surgery protocol for a biased circuit-level noise model. We then provide a new protocol for performing twist-free lattice surgery, where we avoid twist defects in the bulk of the lattice. Our twist-free protocol eliminates the extra circuit components and gate scheduling complexities associated with the measurement of higher weight stabilizers when using twist defects. We also provide a protocol for temporally encoded lattice surgery that can be used to reduce both runtimes and the total space-time costs of quantum algorithms. Lastly, we propose a layout for a quantum processor that is more efficient for rectangular surface codes exploiting noise bias, and which is compatible with the other techniques mentioned above.",

    "abstract": "We propose a divide-and-conquer method for the quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to solve larger problems with small-scale quantum computers. Specifically, we concatenate a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with a reduction in the system dimension, where the interactions between divided subsystems are taken as an effective Hamiltonian expanded by the reduced basis. Then the effective Hamiltonian is further solved by the VQE, which we call deep VQE. Deep VQE allows us to apply quantum-classical hybrid algorithms on small-scale quantum computers to large systems with strong intrasubsystem interactions and weak intersubsystem interactions, or strongly correlated spin models on large regular lattices. As proof-of-principle numerical demonstrations, we use the proposed method for quasi-one-dimensional models, including one-dimensionally coupled 12-qubit Heisenberg antiferromagnetic models on kagome lattices as well as two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnetic models on square lattices. The largest problem size of 64 qubits is solved by simulating 20-qubit quantum computers with a reasonably good accuracy approximately a few %. The proposed scheme enables us to handle the problems of >1000 qubits by concatenating VQEs with a few tens of qubits. While it is unclear how accurate ground-state energy can be obtained for such a large system, our numerical results on a 64-qubit system suggest that deep VQE provides a good approximation (discrepancy within a few percent) and has room for further improvement. Therefore, deep VQE provides us a promising pathway to solve practically important problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.Received 2 October 2020Revised 25 January 2022Accepted 16 February 2022DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.010346Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of a quantum bit's environment is essential for the realization of practical systems for quantum information processing and metrology. We use single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to study the dynamics of a disordered spin ensemble at the diamond surface. Specifically, we tune the density of\"dark\"surface spins to interrogate their contribution to the decoherence of shallow NV center spin qubits. When the average surface spin spacing exceeds the NV center depth, we find that the surface spin contribution to the NV center free induction decay can be described by a stretched exponential with variable power n. We show that these observations are consistent with a model in which the spatial positions of the surface spins are fixed for each measurement, but some of them reconfigure between measurements. In particular, we observe a depth-dependent critical time associated with a dynamical transition from Gaussian (n=2) decay to n=2/3, and show that this transition arises from the competition between the small decay contributions of many distant spins and strong coupling to a few proximal spins at the surface. These observations demonstrate the potential of a local sensor for understanding complex systems and elucidate pathways for improving and controlling spin qubits at the surface.",

    "abstract": "We consider quantum circuits consisting of randomly chosen two-local gates and study the number of gates needed for the distribution over measurement outcomes for typical circuit instances to be anti-concentrated, roughly meaning that the probability mass is not too concentrated on a small number of measurement outcomes. Understanding the conditions for anti-concentration is important for determining which quantum circuits are difficult to simulate classically, as anti-concentration has been in some cases an ingredient of mathematical arguments that simulation is hard and in other cases a necessary condition for easy simulation. Our definition of anti-concentration is that the expected collision probability, that is, the probability that two independently drawn outcomes will agree, is only a constant factor larger than if the distribution were uniform. We show that when the 2-local gates are each drawn from the Haar measure (or any two-design), at least $\\Omega(n \\log(n))$ gates (and thus $\\Omega(\\log(n))$ circuit depth) are needed for this condition to be met on an $n$ qudit circuit. In both the case where the gates are nearest-neighbor on a 1D ring and the case where gates are long-range, we show $O(n \\log(n))$ gates are also sufficient, and we precisely compute the optimal constant prefactor for the $n \\log(n)$. The technique we employ relies upon a mapping from the expected collision probability to the partition function of an Ising-like classical statistical mechanical model, which we manage to bound using stochastic and combinatorial techniques.",

To achieve this we design a set of linear-depth quantum circuits to generate ground states of general string-net models together with unitary open string operators to simulate the creation and braiding of abelian and non-abelian anyons. We show that the abelian (non-abelian) unitary string operators can be implemented with a constant (linear) depth quantum circuit.

Cat qubits are a promising realization of biased-noise qubits as they feature an exponential error bias inherited from their non-local encoding in the phase space of a quantum harmonic oscillator. To confine the state of an oscillator to the cat qubit manifold, two main approaches have been considered so far: a Kerr-based Hamiltonian confinement with high gate performances, and a dissipative confinement with robust protection against a broad range of noise mechanisms. We introduce a new combined dissipative and Hamiltonian confinement scheme based on two-photon dissipation together with a Two-Photon Exchange (TPE) Hamiltonian. The TPE Hamiltonian is similar to Kerr nonlinearity, but unlike the Kerr it only induces a bounded distinction between even- and odd-photon eigenstates, a highly beneficial feature for protecting the cat qubits with dissipative mechanisms. Using this combined confinement scheme, we demonstrate fast and bias-preserving gates with drastically improved performance compared to dissipative or Hamiltonian schemes. In addition, this combined scheme can be implemented experimentally with only minor modifications of existing dissipative cat qubit experiments.",

Our primary example is a Pauli stabilizer model on four-dimensional qudits that belongs to the double semion (DS) phase of matter. The DS stabilizer Hamiltonian is constructed by condensing an emergent boson in a $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code, where the condensation is implemented by making certain two-body measurements. We rigorously verify the topological order of the DS stabilizer model by identifying an explicit finite-depth quantum circuit (with ancillary qubits) that maps its ground state subspace to that of a DS string-net model. We show that the construction of the DS stabilizer Hamiltonian generalizes to all twisted quantum doubles (TQDs) with Abelian anyons. This yields a Pauli stabilizer code on composite-dimensional qudits for each such TQD, implying that the classification of topological Pauli stabilizer codes extends well beyond stacks of toric codes - in fact, exhausting all Abelian anyon theories that admit a gapped boundary. We also demonstrate that symmetry-protected topological phases of matter characterized by type I and type II cocycles can be modeled by Pauli stabilizer Hamiltonians by gauging certain 1-form symmetries of the TQD stabilizer models.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises to provide machine learning with computational advantages. How-ever, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices pose engineering challenges such advantages. Recently, a series of quantum machine learning computational models inspired by the noise-tolerant dynamics on the brain have emerged as a means to circumvent the hardware limitations of NISQ devices. In this article, we introduce a quantum version of a recurrent neural network (RNN), a well-known model for neural circuits in the brain. Our quantum RNN (qRNN) makes use of the natural Hamiltonian dynamics of an ensemble of interacting spin-1/2 particles as a means for computation. In the limit where the Hamiltonian is diagonal, the qRNN recovers the dynamics of the classical version. Beyond this limit, we observe that the quantum dynamics of the qRNN provide quantum computational features that can aid in computation. To this end, we study a qRNN based on arrays of Rydberg atoms, and show that the qRNN is indeed capable of replicating the learning of several cognitive tasks such as multitasking, decision making, and long-term memory by leveraging several key features of this platform such as interatomic interactions, and quantum many-body scars.",

    "abstract": "We present a scalable star-shaped quantum key distribution (QKD) optical fiber network. We use wavelength-division demultiplexing (WDM) of broadband photon pairs to establish key exchange between multiple pairs of participants simultaneously. Our QKD system is the first entanglement-based network of four participants using BBM92 time-bin coding and the first network achieving timing synchronization solely by clock recovery based on the photon arrival times. We demonstrate simultaneous bipartite key exchange between any possible combination of participants and show that the quantum bit error rate (QBER) itself can be used to stabilize the phase in the interferometers by small temperature adjustments. The key distribution is insensitive to polarization fluctuations in the network, enabling key distribution using deployed fibers even under challenging environmental conditions. We show that our network can be readily extended to 34 participants by using a standard arrayed-waveguide grating for WDM with 100 GHz channel spacing and that reconfigurable network connections are possible with a wavelength-selective switch. In a field test we demonstrate secure key rates of 6.3 bit/s with a QBER of 4.5% over a total fiber length of 108 km with 26.8 km of deployed fiber between two participants with high stability. Our system features a relatively simple design of the receiver modules and enables scaling QKD networks without a trusted nodes to distances up to more than 100 km and to more than 100 users. With such a network, a secure communication infrastructure on a metropolitan scale can be established.",

    "abstract": "Speed of state transitions in macroscopic systems is a crucial concept for foundations of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics as well as various applications in quantum technology represented by optimal quantum control. While extensive studies have made eﬀorts to obtain rigorous constraints on dynamical processes since Mandelstam and Tamm, speed limits that provide tight bounds for macroscopic transitions have remained elusive. Here, by employing the local conservation law of probability, the fundamental principle in physics, we develop a general framework for deriving qualitatively tighter speed limits for macroscopic systems than many conventional ones. We show for the ﬁrst time that the speed of the expectation value of an observable deﬁned on an arbitrary graph, which can describe general many-body systems, is bounded by the “gradient” of the observable, in contrast with conventional speed limits depending on the entire range of the observable. This framework enables us to derive novel quantum speed limits for macroscopic unitary dynamics. Unlike previous bounds, the speed limit decreases when the expectation value of the transition Hamiltonian increases; this intuitively describes a new tradeoﬀ relation between time and quantum phase diﬀerence. Our bound is dependent on instantaneous quantum states and thus can achieve the equality condition, which is conceptually distinct from the Lieb-Robinson bound. We also ﬁnd that, beyond expectation values of macroscopic observables, the speed of macroscopic quantum coherence can be bounded from above by our general approach. The newly obtained bounds are veriﬁed in transport phenomena in particle systems and nonequilibrium dynamics in many-body spin systems. We also demonstrate that our strategy can be applied for ﬁnding new speed limits for macroscopic transitions in stochastic systems, including quantum ones, where the bounds are expressed by the entropy production rate. Our work elucidates novel speed limits on the basis of local conservation law, providing fundamental limits to various types of nonequilibrium quantum macroscopic phenomena.",

Fast measurement integration ($980$ ns) and initialization ($\\approx 300$ ns) operations are performed with all-electrical, baseband control. We emphasize a leakage-sensitive joint initialization and measurement metric, developed in the context of exchange-only qubits but applicable more broadly, and report an infidelity of $2.5\\pm0.5\\times 10^{-3}$. This result is enabled by a high-valley-splitting heterostructure, initialization at the 2-to-3 electron charge boundary, and careful assessment and mitigation of $T_1$ during spin-to-charge conversion. The ultimate fidelity is limited by a number of comparably-important factors, and we identify clear paths towards further improved fidelity and speed.

Heralding enables high-fidelity entanglement even for a cavity of moderate quality. For processors composed of trapped ions in a linear chain, a single cavity with realistic parameters successfully transfers photons every few $\\mu$s, enabling the any-to-any entanglement of 20 ion chains containing a total of 500 qubits in 200 $\\mu$s, with both fidelities and rates limited only by local operations and ion readout. For processors composed of Rydberg atoms, our method fully connects a large array of thousands of neutral atoms. The connectivity afforded by our architecture is extendable to tens of thousands of qubits using multiple overlapping cavities, expanding capabilities for NISQ era algorithms and Hamiltonian simulations, as well as enabling more robust high-dimensional error correcting schemes.",

    "abstract": "In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the number of controllable hardware qubits is insuﬃcient to implement quantum error correction (QEC). As an alternative, quantum error mitigation (QEM) can suppress errors in measurement results via repeated experiments and postprocessing of data. Typical techniques for error mitigation, e.g., the quasi-probability decompo-sition method, ignore correlated errors between diﬀerent gates. Here, we introduce a QEM method based on the matrix product operator (MPO) representation of a quantum circuit that can characterize the noise channel with polynomial complexity. Our technique is demonstrated on a depth = 20 fully parallel quantum circuit of up to N q = 20 qubits undergoing local and global noise. The circuit error is reduced by several times with only a small bond dimension D (cid:48) = 1 for the noise channel. The MPO representation increases the accuracy of modeling noise without consuming more experimental resources, which improves the QEM performance and broadens its scope of application. Our method is hopeful of being applied to circuits in higher dimensions with more qubits and deeper depth.",

At the same time, it poses major challenges for theoretical studies, as it implies a sign problem in numerical simulations. Analog quantum simulators open the promising prospect of treating quantum many-body systems with such topological terms, but, contrary to their digital counterparts, they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to control the $\\theta$-angle. Here, we demonstrate how a tunable topological $\\theta$-term can be added to a prototype theory with $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge symmetry, a discretized version of quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. As we show, the model can be realized experimentally in a single-species Bose--Hubbard model in an optical superlattice with three different spatial periods, thus requiring only standard experimental resources. Through numerical calculations obtained from the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method and exact diagonalization, we benchmark the model system, and illustrate how salient effects due to the $\\theta$-term can be observed. These include charge confinement, the weakening of quantum many-body scarring, as well as the disappearance of Coleman's phase transition due to explicit breaking of CP symmetry. This work opens the door towards studying the rich physics of topological gauge-theory terms in large-scale cold-atom quantum simulators.",

More specifically, we employ the new method to derive universal bounds on the error and cost of transforming generic noisy channels (multiple instances can be used adaptively, in contrast to the state theory) to some unitary resource channel under any free channel-to-channel map.

In particular, we diagnose the existence of the topological order through the lens of quantum information and geometry, i.e., via its equivalence to a quantum error-correcting code with a macroscopic code distance or the presence of macroscopic systoles in systolic geometry. We first prove a no-go theorem that $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological order cannot survive on any fractal embedded in 2D. For fractal lattice models embedded in 3D or higher spatial dimensions, $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological order survives if the boundaries of the interior holes condense only loop or membrane excitations. Moreover, for a class of models containing only loop or membrane excitations, and are hence self-correcting on an $n$-dimensional manifold, we prove that topological order survives on a large class of fractal geometries independent of the type of hole boundaries. We further construct fault-tolerant logical gates using their connection to global and higher-form topological symmetries. In particular, we have discovered a logical CCZ gate corresponding to a global symmetry in a class of fractal codes embedded in 3D with Hausdorff dimension asymptotically approaching $D_H=2+\\epsilon$ for arbitrarily small $\\epsilon$, which hence only requires a space-overhead $\\Omega(d^{2+\\epsilon})$ with $d$ being the code distance. This in turn leads to the surprising discovery of certain exotic gapped boundaries that only condense the combination of loop excitations and gapped domain walls. We further obtain logical $\\text{C}^{p}\\text{Z}$ gates with $p\\le n-1$ on fractal codes embedded in $n$D. In particular, for the logical $\\text{C}^{n-1}\\text{Z}$ in the $n^\\text{th}$ level of Clifford hierarchy, we can reduce the space overhead to $\\Omega(d^{n-1+\\epsilon})$. Mathematically, our findings correspond to macroscopic relative systoles in fractals.",

    "abstract": "The hypothetical axion particle (of unknown mass) is a leading candidate for dark matter (DM). Many experiments search for axions with microwave cavities, where an axion may convert into a cavity photon, leading to a feeble excess in the output power of the cavity. Recent work [Nature 590 , 238 (2021)] has demonstrated that injecting squeezed vacuum into the cavity can substantially accelerate the axion search. Here, we go beyond and provide a theoretical framework to leverage the beneﬁts of quantum squeezing in a network setting consisting of many sensor-cavities. By forming a local sensor network, the signals among the cavities can be combined coherently to boost the axion search. Furthermore, injecting multipartite entanglement across the cavities—generated by splitting a squeezed vacuum—enables a global noise reduction. We explore the performance advantage of such a local, entangled sensor-network, which enjoys both coherence between the axion signals and entanglement between the sensors. Our analyses are pertinent to next-generation DM-axion searches aiming to leverage a network of sensors and quantum resources in an optimal way. Finally, we assess the possibility of using a more exotic quantum state, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state. Despite a constant-factor improvement in the scan-time relative to a single-mode squeezed-state in the ideal case, the advantage of employing a GKP state disappears when a practical measurement scheme is considered.

    "abstract": "Scaling of quantum computers to fault-tolerant levels relies critically on the integration of energy-efficient, stable, and reproducible qubit control and readout electronics. In comparison to traditional semiconductor-control electronics (TSCE) located at room temperature, the signals generated by rf sources based on Josephson-junctions (JJs) benefit from small device sizes, low power dissipation, intrinsic calibration, superior reproducibility, and insensitivity to ambient fluctuations. Previous experiments to colocate qubits and JJ-based control electronics have resulted in quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit, degrading the coherence and lifetime of the qubit. In this paper, we digitally control a 0.01-K transmon qubit with pulses from a Josephson pulse generator (JPG) located at the 3-K stage of a dilution refrigerator. We directly compare the qubit lifetime T1, the coherence time T2*, and the thermal occupation Pth when the qubit is controlled by the JPG circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations of ±0.5 μs and ±2 μs for T1 and T2*, respectively, and agreement to within the 1% error for Pth. Additionally, we perform randomized benchmarking to measure an average JPG gate error of 2.1 × 10−2. In combination with a small device size (< 25 mm2) and low on-chip power dissipation (≪100 μW), these results are an important step toward demonstrating the viability of using JJ-based control electronics located at temperature stages higher than the mixing-chamber stage in highly scaled superconducting quantum information systems.",

The adiabatic algorithm is known to return the ground state for sufficiently long preparation times which depend on the a priori unknown spectral gap. Our work relates in a twofold way. First, we propose a method to obtain information about the spectral profile of the adiabatic evolution. Second, we present the concept of a variational quantum adiabatic algorithm (VQAA) for optimized adiabatic paths. We aim at combining the strengths of the adiabatic and the variational approaches for fast and high-fidelity ground state preparation while keeping the number of measurements as low as possible. Our algorithms build upon ancilla protocols which we present that allow to directly evaluate the ground state overlap. We benchmark for a non-integrable spin-1/2 transverse and longitudinal Ising chain with $N=53$ sites using tensor network techniques. Using a black box, gradient-based approach, we report a reduction in the total evolution time for a given desired ground state fidelity by a factor of ten, which makes our method suitable for the limited decoherence time of noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "We provide an efficient algorithm to compile quantum circuits for fault-tolerant execution. We target surface codes, which form a 2D grid of logical qubits with nearest-neighbor logical operations. Embedding an input circuit's qubits in surface codes can result in long-range two-qubit operations across the grid. We show how to prepare many long-range Bell pairs on qubits connected by edge-disjoint paths of ancillas in constant depth that can be used to perform these long-range operations. This forms one core part of our Edge-Disjoint Paths Compilation (EDPC) algorithm, by easily performing many parallel long-range Clifford operations in constant depth. It also allows us to establish a connection between surface code compilation and several well-studied edge-disjoint paths problems. Similar techniques allow us to perform non-Clifford single-qubit rotations far from magic state distillation factories. In this case, we can easily find the maximum set of paths by a max-flow reduction, which forms the other major part of EDPC. EDPC has the best asymptotic worst-case performance guarantees on the circuit depth for compiling parallel operations when compared to related compilation methods based on swaps and network coding. EDPC also shows a quadratic depth improvement over sequential Pauli-based compilation for parallel rotations requiring magic resources. We implement EDPC and find significantly improved performance for circuits built from parallel cnots, and for circuits which implement the multi-controlled $X$ gate.",

We demonstrate two different experimental approaches to measure the decay times of excited states. The first is based on direct current measurements through the quantum device. Pulse sequences are applied to control the occupation of ground and excited states. We observe a lower bound for the excited state decay on the order of hundred microseconds. The second approach employs a capacitively coupled charge sensor to study the time dynamics of the excited state using the Elzerman technique.

    "abstract": "Scalable, local control over gate operations is an outstanding challenge in the ﬁeld of quantum computing and programmable quantum simulation with Rydberg atom arrays. One approach is to use a global ﬁeld to excite atoms to the Rydberg state, and tune individual atoms in and out of resonance via local light shifts. In this work, we point out that photon scattering errors from light shifts can be signiﬁcantly reduced if the light shift is applied to the Rydberg state instead of the ground state, which can be realized in Rydberg states of alkaline earth atoms using optical transitions in the ion core. As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally demonstrate global control of Rydberg excitations in a Yb optical tweezer array via light shifts induced by a laser tuned near the Yb + 6 s → 6 p 1 / 2 transition. We also perform detailed spectroscopy of the induced light shift and scattering rates of the 6 sns 3 S 1 Rydberg states and reveal the existence of satellite lines where losses from autoionization are strongly suppressed. This work can be readily extended to implement local gate operations in Rydberg atom arrays. In order to describe the autoionization process we propose a ﬁve channel model that aims to ﬁt the spectrum by ﬁnding the appropriate multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) parameters. The control laser couples to odd parity 6 p 1 / 2 nl states with both J 0 = 0 and J 0 = 1. Under the assumption that photoionization occurs via an isolated core excitation (ICE) process, the odd J 0 = 2 symmetry is not accessible for ﬁnal Rydberg states attached to the 6 p 1 / 2 threshold. Omitting the open f shell channels that are suspected to be irrelevant, there are in total 18 channels, from which 5 correspond to J 0 = 0 and 13 correspond to J 0 = 1. The simplest semi-realistic model includes only a single open channel (as proposed for Ba in Ref. [1]), and only the 6 p 1 / 2 closed channels, which results in a total of 5 channels: two for J 0 = 0 and three for J 0 = 1 (Table SI). The latter restriction is justiﬁed by the form of the dipole matrix elements in the ICE, which involves the overlap between the radial wavefunctions in the closed channels.",

We employ a recently developed firstprinciple quantum embedding theory to describe point defects embedded in a periodic crystal, and to derive an effective Hamiltonian, which is then transformed to a qubit Hamiltonian by means of a parity transformation. We use the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and quantum subspace expansion methods to obtain the ground and excited states of spin qubits, respectively, and we propose a promising strategy for noise mitigation. We show that by combining zero-noise extrapolation techniques and constraints on electron occupation to overcome the unphysical state problem of the VQE algorithm, one can obtain reasonably accurate results on near-term-noisy architectures for ground and excited state properties of spin defects. ∗ mgovoni@anl.gov † gagalli@uchicago.edu",

We explain that these phases emerge from the unique combination of long-range and dimerized interactions appearing in these platforms, and propose several experimental observables to characterize them.

Quantum information is stored in long-lived hyperfine or rotational states of molecules which interact indirectly through resonant dipole-dipole interactions with Rydberg atoms. A two-qubit gate based on this interaction has a duration of 1 $\\mu$s and an achievable fidelity of 99.9%. The gate has little sensitivity to the motional states of the particles -- the molecules can be in thermal states, the atoms do not need to be trapped during Rydberg excitation, the gate does not heat the molecules, and heating of the atoms has a negligible effect. Within a large, static array, the gate can be applied to arbitrary pairs of molecules separated by tens of micrometres, making the scheme highly scalable. The molecule-atom interaction can also be used for rapid qubit initialization and efficient, non-destructive qubit readout, without driving any molecular transitions. Single qubit gates are driven using microwave pulses alone, exploiting the strong electric dipole transitions between rotational states. Thus, all operations required for large scale quantum computation can be done without moving the molecules or exciting them out of their ground electronic states.",

The complexity of the algorithm is exponential in the number of photon pairs detected, not just the number of photons, and is directly proportional to the time required to calculate a probability amplitude for a pure Gaussian state. The main innovation is to employ the Williamson decomposition to express a mixed Gaussian state as a probability distribution over pure displaced Gaussian states. By first sampling this random displacement, it is possible to reduce sampling to computing pure-state probability amplitudes, for which the most computationally-expensive step is calculating a loop hafnian. We implement and benchmark an improved loop hafnian algorithm and show that it can be used to compute pure-state probabilities, the dominant step in the sampling algorithm, of up to 50-photon events in a single workstation, i.e., without the need of a supercomputer.",

We illustrate the protocol at the example of a Bose-Hubbard model, where the approach to thermal equilibrium in a closed quantum system can be tracked by measuring both sides of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. We relate the scheme to the quantum Zeno effect and weak measurements, and illustrate possible implementations at the example of a cold-atom system.

Here, we show that such breaking channels are related to complementary tests of macrorealism i.e., temporal separability, channel unsteerability, temporal unsteerability, and the temporal Bell inequality. To demonstrate this we first define a steerability-breaking channel, which is conceptually similar to entanglement and nonlocality-breaking channels and prove that it is identical to an incompatibility-breaking channel. A hierarchy of quantum non-breaking channels is derived, akin to the existing hierarchy relations for temporal and spatial quantum correlations. We then introduce the concept of channels that break temporal correlations, explain how they are related to the standard breaking channels, and prove the following results: (1) A robustness-based measure for non-entanglement-breaking channels can be probed by temporal nonseparability. (2) A non-steerability-breaking channel can be quantified by channel steering. (3) Temporal steerability and non-macrorealism can be used for, respectively, distinguishing unital steerability-breaking channels and nonlocality-breaking channels for a maximally entangled state. Finally, a two-dimensional depolarizing channel is experimentally implemented as a proof-of-principle example to demonstrate the hierarchy relation of non-breaking channels using temporal quantum correlations",

Several quantum emitters exhibit ideal single-photon emission with noise-limited photon antibunching, $g^{(2)}(0)=0$. The photoluminescence emission lineshapes are consistent with individual vibronic transitions. However, polarization-resolved excitation and emission suggests the role of multiple optical transitions, and photon emission correlation spectroscopy reveals complicated optical dynamics associated with excitation and relaxation through multiple electronic excited states. We compare the experimental results to quantitative optical dynamics simulations, develop electronic structure models that are consistent with the observations, and discuss the results in the context of ab initio theoretical calculations.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a flexible and graphically intuitive framework that constructs complex quantum error correction codes from simple codes or states, generalizing code concatenation. More specifically, we represent the complex code constructions as tensor networks built from the tensors of simple codes or states in a modular fashion. Using a set of local moves known as operator pushing, one can derive properties of the more complex codes, such as transversal non-Clifford gates, by tracing the flow of operators in the network. The framework endows a network geometry to any code it builds and is valid for constructing stabilizer codes as well as non-stabilizer codes over qubits and qudits. For a contractible tensor network, the sequence of contractions also constructs a decoding/encoding circuit. To highlight the framework's range of capabilities and to provide a tutorial, we lay out some examples where we glue together simple stabilizer codes to construct non-trivial codes. These examples include the toric code and its variants, a holographic code with transversal non-Clifford operators, a 3d stabilizer code, and other stabilizer codes with interesting properties. Surprisingly, we find that the surface code is equivalent to the 2d Bacon-Shor code after\"dualizing\"its tensor network encoding map.",

Unfortunately, the source is vulnerable to light-injection attacks, such as Trojan-horse, laser-seeding, and laser-damage attacks, in which an eavesdropper actively injects bright light to hack the source unit. The hacking laser could be a high-power one that can modify properties of components via the laser-damage attack and also further help the Trojan-horse and other light-injection attacks. Here we propose a countermeasure against the light-injection attacks, consisting of an additional sacrificial component placed at the exit of the source. This component should either withstand high-power incoming light while attenuating it to a safe level that cannot modify the rest of the source, or get destroyed into a permanent high-attenuation state that breaks up the line. We demonstrate experimentally that off-the-shelf fiber-optic isolators and circulators have these desired properties, at least under attack by a continuous-wave high-power laser.",

Entanglement between separated quantum processing nodes has been achieved on several experimental platforms in the past decade. To move towards metropolitan-scale quantum network test beds, the creation and transmission of indistinguishable single photons over existing telecom infrastructure is key. Here we report the interference of photons emitted by remote, spectrally detuned NV center-based network nodes, using quantum frequency conversion to the telecom L-band. We find a visibility of 0.79$\\pm$0.03 and an indistinguishability between converted NV photons around 0.9 over the full range of the emission duration, confirming the removal of the spectral information present. Our approach implements fully separated and independent control over the nodes, time-multiplexing of control and quantum signals, and active feedback to stabilize the output frequency. Our results demonstrate a working principle that can be readily employed on other platforms and shows a clear path towards generating metropolitan scale, solid-state entanglement over deployed telecom fibers.",

We argue that either the QCA is nontrivial, i.e. , not a ﬁnite-depth circuit of local quantum gates, or there exists a two-dimensional commuting projector Hamiltonian realizing the chiral semion topological order (characterized by U (1) 2 Chern-Simons theory). Our QCA is obtained by ﬁrst constructing the Walker-Wang Hamiltonian of a certain premodular tensor category of order four, then condensing the deconﬁned bulk boson at the level of lattice operators. We show that the resulting Hamiltonian hosts chiral semion surface topological order in the presence of a boundary and can be realized as a non-Pauli stabilizer code on qubits, from which the QCA is deﬁned. The construction is then generalized to a class of QCAs deﬁned by non-Pauli stabilizer codes on 2 n -dimensional qudits that feature surface anyons described by U (1) 2 n Chern-Simons theory. Our results support the conjecture that the group of nontrivial three-dimensional QCAs is isomorphic to the Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion categories.",

This isolation, however, is a mixed blessing, limiting the ability of these ensembles to interface with other quantum systems coherently. Here we show that spin-exchange collisions with alkali-metal atoms render a quantum interface for noble-gas spins without impeding their long coherence times. We formulate the many-body theory of the hybrid system and reveal a collective mechanism that strongly couples the macroscopic quantum states of the two spin ensembles. Despite their stochastic and random nature, weak collisions enable entanglement and reversible exchange of nonclassical excitations in an efficient, controllable, and deterministic process. With recent experiments now entering the strong-coupling regime, this interface paves the way towards realizing hour-long quantum memories and entanglement at room-temperature.",

    "abstract": "Disorder-free localization is a recently discovered phenomenon of nonergodicity that can emerge in quantum many-body systems hosting gauge symmetries when the initial state is prepared in a superposition of gauge superselection sectors. Thermalization is then prevented up to all accessible evolution times despite the model being nonintegrable and translation-invariant. In a recent work [Halimeh, Zhao, Hauke, and Knolle, arXiv:2111.02427], it has been shown that terms linear in the gauge-symmetry generator stabilize disorder-free localization in U(1) gauge theories against gauge errors that couple diﬀerent superselection sectors. Here, we show in the case of Z 2 gauge theories that disorder-free localization can not only be stabilized, but also enhanced by the addition of translation-invariant terms linear in a local Z 2 pseudogenerator that acts identically to the full generator in a single superselection sector, but not necessarily outside of it. We show analytically and numerically how this leads through the quantum Zeno eﬀect to the dynamical emergence of a renormalized gauge theory with an enhanced local symmetry, which contains the Z 2 gauge symmetry of the ideal model, associated with the Z 2 pseudogenerator. The resulting proliferation of superselection sectors due to this dynamically emergent gauge theory creates an eﬀective disorder greater than that in the original model, thereby enhancing disorder-free localization. We demonstrate the experimental feasibility of the Z 2 pseudogenerator by providing a detailed readily implementable experimental proposal for the observation of disorder-free localization in a Rydberg setup.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous ideal quantum measurements of multiple single-photon-level signals would advance applications in quantum information processing, metrology, and astronomy, but require the ﬁrst ampliﬁer to be simultaneously broadband, quantum limited, and directional. However, conventional traveling-wave parametric ampliﬁers support broadband ampliﬁcation at the cost of increased added noise and are not genuinely directional due to non-negligible nonlinear backward wave generation. In this work, we introduce a new class of ampliﬁers which encode the information in the Floquet modes of the system. Such Floquet mode ampliﬁers prevent information leakage and overcome the trade-oﬀ between quantum eﬃciency (QE) and bandwidth. Crucially, Floquet mode ampliﬁers strongly suppress the nonlinear forward-backward wave coupling and are therefore genuinely directional and readily integrable with qubits, clearing another major obstacle towards broadband ideal quantum measurements. Furthermore, Floquet mode ampliﬁers are insensitive to out-of-band impedance mismatch, which otherwise may lead to gain ripples, parametric oscillations, and instability in conventional traveling-wave parametric ampliﬁers. Finally, we show that a Floquet mode Josephson traveling-wave parametric ampliﬁer implementation can simultaneously achieve > 20 dB gain and a QE of η/η ideal > 99 . 9% of the quantum limit over more than an octave of bandwidth. The proposed Floquet scheme is also widely applicable to other platforms, such as kinetic inductance traveling-wave ampliﬁers and optical parametric ampliﬁers.",

If a large capacitor shunts the ends of the array, the circuit forms a protected qubit because its degenerate ground states are robust to offset charge and magnetic field fluctuations for a sizable window around zero offset charge and half flux quantum.

The parity-switching rate exhibits a qubit-state-dependent peak in the flux dependence, indicating a cold distribution of excess QPs which are predominantly trapped in the low-gap film of the device. Moreover, we find that the photon-assisted process contributes significantly to both parity switching and the generation of excess QPs by fitting to a model that self-consistently incorporates photon-assisted parity switching as well as inter-film QP dynamics.",

However, detailed microscopic mechanisms are often obscure, and unconventional spaces are generally challenging to construct in solids. Highly controllable atomic systems can quantum simulate such physics, even those inaccessible in other platforms. Here, we realize a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) on a synthetic cylindrical surface subject to a net radial synthetic magnetic flux. We observe a symmetry-protected topological band structure emerging on this Hall cylinder but disappearing in the planar counterpart. BEC's transport observed as Bloch oscillations in the band structure is analogous to traveling on a M\\\"obius strip in the momentum space, revealing topological band crossings protected by a nonsymmorphic symmetry. We demonstrate that breaking this symmetry induces a topological transition manifested as gap opening at band crossings, and further manipulate the band structure and BEC's transport by controlling the axial synthetic magnetic flux. Our work opens the door for using atomic quantum simulators to explore intriguing topological phenomena intrinsic in unconventional spaces.",

In this work, we investigate quantum advantages for discrimination tasks over noncontextual theories by considering a maximum conﬁdence measurement that uniﬁes diﬀerent strategies of quantum state discrimination, including minimum-error and unambiguous discrimination. We ﬁrst show that maximum conﬁdence discrimination, as well as unambiguous discrimination, contains contextual advantages. We then consider a semi-device independent scenario of certifying maximum conﬁdence measurement. The scenario naturally contains undetected events, making it a natural setting to explore maximum conﬁdence measurements. We show that the certiﬁed maximum conﬁdence in quantum theory also contains contextual advantages. Our results establish how the advantages of quantum theory over a classical model may appear in a realistic scenario of a discrimination task.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a cavity-based solution to scale up experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices by an order of magnitude over state-of-the-art free space lattices. Our two-dimensional optical lattices are created by power enhancement cavities with large mode waists of 489(8) µ m and allow us to trap ultracold strontium atoms at a lattice depth of 60 µ K by using only 80 mW of input light per cavity axis. We characterize these lattices using high-resolution clock spectroscopy and resolve carrier transitions between diﬀerent vibrational levels. With these spectral features, we locally measure the lattice potential envelope and the sample temperature with a spatial resolution limited only by the optical resolution of the imaging system. The measured ground-band and trap lifetimes are 18(3) s and 59(2) s , respectively, and the lattice frequency (depth) is long-term stable on the MHz (0.1%) level. Our results show that large, deep, and stable two-dimensional cavity-enhanced lattices can be created at any wavelength and can be used to scale up neutral-atom-based quantum simulators, quantum computers, sensors, and optical lattice clocks. Core refers to the core polarizability. The uncertainties for individual polarizability contributions result from propagat-ing uncertainties in the matrix elements [84] and lead to the quoted uncertainty for the total polarizability.",

    "abstract": "We propose an implementation of a two-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory model on a shallow quantum circuit, involving a number of single and two-qubits gates comparable to what can be achieved with present-day and near-future technologies. The ground state preparation is numerically analyzed on a small lattice with a variational quantum algorithm, which requires a small number of parameters to reach high fidelities and can be efficiently scaled up on larger systems. Despite the reduced size of the lattice we consider, a transition between confined and deconfined regimes can be detected by measuring expectation values of Wilson loop operators or the topological entropy. Moreover, if periodic boundary conditions are implemented, the same optimal solution is transferable among all four different topological sectors, without any need for further optimization on the variational parameters. Our work shows that variational quantum algorithms provide a useful technique to be added in the growing toolbox for digital simulations of lattice gauge theories.",

    "abstract": "Continuous-variable quantum key distribution exploits coherent measurements of the electromagnetic field, i.e., homodyne or heterodyne detection. The most advanced security proofs developed so far relied on idealised mathematical models for such measurements, which assume that the measurement outcomes are continuous and unbounded variables. As physical measurement devices have finite range and precision, these mathematical models only serve as an approximation. It is expected that, under suitable conditions, the predictions obtained using these simplified models are in good agreement with the actual experimental implementations. However, a quantitative analysis of the error introduced by this approximation, and of its impact on composable security, have been lacking so far. Here we present a theory to rigorously account for the experimental limitations of realistic heterodyne detection. We focus on collective attacks, and present security proofs for the asymptotic and finite-size regimes, the latter within the framework of composable security. In doing this, we establish for the first time the composable security of discrete-modulation continuous-variable quantum key distribution in the finite-size regime. Tight bounds on the key rates are obtained through semi-definite programming and do not rely on a truncation of the Hilbert space.",

    "abstract": "Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are specialized hardware accelerators developed by Google to support large-scale machine-learning tasks, but they can also be leveraged to accelerate and scale other linear-algebra-intensive computations. In this paper we demonstrate the usage of TPUs for massively parallel, classical simulations of quantum many-body dynamics on long timescales. We apply our methods to study the phenomenon of Floquet prethermalization, i.e., exponentially slow heating in quantum spin chains subject to high-frequency periodic driving. We simulate the dynamics of L=34 qubits for over $10^5$ Floquet periods, corresponding to circuits with millions of two-qubit gates. The circuits simulated have no additional symmetries and represent a pure-state evolution in the full $2^L$-dimensional Hilbert space. This is achieved by distributing the computation over 128 TPU cores. On that size TPU cluster, we find speedups in wall-clock runtime of 230x and 15x when compared to reference CPU and single-GPU simulations, respectively, for shorter 30-qubit simulations that can be handled by all three platforms. We study the computational cost of the simulations, as a function of both the number of qubits and the number of TPU cores used, up to our maximum capacity of L=40 qubits, which requires a ``full pod\"of 2048 TPU cores with tens of terabytes of memory in total. For these simulations, an 8-TPU-core machine is comparable to a single A100 GPU, and thus the full TPU pod is comparable to a machine with hundreds of GPUs. However, the TPU pod is more energy and cost efficient, and readily accessible (via Google Cloud), unlike such large many-GPU configurations. We also study the accumulation of numerical error as a function of circuit depth in very deep circuits. Our work demonstrates that TPUs can offer significant advantages for state-of-the-art simulations of quantum many-body dynamics.",

All basic operations, including initialization, quantum logic operations, and readout, are performed with high fidelity. Selective two-qubit and single-qubit gates, implemented using a narrow linewidth laser, comprise a universal gate set, allowing realization of any unitary on the quantum register.

In this context, we establish an experimentally realizable map between the hybrid system and a qubit coupled to thermal harmonic environments of arbitrary complexity that enables the analog quantum simulation of open quantum systems. We assess the utility of the simulator by numerically exact emulations that indicate that the experimental setup can faithfully mimic the intended target even in the presence of its natural inherent noise. We further provide a detailed analysis of the physical requirements on the quantum dots and the RLC circuits needed to experimentally realize this proposal that indicates that the simulator can be created with existing technology. The approach can exactly capture the eﬀects of highly structured non-Markovian quantum environments typical of photosynthesis and chemical dynamics, and oﬀer clear potential advantages over conventional and even quantum computation.

In aluminum films, their thickness modulates the gap; therefore, standard fabrication of Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junctions, which relies on overlapping a thicker film on top of a thinner one, always results in gap-engineered devices. Here we reconsider quasiparticle effects in superconducting qubits to explicitly account for the unavoidable asymmetry in the gap on the two sides of a Josephson junction. We find that different regimes can be encountered in which the quasiparticles have either similar densities in the two junction leads, or are largely confined to the lower-gap lead. Qualitatively, for similar densities the qubit's excited state population is lower but its relaxation rate higher than when the quasiparticles are confined; therefore, there is a potential trade-off between two desirable properties in a qubit.",

    "abstract": "Drawing independent samples from high-dimensional probability distributions represents the major computational bottleneck for modern algorithms, including powerful machine learning frameworks such as deep learning. The quest for discovering larger families of distributions for which sampling can be efficiently realized has inspired an exploration beyond established computing methods and turning to novel physical devices that leverage the principles of quantum computation. Quantum annealing embodies a promising computational paradigm that is intimately related to the complexity of energy landscapes in Gibbs distributions, which relate the probabilities of system states to the energies of these states. Here, we study the sampling properties of physical realizations of quantum annealers which are implemented through programmable lattices of superconducting flux qubits. Comprehensive statistical analysis of the data produced by these quantum machines shows that quantum annealers behave as samplers that generate independent configurations from low-temperature noisy Gibbs distributions. We show that the structure of the output distribution probes the intrinsic physical properties of the quantum device such as effective temperature of individual qubits and magnitude of local qubit noise, which result in a non-linear response function and spurious interactions that are absent in the hardware implementation. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in characterization of future generations of quantum annealers and other emerging analog computing devices.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction and symmetries play central roles in quantum information science and physics. It is known that quantum error-correcting codes that obey (are covariant with respect to) continuous symmetries in a certain sense cannot correct erasure errors perfectly (a well-known result in this regard being the Eastin–Knill theorem in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computing), in contrast to the case without symmetry constraints. Furthermore, several quantitative fundamental limits on the accuracy of such covariant codes for approximate quantum error correction are known. Here, we consider the quantum error correction capability of uniformly random covariant codes. In particular, we analytically study the most essential cases of U (1) and SU ( d ) symmetries, and show that for both symmetry groups the error of the covariant codes generated by Haar-random symmetric unitaries, i.e., unitaries that commute with the group actions, typically scale as O ( n − 1 ) in terms of both the average- and worst-case puriﬁed distances against erasure noise, saturating the fundamental limits to leading order. We note that the results hold for symmetric variants of unitary 2-designs, and comment on the convergence problem of symmetric random circuits. Our results not only indicate (potentially eﬃcient) randomized constructions of optimal U (1)- and SU ( d )-covariant codes, but also reveal fundamental properties of random symmetric unitaries, which yield important solvable models of complex quantum systems (including black holes and many-body spin systems) that have attracted great recent interest in quantum gravity and condensed matter physics. We expect our construction and analysis to ﬁnd broad relevance in both physics and quantum computing.",

We show that a naive generalization of the corresponding spin-1/2 quantum East model does not posses analogous slow dynamical properties. In particular, conversely to the spin case, the bosonic ground state turns out to be not localized. We restore localization by introducing a repulsive interaction term. The bosonic nature of the model allows us to construct rich families of many-body localized states, including coherent, squeezed and cat states. We formalize this finding by introducing a set of superbosonic creation-annihilation operators which satisfy the bosonic commutation relations and, when acting on the vacuum, create excitations exponentially localized around a certain site of the lattice. Given the constrained nature of the model, these states retain memory of their initial conditions for long times. Even in the presence of dissipation, we show that quantum information remains localized within decoherence times tunable with the parameters of the system. We propose an implementation of the bosonic quantum East model based on state-of-the-art superconducting circuits, which could be used in the near future to explore dynamical properties of kinetically constrained models in modern platforms.",

It is not only important for understanding a range of effective one-dimensional condensed matter realizations, but also shares some of the non-perturbative physics with quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which makes it a prime target for current quantum simulation efforts. In analogy with QCD, the confinement-induced two-particle boundstates that appear in these models are dubbed mesons. Here, we study scattering events due to meson collisions in a quantum spin chain with long-range interactions such that two mesons have an extended interaction. We show how novel hadronic boundstates, e.g. with four constituent particles akin to tetraquarks, may form dynamically in fusion events. In a natural collision their signal is weak as elastic meson scattering dominates. However, we propose two controllable protocols which allow for a clear observation of dynamical hadron formation. We discuss how this physics can be simulated in trapped ion or Rydberg atom set-ups.",

    "abstract": "We present two classical algorithms for the simulation of universal quantum circuits on $n$ qubits constructed from $c$ instances of Clifford gates and $t$ arbitrary-angle $Z$-rotation gates such as $T$ gates. Our algorithms complement each other by performing best in different parameter regimes. The $\\tt{Estimate}$ algorithm produces an additive precision estimate of the Born rule probability of a chosen measurement outcome with the only source of run-time inefficiency being a linear dependence on the stabilizer extent (which scales like $\\approx 1.17^t$ for $T$ gates). Our algorithm is state-of-the-art for this task: as an example, in approximately $13$ hours (on a standard desktop computer), we estimated the Born rule probability to within an additive error of $0.03$, for a $50$-qubit, $60$ non-Clifford gate quantum circuit with more than $2000$ Clifford gates. Our second algorithm, $\\tt{Compute}$, calculates the probability of a chosen measurement outcome to machine precision with run-time $O(2^{t-r} t)$ where $r$ is an efficiently computable, circuit-specific quantity. With high probability, $r$ is very close to $\\min \\{t, n-w\\}$ for random circuits with many Clifford gates, where $w$ is the number of measured qubits. $\\tt{Compute}$ can be effective in surprisingly challenging parameter regimes, e.g., we can randomly sample Clifford+$T$ circuits with $n=55$, $w=5$, $c=10^5$ and $t=80$ $T$ gates, and then compute the Born rule probability with a run-time consistently less than $10$ minutes using a single core of a standard desktop computer. We provide a C+Python implementation of our algorithms and benchmark them using random circuits, the hidden shift algorithm and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).",

    "abstract": "Current superconducting quantum processors require strategies for coping with material defects and imperfect parameter targeting in order to scale up while maintaining high performance. To that end, in-situ control of qubit frequencies with magnetic flux can be used to avoid spurious resonances. However, increased dephasing due to 1/f flux noise limits performance at all of these operating points except for noise-protected sweet spots, which are sparse under DC flux bias and monochromatic flux modulation. Here we experimentally demonstrate that two-tone flux modulation can be used to create a continuum of dynamical sweet spots, greatly expanding the range of qubit frequencies achievable while first-order insensitive to slow flux noise. To illustrate some advantages of this flexibility, we use bichromatic flux control to reduce the error rates and gate times of parametric entangling operations between transmons. Independent of gate scheme, the ability to use flux control to freely select qubit frequencies while maintaining qubit coherence represents an important step forward in the robustness and scalability of near-term superconducting qubit devices.",

Here, we exploit the control on the effective open spin qutrit dynamics of an NV center, to experimentally realize an autonomous feedback process (Maxwell demon) with tunable dissipative strength. The feedback is enabled by random measurement events that condition the subsequent dissipative evolution of the qutrit. The efficacy of the autonomous Maxwell demon is quantified by experimentally characterizing the fluctuations of the energy exchanged by the system with the environment by means of a generalized Sagawa-Ueda-Tasaki relation for dissipative dynamics. This opens the way to the implementation of a new class of Maxwell demons, which could be useful for quantum sensing and quantum thermodynamic devices.",

    "abstract": "Linear optical quantum computing is beset by the lack of deterministic entangling operations besides photon loss. Motivated by advancements at the experimental front in deterministic generation of various kinds of multiphoton entangled states, we propose an architecture for linear-optical quantum computing that harnesses the availability of three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Our architecture and its subvariants use polarized photons in GHZ states, polarization beam splitters, delay lines, optical switches and on-off detectors. We concatenate topological quantum error correction code with three-qubit repetition codes and estimate that our architecture can tolerate remarkably high photon-loss rate of $11.5 \\%$; this makes a drastic change that is at least an order higher than those of known proposals. Further, considering three-photon GHZ states as resources, we estimate the resource overheads to perform gate operations with an accuracy of $10^{-6}~(10^{-15})$ to be $2.0\\times10^6~(5.6\\times10^7)$. Compared to other all-photonic schemes, our architecture is also resource-efficient. In addition, the resource overhead can be even further improved if larger GHZ states are available. Given its striking enhancement in the photon loss threshold and the recent progress in generating multiphoton entanglement, our scheme will make scalable photonic quantum computing a step closer to reality.",

The suggested setup relies on Rydberg atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, where excitations hop through the lattice by dipolar exchange interactions and can be interpreted as hard-core bosons. The quantum many-body Hamiltonian is studied within exact diagonalization and the density-matrix renormalization group. We identify experimentally accessible parameters where all signatures indicate the appearance of a fractional state with the same topological properties as the ν=1/2 bosonic Laughlin state. We demonstrate an adiabatic ramping procedure, which allows for the preparation of the topological state in a finite system, and demonstrate an experimentally accessible smoking-gun signature for the fractional excitations.1 MoreReceived 2 February 2022Accepted 2 June 2022Corrected 23 September 2022DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.030302Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Precise temperature measurements on systems of few ultracold atoms is of paramount importance in quantum technology, but can be very resource-intensive. Here, we put forward an adaptive Bayesian framework that substantially boosts the performance of cold atom temperature estimation. Speciﬁcally, we process data from release–recapture thermometry experiments on few potassium atoms cooled down to the microkelvin range in an optical tweezer. We demonstrate that adaptively choosing the release–recapture times to maximise information gain does substantially reduce the number of measurements needed for the estimate to converge to a ﬁnal reading. Unlike conventional methods, our proposal systematically avoids capturing and processing uninformative measurements. Furthermore, we are able to produce much more reliable estimates, especially when the measured data are scarce and noisy. Likewise, the resulting estimates converge faster to the real temperature in the asymptotic limit. Our method can be adapted to enhance the precision and resource-efﬁciency of many other techniques running on different experimental setups, thus opening new avenues in quantum thermometry.",

In addition, we construct a family of hybrid color-toric codes by morphing the color code. Our code family inherits the fault-tolerant gates of the original color code, implemented via constant-depth local unitaries. As a special case of this construction, we obtain toric codes with fault-tolerant multi-qubit control-$Z$ gates. We also provide an efficient decoding algorithm for hybrid color-toric codes in two dimensions, and numerically benchmark its performance for phase-flip noise. We expect that morphing may also be a useful technique for modifying other code families such as triorthogonal codes.",

This model contains both confinement and deconfinement phases, whose phase diagram is controlled by the mass of the matter field and the topological angle. Since varying the mass of matter field is straightforward experimentally, we propose how to tune the topological angle, allowing accessing the entire phase diagram. We propose that direct experimental evidence of confinement and deconfinement can be obtained by measuring whether a physical charge is localized around a fixed gauge charge to screen it. We also discuss the PXP model realized in the Rydberg atoms array, which is equivalent to the lattice Schwinger model when all local gauge charges are fixed as zero. Although the gauge charges are fixed, we can alternatively probe the confinement and the deconfinement in the PXP model by studying the relative motion of a pair of a physical charge and an anti-charge. Our scheme can be directly implemented in these two relevant experimental platforms of ultracold atom quantum simulators.",

This motivates the design of practical decoders that minimise the resource cost of color-code quantum computation. Here we propose a decoder for the planar color code with a triangular boundary where we match syndrome defects on a nontrivial manifold that has the topology of a M\\\"{o}bius strip. A basic implementation of our decoder used on the color code with hexagonal lattice geometry demonstrates a logical failure rate that is competitive with the optimal performance of the surface code, $\\sim p^{\\alpha \\sqrt{n}}$, with $\\alpha \\approx 6 / 7 \\sqrt{3} \\approx 0.5$, error rate $p$, and $n$ the code length. Furthermore, by exhaustively testing over five billion error configurations, we find that a modification of our decoder that manually compares inequivalent recovery operators can correct all errors of weight $\\le (d-1) /2$ for codes with distance $d \\le 13$. Our decoder is derived using relations among the stabilizers that preserve global conservation laws at the lattice boundary. We present generalisations of our method to depolarising noise and fault-tolerant error correction, as well as to Majorana surface codes, higher-dimensional color codes and single-shot error correction.",

Our approach starts with a holographic technique to prepare a compressed approximation to electronic mean-field ground-states, known as fermionic Gaussian matrix product states (GMPS), with a polynomial reduction in qubit- and (in select cases gate-) resources compared to existing techniques. Correlations are then introduced by augmenting the GMPS circuits in a variational technique which we denote GMPS+X. We demonstrate this approach on Quantinuum's System Model H1 trapped-ion quantum processor for 1$d$ models of correlated metal and Mott insulating states. Focusing on the $1d$ Fermi-Hubbard chain as a benchmark, we show that GMPS+X methods faithfully capture the physics of correlated electron states, including Mott insulators and correlated Luttinger liquid metals, using considerably fewer parameters than problem-agnostic variational circuits.",

For example, atoms in multimode cavity QED systems provide an exciting platform to study many-body phenomena in regimes where the atoms are strongly coupled amongst themselves and with the cavity, but the strong coupling makes it complicated to infer the conditioned state of the atoms from the output light. In this work we address this problem, describing the reduced atomic state via a conditioned hierarchy of equations of motion, which provides an exact conditioned reduced description under monitoring (and continuous feedback). We utilise this formalism to study how different monitoring for modes of a multimode cavity affects our information gain for an atomic state, and to improve spin squeezing via measurement and feedback in a strong coupling regime. This work opens opportunities to understand continuous monitoring of non-Markovian open quantum systems, both on a practical and fundamental level.",

We present a dissipative\"spin amplification\"protocol that allows one to dramatically improve the sensitivity of such schemes, even in the presence of realistic intrinsic dissipation and noise. Our method is based on exploiting collective (i.e., superradiant) spin decay, an effect that is usually seen as a nuisance because it limits spin-squeezing protocols. We show that our approach can allow a system with a highly imperfect spin readout to approach SQL-like scaling in $N$ within a factor of two, without needing to change the actual readout mechanism. Our ideas are compatible with several state-of-the-art experimental platforms where an ensemble of solid-state spins (NV centers, SiV centers) is coupled to a common microwave or mechanical mode.",

However, many protected superconducting qubits exhibit relatively low transition frequencies, which could make their integration with conventional transmon circuits challenging. In this work, we propose and study a scheme for entangling a tunable transmon with a Cooper-pair parity-protected qubit, a paradigmatic example of a low-frequency protected qubit that stores quantum information in opposite Cooper-pair parity states on a superconducting island. By tuning the external flux on the transmon, we show that non-computational states can mediate a two-qubit entangling gate that preserves the Cooper-pair parity independent of the detailed pulse sequence. Interestingly, the entangling gate bears similarities to a controlled-phase gate in conventional transmon devices. Hence, our results suggest that standard high-precision gate calibration protocols could be repurposed for operating hybrid qubit devices.",

Applying the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), the constraints can either be enforced explicitly, by energy penalties, or implicitly, by restricting the dynamics to the low-energy subspace via the driver Hamiltonian. While the explicit approach allows for parallelization with a system-size-independent circuit depth, the implicit approach shows better QAOA performance. Here we combine the two approaches in order to improve the QAOA performance while keeping the circuit parallelizable.

    "abstract": "The goal of digital quantum simulation is to approximate the dynamics of a given target Hamiltonian via a sequence of quantum gates, a procedure known as Trotterization. The quality of this approximation can be controlled by the so called Trotter step, that governs the number of required quantum gates per unit simulation time. The stroboscopic dynamics generated by Trotterization is eﬀectively described by a time-independent Hamiltonian, referred to as the Floquet Hamiltonian. In this work, we propose Floquet Hamiltonian learning to reconstruct the experimentally realized Floquet Hamiltonian order-by-order in the Trotter step. This procedure is eﬃcient, i.e., it requires a number of measurements that scales polynomially in the system size, and can be readily implemented in state-of-the-art experiments. With numerical examples, we propose several applications of our method in the context of veriﬁcation of quantum devices: from the characterization of the distinct sources of errors in digital quantum simulators to determining the optimal operating regime of the device. We show that our protocol provides the basis for feedback-loop design and calibration of new types of quantum gates. Furthermore it can be extended to the case of non-unitary dynamics and used to learn Floquet Liouvillians, thereby oﬀering a way of characterizing the dissipative processes present in NISQ quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "Implementing time evolution operators on quantum circuits is important for quantum simulation. However, the standard way, Trotterization, requires a huge numbers of gates to achieve desirable accuracy. Here, we propose a local variational quantum compilation (LVQC) algorithm, which allows to accurately and efficiently compile a time evolution operators on a large-scale quantum system by the optimization with smaller-size quantum systems. LVQC utilizes a subsystem cost function, which approximates the fidelity of the whole circuit, defined for each subsystem as large as approximate causal cones brought by the Lieb-Robinson (LR) bound. We rigorously derive its scaling property with respect to the subsystem size, and show that the optimization conducted on the subsystem size leads to the compilation of whole-system time evolution operators. As a result, LVQC runs with limited-size quantum computers or classical simulators that can handle such smaller quantum systems. For instance, finite-ranged and short-ranged interacting $L$-size systems can be compiled with $O(L^0)$- or $O(\\log L)$-size quantum systems depending on observables of interest. Furthermore, since this formalism relies only on the LR bound, it can efficiently construct time evolution operators of various systems in generic dimension involving finite-, short-, and long-ranged interactions. We also numerically demonstrate the LVQC algorithm for one-dimensional systems. Employing classical simulation by time-evolving block decimation, we succeed in compressing the depth of a time evolution operators up to $40$ qubits by the compilation for $20$ qubits. LVQC not only provides classical protocols for designing large-scale quantum circuits, but also will shed light on applications of intermediate-scale quantum devices in implementing algorithms in larger-scale quantum devices.",

In this paper, we propose a novel protocol based on $2^m$-dimensional time-bin photonic qudits that allow for the simultaneous generation of multiple ($m$) entangled pairs between two distributed qubit registers and outline a specific implementation of the protocol based on cavity-mediated spin-photon interactions. By adopting the qudit protocol, the required qubit memory time is independent of the transmission loss between the nodes in contrast to standard qubit approaches.

This motivates the development of efficient approaches to facilitate the control of such systems and enable the preparation of non-trivial quantum states. Here we formulate an approach to control quantum systems based on matrix product states~(MPS). We compare counter-diabatic and leakage minimization approaches to the so-called local steering problem, that consists in finding the best value of the control parameters for generating a unitary evolution of the specific MPS state in a given direction. In order to benchmark the different approaches, we apply them to the generalization of the PXP model known to exhibit coherent quantum dynamics due to quantum many-body scars. We find that the leakage-based approach generally outperforms the counter-diabatic framework and use it to construct a Floquet model with quantum scars. We perform the first steps towards global trajectory optimization and demonstrate entanglement steering capabilities in the generalized PXP model. Finally we apply our leakage minimization approach to construct quantum scars in the periodically driven non-integrable Ising model.",

    "abstract": "Finding the ground-state energy of electrons subject to an external electric field is a fundamental problem in computational chemistry. While the theory of QMA-completeness has been instrumental in understanding the complexity of finding ground states in many-body quantum systems, prior to this work it has been unknown whether or not the special form of the Hamiltonian for the electronic structure of molecules can be exploited to find ground states efficiently or whether the problem remains hard for this special case. We prove that the electronic-structure problem, when restricted to a fixed single-particle basis and a fixed number of electrons, is QMA-complete. In our proof, the local Hamiltonian is encoded in the choice of spatial orbitals used to discretize the electronic-structure Hamiltonian. In contrast, Schuch and Verstraete have proved hardness for the electronic-structure problem with an additional site-specific external magnetic field, but without the restriction to a fixed basis, by encoding a local Hamiltonian on qubits in the site-specific magnetic field. We also show that estimation of the energy of the lowest-energy Slater-determinant state (i.e., the Hartree-Fock state) is nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-complete for the electronic-structure Hamiltonian in a fixed basis.Received 5 October 2021Revised 18 January 2022Accepted 14 March 2022DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.020322Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "We study the real-time dynamics of a small bubble of \"false vacuum\" in a 1+1-dimensional quantum spin chain. Such a bubble can also be thought of as a well-separated, but confined, kink-antikink pair. We construct initial bubbles as infinite Matrix Product States via a quasiparticle wavepacket ansatz and approximately simulate their (unitary) time evolution, analyzing the outcomes of the resulting kink-antikink collisions. In the transverse-field Ising chain with a longitudinal field, we do not observe particle production, despite the nonintegrability of the model, supporting recent observations of nonthermalizing mesonic states with the same model. After adding extra terms to the Hamiltonian, however, we are able to observe production of both confined and unconfined particle pairs. We find the methods used are adequate for simulating low-energy events, in which few particles are produced. However, our observation of entanglement growth with energy and with the number of collisions suggests that accurate simulations at higher energies will ultimately exhaust our methods. Quantum devices, in contrast, are not limited by entanglement production, and promise to allow us to go far beyond classical methods. We consider simulations of false-vacuum dynamics to be exciting applications for both analog and digital quantum simulation.",

    "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method in data analysis that involves diagonalizing the covariance matrix of the dataset. Recently, quantum algorithms have been formulated for PCA based on diagonalizing a density matrix. These algorithms assume that the covariance matrix can be encoded in a density matrix, but a concrete protocol for this encoding has been lacking. Our work aims to address this gap. Assuming amplitude encoding of the data, with the data given by the ensemble {pi,|ψi⟩}, then one can easily prepare the ensemble average density matrix ρ¯=∑ipi|ψi⟩⟨ψi|. We first show that ρ¯ is precisely the covariance matrix whenever the dataset is centered. For quantum datasets, we exploit global phase symmetry to argue that there always exists a centered dataset consistent with ρ¯, and hence ρ¯ can always be interpreted as a covariance matrix. This provides a simple means for preparing the covariance matrix for arbitrary quantum datasets or centered classical datasets. For uncentered classical datasets, our method is so-called \"PCA without centering,\" which we interpret as PCA on a symmetrized dataset. We argue that this closely corresponds to standard PCA, and we derive equations and inequalities that bound the deviation of the spectrum obtained with our method from that of standard PCA. We numerically illustrate our method for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten digit dataset. We also argue that PCA on quantum datasets is natural and meaningful, and we numerically implement our method for molecular ground-state datasets.1 MoreReceived 14 April 2022Revised 5 July 2022Accepted 16 August 2022DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.030334Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "While quantum circuits built from two-particle dual-unitary (maximally entangled) operators serve as minimal models of typically nonintegrable many-body systems, the construction and characterization of dual-unitary operators themselves are only partially understood. A nonlinear map on the space of unitary operators was proposed in PRL.~125, 070501 (2020) that results in operators being arbitrarily close to dual unitaries. Here we study the map analytically for the two-qubit case describing the basins of attraction, fixed points, and rates of approach to dual unitaries. A subset of dual-unitary operators having maximum entangling power are 2-unitary operators or perfect tensors, and are equivalent to four-party absolutely maximally entangled states. It is known that they only exist if the local dimension is larger than $d=2$. We use the nonlinear map, and introduce stochastic variants of it, to construct explicit examples of new dual and 2-unitary operators. A necessary criterion for their local unitary equivalence to distinguish classes is also introduced and used to display various concrete results and a conjecture in $d=3$. It is known that orthogonal Latin squares provide a ``classical combinatorial design\"for constructing permutations that are 2-unitary. We extend the underlying design from classical to genuine quantum ones for general dual-unitary operators and give an example of what might be the smallest sized genuinely quantum design of a 2-unitary in $d=4$.",

This hierarchy not only provides a sequence of certified bounds for the rank-constrained optimization problem, but also gives pretty good and often exact values in practice when the lowest level of the hierarchy is considered. We demonstrate that our approach can be used for relevant problems in quantum information processing, such as the optimization over pure states, the characterization of mixed unitary channels and faithful entanglement, and quantum contextuality, as well as in classical information theory including the maximum cut problem, pseudo-Boolean optimization, and the orthonormal representation of graphs.

The negative result measurements (NRM) are implemented in order to validate the presumption of non-invasive measurability used in defining macrorealism. Among all the experiments to date testing macrorealism, the present experiment stands out in comprehensively addressing the relevant loopholes. The clumsiness loophole is addressed through precision testing of any classical invasiveness involved in the implementation of NRMs. This is done by suitably choosing the experimental parameters so that the quantum mechanically (QM) predicted validity of all the relevant two-time no-signalling in time (NSIT) conditions is maintained in all the three pairwise experiments performed to show LGI/WLGI violation. Further, importantly, the detection efficiency loophole is addressed by adopting suitable modifications in the measurement strategy enabling the demonstration of the violation of LGI/WLGI for any non-zero detection efficiency. We also show how other relevant loopholes like the multiphoton emission loophole, coincidence loophole, and the preparation state loophole are all closed in the present experiment. We report the LGI violation of $1.32 \\pm 0.04$ and the WLGI violation of $0.10 \\pm 0.02$, where the magnitudes of violation are respectively 8 times and 5 times the corresponding error values, while agreeing perfectly with the ranges of the QM predicted values of the LGI, WLGI expressions that we estimate by taking into account the non-idealities of the actual experiment. Simultaneously, the experimentally observed probabilities satisfy all the two-time NSIT conditions up to the order of $10^{-2}$, which ensures non-invasiveness in the implemented NRMs.",

A broad class of bosonic codes, namely rotation-symmetric codes, can be characterized by their phase-space rotation symmetry. However, their performance has been examined to date only within an idealistic noise model. Here, we further analyze the error-correction capabilities of rotation-symmetric codes using a teleportation-based error-correction circuit. To this end, we numerically compute the average gate fidelity, including measurement errors into the noise model of the data qubit. Focusing on physical measurement models, we assess the performance of heterodyne and adaptive homodyne detection in comparison to the previously studied canonical phase measurement. This setting allows us to shed light on the role of different currently available measurement schemes when decoding the encoded information. We find that with the currently achievable measurement efficiencies in microwave optics, bosonic rotation codes undergo a substantial decrease in their break-even potential. In addition, we perform a detailed analysis of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes using a similar error-correction circuit that allows us to analyze the effect of realistic measurement models on different codes. In comparison to RSB codes, we find for GKP codes an even greater reduction in performance together with a vulnerability to photon-number dephasing. Our results show that highly efficient measurement protocols constitute a crucial building block towards error-corrected quantum information processing with bosonic continuous-variable systems.",

    "abstract": "We study the behavior of errors in the quantum simulation of spin systems with long-range multi-body interactions resulting from the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the time-evolution operator. We identify a regime where the Floquet operator underlying the Trotter decomposition undergoes sharp changes even for small variations in the simulation step size. This results in a time evolution operator that is very diﬀerent from the dynamics generated by the targeted Hamiltonian, which leads to a proliferation of errors in the quantum simulation. These regions of sharp change in the Floquet operator, referred to as structural instability regions, appear typically at intermediate Trotter step sizes and in the weakly-interacting regime, and are thus complementary to recently revealed quantum chaotic regimes of the Trotterized evolution [1, 2]. We characterize these structural instability regimes in p -spin models, transverse-ﬁeld Ising models with all-to-all p -body interactions, and analytically predict their occurrence based on unitary perturbation theory. We further show that the eﬀective Hamiltonian associated with the Trotter decomposition of the unitary time-evolution operator, when the Trotter-step size is chosen to be in the structural instability region, is very diﬀerent from the target Hamiltonian, which explains the large errors that can occur in the simulation in the regions of instability. These results have implications for the reliability of near-term gate-based quantum simulators, and reveal an important interplay between errors and the physical properties of the system being simulated.",

    "abstract": "The development of a future, global quantum communication network (or quantum internet) will enable high rate private communication and entanglement distribution over very long distances. However, the large-scale performance of ground-based quantum networks (which employ photons as information carriers through optical-fibres) is fundamentally limited by fibre quality and link length, with the latter being a primary design factor for practical network architectures. While these fundamental limits are well established for arbitrary network topologies, the question of how to best design global architectures remains open. In this work, we introduce a large-scale quantum network model called weakly-regular architectures. Such networks are capable of idealising network connectivity, provide freedom to capture a broad class of spatial topologies and remain analytically treatable. This allows us to investigate the effectiveness of large-scale networks with consistent connective properties, and unveil critical conditions under which end-to-end rates remain optimal. Furthermore, through a strict performance comparison of ideal, ground-based quantum networks with that of realistic satellite quantum communication protocols, we establish conditions for which satellites can be used to outperform fibre-based quantum infrastructure; {rigorously proving the efficacy of satellite-based technologies for global quantum communications.",

    "abstract": "We can encode a qubit in the energy levels of a quantum system. Relaxation and other dissipation processes lead to decay of the fidelity of this stored information. Is it possible to preserve the quantum information for a longer time by introducing additional drives and dissipation? The existence of autonomous quantum error correcting codes answers this question in the positive. Nonetheless, discovering these codes for a real physical system, i.e., finding the encoding and the associated driving fields and bath couplings, remains a challenge that has required intuition and inspiration to overcome. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a computational approach based on adjoint optimization for discovering autonomous quantum error correcting codes given a description of a physical system. We implement an optimizer that searches for a logical subspace and control parameters to better preserve quantum information. We demonstrate our method on a system of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a lossy qubit, and find that varying the Hamiltonian distance in Fock space -- a proxy for the control hardware complexity -- leads to discovery of different and new error correcting schemes. We discover what we call the $\\sqrt{3}$ code, realizable with a Hamiltonian distance $d=2$, and propose a hardware-efficient implementation based on superconducting circuits.",

    "abstract": "Entanglement is the fuel of advanced quantum technology. It is for instance consumed in measurement-based quantum computing and allows loss-tolerant encoding of quantum information. In photonics, entanglement has traditionally been generated probabilistically, requiring massive multiplexing for scaling up to many photons. An alternative approach utilizes quantum emitters in nanophotonic devices for deterministic generation of single photons, which an be extended to two- and multi-photon generation on demand. The proposed polarization-entanglement sources are, however, incompatible with spatial dual-rail qubit encoding, which is preferred in photonic quantum computing realized in scalable integrated photonic circuits. Here we propose and experimentally realize an on-demand source of dual-rail photon pairs using a quantum dot in a planar nanophotonic waveguide. The source exploits the cascaded decay of a biexciton state and chiral light-matter coupling to achieve deterministic generation of spatial dual-rail Bell pairs with the amount of entanglement determined by the chirality. The operational principle can readily be extended to multi-photon entanglement generation, and such sources may be interfaced with advanced photonic-integrated circuits, e.g., for efficient preparation of entanglement resource states for photonic quantum computing.",

In this work, we show that an optically-thin ensemble of 11,000 radiating atoms spontaneously organize to produce spatially coherent light. The reason for this coherence is collective-coupling of the individual emitters via Dicke superradiance and subradiance (as opposed to amplification through stimulated emission).",

In addition, gates acting on diﬀerent sets of qubits require unique sets of control parameters. Thus, an eﬃcient multi-dimensional parameter estimation procedure is crucial to calibrate even medium sized quantum processors. Here, we develop and characterize an eﬃcient calibration protocol to automatically estimate and adjust experimental parameters of the widely used Mølmer-Sørensen entangling gate operation in a trapped ion quantum information processor. The protocol exploits Bayesian parameter estimation methods which includes a stopping criterion based on a desired gate inﬁdelity. We experimentally demonstrate a median gate inﬁdelity of 1 . 3(1) · 10 − 3 , requiring only 1200 ± 500 experimental cycles, while completing the entire gate calibration procedure in less than one minute.

Remarkably, the mechanism is sufficiently generic that the dynamics can be fully ergodic upon resolving the protecting symmetry and fixing the encoded quantum state, resulting in an infinite-temperature quantum memory. After exemplifying the mechanism in a strongly nonintegrable two-dimensional (2D) spin model inspired by the surface code, we find it has a natural interpretation in the language of noiseless subsystems and stabilizer subsystem codes. This interpretation yields a number of further examples, including a nonintegrable Hamiltonian with quantum memory based on the Bacon-Shor code. The lifetime of the encoded quantum information in these models is infinite provided the dynamics respect the stabilizer symmetry of the underlying subsystem code. In the presence of symmetry-violating perturbations, we make contact with previous work leveraging the concept of prethermalization to show that the encoded quantum information retains a parametrically long lifetime under dynamics with an enlarged continuous symmetry group. We identify conditions on the underlying subsystem code that enable such a prethermal enhancement of the memory lifetime.",

When the number F of fermions is much smaller than the number M of modes, this symmetry reduces the number of information-theoretically required qubits from Θ( M ) to O ( F log M ). In this limit, our encoding requires O ( F 2 log 4 M ) qubits, while encoded fermionic creation and annihilation operators have cost O ( F 2 log 5 M ) in two-qubit gates. When incorporated into randomized simulation methods, this permits simulating time-evolution with only polylogarithmic explicit dependence on M . This is the ﬁrst second-quantized encoding of fermions in qubits whose costs in qubits and gates are both polylogarithmic in M , which permits studying fermionic systems in the high-accuracy regime of many modes.",

The example is leveraged to an operational advantage in a pacifist version of the strategy game Battleship. We pinpoint a characteristic of quantum systems that enables quantum advantage in any bounded-memory information retrieval task. While preparation contextuality has previously been linked to advantages in random access coding, we focus here on a different characteristic called sequential contextuality. It is shown not only to be necessary and sufficient for quantum advantage, but also to quantify the degree of advantage.",

    "abstract": "Non-Gaussian quantum states have been deterministically prepared and autonomously stabilized in single- and two-mode circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures via engineered dissipation. However, it is currently unknown how to scale up this technique to multi-mode non-Gaussian systems. Here, we upgrade dissipation engineering to collective (normal) modes of nonlinear resonator arrays and show how to stabilize multi-mode Schrodinger cat states. These states are multi-photon and multi-mode quantum superpositions of coherent states in a single normal mode delocalized over an arbitrary number of cavities. We consider tailored dissipative coupling between resonators that are parametrically driven and feature an on-site nonlinearity, which is either a Kerr-type nonlinearity or an engineered two-photon loss. For both types of nonlinearity, we find the same exact closed-form solutions for the two-dimensional steady-state manifold spanned by superpositions of multi-mode Schrodinger cat states. We further show that, in the Zeno limit of strong dissipative coupling, the even parity multi-mode cat state can be deterministically prepared from the vacuum. Remarkably, engineered two-photon loss gives rise to a fast relaxation towards the steady state, protecting the state preparation against decoherence due to intrinsic single-photon losses and imperfections in tailored dissipative coupling, which sets in at longer times. The relaxation time is independent of system size making the state preparation scalable. Multi-mode cat states are naturally endowed with a noise bias that increases exponentially with system size and can thus be exploited for enhanced robust encoding of quantum information.",

Notably, our bound is applicable to quantum state and channel manipulation with respect to any type of quantum resource and any class of free transformations thereof, encompassing broad types of settings, including entanglement, quantum thermodynamics, and quantum communication. We also show that our techniques provide strong converse bounds relating the distillable resource and resource dilution cost in the asymptotic regime. Moreover, we introduce a class of channels that generalize twirling maps encountered in many resource theories, and by directly connecting it with resource quantification, we compute analytically several smoothed resource measures and improve our one-shot yield--cost bound in relevant theories. We use these operational insights to exactly evaluate important measures for various resource states in the resource theory of magic states.",

Although there has been signiﬁcant progress in characterizing basic parameters of TLS defects, exact mechanisms of interactions between a qubit and various types of TLS defects remained largely unexplored due to the lack of experimental techniques able to probe the form of qubit-defect couplings. Here we present an experimental method of TLS defect spectroscopy using a strong qubit drive that allowed us to distinguish between various types of qubit-defect interactions. By applying this method to a capacitively shunted ﬂux qubit, we detected a rare type of TLS defect with a nonlinear qubit-defect coupling due to critical-current ﬂuctuations, as well as conventional TLS defects with a linear coupling to the qubit caused by charge ﬂuctuations. The presented approach could become the routine method for high-frequency defect inspection and quality control in superconducting qubit fabrication, providing essential feedback for fabrication process optimization. The reported method is a powerful tool to uniquely identify the type of noise ﬂuctuations caused by TLS defects, enabling the development of realistic noise models relevant to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing and fault-tolerant quantum control.",

    "abstract": "We observe the continuous emission of photons into a waveguide from a superconducting qubit without the application of an external drive. To explain this counterintuitive observation, we build a two-bath model where the qubit couples simultaneously to a cold bath (the waveguide) and a hot bath (a secondary environment). Our results show that the thermal-photon occupation of the hot bath is up to 0.14 photons, 35 times larger than the cold waveguide, leading to nonequilibrium heat transport with a power of up to 132 zW, as estimated from the qubit emission spectrum. By adding more isolation between the sample output and the ﬁrst cold ampliﬁer in the output line, the heat transport is strongly suppressed. Our interpretation is that the hot bath may arise from active two-level systems being excited by noise from the output line, and that the qubit coherence can be improved signiﬁcantly by suppressing this noise. We also apply a coherent drive, and use the waveguide to measure thermodynamic work and heat, suggesting waveguide spectroscopy is a useful means to study quantum heat engines and refrigerators. Finally, based on the theoretical model, we propose how a similar setup can be used as a noise spectrometer which provides a solution for calibrating the background noise of hybrid quantum systems.",

By considering chain-like systems of repeating `unit' cells which can each consist of multiple sites, we show that tuning a single system parameter (the intra-unit-cell coupling) leads to efficient and highly robust transport over relatively long distances. This remarkable transport performance is shown to originate from a partitioning of the system's eigenstates into energetically-separated bright and dark subspaces, allowing long range transport to proceed efficiently through a `dark chain' of eigenstates. Finally, we discuss the effects of intrinsic dipole moments, which are of particular relevance to molecular architectures, and demonstrate that appropriately-aligned dipoles can lead to additional protection against other (non-radiative) loss processes.

Current methods require the explicit reconstruction of the density matrix, which is highly demand-ing, or the contraction of replicas, which requires an effort exponential in the number of replicas and which is costly in terms of memory. In contrast, our method requires the stochastic sampling of matrix elements of the classically represented reduced states with respect to random states drawn from simple product probability measures constituting frames. Even though not corresponding to physical operations, such matrix elements are straightforward to calculate for tensor network states, and their moments provide the Rényi entropies and negativities as well as their symmetry-resolved components. We test our method on the one-dimensional critical XX chain and the two-dimensional toric code in a checkerboard geometry. Although the cost is exponential in the subsystem size, it is sufﬁciently moderate so that - in contrast with other approaches - accurate results can be obtained on a personal computer for relatively large subsystem sizes.",

    "abstract": "Exploring highly connected networks of qubits is invaluable for implementing various quantum algorithms and simulations as it allows for entangling qubits with reduced circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate a multi-qubit STAR (Sideband Tone Assisted Rabi driven) gate. Our scheme is inspired by the ion qubit Mølmer-Sørensen gate and is mediated by a shared photonic mode and Rabi-driven superconducting qubits, which relaxes restrictions on qubit frequencies during fabrication and supports scalability. We achieve a two-qubit gate with maximum state ﬁdelity of 95% in 310 ns, a three-qubit gate with state ﬁdelity 90.5% in 217 ns, and a four-qubit gate with state ﬁdelity 66% in 200 ns. Furthermore, we develop a model of the gate that show the four-qubit gate is limited by shared resonator losses and the spread of qubit-resonator couplings, which must be addressed to reach high-ﬁdelity operations.",

Deploying quantum networks means facing the challenges of scaling up the physical hardware and, more importantly, of scaling up all other network layers and optimally utilising network resources. Here we consider two related protocols, their experimental demonstrations on an 8-user quantum network test-bed, and discuss their usefulness with the aid of example use cases. First, an authentication transfer protocol to manage a fundamental limitation of quantum communication -- the need for a pre-shared key between every pair of users linked together on the quantum network. By temporarily trusting some intermediary nodes for a short period of time (<35 min in our network), we can generate and distribute these initial authentication keys with a very high level of security. Second, when end users quantify their trust in intermediary nodes, our flooding protocol can be used to improve both end-to-end communication speeds and increase security against malicious nodes.",

The second valence electron also brings new propects through the so-called Isolated Core Excitation (ICE), however autoionization presents a strong limitation to this use. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a new approach to applying a sizable light shift to a Rydberg state with close-to-resonant ICE while avoiding auto-ionization. In particular, we have investigated ICE of ytterbium atoms in $^1S_0$ Rydberg states. Spectroscopic studies of the induced auto-ionization and the light shift imparted to the Rydberg states are perfectly accounted for with Multi-channel Quantum Defect Theory. Such a control over the inner electron without disturbing the Rydberg electron brings a new tool for the targeted, coherent manipulation of Rydberg states in quantum simulation experiments performed with alkaline-earth atoms.",

    "abstract": "Attaining fault tolerance while maintaining low overhead is one of the main challenges in a practical implementation of quantum circuits. One major technique that can overcome this problem is the ﬂag technique, in which high-weight errors arising from a few faults can be detected by a few ancillas and distinguished using subsequent syndrome measurements. The technique can be further improved using the fact that for some families of codes, errors of any weight are logically equivalent if they have the same syndrome and weight parity, as previously shown in [1]. In this work, we develop a notion of distinguishable fault set which captures both concepts of ﬂags and weight parities, and extend the use of weight parities in error correction from [1] to families of capped and recursive capped color codes. We also develop fault-tolerant protocols for error correction, measurement, state preparation, and logical T gate implementation via code switching, which are suﬃcient for performing fault-tolerant Cliﬀord computation on a capped color code, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation on a recursive capped color code. Our protocols for a capped or a recursive capped color code of any distance require only 2 ancillas, assuming that the ancillas can be reused. The concept of distinguishable fault set also leads to a generalization of the deﬁnitions of fault-tolerant gadgets proposed by Aliferis, Gottesman, and Preskill.",

Despite their widespread popularity as qubit arrays, there remains yet untapped potential beyond the two-level approximation or, equivalently, the hard-core boson model. With the higher excited levels included, coupled transmons naturally realize the attractive Bose-Hubbard model. The dynamics of the model has been difficult to study due to unfavorable scaling of the dimensionality of the Hilbert space with the system size. In this work, we present a framework for describing the effective unitary dynamics of highly-excited states of coupled transmons based on high-order degenerate perturbation theory. This allows us to describe various collective phenomena -- such as bosons stacked onto a single site behaving as a single particle, edge-localization, and effective longer-range interactions -- in a unified, compact and accurate manner. While our examples deal with one-dimensional chains of transmons for the sake of clarity, the theory can be readily applied to more general geometries.",

We focus on learning the anisotropic dipolar term of the Hamiltonian, which generates dynamics that are challenging to classically simulate in some contexts. We demonstrate the ability to directly estimate the Jacobian and Hessian of the corresponding learning problem on a quantum computer, allowing us to learn the Hamiltonian parameters. We develop algorithms for performing this computation on both noisy near-term and future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We argue that the former is promising as an early beyond-classical quantum application since it only requires evolution of a local spin Hamiltonian. We investigate the example of a protein (ubiquitin) confined on a membrane as a benchmark of our method. We isolate small spin clusters, demonstrate the convergence of our learning algorithm on one such example, and then investigate the learnability of these clusters as we cross the ergodic to non-ergodic phase transition by suppressing the dipolar interaction. We see a clear correspondence between a drop in the multifractal dimension measured across many-body eigenstates of these clusters, and a transition in the structure of the Hessian of the learning cost function (from degenerate to learnable). Our hope is that such quantum computations might enable the interpretation and development of new NMR techniques for analyzing molecular structure.",

Our quantum algorithm delivers a super-quadratic speedup over the state-of-the-art quantum algorithm for ground-state generation, overcomes the ground-state-generation bottleneck of the prior approach and is optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor. Specifically, we establish two quantum algorithms -- Fourier-based and wavelet-based -- to generate the ground state of a free massive scalar bosonic QFT with gate complexity quasilinear in the number of discretized-QFT modes. The Fourier-based algorithm is limited to translationally invariant QFTs. Numerical simulations show that the wavelet-based algorithm successfully yields the ground state for a QFT with broken translational invariance. Furthermore, the cost of preparing particle excitations in the wavelet approach is independent of the energy scale. Our algorithms require a routine for generating one-dimensional Gaussian (1DG) states. We replace the standard method for 1DG-state generation, which requires the quantum computer to perform lots of costly arithmetic, with a novel method based on inequality testing that significantly reduces the need for arithmetic. Our method for 1DG-state generation is generic and could be extended to preparing states whose amplitudes can be computed on the fly by a quantum computer.",

We show that it gives genuine sufficient and necessary conditions for approximate single-shot state-transitions in generic resource theories without the need for further optimization. We also clarify its relation to smoothed min- and max-entropies, and construct a monotone for resource theories using only the standard (relative) entropy and variance of (relative) surprisal. This immediately gives rise to enhanced lower bounds for entropy production in random processes. We establish certain properties of the variance of relative surprisal which will be useful for further investigations, such as uniform continuity and upper bounds on the violation of sub-additivity. Motivated by our results, we further derive a simple and physically appealing axiomatic single-shot characterization of (relative) entropy which we believe to be of independent interest. We illustrate our results with several applications, ranging from interconvertibility of ergodic states, over Landauer erasure to a bound on the necessary dimension of the catalyst for catalytic state transitions and Boltzmann's H-theorem.",

    "abstract": "Micro- and nanoscale optical or microwave cavities are used in a wide range of classical applications and quantum science experiments, ranging from precision measurements, laser technologies to quantum control of mechanical motion. The dissipative photon loss via absorption, present to some extent in any optical cavity, is known to introduce thermo-optical eﬀects and thereby impose fundamental limits on precision measurements. Here, we theoretically and experimentally reveal that such dissipative photon absorption can result in quantum feedback via in-loop ﬁeld detection of the absorbed optical ﬁeld, leading to the intracavity ﬁeld ﬂuctuations to be squashed or antisquashed. A closed-loop dissipative quantum feedback to the cavity ﬁeld arises. Strikingly, this modiﬁes the optical cavity susceptibility in coherent response measurements (capable of both increasing or decreasing the bare cavity linewidth) and causes excess noise and correlations in incoherent interferometric optomechanical measurements using a cavity, that is parametrically coupled to a mechanical oscillator. We experimentally observe such unanticipated dissipative dynamics in optomechanical spectroscopy of sideband-cooled optomechanical crystal cavi-tiess at both cryogenic temperature (approximately 8 K) and ambient conditions. The dissipative feedback introduces eﬀective modiﬁcations to the optical cavity linewidth and the optomechanical scattering rate and gives rise to excess imprecision noise in the interferometric quantum measurement of mechanical motion. Such dissipative feedback diﬀers fundamentally from a quantum nondemolition feedback, e.g., optical Kerr squeezing. The dissipative feedback itself always results in an antisqueezed out-of-loop optical ﬁeld, while it can enhance the coexisting Kerr squeezing under certain conditions. Our result applies to cavity spectroscopy in both optical and superconducting microwave cavities, and equally applies to any dissipative feedback mechanism of diﬀerent bandwidth inside the cavity. It has wide-ranging implications for future dissipation engineering, such as dissipation enhanced sideband cooling and Kerr squeezing, quantum frequency conversion, and nonreciprocity in photonic systems.",

    "abstract": "Randomized benchmarking (RB) is the gold standard for experimentally evaluating the quality of quantum operations. The current framework for RB is centered on groups and their representations, but this can be problematic. For example, Clifford circuits need up to $O(n^2)$ gates, and thus Clifford RB cannot scale to larger devices. Attempts to remedy this include new schemes such as linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB), cycle benchmarking, and non-uniform RB, but they do not fall within the group-based RB framework. In this work, we formulate the \\emph{universal randomized benchmarking (URB) framework} which does away with the group structure and also replaces the recovery gate plus measurement component with a general ``post-processing'' POVM. Not only does this framework cover most of the existing benchmarking schemes, but it also gives the language for and helps inspire the formulation of new schemes. We specifically consider a class of URB schemes called \\emph{twirling schemes}. For twirling schemes, the post-processing POVM approximately factorizes into an intermediate channel, inverting maps, and a final measurement. This leads us to study the twirling map corresponding to the gate ensemble specified by the scheme. We prove that if this twirling map is strictly within unit distance of the Haar twirling map in induced diamond norm, the probability of measurement as a function of gate length is a single exponential decay up to small error terms. The core technical tool we use is the matrix perturbation theory of linear operators on quantum channels.",

    "abstract": "For solid-state spin systems, unwanted interactions with surrounding spin baths and inhomogeneity are ubiquitous challenges. In defect spin systems, part of this challenge is that the process of generating the desired defect often involves creating numerous unwanted defects that induce dephasing. Here we show that many of these issues can be alleviated with the silicon vacancy in silicon carbide (SiC), which is a simple defect to produce as it does not require the introduction of impurity atoms into the crystal. Previous measurements of the inhomogeneous dephasing time T2∗ of silicon-vacancy ensembles have thus far been limited to a few 100 ns due to the nuclear spin bath. We perform isotopic purification to minimize the influence of nuclear spins, leading to an order of magnitude improvement in the T2∗ at room temperature. Further improvements emerge by suppressing the effects of strain inhomogeneity via an informed choice of basis in the spin quartet. Combining these techniques leads to about a factor 50 improvement in the T2∗ of the defect ensemble even at high defect densities.Received 31 August 2021Accepted 18 February 2022DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.010343Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "We theoretically study the dynamics of $n$-level spin-orbit coupled alkaline-earth fermionic atoms with SU($n$) symmetric interactions. We consider three dimensional lattices with tunneling along one dimension, and the internal levels treated as a synthetic dimension, realizing an $n$-leg flux ladder. Laser driving is used to couple the internal levels and to induce an effective magnetic flux through the ladder. We focus on the dense and strongly interacting regime, where in the absence of flux the system behaves as a Mott insulator with suppressed motional dynamics. At integer and fractional ratios of the laser Rabi frequency to the onsite interactions, the system exhibits resonant features in the dynamics. These resonances occur when interactions help overcome kinetic constraints upon the tunneling of atoms, thus enabling motion. Different resonances allow for the development of complex chiral current patterns. The resonances resemble the ones appearing in the longitudinal Hall resistance when the magnetic field is varied. We characterize the dynamics by studying the system's long-time relaxation behavior as a function of flux, number of internal levels $n$, and interaction strength. We observe a series of non-trivial pre-thermal plateaus caused by the emergence of resonant processes at successive orders in perturbation theory. We discuss protocols to observe the predicted phenomena under current experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Quantum self-testing is the task of certifying quantum states and measurements using the output statistics solely, with minimal assumptions about the underlying quantum system. It is based on the observation that some extremal points in the set of quantum correlations can only be achieved, up to isometries, with specific states and measurements. Here, we present a new approach for quantum self-testing in Bell non-locality scenarios, motivated by the following observation: the quantum maximum of a given Bell inequality is, in general, difficult to characterize. However, it is strictly contained in an easy-to-characterize set: the \\emph{theta body} of a vertex-weighted induced subgraph $(G,w)$ of the graph in which vertices represent the events and edges join mutually exclusive events. This implies that, for the cases where the quantum maximum and the maximum within the theta body (known as the Lov\\'asz theta number) of $(G,w)$ coincide, self-testing can be demonstrated by just proving self-testability with the theta body of $G$. This graph-theoretic framework allows us to (i) recover the self-testability of several quantum correlations that are known to permit self-testing (like those violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and three-party Mermin Bell inequalities for projective measurements of arbitrary rank, and chained Bell inequalities for rank-one projective measurements), (ii) prove the self-testability of quantum correlations that were not known using existing self-testing techniques (e.g., those violating the Abner Shimony Bell inequality for rank-one projective measurements). Additionally, the analysis of the chained Bell inequalities gives us a closed-form expression of the Lov\\'asz theta number for a family of well-studied graphs known as the M\\\"obius ladders, which might be of independent interest in the community of discrete mathematics.",

    "abstract": "Floquet engineering provides a toolbox for the realization of novel quantum phases without static counterparts, while conventionally the realization may rely on the manipulation of complex temporal evolution. Here we propose a systematic and high-precision scheme to realize unconventional Floquet topological phases by engineering local band structures in particular momentum subspace called band inversion surfaces (BISs). This scheme is based on a new bulk-boundary correspondence that for a class of generic $d$-dimensional periodically driven systems, the local topological structure formed in each BIS uniquely determines the features of gapless boundary modes. By engineering the BIS configuration we demonstrate a highly efficient approach to realize, manipulate, and detect novel Floquet topological phases. In particular, we predict a two-dimensional (2D) anomalous Floquet valley-Hall phase which carries trivial global bulk topological invariants but features protected counter-propagating edge states in each quasienergy gap. The unconventional nature of this novel 2D phase is further illustrated by the examination of edge geometry dependence and its robustness to disorder scattering. Anomalous chiral topological phases with valley protection in higher dimension are also predicted and studied. Our systematic and highly feasible scheme opens a new route to realize and engineer unconventional Floquet topological phases for ultracold atoms and other quantum simulators.",

    "abstract": "We introduce operational quantum tasks based on betting with risk-aversion -- or quantum betting tasks for short -- inspired by standard quantum state discrimination and classical horse betting with risk-aversion and side information. In particular, we introduce the operational tasks of quantum state betting (QSB), noisy quantum state betting (nQSB), and quantum channel betting (QCB) played by gamblers with different risk tendencies. We prove that the advantage that informative measurements (non-constant channels) provide in QSB (nQSB) is exactly characterised by Arimoto's $\\alpha$-mutual information, with the order $\\alpha$ determining the risk aversion of the gambler. More generally, we show that Arimoto-type information-theoretic quantities characterise the advantage that resourceful objects offer at playing quantum betting tasks when compared to resourceless objects, for general quantum resource theories (QRTs) of measurements, channels, states, and state-measurement pairs, with arbitrary resources. In limiting cases, we show that QSB (QCB) recovers the known tasks of quantum state (channel) discrimination when $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty$, and quantum state (channel) exclusion when $\\alpha \\rightarrow -\\infty$. Inspired by these connections, we also introduce new quantum R\\'enyi divergences for measurements, and derive a new family of resource monotones for the QRT of measurement informativeness. This family of resource monotones recovers in the same limiting cases as above, the generalised robustness and the weight of informativeness. Altogether, these results establish a broad and continuous family of four-way correspondences between operational tasks, mutual information measures, quantum R\\'enyi divergences, and resource monotones, that can be seen to generalise two limiting correspondences that were recently discovered for the QRT of measurement informativeness.",

This depth is inversely proportional to the number of available quantum gates that have been synthesized. Moreover, quantum gate-synthesis and control problems exhibit a vast range of external parameter dependencies, both physical and application specific.

Analogously to nonreciprocal phenomena in multiferroics, the magnetoelectric coupling is time-reversal and inversion asymmetric. This asymmetry establishes a means for exceptional tunability of magnon-photon coupling, which can be switched on and oﬀ by reversing the magnetization direction. Taking the multiferroic skyrmion-host Cu 2 OSeO 3 with ultralow magnetic damping as an example, we reveal the electrical activity of skyrmion eigenmodes and propose it for magnon-photon splitting of “magnetically dark” elliptic modes. Furthermore, we predict a cavity-induced magnon-magnon coupling between magnetoelectrically active skyrmion excitations. We discuss applications in quantum information processing by proposing protocols for all-electrical magnon-mediated photon quantum gates, and a photon-mediated SPLIT operation of magnons. Our study highlights magnetoelectric cavity magnonics as a novel platform for realizing quantum-hybrid systems and the coherent transduction between photons and magnons in topological magnetic textures.",

In general, this limits their reliability for strongly correlated systems, for instance, in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition (QPT). Here, we propose a protocol that makes optimal use of a given ﬁnite-size simulator by directly preparing, on its bulk region, a mixed state representing the reduced density operator of the translation-invariant inﬁnite-sized system of interest. This protocol is based on coherent evolution with a local deformation of the system Hamiltonian. For systems of free fermions in one and two spatial dimensions, we illustrate and explain the underlying physics, which consists of quasi-particle transport towards the system’s boundaries while retaining the bulk “vacuum”. For the example of a non-integrable extended Su-Schrieﬀer-Heeger model, we demonstrate that our protocol enables a more accurate study of QPTs. In addition, we demonstrate the protocol for an interacting spinful Fermi-Hubbard model with doping for 1D chains and a small two-leg ladder, where the initial state is a random superposition of energetically low-lying states.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction (QEC) is a procedure by which the quantum state of a system is protected against a known type of noise, by preemptively adding redundancy to that state. Such a procedure is commonly used in quantum computing when thermal noise is present. Interestingly, thermal noise has also been known to play a central role in quantum thermodynamics (QTD). This fact hints at the applicability of certain QTD statements in the QEC of thermal noise, which has been discussed previously in the context of Maxwell's demon. In this article, we view QEC as a quantum heat engine with a feedback controller (i.e., a demon). We derive an upper bound on the measurement heat dissipated during the error-identification stage in terms of the Groenewold information gain, thereby providing the latter with a physical meaning also when it is negative. Further, we derive the second law of thermodynamics in the context of this QEC engine, operating with general quantum measurements. Finally, we show that, under a set of physically motivated assumptions, this leads to a fundamental triple trade-off relation, which implies a trade-off between the maximum achievable fidelity of QEC and the super-Carnot efficiency that heat engines with feedback controllers have been known to possess. A similar trade-off relation occurs for the thermodynamic efficiency of the QEC engine and the efficacy of the quantum measurement used for error identification.",

Their realization has been a longstanding goal because they offer great potential utility for quantum computation and memory. However, they have so far eluded experimental observation both in solid-state systems as well as in ultracold quantum gases. Here, we propose to leverage the tremendous control offered by rotating two-dimensional trapped-ion crystals in a Penning trap to simulate the dynamical phases of two-dimensional p+ip superfluids. This is accomplished by mapping the presence or absence of a Cooper pair into an effective spin-1/2 system encoded in the ions' electronic levels. We show how to infer the topological properties of the dynamical phases, and discuss the role of beyond mean-field corrections.

These diagrams represent the underlying mathematical operations and aid physical interpretation, but cannot generally be computed with directly. In this paper we introduce the ZXH-calculus, a graphical language based on the ZX-calculus, that we use to represent and reason about many-body states entirely graphically. As a demonstration, we express the 1D AKLT state, a symmetry protected topological state, in the ZXH-calculus by developing a representation of spins higher than 1/2 within the calculus. By exploiting the simplifying power of the ZXH-calculus rules we show how this representation straightforwardly recovers two important properties, the existence of topologically protected edge states, and the non-vanishing of a string order parameter. We furthermore show how the AKLT matrix-product state representation can be recovered from our diagrams. In addition, we provide an alternative proof that the 2D AKLT state on a hexagonal lattice can be reduced to a graph state, demonstrating that it is a universal quantum computing resource. Our results show that the ZXH-calculus is a powerful language for representing and computing with physical states entirely graphically, paving the way to develop more efficient many-body algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Quantum transduction between the microwave and optical domains is an outstanding challenge for long-distance quantum networks based on superconducting qubits. For all transducers realized to date, the generally weak light-matter coupling does not allow high transduction efficiency, large bandwidth, and low noise simultaneously. Here we show that a large electric dipole moment of an exciton in an optically active self-assembled quantum dot molecule (QDM) efficiently couples to a microwave resonator field at a single-photon level. This allows for transduction between microwave and optical photons without coherent optical pump fields to enhance the interaction. With an on-chip device, we demonstrate a sizeable single-photon coupling strength of 16 MHz. Thanks to the fast exciton decay rate in the QDM, the transduction bandwidth between an optical and microwave resonator photon reaches several 100s of MHz. Introduction Because of their bright and fast single-photon emission and the high indistinguishability of emitted photons, selfassembled quantum dots (QDs) have been proposed as an ideal single-photon source for long-distance quantum communication. Harnessing the ability to enhance lightmatter interactions in photonic nanostructures, single QDs can serve as both a nearly deterministic single-photon source and an excellent nonlinear element realized by strong coupling to an optical mode. Combined with the recent advances in technologies to tune their resonance frequencies in-situ, single QDs are becoming more prominent for constructing quantum networks in the optical domain. For quantum processing at a local node, on the other hand, superconducting qubits and trapped ions are the leading platforms. Particularly, superconducting qubits are attractive because of their high programmability, scalability, fast operational speed, and high fidelity of singleand multi-qubit gates. Circuit quantum electrodynamics in the microwave domain plays a central role in superconducting quantum information processors. Hybridizing the strengths of both frequency domains – the low attenuation with the enormous bandwidth of optical fibers and the strong computational power of microwave circuits – is a key step towards a distributed quantum information processing network. Many groups have dedicated efforts towards developing various transducers between microwave and optical photons, such as electro-optomechanical systems , electro-optic systems, rare-earth ion ensembles, and magnons. Although there are impressive advances such as the conversion of a transmon to an optical photon and lownoise transduction, satisfying all the necessary conditions, namely high efficiency, large bandwidth, and low noise, simultaneously is still challenging. The underlying issue is generally weak single-photon coupling strengths. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel physical platform consisting of an optically active InAs/GaAs QD molecule (QDM) coupled to a superconducting circuit system. The advantages of using an InAs/GaAs QDM for opticalmicrowave transduction are the following: (i) using a molecular state of the QDs, one can obtain a large electric dipole moment upon single optical photon absorption, which allows for a sizeable coupling strength g0 between a single microwave photon and a single QDM; (ii) the large g0 ensures that additional laser fields are not necessary to effect transduction, which reduces excess noise to a minimum; (iii) the intrinsic bandwidth of the interconnection becomes considerably large (several 100s of MHz) since the exciton recombines on sub-nanosecond timescales; (iv) downconverted single optical photons associated with optical-tomicrowave transduction heralds the success of the transduction events, which are essential to realize direct quantum state transfer between distant superconducting qubits with high fidelity. To prove the concept, we fabricate an on-chip device and demonstrate a sizeable coupling strength of 16 MHz as well as transduction between optical and microwave resonator",

We characterise the dynamics of the nanoparticle from a thermodynamic point-of-view, investigating the dynamics with the Wehrl entropy production and its rates. Furthermore, we investigate coupling regimes where the the quantum effect and thermal effect are of the same magnitude, and look at suitable squeezing of the initial state that provides the maximum coherence. The effects and the competitions of the unitary and the dissipative parts onto the system are demonstrated. We quantify the requirements to relate our results to a bonafide experiment with the presence of the environment, and discuss the experimental interpretations of our results in the end.",

This opens the door to revisiting foundational questions and issues, such as the nature of quantum entropy, from a geometric perspective. Central to this is the concept of geometric quantum state -- the probability measure on a system's space of pure states. This space's continuity leads us to introduce two analysis tools, inspired by Renyi's information theory, to characterize and quantify fundamental properties of geometric quantum states: the quantum information dimension that is the rate of geometric quantum state compression and the dimensional geometric entropy that monitors information stored in quantum states. We recount their classical definitions, information-theoretic meanings, and physical interpretations, and adapt them to quantum systems via the geometric approach. We then explicitly compute them in various examples and classes of quantum system. We conclude commenting on future directions for information in geometric quantum mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Reliable processing of quantum information is a milestone to achieve for the deployment of quantum technologies. Uncontrolled, out-of-equilibrium sources of decoherence need to be characterized in detail for designing the control of quantum devices to mitigate the loss of quantum information. However, quantum sensing of such environments is still a challenge due to their non-stationary nature that in general can generate complex high-order correlations. We here introduce a path integral framework to characterize non-stationary environmental fluctuations by a quantum probe. We found the solution for the decoherence decay of non-stationary, generalized Gaussian processes that induce pure dephasing. This dephasing when expressed in a suitable basis, based on the non-stationary noise eigenmodes, is defined by the overlap of a generalized noise spectral density and a filter function that depends on the control fields. This result thus extends the validity to out-of-equilibrium environments, of the similar general expression for the dephasing of open quantum systems coupled to stationary noises. We show physical insights for a broad subclass of non-stationary noises that are local-in-time, in the sense that the noise correlation functions contain memory based on constraints of the derivatives of the fluctuating noise paths. Spectral and non-Markovian properties are discussed together with implementations of the framework to treat paradigmatic environments that are out-of-equilibrium, e.g. due to a quench and a pulsed noise. We show that our results provide tools for probing the spectral and time-correlation properties, and for mitigating decoherence effects of out-of-equilibrium -- non-stationary -- environments.",

We show how to transform a gate’s process matrix into an error generator that represents the same information more usefully. We construct a basis of simple and physically intuitive elementary error generators, classify them, and show how to represent any gate’s error generator as a mixture of elementary error generators with various rates. Finally, we show how to build a large variety of reduced models for gate errors by combining elementary error generators and/or entire subsectors of generator space. We conclude with a few examples of reduced models, including one with just 9N parameters that describes almost all commonly predicted errors on an N -qubit processor.",

    "abstract": "We study quantum conditional entropy production, which quantiﬁes the irreversibility of system-environment evolution from the perspective of a third system, called the reference. The reference is initially correlated with the system. We show that the quantum unconditional entropy production with respect to the system is less than the conditional entropy production with respect to the reference, where the latter includes a reference-induced dissipative information. The dissipative information pinpoints the distributive correlation established between the environment and the reference, even though they do not interact directly. When reaching the thermal equilibrium, the system-environment evolution has a zero unconditional entropy production. However, one can still have a nonzero conditional entropy production with respect to the reference, which characterizes the informational nonequilibrium of the system-environment evolution in the view point of the reference. The additional contribution to the conditional entropy production, the dissipative information, characterizes a minimal thermodynamic cost that the system pays for maintaining the correlation with the reference. Positive dissipative information also characterizes potential work waste. We prove that both types of entropy production and the dissipative information follow quantum ﬂuctuation theorems when a two-point measurement is applied. We verify the quantum ﬂuctuation theorem for the dissipative information experimentally on IBM quantum computers. We also present examples based on the qubit collisional model and demonstrate universal nonzero dissipative information in the qubit Maxwell’s demon protocol.",

Crucial to meeting these experiments’ required sensitivities is the implementation of large momentum transfer (>10~k). Here we show that to sequentially apply such a large momentum via π pulses places stringent requirements on the frequency noise of the interferometry laser, finding that the linewidth is required to be considerably lower than has previously been suggested. This is due to imperfect pulse fidelity in the presence of noise and is apparent even for an atom at rest interacting with resonant light, making this a fundamental constraint on operational fidelity for a given laser and pulse sequence. Within this framework, we further present and analyse two high-power, frequency-stabilised laser sources designed to perform interferometry on the S0 P0 clock transitions of cadmium and strontium, respectively operating at 332 nm and 698 nm.",

    "abstract": "Starting from a simple estimation problem, here we propose a general approach for decoding quantum measurements from the perspective of information extraction. By virtue of the estimation fidelity only, we provide surprisingly simple characterizations of rank-1 projective measurements, mutually unbiased measurements, and symmetric informationally complete measurements. Notably, our conclusions do not rely on any assumption on the rank, purity, or the number of measurement outcomes, and we do not need bases to start with. Our work demonstrates that all these elementary quantum measurements are uniquely determined by their information-extraction capabilities, which are not even anticipated before. In addition, we offer a new perspective for understanding noncommutativity and incompatibility from tomographic performances, which also leads to a universal criterion for detecting quantum incompatibility. Furthermore, we show that the estimation fidelity can be used to distinguish inequivalent mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete measurements. In the course of study, we introduce the concept of (weighted complex projective) $1/2$-designs and show that all $1/2$-designs are tied to symmetric informationally complete measurements, and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Although quantum computation (QC) is regarded as a promising numerical method for computational quantum chemistry, current applications of quantum-chemistry calculations on quantum computers are limited to small molecules. This limitation can be ascribed to technical problems in building and manipulating more qubits and the associated complicated operations of quantum gates in a quantum circuit when the size of the molecular system becomes large. As a result, reducing the number of required qubits is necessary to make QC practical. Currently, the minimal STO-3G basis set is commonly used in benchmark studies because it requires the minimum number of spin orbitals. Nonetheless, the accuracy of using STO-3G is generally low and thus cannot provide useful predictions. We propose to adopt Daubechies wavelet functions as an accurate and efficient method for QCs of molecular electronic properties. We demonstrate that a minimal basis set constructed from Daubechies wavelet basis can yield accurate results through a better description of the molecular Hamiltonian, while keeping the number of spin orbitals minimal. With the improved Hamiltonian through Daubechies wavelets, we calculate vibrational frequencies for H$_2$ and LiH using quantum-computing algorithm to show that the results are in excellent agreement with experimental data. As a result, we achieve quantum calculations in which accuracy is comparable with that of the full configuration interaction calculation using the cc-pVDZ basis set, whereas the computational cost is the same as that of a STO-3G calculation. Thus, our work provides a more efficient and accurate representation of the molecular Hamiltonian for efficient QCs of molecular systems, and for the first time demonstrates that predictions in agreement with experimental measurements are possible to be achieved with quantum resources available in near-term quantum computers.",

The existing security proofs require accumulating a large number of raw key bits for privacy amplification. This is similar to block ciphers in classical cryptography that would delay the final key generation since an entire block must be accumulated before privacy amplification. Moreover, any leftover errors after information reconciliation would corrupt the entire block. By modifying the security proof based on quantum error correction, we develop a stream privacy amplification scheme, which resembles the classical stream cipher, to solve the problems of final key generation delay and error spread. The stream scheme can also help to enhance the security of trusted-relay quantum networks. Inspired by the connection between stream ciphers and quantum error correction in our security analysis, we further develop a generic information-theoretic tool to study the security of classical encryption algorithms.",

For any control Hamiltonian that produces a geometric gate, we ﬁnd that under certain common conditions one can construct another control Hamiltonian that produces an equivalent dynamical gate with identical noise sensitivity (as characterized by the ﬁlter function). Our result holds for a Hilbert space of arbitrary dimensions, but we illustrate our result by examining experimentally relevant single-qubit scenarios and providing explicit examples of equivalent geometric and dynamical gates.",

    "abstract": "Deriving eﬀective Hamiltonian models plays an essential role in quantum theory, with particular emphasis in recent years on control and engineering problems. In this work, we present two symbolic methods for computing eﬀective Hamiltonian models: the Non-perturbative Analytical Diagonalization (NPAD) and the Recursive Schrieﬀer-Wolﬀ Transformation (RSWT). NPAD makes use of the Jacobi iteration and works without the assumptions of perturbation theory while retaining convergence, allowing to treat a very wide range of models. In the perturbation regime, it reduces to RSWT, which takes advantage of an in-built recursive structure where remarkably the number of terms increases only linearly with perturbation order, exponentially decreasing the number of terms compared to the ubiquitous Schrieﬀer-Wolﬀ method. In this regime, NPAD further gives an exponential reduction in terms, i.e. superexponential compared to Schrieﬀer-Wolﬀ, relevant to high precision expansions. Both methods consist of algebraic expressions and can be easily automated for symbolic computation. To demonstrate the application of the methods, we study the ZZ and cross-resonance interactions of superconducting qubits systems. We investigate both suppressing and engineering the coupling in near-resonant and quasi-dispersive regimes. With the proposed methods, the coupling strength in the eﬀective Hamiltonians can be estimated with high precision comparable to numerical results. qubit-qubit interaction. The result shows that the ZZ interaction can be suppressed without resorting to ad-3",

Existing setups range from single atomic ions, to ion chains and crystals, to charged molecules and nanoparticles. Future technological applications of such quantum systems will be crucially affected by fluctuating electric fields emanating from nearby electrodes, which interact with the levitated particles' monopole and higher charge moments. In this article, we provide a theoretical toolbox for describing how the rotational and translational quantum dynamics of charged nano- to microscale objects is affected by near metallic and dielectric surfaces, as characterized by their macroscopic dielectric response. The resulting quantum master equations describe the coherent surface-particle interaction, due to image charges and Casimir-Polder potentials, as well as surface-induced decoherence and heating, with the experimentally observed frequency and distance scaling. We explicitly evaluate the master equations for typical charge distributions and types of motion, thereby providing the tools required for describing and mitigating surface-induced decoherence in a variety of experiments with charged objects.",

    "abstract": "The field of quantum Hamiltonian complexity lies at the intersection of quantum many-body physics and computational complexity theory, with deep implications to both fields. The main object of study is the LocalHamiltonian problem, which is concerned with estimating the ground-state energy of a local Hamiltonian and is complete for the class QMA, a quantum generalization of the class NP. A major challenge in the field is to understand the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian problem in more physically natural parameter regimes. One crucial parameter in understanding the ground space of any Hamiltonian in many-body physics is the spectral gap, which is the difference between the smallest two eigenvalues. Despite its importance in quantum many-body physics, the role played by the spectral gap in the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian is less well-understood. In this work, we make progress on this question by considering the precise regime, in which one estimates the ground-state energy to within inverse exponential precision. Computing ground-state energies precisely is a task that is important for quantum chemistry and quantum many-body physics. \nIn the setting of inverse-exponential precision, there is a surprising result that the complexity of LocalHamiltonian is magnified from QMA to PSPACE, the class of problems solvable in polynomial space. We clarify the reason behind this boost in complexity. Specifically, we show that the full complexity of the high precision case only comes about when the spectral gap is exponentially small. As a consequence of the proof techniques developed to show our results, we uncover important implications for the representability and circuit complexity of ground states of local Hamiltonians, the theory of uniqueness of quantum witnesses, and techniques for the amplification of quantum witnesses in the presence of postselection.",

    "abstract": "When a resonant photon traverses a sample of absorbing atoms, how much time do atoms spend in the excited state? Does the answer depend on whether the photon is ultimately absorbed or transmitted? In particular, if it is $\\textit{not}$ absorbed, does it cause atoms to spend any time in the excited state, and if so, how much? In an experiment with ultra-cold Rubidium atoms, we simultaneously record whether atoms are excited by incident (\"signal\") photons and whether those photons are transmitted. We measure the time spent by atoms in the excited state by using a separate, off-resonant \"probe\" laser to monitor the index of refraction of the sample - that is, we measure the nonlinear phase shift written by a signal pulse on this probe beam - and use direct detection to isolate the effect of single transmitted photons. For short pulses (10 ns, to be compared to the 26 ns atomic lifetime) and an optically thick medium (peak OD = 4, leading to 60% absorption given our broad bandwidth), we find that the average time atoms spend in the excited state due to one transmitted photon is not zero, but rather (77 $\\pm$ 16)% of the time the average incident photon causes them to spend in the excited state. We attribute this observation of \"excitation without loss\" to coherent forward emission, which can arise when the instantaneous Rabi frequency (pulse envelope) picks up a phase flip - this happens naturally when a broadband pulse propagates through an optically thick medium with frequency-dependent absorption [1]. These results unambiguously reveal the complex history of photons as they propagate through an absorbing medium and illustrate the power of utilizing post-selection to experimentally investigate the past behaviour of observed quantum systems.",

In this task, the sender Alice and the receiver Bob share an entangled state. She encodes the classical information into it using a symmetric preserving encoder and sends the encoded state to Bob through a noiseless quantum channel. The decoder is limited to a measurement to satisfy a certain locality condition on the bipartite system composed of the receiving system and the preshared entanglement half. Our contributions are summarized as follows: First, we derive an achievable transmission rate for this task dependently of conditions of encoder and decoder. Surprisingly, we show that the obtained rate cannot be improved even when the decoder is relaxed to local measurements, two-way LOCCs, separable measurements, or partial transpose positive (PPT) measurements for the bipartite system. Moreover, depending on the class of allowed measurements with a locality condition, we relax the class of encoding operations to super-quantum encoders in the framework of general probability theory (GPT). That is, when our decoder is restricted to a separable measurement, theoretically, a positive operation is allowed as an encoding operation. Surprisingly, even under this type of super-quantum relaxation, the transmission rate cannot be improved. This fact highlights the universal validity of our analysis beyond quantum theory.",

Unfortunately, efficient Raman excitations are usually accompanied by uncompensated dynamic phases and coherent spin-leakages, preventing accurate and repetitive transfer of recoil momentum to large samples. We provide systematic study to demonstrate that the limitations can be substantially overcame by dynamically programming an adiabatic pulse sequence. Experimentally, counter-propagating frequency-chirped pulses are programmed on an optical delay line to parallelly drive five $\\Delta m=0$ hyperfine Raman transitions of $^{85}$Rb atoms for spin-dependent kick (SDK) within $\\tau=40$~nanoseconds, with an $f_{\\rm SDK}\\approx 97.6\\%$ inferred fidelity. Aided by numerical modeling, we demonstrate that by alternating the chirps of successive pulses in a balanced fashion, accumulation of non-adiabatic errors including the spin-leakages can be managed, while the dynamic phases can be robustly cancelled. Operating on a phase-stable delay line, the method supports precise, fast, and flexible control of spinor matterwave with efficient Raman excitations.",

    "abstract": "We present a voltage gate-based method for controlling the Majorana transmon, using a sinusoidal modulation of the induced offset charge $n_g$. Working in the transmon regime and in the instantaneous eigenstates basis, we find the time evolution under this protocol that realises tunable $X$-$Z$ rotations. We optimise the parameters of the system for different single-qubit gates in both the laboratory frame and the qubit rotating frame, obtaining qubit control errors $1-\\mathcal{F}$ smaller than $\\sim2\\times 10^{-4}$. In addition to this, we conduct an analysis of the effects of the charge noise, assuming wide-band $1/f$ additive noise in $n_g$, both for the free and the driven evolutions. For the free evolution, the relaxation and dephasing rates are calculated perturbatively, obtaining long dephasing times of the order of milliseconds at the system's sweet-spots. For the driven case, the average fidelity for the $X$-gate is obtained via a numerical simulation, demonstrating remarkable resilience.",

    "abstract": "As the number of qubits available on noisy quantum computers grows, it will become necessary to efficiently select a subset of physical qubits to use in a quantum computation. For any given quantum program and device there are many ways to assign physical qubits for execution of the program, and assignments will differ in performance due to the variability in quality across qubits and entangling operations on a single device. Evaluating the performance of each assignment using fidelity estimation introduces significant experimental overhead and will be infeasible for many applications, while relying on standard device benchmarks provides incomplete information about the performance of any specific program. Furthermore, the number of possible assignments grows combinatorially in the number of qubits on the device and in the program, motivating the use of heuristic optimization techniques. We approach this problem using simulated annealing with a cost function based on the Loschmidt Echo, a diagnostic that measures the reversibility of a quantum process. We provide theoretical justification for this choice of cost function by demonstrating that the optimal qubit assignment coincides with the optimal qubit assignment based on state fidelity in the weak error limit, and we provide experimental justification using diagnostics performed on Google's superconducting qubit devices. We then establish the performance of simulated annealing for qubit assignment using classical simulations of noisy devices as well as optimization experiments performed on a quantum processor. Our results demonstrate that the use of Loschmidt Echoes and simulated annealing provides a scalable and flexible approach to optimizing qubit assignment on near-term hardware.",

    "abstract": "We reformulate the continuous space Schr\\\"odinger equation in terms of spin Hamiltonians. For the kinetic energy operator, the critical concept facilitating the reduction in model complexity is the idea of position encoding. Binary encoding of position produces a Heisenberg-like model and yields exponential improvement in space complexity when compared to classical computing. Encoding with a binary reflected Gray code, and a Hamming distance 2 Gray code yields the additional effect of reducing the spin model down to the XZ and transverse Ising model respectively. We also identify the bijective mapping between diagonal unitaries and the Walsh series, producing the mapping of any real potential to a series of $k$-local Ising models through the fast Walsh transform. Finally, in a finite volume, we provide some numerical evidence to support the claim that the total time needed for adiabatic evolution is protected by the infrared cutoff of the system. As a result, initial state preparation from a free-field wavefunction to an interacting system is expected to exhibit polynomial time complexity with volume and constant scaling with respect to lattice discretization for all encodings. For the Hamming distance 2 Gray code, the evolution starts with the transverse Hamiltonian before introducing penalties such that the low lying spectrum reproduces the energy levels of the Laplacian. The adiabatic evolution of the penalty Hamiltonian is therefore sensitive to the ultraviolet scale. It is expected to exhibit polynomial time complexity with lattice discretization, or exponential time complexity with respect to the number of qubits given a fixed volume.",

    "abstract": "In quantum information processing quantum operations are often processed alongside measurements which result in classical data. Due to the information gain of classical measurement outputs non-unitary dynamical processes can take place on the system, for which common quantum channel descriptions fail to describe the time evolution. Quantum measurements are correctly treated by means of so-called quantum instruments capturing both classical outputs and post-measurement quantum states. Here we present a general recipe to characterize quantum instruments alongside its experimental implementation and analysis. Thereby, the full dynamics of a quantum instrument can be captured, exhibiting details of the quantum dynamics that would be overlooked with common tomography techniques. For illustration, we apply our characterization technique to a quantum instrument used for the detection of qubit loss and leakage, which was recently implemented as a building block in a quantum error correction (QEC) experiment [1]. Our analysis reveals unexpected and in-depth information about the failure modes of the implementation of the quantum instrument. We then numerically study the implications of these experimental failure modes on QEC performance, when the instrument is employed as a building block in QEC protocols on a logical qubit. Our results highlight the importance of careful characterization and modelling of failure modes in quantum instruments, as compared to simplistic hardware-agnostic phenomenological noise models, which fail to predict the undesired behavior of faulty quantum instruments. The presented methods and results are directly applicable to generic quantum instruments.",

    "abstract": "Deep defects in silicon carbide (SiC) possess atom-like electronic, spin and optical properties, making them ideal for quantum-computing and -sensing applications. In these applications, deep defects are often placed within fabricated nanostructures that modify defect properties due to surface and quantum confinement effects. Thus far, theoretical studies exploring deep defects in SiC have ignored these effects. Using density functional theory, this work demonstrates site-dependence of properties of bright, negatively-charged silicon monovacancies within a SiC nanowire. It is shown that the optical properties of defects depend strongly on the hybridization of the defect states with the surface states and on the structural changes allowed by proximity to the surfaces. Additionally, the analysis of the first principles results indicates that the charge-state conversion and/or migration to thermodynamically-favorable undercoordinated surface sites can deteriorate deep-defect properties. These results illustrate the importance of considering how finite-size effects tune defect properties, and of creating mitigating protocols to ensure a defect's charge-state stability within nanostructured hosts.",

Localised-TPF Codes It is known that the discrimination of ensembles of quantum states with Geometrical Uniform Symmetry (GUS) can be enhanced through the use of joint quantum measurements [38]. An ensemble of states {pi, ρi}i=1 possess GUS if pi = n −1 and there exist a set of symmetry unitaries {Si}i=1 such that ρi = Siρ0S i , and S0 = I where I is the identity. In the case of GUS ensembles of pure coherent states, Pretty Good Measurements (PGMs) have been proven to be optimal [30]. This means that GUS ensembles of coherent states transmitted through pure-loss channels (which retain the purity of input states Eη(|α〉〈α|) = |ηα〉〈ηα|) can be optimally discriminated via PGMs. Motivated by this fact, and inspired by the Channel Position Finding (CPF) formalism developed for quantum channel discrimination [39], let us introduce kTarget Position Finding (k-TPF). This is an encoding that uses image spaces U TPF which describe the set of all m-length binary patterns that possess exactly k-target modulated states. For example the image space U TPF denotes the ensemble of m-mode coherent states with a single target state, against a backdrop of (m − 1) background states, e.g. i = [1, 0, . . . , 0] ∈ U TPF . This form of image space can be be used to generate GUS coherent pattern ensembles for communication between Alice and Bob, as explored in [28]. We may now outline a potential communication scheme over uniform, m-length multi-channels. Alice and Bob wish to globally encode information onto their patterns by means of two factors; locality and TPF properties. Every pattern is divided into an n-partite locality structure according to a disjoint partition set S = {sj}j=1, where sj is a subset that collects specific modes within the pattern. That is,",

    "abstract": "The ability to perform high-precision optical measurements is paramount to science and engineering. Laser interferometry enables interaction-free sensing with a precision ultimately limited by shot noise. Quantum optical sensors can surpass this limit, but single- or multi-photon schemes are challenged by low experimental sampling rates, while squeezed-light approaches require complex optical setups and sophisticated time gating. Here, we introduce a simple method that infers optical phase shifts through standard intensity measurements while still maintaining the quantum advantage in the measurement precision. Capitalising on the robustness and high sampling rates of our device, we implement a quantum optical microphone in the audio band. Its performance is benchmarked against a classical laser microphone in a standardised medically-approved speech recognition test on 45 subjects. We find that quantum-recorded words improve the speech recognition threshold by $-0.57\\, \\text{dB}_{\\text{SPL}}$, thus making the quantum advantage audible. Not only do these results open the door towards applications in quantum nonlinear interferometry, but they also show that quantum phenomena can be experienced by humans.",

    "abstract": "We consider quantum error-correcting subsystem codes whose gauge generators realize a translationinvariant, free-fermion-solvable spin model. In this setting, errors are suppressed by a Hamiltonian whose terms are the gauge generators of the code and whose exact spectrum and eigenstates can be found via a generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation. Such solutions are characterized by the frustration graph of the Hamiltonian: the graph whose vertices are Hamiltonian terms, which are neighboring if the terms anticommute. We provide methods for embedding a given frustration graph in the anticommutation relations of a spin model and present the first known example of an exactly solvable spin model with a two-dimensional free-fermion description and exact topological qubits. This model can be viewed as a free-fermionized version of the two-dimensional Bacon-Shor code. Using graph-theoretic tools to study the unit cell, we give an efficient algorithm for deciding if a given translation-invariant spin model is solvable, and explicitly construct the solution. Further, we examine the energetics of these exactly solvable models from the graph-theoretic perspective and show that the relevant gaps of the spin model correspond to known graph-theoretic quantities: the skew energy and the median eigenvalue of an oriented graph. Finally, we numerically search for models which have large spectral gaps above the ground state spin configuration and thus exhibit particularly robust thermal suppression of errors. These results suggest that optimal models will have low dimensionality and odd coordination numbers, and that the primary limit to energetic error suppression is the skew energy difference between different symmetry sectors rather than single-particle excitations of the free fermions.",

We relate the two questions by comparing two tensor norms on the space of dichotomic quantum measurements: one characterizing measurement compatibility and the second one characterizing violations of a given Bell inequality. We provide sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the two notions in terms of the matrix describing the correlation Bell inequality.

Although one typically focuses on impulsive delta-like sources, as these give direct access to $n$-point Feynman propagators, we show in this work that using always-on harmonic sources can simplify substantially the sensing protocol. In a specific regime, the effective real-time dynamics of the quantum sensors can be described by a quantum Ising model with long-range couplings, the range and strength of which contains all the relevant information about the renormalisation of the QFT, which can now be extracted in the absence of multi-partite entanglement. We present a detailed analysis of how this sensing protocol can be relevant to characterise the long-wavelength QFT that describes quantised sound waves of trapped-ion crystals in the vicinity of a structural phase transition, opening a new route to characterise the associated renormalisation of sound.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that measurement-induced quantum back action (QBA) can be eliminated in composite systems by engineering so-called quantum-mechanics-free subspaces (QMFSs) of commuting variables, leading to a trajectory of a quantum system without quantum uncertainties. This situation can be realized in a composite system that includes a negative-mass subsystem, which can be implemented by, e.g., a polarized spin ensemble or a two-tone-driven optomechanical system. The realization of a trajectory without quantum uncertainties implies entanglement between the subsystems, and allows for measurements of motion, fields and forces with, in principle, unlimited precision. To date, these principles have been developed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally for a number of composite systems. However, the utility of the concept has been limited by the dominating requirement of close proximity of the resonance frequencies of the system of interest and the negative-mass reference system, and by the need to embed the subsystems in a narrowband cavity, which could be problematic while at the same time achieving good overcoupling. Here we propose a general approach which overcomes these limitations by employing periodic modulation of the driving fields (e.g., two-tone driving) in combination with coherent or measurement-based anti-noise paths. This approach makes it possible to engineer a QMFS of two systems with vastly different spectra and with arbitrary signs of their masses, while dispensing with the need to embed the subsystems in a sideband-resolving cavity. We discuss the advantages of this novel approach for applications such as QBA evasion in gravitational wave detection, force sensing, and entanglement generation between disparate systems.",

In this work, we identify a class of experimentally accessible quantum systems where thermal density matrices emerge from vacuum entanglement. We show that reduced density matrices of lower-dimensional subsystems embedded in $D$-dimensional gapped Dirac fermion vacuum, either on a lattice or continuum, have a thermal form with respect to a lower-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian. Strikingly, we show that vacuum entanglement can even conspire to make a subsystem of a gapped system at zero temperature appear as a hot gapless system. We propose concrete experiments in cold atom quantum simulators to observe the vacuum entanglement induced thermal states.",

A hyperﬁne-induced electro-nuclear controlled-phase (e-n-CPhase) gate operation, generated (up to local rotations) by merely holding an electron at a sweet-spot of maximum hyperﬁne strength for a speciﬁc duration of time, is predicted to be exceptionally resilient to charge/voltage noise.
