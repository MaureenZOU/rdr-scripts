    "abstract": "Quantum computers offer an intriguing path for a paradigmatic change of computing in the natural sciences and beyond, with the potential for achieving a so-called quantum advantage—namely, a significant (in some cases exponential) speedup of numerical simulations. The rapid development of hardware devices with various realizations of qubits enables the execution of small-scale but representative applications on quantum computers. In particular, the high-energy physics community plays a pivotal role in accessing the power of quantum computing, since the field is a driving source for challenging computational problems. This concerns, on the theoretical side, the exploration of models that are very hard or even impossible to address with classical techniques and, on the experimental side, the enormous data challenge of newly emerging experiments, such as the upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. In this Roadmap paper, led by CERN, DESY, and IBM, we provide the status of high-energy physics quantum computations and give examples of theoretical and experimental target benchmark applications, which can be addressed in the near future. Having in mind hardware with about 100 qubits capable of executing several thousand two-qubit gates, where possible, we also provide resource estimates for the examples given using error-mitigated quantum computing. The ultimate declared goal of this task force is therefore to trigger further research in the high-energy physics community to develop interesting use cases for demonstrations on near-term quantum computers.

    "abstract": "We report an accurate and efficient classical simulation of a kicked Ising quantum system on the heavy hexagon lattice. A simulation of this system was recently performed on a 127-qubit quantum processor using noise-mitigation techniques to enhance accuracy [Y. Kim ., Nature, 618, 500–5 (2023)]. Here we show that, by adopting a tensor network approach that reflects the geometry of the lattice and is approximately contracted using belief propagation, we can perform a classical simulation that is significantly more accurate and precise than the results obtained from the quantum processor and many other classical methods. We quantify the treelike correlations of the wave function in order to explain the accuracy of our belief propagation-based approach. We also show how our method allows us to perform simulations of the system to long times in the thermodynamic limit, corresponding to a quantum computer with an infinite number of qubits. Our tensor network approach has broader applications for simulating the dynamics of quantum systems with treelike correlations. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "The vacuum of the lattice Schwinger model is prepared on up to 100 qubits of IBM’s Eagle-processor quantum computers. A new algorithm to prepare the ground state of a gapped translationally invariant system on a quantum computer is presented, which we call “scalable circuits ADAPT-VQE” (SC-ADAPT-VQE). This algorithm uses the exponential decay of correlations between distant regions of the ground state, together with ADAPT-VQE, to construct quantum circuits for state preparation that can be scaled to arbitrarily large systems. These scalable circuits can be determined with use of classical computers, avoiding the challenging task of optimizing parameterized circuits on a quantum computer. SC-ADAPT-VQE is applied to the Schwinger model, and is shown to be systematically improvable, with an accuracy that converges exponentially with circuit depth.

    "abstract": "This tutorial article introduces the physics of quantum information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. The goals are to understand how to precisely quantify the spreading of quantum information and how causality emerges in complex quantum systems. We introduce a general framework to study the dynamics of quantum information, including detection and decoding. We show that the dynamics of quantum information is closely related to operator dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, and, under certain circumstances, can be precisely quantified by the so-called out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). The general behavior of the OTOC is discussed based on several toy models, including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, random circuit models, and Brownian models, in which the OTOC is analytically tractable. We introduce numerical methods, including exact diagonalization and tensor network methods, to calculate the OTOC for generic quantum many-body systems. We also survey current experimental schemes for measuring the OTOC in various quantum simulators.4 MoreReceived 14 February 2022Revised 9 May 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.010201Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Topological quantum memory can protect information against local errors up to finite error thresholds. Such thresholds are usually determined based on the success of decoding algorithms rather than the intrinsic properties of the mixed states describing corrupted memories. Here we provide an intrinsic characterization of the breakdown of topological quantum memory, which both gives a bound on the performance of decoding algorithms and provides examples of topologically distinct mixed states. We employ three information-theoretical quantities that can be regarded as generalizations of the diagnostics of ground-state topological order, and serve as a definition for topological order in error-corrupted mixed states. We consider the topological contribution to entanglement negativity and two other metrics based on quantum relative entropy and coherent information. In the concrete example of the two-dimensional (2D) Toric code with local bit-flip and phase errors, we map three quantities to observables in 2D classical spin models and analytically show they all undergo a transition at the same error threshold. This threshold is an upper bound on that achieved in any decoding algorithm and is indeed saturated by that in the optimal decoding algorithm for the Toric code.

    "abstract": "The possibility of engineering artificial Kitaev chains in arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow superconducting regions has emerged as an attractive way to overcome the disorder issues that complicate the realization and detection of topological superconducting phases in other platforms. Although a true topological phase would require long chains, a two-site chain realized in a double quantum dot can already be tuned to points in parameter space where it hosts zero-energy states that seem identical to the Majorana bound states that characterize a topological phase. These states have been named “poor man’s Majorana bound states” (PMMs) because they lack formal topological protection. In this work, we propose a pathway for next-generation experiments on PMMs. The pathway starts with experiments to characterize a single pair of PMMs by measuring the Majorana quality and then moves on to initialization and readout of the parity of a PMM pair, which allows the measurement of quasiparticle poisoning times. The next step is to couple two PMM systems to form a qubit. We discuss measurements of the coherence time of such a qubit, as well as a test of Majorana fusion rules in the same setup. Finally, we propose and analyze three different types of braidinglike experiments that require more complex device geometries. Our conclusions are supported by calculations based on a realistic model with interacting and spinful quantum dots, as well as by simpler models to gain physical insight. Our calculations show that it is indeed possible to demonstrate non-Abelian physics in minimal two-site Kitaev chains despite the lack of a true topological phase. However, our findings also reveal that doing so requires some extra care, appropriately modified protocols, and awareness of the details of this particular platform.

To suppress diabatic transitions, we include counterdiabatic driving in the optimization and utilize variational matrix product operators to represent adiabatic gauge potentials. Traditionally, Trotter product formulas are used to turn adiabatic time evolution into quantum circuits and the addition of counterdiabatic driving increases the circuit depth per time step. Instead, we classically optimize a parameterized quantum circuit of fixed depth to simultaneously capture adiabatic evolution together with counterdiabatic driving over many time steps. The methods are applied to the ground-state preparation of quantum Ising chains with transverse and longitudinal fields. We show that the classically optimized circuits can significantly outperform Trotter product formulas. Additionally, we discuss how the approach can be used for combinatorial optimization.

    "abstract": "Quantum simulation traditionally relies on unitary dynamics, inherently imposing efficiency constraints on the generation of intricate entangled states. In principle, these limitations can be superseded by nonunitary, dynamic circuits. These circuits exploit measurements alongside conditional feed-forward operations, providing a promising approach for long-range entangling gates, higher effective connectivity of near-term hardware, and more efficient state preparations. Here, we explore the utility of shallow dynamic circuits for creating long-range entanglement on large-scale quantum devices. Specifically, we study two tasks: controlled- gate teleportation between up to 101 qubits by feeding forward 99 midcircuit measurement outcomes, and the preparation of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states with genuine entanglement. In the former, we observe that dynamic circuits can outperform their unitary counterparts. In the latter, by tallying instructions of compiled quantum circuits, we provide an error budget detailing the obstacles that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of dynamic circuits. Looking forward, we expect dynamic circuits to be useful for generating long-range entanglement in the near term on large-scale quantum devices. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "Quantum neural network architectures that have little to no inductive biases are known to face trainability and generalization issues. Inspired by a similar problem, recent breakthroughs in machine learning address this challenge by creating models encoding the symmetries of the learning task. This is materialized through the usage of equivariant neural networks the action of which commutes with that of the symmetry. In this work, we import these ideas to the quantum realm by presenting a comprehensive theoretical framework to design equivariant quantum neural networks (EQNNs) for essentially any relevant symmetry group. We develop multiple methods to construct equivariant layers for EQNNs and analyze their advantages and drawbacks. Our methods can find unitary or general equivariant quantum channels efficiently even when the symmetry group is exponentially large or continuous. As a special implementation, we show how standard quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be generalized to group-equivariant QCNNs where both the convolution and pooling layers are equivariant to the symmetry group.

We show that different condensation processes are associated with a general class of domain walls, which can exist in both spacelike and timelike directions. This class includes semitransparent domain walls that condense certain subsets of anyons. We use our theory to classify topological objects and design novel fault-tolerant logic gates for the color code. As a final example, we also argue that dynamical “Floquet codes” can be viewed as a series of condensation operations. We propose a general construction for realizing planar dynamically driven codes based on condensation operations on the color code.

    "abstract": "In recent years, research in quantum computing has largely focused on two approaches: near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing and future fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). A growing body of research into early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) is exploring how to utilize quantum computers during the transition between these two eras. However, without agreed-upon characterizations of this transition, it is unclear how best to utilize EFTQC architectures. We argue for the perspective that this transition period will be characterized by a law of diminishing returns in quantum error correction (QEC), where the ability of the architecture to maintain quality operations at scale determines the point of diminishing returns. Two challenges emerge from this picture: how to model this phenomenon of diminishing return of QEC as the performance of devices is continually improving and how to design algorithms to make the most use of these devices. To address these challenges, we present models for the performance of EFTQC architectures, capturing the diminishing returns of QEC. We then use these models to elucidate the regimes in which algorithms suited to such architectures are advantageous. As a concrete example, we show that for the canonical task of phase estimation, in a regime of moderate scalability and using just over one million physical qubits, the “reach” of the quantum computer can be extended (compared to the standard approach) from 90-qubit instances to over 130-qubit instances using a simple early fault-tolerant quantum algorithm, which reduces the number of operations per circuit by a factor of 100 and increases the number of circuit repetitions by a factor of 10 000. This clarifies the role that such algorithms might play in the era of limited-scalability quantum computing. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "Assembling and maintaining large arrays of individually addressable atoms is a key requirement for continued scaling of neutral-atom-based quantum computers and simulators. In this work, we demonstrate a new paradigm for assembly of atomic arrays, based on a synergistic combination of optical tweezers and cavity-enhanced optical lattices, and the incremental filling of a target array from a repetitively filled reservoir. In this protocol, the tweezers provide microscopic rearrangement of atoms, while the cavity-enhanced lattices enable the creation of large numbers of optical traps with sufficient depth for rapid low-loss imaging of atoms. We apply this protocol to demonstrate near-deterministic filling (99% per-site occupancy) of 1225-site arrays of optical traps. Because the reservoir is repeatedly filled with fresh atoms, the array can be maintained in a filled state indefinitely. We anticipate that this protocol will be compatible with mid-circuit reloading of atoms into a quantum processor, which will be a key capability for running large-scale error-corrected quantum computations whose durations exceed the lifetime of a single atom in the system.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of observing quantum collective phenomena emerging from large numbers of measurements. These phenomena are difficult to observe in conventional experiments because, in order to distinguish the effects of measurement from dephasing, it is necessary to postselect on sets of measurement outcomes with Born probabilities that are exponentially small in the number of measurements performed. An unconventional approach, which avoids this exponential “postselection problem”, is to construct cross-correlations between experimental data and the results of simulations on classical computers. However, these cross-correlations generally have no definite relation to physical quantities. We first show how to incorporate classical shadows into this framework, thereby allowing for the construction of quantum information-theoretic cross-correlations. We then identify cross-correlations that both upper and lower bound the measurement-averaged von Neumann entanglement entropy, as well as cross-correlations that lower bound the measurement-averaged purity and entanglement negativity. These bounds show that experiments can be performed to constrain postmeasurement entanglement without the need for postselection. To illustrate our technique, we consider how it could be used to observe the measurement-induced entanglement transition in Haar-random quantum circuits. We use exact numerical calculations as proxies for quantum simulations and, to highlight the fundamental limitations of classical memory, we construct cross-correlations with tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension. Our results reveal a signature of measurement-induced criticality that can be observed using a quantum simulator in polynomial time and with polynomial classical memory.

    "abstract": "Encoding information redundantly using quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes allows one to overcome the inherent sensitivity to noise in quantum computers to ultimately achieve large-scale quantum computation. The Steane QEC method involves preparing an auxiliary logical qubit of the same QEC code as used for the data register. The data and auxiliary registers are then coupled with a logical controlled- () gate, enabling a measurement of the auxiliary register to reveal the error syndrome. This study presents the implementation of multiple rounds of fault-tolerant (FT) Steane QEC on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Various QEC codes are employed and the results are compared to a previous experimental approach utilizing flag qubits. Our experimental findings show improved logical fidelities for Steane QEC and accompanying numerical simulations indicate an even larger performance advantage for quantum processors limited by entangling-gate errors. This establishes experimental Steane QEC as a competitive paradigm for FT quantum computing. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "Demonstrating quantum advantage requires experimental implementation of a computational task that is hard to achieve using state-of-the-art classical systems. One approach is to perform sampling from a probability distribution associated with a certain class of highly entangled many-body wave functions. It has been suggested that such a quantum advantage can be certified with the (XEB). We critically examine this notion. First, we consider a “benign” setting, where an honest implementation of a noisy quantum circuit is assumed, and characterize the conditions under which the XEB approximates the of quantum dynamics. Second, we assume an “adversarial” setting, where all possible classical algorithms are considered for comparisons, and show that achieving relatively high XEB values does not imply faithful simulation of quantum dynamics. Specifically, we present an efficient classical algorithm that achieves high XEB values, namely 5–12% of those obtained in the state-of-the-art experiments, within just a few seconds using a single GPU machine. This is made possible by identifying and exploiting several vulnerabilities of the XEB, which allows us to achieve high XEB values without simulating a full quantum circuit. Remarkably, our algorithm features with the system size than a noisy quantum device for commonly studied random circuit ensembles in various architecture. We quantitatively explain the success of our algorithm and the limitations of the XEB by using a theoretical framework, in which the dynamics of the average XEB and fidelity are mapped to classical statistical mechanics models. Using this framework, we illustrate the relation between the XEB and the fidelity for quantum circuits in various architectures, with different choices of gate sets, and in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results demonstrate that XEB’s utility as a proxy for fidelity hinges on several conditions, which should be independently checked in the benign setting, but cannot be assumed in the general adversarial setting. Therefore, the XEB on its own has a limited utility as a benchmark for quantum advantage. We briefly discuss potential ways to overcome these limitations.

In recent years, numerous theoretical protocols for remote-entanglement generation have been proposed, many of which have been experimentally realized.

Our framework categorizes existing protocols at various levels of abstraction and allows for combining the elements of different schemes in new ways.

    "abstract": "Logical qubits can be protected from decoherence by performing quantum error-correction (QEC) cycles repeatedly. Algorithms for fault-tolerant QEC must be compiled to the specific hardware platform under consideration in order to practically realize a quantum memory that operates for in principle arbitrary long times. All circuit components must be assumed as noisy unless specific assumptions about the form of the noise are made. Modern QEC schemes are challenging to implement experimentally in physical architectures where in-sequence measurements and feed forward of classical information cannot be reliably executed fast enough or even at all. Here we provide a novel scheme to perform QEC cycles without the need of measuring qubits that is fully fault-tolerant with respect to all components used in the circuit. Our scheme can be used for any low-distance CSS code since its only requirement towards the underlying code is a transversal gate. Similarly to Steane-type EC, we coherently copy errors to a logical auxiliary qubit but then apply a coherent feedback operation from the auxiliary system to the logical data qubit. The logical auxiliary qubit is prepared fault tolerantly without measurements, too. We benchmark logical failure rates of the scheme in comparison to a flag-qubit-based EC cycle. We map out a parameter region where our scheme is feasible and estimate physical error rates necessary to achieve the break-even point of beneficial QEC with our scheme. We outline how our scheme could be implemented in ion traps and with neutral atoms in a tweezer array. For recently demonstrated capabilities of atom shuttling and native multiatom Rydberg gates, we achieve moderate circuit depths and beneficial performance of our scheme while not breaking fault tolerance. These results thereby enable practical fault-tolerant QEC in hardware architectures that do not support midcircuit measurements. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) currently stand as the most efficient techniques for implementing functions of block-encoded matrices, a central task that lies at the heart of most prominent quantum algorithms. However, current QSP approaches face several challenges, such as the restrictions imposed on the family of achievable polynomials and the difficulty of calculating the required phase angles for specific transformations. In this paper, we present a generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP) approach, employing general SU(2) rotations as our signal-processing operators, rather than relying solely on rotations in a single basis. Our approach lifts all practical restrictions on the family of achievable transformations, with the sole remaining condition being that <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mrow><a:mo stretchy=\"false\">|</a:mo></a:mrow><a:mi>P</a:mi><a:mrow><a:mo stretchy=\"false\">|</a:mo></a:mrow><a:mo>≤</a:mo><a:mn>1</a:mn></a:math>, a restriction necessary due to the unitary nature of quantum computation.

While originally studied in pointlike ensembles, this phenomenon persists in extended ordered systems if the interparticle distance is below a certain bound. Here, we investigate Dicke superradiance in a realistic experimental setting using ordered arrays of alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, such as strontium and ytterbium. Such atoms offer exciting new opportunities for light-matter interactions, as their internal structure allows for trapping at short interatomic distances compared to their long-wavelength transitions, providing the potential for collectively enhanced dissipative interactions. Despite their intricate electronic structure, we show that two-dimensional arrays of these atomic species should exhibit many-body superradiance for achievable lattice constants. Moreover, superradiance effectively “closes” transitions, such that multilevel atoms become more two-level like. This occurs because the avalanchelike decay funnels the emission of most photons into the dominant transition, overcoming the single-atom decay ratios dictated by their fine structure and Zeeman branching. Our work represents an important step in harnessing alkaline-earth atoms as quantum optical sources and as platforms to explore many-body dissipative dynamics.

Thus, recently discovered measurement-induced transitions between highly entangling and low-entanglement dynamics are phase transitions in classical simulability. Here, we study simulability transitions beyond entanglement: noting that some highly entangling dynamics (e.g., integrable systems or Clifford circuits) are easy to classically simulate, thus requiring “magic”—a subtle form of quantum resource—to achieve computational hardness, we ask how the dynamics of magic competes with measurements.

We find cases where transitions in magic and entanglement coincide, but also others with a magic and simulability transition in a highly (volume-law) entangled phase. In establishing our results, we use Pauli-based computation, a scheme distilling the quantum essence of the dynamics to a magic state register subject to mutually commuting measurements.

    "abstract": "One of the most prominent application areas for quantum computers is solving hard constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. However, detailed analyses of the complexity of standard quantum algorithms have suggested that outperforming classical methods for these problems would require extremely large and powerful quantum computers. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed for near-term quantum computers, yet previous work has shown strong limitations on the ability of QAOA to outperform classical algorithms for optimization problems. Here we instead apply QAOA to hard constraint satisfaction problems, where both classical and quantum algorithms are expected to require exponential time. We analytically characterize the average success probability of QAOA on a constraint satisfaction problem commonly studied using statistical physics methods: random <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mi>k</a:mi></a:math>-SAT at the threshold for satisfiability, as the number of variables <d:math xmlns:d=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><d:mi>n</d:mi></d:math> goes to infinity.

We then compare QAOA with leading classical solvers. For random 8-SAT, we find that for more than 14 quantum circuit layers, QAOA achieves more efficient scaling than the highest-performance classical solver we tested, WalkSATlm.

This work studies the effect of quantum jumps on the entanglement dynamics beyond the no-click limit corresponding to a deterministic non-Hermitian evolution. To this aim, we introduce a new tool that looks at the statistics of entanglement-entropy gain and loss after and in between quantum jumps. This insight allows us to build a simple stochastic model of a random walk with partial resetting, which reproduces the entanglement dynamics, and to dissect the mutual role of jumps and non-Hermitian evolution on the entanglement scaling. We apply these ideas to the study of measurement-induced transitions in monitored fermions.

We provide evidence for “symmetry-enforced separability transitions” in a variety of states, where in one regime the mixed state is expressible as a convex sum of symmetric short-range-entangled pure states, while in the other regime, such a representation is not feasible. We first discuss the Gibbs state of Hamiltonians that exhibit spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry, and argue that the associated thermal phase transition can be thought of as a symmetry-enforced separability transition. Next we study cluster states in various dimensions subjected to local decoherence, and identify several distinct mixed-state phases and associated separability phase transitions, which also provides an alternative perspective on recently discussed “average symmetry-protected topological order.” We also study decohered <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mi>p</a:mi><a:mo>+</a:mo><a:mi>i</a:mi><a:mi>p</a:mi></a:math> superconductors, and find that if the decoherence breaks the fermion parity explicitly, then the resulting mixed state can be expressed as a convex sum of nonchiral states, while a fermion parity–preserving decoherence results in a phase transition at a nonzero threshold that corresponds to spontaneous breaking of fermion parity. Finally, we briefly discuss systems that satisfy the no low-energy trivial state property, such as the recently discovered good low-density parity-check codes, and argue that the Gibbs state of such systems exhibits a temperature-tuned separability transition.

Examples include gate sequences benefiting from midcircuit real-time measurement-based feedback, such as qubit initialization, entanglement generation, teleportation, and, perhaps most importantly, quantum error correction. A prominent and widely used readout approach is based on the dispersive interaction of a superconducting qubit strongly coupled to a large-bandwidth readout resonator, frequently combined with a dedicated or shared Purcell filter protecting qubits from decay. By dynamically reducing the qubit-resonator detuning and thus increasing the dispersive shift, we demonstrate a beyond-state-of-the-art two-state-readout error of only 0.25% in 100-ns integration time. Maintaining low-readout-drive strength, we nearly quadruple the signal-to-noise ratio of the readout by doubling the readout-mode line width, which we quantify by considering the hybridization of the readout resonator and its dedicated Purcell filter. We find excellent agreement between our experimental data and our theoretical model. The presented results are expected to further boost the performance of new and existing algorithms and protocols critically depending on high-fidelity fast midcircuit measurements.

Here, we propose and demonstrate a nonlinear Purcell filter that suppresses such an undesirable dephasing process without sacrificing the readout performance. When a readout pulse is applied, the filter automatically reduces the effective linewidth of the readout resonator, increasing the sensitivity of the qubit to the input field. The noise tolerance of the device we have fabricated is shown to be enhanced by a factor of 3 relative to a device with a linear filter. The measurement rate is enhanced by another factor of 3 by utilizing the bifurcation of the nonlinear filter. A readout fidelity of 99.4% and a quantum nondemolition fidelity of 99.2% are achieved using a 40-ns readout pulse. The nonlinear Purcell filter will be an effective tool for realizing a fast, high-fidelity readout without compromising the coherence time of the qubit.

    "abstract": "Exploiting the power of quantum computation to realize superior machine learning algorithms has been a major research focus of recent years, but the prospects of quantum machine learning (QML) remain dampened by considerable technical challenges. A particularly significant issue is that generic QML models suffer from so-called barren plateaus in their training landscapes—large regions where cost function gradients vanish exponentially in the number of qubits employed, rendering large models effectively untrainable. A leading strategy for combating this effect is to build problem-specific models that take into account the symmetries of their data in order to focus on a smaller, relevant subset of Hilbert space. In this work, we introduce a family of rotationally equivariant QML models built upon the quantum Fourier transform, and leverage recent insights from the Lie-algebraic study of QML models to prove that (a subset of) our models do not exhibit barren plateaus. In addition to our analytical results we numerically test our rotationally equivariant models on a dataset of simulated scanning tunneling microscope images of phosphorus impurities in silicon, where rotational symmetry naturally arises, and find that they dramatically outperform their generic counterparts in practice.

    "abstract": "Quantum computers are expected to drastically accelerate certain computing tasks versus classical computers. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, which have tens to hundreds of noisy physical qubits, are gradually becoming available, but it is still challenging to achieve useful quantum advantages in meaningful tasks. On the other hand, full fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) based on quantum error correction code remains far beyond realization due to its extremely large requirement of high-precision physical qubits. In this study, we propose a quantum computing architecture to close the gap between NISQ and FTQC architectures. Our architecture is based on erroneous arbitrary rotation gates and error-corrected Clifford gates implemented by lattice surgery. We omit the typical distillation protocol to achieve direct analog rotations and small qubit requirements, and minimize the remnant errors of the rotations by a carefully designed state injection protocol.

    "abstract": "We propose and implement a family of quantum-informed recursive optimization (QIRO) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. Our approach leverages quantum resources to obtain information that is used in problem-specific classical reduction steps that recursively simplify the problem. These reduction steps address the limitations of the quantum component (e.g., locality) and ensure solution feasibility in constrained optimization problems. Additionally, we use backtracking techniques to further improve the performance of the algorithm without increasing the requirements on the quantum hardware. We showcase the capabilities of our approach by informing QIRO with correlations from classical simulations of shallow circuits of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, solving instances of maximum independent set and maximum satisfiability problems with hundreds of variables. We also demonstrate how QIRO can be deployed on a neutral atom quantum processor to find large independent sets of graphs. In summary, our scheme achieves results comparable to classical heuristics even with relatively weak quantum resources. Furthermore, enhancing the quality of these quantum resources improves the performance of the algorithms. Notably, the modular nature of QIRO offers various avenues for modifications, positioning our work as a template for a broader class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for combinatorial optimization.

    "abstract": "In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation, and properties of some of the main quasiprobabilities that can describe the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times. Such statistics incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. We particularly focus on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and related distributions. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. Once defined the fundamental concepts following the standpoint of joint measurability in quantum mechanics, we illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium nondriven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, and quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance, the Ising model with a transverse field. Throughout the tutorial, we meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.

    "abstract": "Monitored quantum dynamics—unitary evolution interspersed with measurements—has recently emerged as a rich domain for phase structure in quantum many-body systems away from equilibrium. Here we study monitored dynamics from the point of view of an eavesdropper who has access to the classical measurement outcomes, but not to the quantum many-body system. We show that a measure of information flow from the quantum system to the classical measurement record—the informational power—undergoes a phase transition in correspondence with the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). This transition determines the eavesdropper's (in)ability to learn properties of an unknown initial quantum state of the system, given a complete classical description of the monitored dynamics and arbitrary classical computational resources. We make this learnability transition concrete by defining classical shadow protocols that the eavesdropper may apply to this problem, and show that the MIPT manifests as a transition in the sample complexity of various shadow-estimation tasks, which become harder in the low-measurement phase. We focus on three applications of interest: Pauli expectation values (where we find the MIPT appears as a point of optimal learnability for typical Pauli operators), many-body fidelity, and global charge in U(1)-symmetric dynamics. Our work unifies different manifestations of the MIPT under the umbrella of learnability and gives this notion a general operational meaning via classical shadows.Received 13 November 2023Accepted 20 March 2024DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.020304Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Floquet codes are a novel class of quantum error-correcting codes with dynamically generated logical qubits arising from a periodic schedule of noncommuting measurements. We utilize the interpretation of measurements in terms of condensation of topological excitations and the rewinding of measurement sequences to engineer new examples of Floquet codes. In particular, rewinding is advantageous for obtaining a desired set of instantaneous stabilizer groups on both toric and planar layouts. Our first example is a Floquet code with instantaneous stabilizer codes that have the same topological order as the three-dimensional (3D) toric code(s). This Floquet code also exhibits a splitting of the topological order of the 3D toric code under the associated sequence of measurements, i.e., an instantaneous stabilizer group of a single copy of the 3D toric code in one round transforms into an instantaneous stabilizer group of two copies of the 3D toric code up to nonlocal stabilizers in the following round. We further construct boundaries for this 3D code and argue that stacking it with two copies of the 3D subsystem toric code allows for a transversal implementation of the logical non-Clifford controlled-controlled-<a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mi>Z</a:mi></a:math> gate. We also show that the coupled-layer construction of the X-cube Floquet code can be modified by a rewinding schedule such that each of the instantaneous stabilizer codes is finite depth equivalent to the X-cube model up to toric codes; the X-cube Floquet code exhibits a splitting of the X-cube model into a copy of the X-cube model and toric codes under the measurement sequence. Our final 3D example is a generalization of the 2D Floquet toric code on the honeycomb lattice to three dimensions, which has instantaneous stabilizer codes with the same topological order as the 3D fermionic toric code.

    "abstract": "Adaptive quantum circuits, which combine local unitary gates, midcircuit measurements, and feedforward operations, have recently emerged as a promising avenue for efficient state preparation, particularly on near-term quantum devices limited to shallow-depth circuits. Matrix product states (MPS) comprise a significant class of many-body entangled states, efficiently describing the ground states of one-dimensional gapped local Hamiltonians and finding applications in a number of recent quantum algorithms. Recently, it has been shown that the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state—a paradigmatic example of an MPS—can be exactly prepared with an adaptive quantum circuit of constant depth, an impossible feat with local unitary gates alone due to its nonzero correlation length [Smith , PRX Quantum 4, 020315 (2023)]. In this work, we broaden the scope of this approach and demonstrate that a diverse class of MPS can be exactly prepared using constant-depth adaptive quantum circuits, outperforming theoretically optimal preparation with unitary circuits. We show that this class includes short- and long-ranged entangled MPS, symmetry-protected topological (SPT) and symmetry-broken states, MPS with finite Abelian, non-Abelian, and continuous symmetries, resource states for MBQC, and families of states with tunable correlation length. Moreover, we illustrate the utility of our framework for designing constant-depth sampling protocols, such as for random MPS or for generating MPS in a particular SPT phase. We present sufficient conditions for particular MPS to be preparable in constant time, with global on-site symmetry playing a pivotal role. Altogether, this work demonstrates the immense promise of adaptive quantum circuits for efficiently preparing many-body entangled states and provides explicit algorithms that outperform known protocols to prepare an essential class of states.

Higher qubit operating temperatures would significantly increase the cooling power available, which is desirable for scaling up the number of qubits in quantum computing architectures and integrating qubits in experiments requiring increased heat dissipation. To operate superconducting qubits at higher temperatures, it is necessary to address both quasiparticle decoherence (which becomes significant for aluminum junctions above 160 mK) and dephasing from thermal microwave photons (which are problematic above 50 mK). Using low-loss niobium-trilayer junctions, which have reduced sensitivity to quasiparticles due to the higher superconducting transition temperature of niobium, we fabricate transmons with higher frequencies than previously studied, up to 24 GHz. We measure decoherence and dephasing times of about <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mn>1</a:mn><a:mspace width=\"0.2em\"/><a:mtext fontfamily=\"times\">μ</a:mtext><a:mrow><a:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</a:mi></a:mrow></a:math>, corresponding to average qubit quality factors of approximately <g:math xmlns:g=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><g:msup><g:mn>10</g:mn><g:mn>5</g:mn></g:msup></g:math>, and find that decoherence is unaffected by quasiparticles up to <j:math xmlns:j=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><j:mn>1</j:mn><j:mspace width=\"0.2em\"/><j:mrow><j:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">K</j:mi></j:mrow></j:math>.

    "abstract": "High-harmonic generation is a light up-conversion process occurring in a strong laser field, leading to coherent bursts of extreme ultrashort broadband radiation [Lewenstein , Phys. Rev. A , 2117 (1994)]. As a new perspective, we propose that ultrafast strong-field electronic or photonic processes such as high-harmonic generation can potentially generate nonclassical states of light well before the decoherence of the system occurs [Gorlach , Nat. Commun. , 4598 (2020); Stammer ., Phys. Rev. Lett. , 123603 (2022)]. This could address fundamental challenges in quantum technology such as scalability, decoherence, or the generation of massively entangled states [Lewenstein , Luca Argenti Michael Chini, 27 (2024)]. Here, we report experimental evidence of the nonclassical nature of the harmonic emission in several semiconductors excited by a femtosecond infrared laser. By investigating single- and double-beam intensity cross-correlation [Loudon, Rep. Prog. Phys. , 913 (1980)], we measure characteristic nonclassical features in the single-photon statistics. We observe two-mode squeezing in the generated harmonic radiation, which depends on the laser intensity that governs the transition from super-Poissonian to Poissonian photon statistics. The measured violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality realizes a direct test of multipartite entanglement in high-harmonic generation [Wasak, Phys. Rev. A , 033616 (2014)]. This result is supported by the theory of multimodal detection and the Hamiltonian from which the effective squeezing modes of the harmonics can be derived [Gonoskov , Phys. Rev. B , 125110 (2024); Christ New J. Phys. , 033027 (2011)]. With this work, we show experimentally that high-harmonic generation is a new quantum bosonic platform that intrinsically produces nonclassical states of light with unique features such as multipartite broadband entanglement or multimode squeezing. The source operates at room temperature, using standard semiconductors and a standard commercial fiber laser, opening up new routes for the quantum industry, such as optical quantum computing, communication, and imaging.

    "abstract": "We address how one can empirically infer properties of quantum states generated by dynamics involving measurements. Our focus is on many-body settings where the number of measurements is extensive, making brute-force approaches based on postselection intractable due to their exponential sample complexity. We introduce a general-purpose scheme that can be used to infer any property of the post-measurement ensemble of states (e.g. the average entanglement entropy, or frame potential) using a scalable number of experimental repetitions. We first identify a general class of estimable properties that can be directly extracted from experimental data. Then, based on empirical observations of such quantities, we show how one can indirectly infer information about any particular given non-estimable quantity of interest through classical post-processing. Our approach is based on an optimization task, where one asks what are the minimum and maximum values that the desired quantity could possibly take, while ensuring consistency with observations. The true value of this quantity must then lie within a feasible range between these extrema, resulting in two-sided bounds. Narrow feasible ranges can be obtained by using a classical simulation of the device to determine which estimable properties one should measure. Even in cases where this simulation is inaccurate, unambiguous information about the true value of a given quantity realised on the quantum device can be learned. As an immediate application, we show that our method can be used to verify the emergence of quantum state designs in experiments. We identify some fundamental obstructions that in some cases prevent sharp knowledge of a given quantity from being inferred, and discuss what can be learned in cases where classical simulation is too computationally demanding to be feasible.",

    "abstract": "While quantum state tomography is notoriously hard, most states hold little interest to practically minded tomographers. Given that states and unitaries appearing in nature are of bounded gate complexity, it is natural to ask if efficient learning becomes possible.

    "abstract": "Quantum algorithms for ground-state energy estimation of chemical systems require a high-quality initial state. However, initial state preparation is commonly either neglected entirely, or assumed to be solved by a simple product state like Hartree-Fock. Even if a nontrivial state is prepared, strong correlations render ground-state overlap inadequate for quality assessment. In this work, we address the initial state preparation problem with an end-to-end algorithm that and the quality of initial states, accomplishing the latter with a new metric—the energy distribution. To be able to prepare more complicated initial states, we introduce an implementation technique for states in the form of a sum of Slater determinants that exhibits significantly better scaling than all prior approaches. We also propose low-precision quantum phase estimation (QPE) for further state quality refinement. The complete algorithm is capable of generating high-quality states for energy estimation, and is shown in select cases to lower the overall estimation cost by several orders of magnitude when compared with the best single product state ansatz. More broadly, the energy distribution picture suggests that the goal of QPE should be reinterpreted as generating improvements compared to the energy of the initial state and other classical estimates: such an improvement can still be achieved even if QPE does not project directly onto the ground state. Finally, we show how the energy distribution can help in identifying potential quantum advantage. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "Long-distance entanglement distribution is the key task for quantum networks, enabling applications such as secure communication and distributed quantum computing. In this work, we take a crucial step toward this task by sharing entanglement over long optical fibers between a single 87Rb atom and a single photon. High fidelity of the atomic state could be maintained during long flight times through such fibers by prolonging the coherence time of the single atom to 10 ms based on encoding in long-lived states. In addition, the attenuation in the fibers is minimized by converting the wavelength of the photon to the telecom S band via polarization-preserving quantum frequency conversion. These improvements enable us to observe entanglement between the atomic quantum memory and the emitted photons transmitted through standard spooled telecom fibers with a length of 101 km with a fidelity of 70.8±2.4%. This fidelity is comparable to recent demonstrations over 20 km, despite the channel loss now significantly exceeding 20 dB. In fact, now the reduction in fidelity is due to detector dark counts rather than loss of coherence of the atom or photon, proving the suitability of our platform to realize city-to-city-scale quantum network links.2 MoreReceived 7 August 2023Revised 23 December 2023Accepted 6 March 2024DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.020307Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Repeated projective measurements in unitary circuits can lead to an entanglement phase transition as the measurement rate is tuned. In this work, we consider a different setting in which the projective measurements are replaced by dynamically chosen unitary gates that minimize the entanglement. This can be seen as a one-dimensional unitary circuit game in which two players get to place unitary gates on randomly assigned bonds at different rates: the \"entangler\" applies a random local unitary gate with the aim of generating extensive (volume-law) entanglement. The \"disentangler,\" based on limited knowledge about the state, chooses a unitary gate to reduce the entanglement entropy on the assigned bond with the goal of limiting to only finite (area-law) entanglement. In order to elucidate the resulting entanglement dynamics, we consider three different scenarios: (i) a classical discrete height model, (ii) a Clifford circuit, and (iii) a general U(4) unitary circuit. We find that both the classical and Clifford circuit models exhibit phase transitions as a function of the rate that the disentangler places a gate, which have similar properties that can be understood through a connection to the stochastic Fredkin chain. In contrast, the entangler always wins when using Haar random unitary gates and we observe extensive, volume-law entanglement for all nonzero rates of entangling.5 MoreReceived 30 June 2023Accepted 14 December 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.010309Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

However, due to the fundamental trade-off between gate fidelity and execution time, as well as limited scalability, the use of cavity QED for quantum computation was overtaken by other architectures. Here, we introduce a new element into cavity QED—a free charged particle, acting as a flying qubit. Using free electrons as a specific example, we demonstrate that our approach enables ultrafast, deterministic, and universal discrete-variable quantum computation in a cavity-QED-based architecture, with potentially improved scalability. Our proposal hinges on a novel excitation blockade mechanism in a resonant interaction between a free-electron and a cavity polariton. This nonlinear interaction is faster by several orders of magnitude with respect to current photon-based cavity-QED gates, enjoys wide tunability and can demonstrate fidelities close to unity. Furthermore, our scheme is ubiquitous to any cavity nonlinearity, either due to light-matter coupling as in the Jaynes-Cummings model or due to photon-photon interactions as in a Kerr-type many-body system. In addition to promising advancements in cavity-QED quantum computation, our approach paves the way towards ultrafast and deterministic generation of highly entangled photonic graph states and is applicable to other quantum technologies involving cavity QED.

    "abstract": "During time evolution of many-body systems entanglement grows rapidly, limiting exact simulations to small-scale systems or small timescales. Quantum information tends, however, to flow towards larger scales without returning to local scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly affect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum information in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to large-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently introduced to organize quantum information into different scales, allowing us to define and that we employ to systematically discard long-range quantum correlations in a controlled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems up to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by solving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the information flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale information. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the microscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at which information is discarded, while using the state at the maximum scale to accurately obtain the information flow. The resulting algorithm, which we call local-information time evolution, is highly versatile and suitable for investigating many-body quantum dynamics in both closed and open quantum systems with diverse hydrodynamic behaviors.

    "abstract": "Qubit decoherence unavoidably degrades the fidelity of quantum logic gates. Accordingly, realizing gates that are as fast as possible is a guiding principle for qubit control, necessitating protocols for mitigating error channels that become significant as gate time is decreased. One such error channel arises from the counter-rotating component of strong, linearly polarized drives. This error channel is particularly important when gate times approach the qubit Larmor period and represents the dominant source of infidelity for sufficiently fast single-qubit gates with low-frequency qubits such as fluxonium. In this work, we develop and demonstrate two complementary protocols for mitigating this error channel. The first protocol realizes circularly polarized driving in circuit QED through simultaneous charge and flux control. The second protocol—commensurate pulses—leverages the coherent and periodic nature of counter-rotating fields to regularize their contributions to gates, enabling single-qubit gate fidelities reliably exceeding 99.997%. This protocol is platform independent and requires no additional calibration overhead. This work establishes straightforward strategies for mitigating counter-rotating effects from strong drives in circuit QED and other platforms, which we expect to be helpful in the effort to realize high-fidelity control for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

    "abstract": "Chaotic systems are highly sensitive to a small perturbation and are ubiquitous throughout the biological sciences, the physical sciences, and even the social sciences. Taking this as the underlying principle, we construct an operational notion for quantum chaos. Namely, we demand that the future state of a many-body isolated quantum system is sensitive to past multitime operations on a small subpart of that system. By “sensitive,” we mean that the resultant states from two different perturbations cannot easily be transformed into each other. That is, the pertinent quantity is the complexity of the effect of the perturbation within the final state. From this intuitive metric, which we call the butterfly-flutter fidelity, we use the language of multitime quantum processes to identify a series of operational conditions on chaos; in particular, the scaling of the spatiotemporal entanglement. Our criteria already contain the routine notions, as well as the well-known diagnostics for quantum chaos. This includes the Peres-Loschmidt echo, dynamical entropy, tripartite mutual information, and local-operator entanglement. We hence present a unified framework for these existing diagnostics within a single structure. We also go on to quantify how several mechanisms, such as evolution generated from random circuits, lead to quantum chaos. Our work paves the way to systematically study many-body dynamical phenomena such as many-body localization, measurement-induced phase transitions, and Floquet dynamics.

    "abstract": "We realize arbitrary-wave-form-based control of spin-selective recombination reactions of radical pairs in the low-magnetic-field regime. To this end, we extend the gradient-ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) paradigm to allow for optimizing reaction yields. This overcomes drawbacks of previously suggested time-local optimization approaches for the reaction control of radical pairs, which were limited to high biasing fields. We demonstrate how efficient time-global optimization of the recombination yields can be realized by gradient-based methods augmented by time blocking, sparse sampling of the yield, and evaluation of the central single time-step propagators and their Fréchet derivatives using iterated Trotter-Suzuki splittings. Results are shown for both a toy model, previously used to demonstrate coherent control of radical-pair reactions in the simpler high-field scenario and, furthermore, for a realistic exciplex-forming donor-acceptor system comprising 16 nuclear spins. This raises prospects for the spin control of actual radical-pair systems in ambient magnetic fields, by suppressing or boosting radical reaction yields using purpose-specific radio-frequency wave forms, paving the way for reaction-yield-dependent quantum magnetometry and potentially applications of quantum control to biochemical radical-pair reactions. We demonstrate the latter aspect for two radical pairs implicated in quantum biology.2 MoreReceived 26 June 2023Revised 15 January 2024Accepted 7 March 2024DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.020303Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "We construct a fault-tolerant quantum error-correcting protocol based on a qubit encoded in a large spin qudit using a spin-cat code, analogous to the continuous-variable cat encoding. With this, we can correct the dominant error sources, namely processes that can be expressed as error operators that are linear or quadratic in the components of angular momentum. Such codes tailored to dominant error sources can exhibit superior thresholds and lower resource overheads when compared to those designed for unstructured noise models. A key component is the gate that preserves the rank of spherical tensor operators. Categorizing the dominant errors as phase and amplitude errors, we demonstrate how phase errors, analogous to phase-flip errors for qubits, can be effectively corrected. Furthermore, we propose a measurement-free error-correction scheme to address amplitude errors without relying on syndrome measurements. Through an in-depth analysis of logical gate errors, we establish that the fault-tolerant threshold for error correction in the spin-cat encoding surpasses that of standard qubit-based encodings. We consider a specific implementation based on neutral-atom quantum computing, with qudits encoded in the nuclear spin of <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:msup><a:mi/><a:mn>87</a:mn></a:msup><a:mi>Sr</a:mi></a:math>, and show how to generate the universal gate set, including the rank-preserving gate, using quantum control and the Rydberg blockade.

This exceeds the microscopic timescales by 6 orders of magnitude and approaches the perfect hysteresis expected between two macroscopic attractors in the thermodynamic limit. These findings and interpretation are qualitatively supported by neoclassical theory and large-scale quantum-jump Monte Carlo simulations. Besides shedding more light on driven-dissipative physics in the limit of strong light-matter coupling, this system might also find applications in quantum sensing and metrology.

    "abstract": "The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error-correcting code encodes a finite-dimensional logical space in one or more bosonic modes, and has recently been demonstrated in trapped ions and superconducting microwave cavities. In this work we introduce a new subsystem decomposition for GKP codes that we call the stabilizer subsystem decomposition, analogous to the usual approach to quantum stabilizer codes. The decomposition has the defining property that a partial trace over the nonlogical stabilizer subsystem is equivalent to an ideal decoding of the logical state, distinguishing it from previous GKP subsystem decompositions. We describe how to decompose arbitrary states across the subsystem decomposition using a set of transformations that move between the decompositions of different GKP codes. Besides providing a convenient theoretical view on GKP codes, such a decomposition is also of practical use. We use the stabilizer subsystem decomposition to efficiently simulate noise acting on single-mode GKP codes, and in contrast to more conventional Fock basis simulations, we are able to consider essentially arbitrarily large photon numbers for realistic noise channels, such as loss and dephasing.

The physical origins of this single-shot property remain elusive, in part due to the scarcity of known models. To address this challenge, we provide a systematic construction of a class of topological subsystem codes in three dimensions built from Abelian quantum double models in one fewer dimension. Our construction not only generalizes the recently introduced subsystem toric code [Kubica and Vasmer, Nat. Commun. , 6272 (2022)] but also provides a new perspective on several aspects of the original model, including the origin of the Gauss law for gauge flux, and boundary conditions for the code family. We then numerically study the performance of the first few codes in this class against phenomenological noise to verify their single-shot property. Lastly, we discuss Hamiltonians naturally associated with these codes, and argue that they may be gapless. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of integrable systems is the purely elastic scattering of their excitations. Such systems possess an extensive number of locally conserved charges, leading to the conservation of the number of scattered excitations, as well as their set of individual momenta. In this work, we show that inelastic decay can nevertheless be observed in circuit-QED realizations of integrable boundary models. We consider the scattering of microwave photons off impurities in superconducting circuits implementing the boundary sine-Gordon and Kondo models, which are both integrable. We show that not only is inelastic decay possible for the microwave photons, in spite of integrability, and due to a nonlinear relation between them and the elastically scattered excitations, but also that integrability in fact provides powerful analytical tools allowing us to obtain exact expressions for response functions describing the inelastic decay. Using the framework of form factors, we calculate the total inelastic decay rate and elastic phase shift of the microwave photons, extracted from a two-point response function. We then go beyond linear response and obtain the exact energy-resolved inelastic decay spectrum, using a novel method to evaluate form-factor expansions of three-point response functions, which could prove useful in other applications of integrable quantum field theories. Our results could be relevant to several recent photon-splitting experiments and, in particular, to recent experimental works that provide evidence for the elusive Schmid-Bulgadaev dissipative quantum phase transition.

We show that even in the presence of unital sources such as the depolarizing channel, the distribution, under the combined noise channel, never resembles a maximally entropic distribution at any depth. To show this, we prove that the output distribution of such circuits never anticoncentrates—meaning that it is never too “flat”—regardless of the depth of the circuit. This is in stark contrast to the behavior of noiseless random quantum circuits or those with only unital noise, both of which anticoncentrate at sufficiently large depths. As a consequence, our results shows that the complexity of random-circuit sampling under realistic noise is still an open question, since anticoncentration is a critical property exploited by both state-of-the-art classical hardness and easiness results.

    "abstract": "A restriction in the quality and quantity of available qubits presents a substantial obstacle to the application of near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers in practical tasks. To confront this challenge, some techniques for effectively augmenting the system size through classical processing have been proposed; one promising approach is quantum circuit cutting. The main idea of quantum circuit cutting is to decompose an original circuit into smaller subcircuits and combine outputs from these subcircuits to recover the original output. Although this approach enables us to simulate larger quantum circuits beyond physically available circuits, it needs classical overheads quantified by two metrics: the sampling overhead in the number of measurements to reconstruct the original output, and the number of channels in the decomposition. Thus, it is crucial to devise a decomposition method that minimizes both of these metrics, thereby reducing the overall execution time. This paper studies the problem of decomposing the <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mi>n</a:mi></a:math>-qubit identity channel, i.e., <d:math xmlns:d=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><d:mi>n</d:mi></d:math>-parallel wire cutting, into a set of local operations and classical communication; then we give an optimal wire-cutting method composed of channels based on mutually unbiased bases that achieves minimal overheads in both the sampling overhead and the number of channels, without ancilla qubits. This is in stark contrast to the existing method that achieves the optimal sampling overhead yet with ancilla qubits. Moreover, we derive a tight lower bound on the number of channels in parallel wire cutting without ancilla systems and show that only our method achieves this lower bound among the existing methods. Notably, our method shows an exponential improvement in the number of channels, compared to the aforementioned ancilla-assisted method that achieves optimal sampling overhead. Our work significantly alleviates the additional overheads for the wire-cutting method and may provide essential components for the early success of quantum computing.

    "abstract": "Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow us to steer quantum information in a nonlocal way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using nonmaximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here, we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface-code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori-type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mi>X</a:mi><a:mo>+</a:mo><a:mi>Z</a:mi></a:math> angle along the self-dual line—indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg-atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.

    "abstract": "Designs for quantum error correction depend strongly on the connectivity of the qubits. For solid-state qubits, the most straightforward approach is to have connectivity constrained to a planar graph. Practical considerations may also further restrict the connectivity, resulting in a relatively sparse graph such as the heavy-hexagonal (“heavy-hex”) architecture of current IBM Quantum devices. In such cases, it is hard to use all qubits to their full potential. Instead, in order to emulate the denser connectivity required to implement well-known quantum error-correcting codes, many qubits remain effectively unused. In this work, we show how this bug can be turned into a feature. By using the unused qubits of one code to execute another, two codes can be implemented on top of each other, allowing easy application of fault-tolerant entangling gates and measurements. We demonstrate this by realizing a surface code and a Bacon-Shor code on a 133-qubit IBM Quantum device.

We provide a guide for calculating this observable on a fault-tolerant quantum computer while optimizing the required computational resources. Specifically, we present a quantum algorithm that estimates interaction energies at the first-order SAPT level with a Heisenberg-limited scaling. To this end, we exploit a high-order tensor-factorization and block-encoding technique that efficiently represents each SAPT observable. To quantify the computational cost of our methodology, we provide resource estimates in terms of the required number of logical qubits and Toffoli gates to execute our algorithm for a range of benchmark molecules, also taking into account the cost of the eigenstate preparation and the cost of block encoding the SAPT observables.

    "abstract": "Topological color codes are widely acknowledged as promising candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Neither a two-dimensional nor a three-dimensional topology, however, can provide a universal gate set {, , }, with the gate missing in the two-dimensional and the gate in the three-dimensional case. These complementary shortcomings of the isolated topologies may be overcome in a combined approach, by switching between a two- and a three-dimensional code while maintaining the logical state. In this work, we construct resource-optimized deterministic and nondeterministic code-switching protocols for two- and three-dimensional distance-three color codes using fault-tolerant quantum circuits based on flag qubits. Deterministic protocols allow for the fault-tolerant implementation of logical gates on an encoded quantum state, while nondeterministic protocols may be used for the fault-tolerant preparation of magic states. Taking the error rates of state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum processors as a reference, we find a logical failure probability of 3% for deterministic logical gates, which cannot be realized transversally in the respective code. By replacing the three-dimensional distance-three color code in the protocol for magic state preparation with the morphed code introduced in Vasmer and Kubica [PRX Quantum 3, 030319 (2022)], we reduce the logical failure rates by 2 orders of magnitude, thus rendering it a viable method for magic state preparation on near-term quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that code switching enables the fault-tolerant and deterministic implementation of a universal gate set under realistic conditions, and thereby provide a practical avenue to advance universal, fault-tolerant quantum computing and enable quantum algorithms on first, error-corrected logical qubits.

    "abstract": "Shuttling spins with high fidelity is a key requirement to scale up semiconducting quantum computers, enabling qubit entanglement over large distances and favoring the integration of control electronics on-chip. To decouple the spin from the unavoidable charge noise, state-of-the-art spin shuttlers try to minimize the inhomogeneity of the Zeeman field. However, this decoupling is challenging in otherwise promising quantum computing platforms such as hole spin qubits in silicon and germanium, characterized by a large spin-orbit interaction and an electrically tunable qubit frequency. In this work, we show that, surprisingly, the large inhomogeneity of the Zeeman field stabilizes the coherence of a moving spin state, thus also enabling high-fidelity shuttling in these systems. We relate this enhancement in fidelity to the deterministic dynamics of the spin that filters out the dominant low-frequency contributions of the charge noise. By simulating several different scenarios and noise sources, we show that this is a robust phenomenon generally occurring at large field inhomogeneity. By appropriately adjusting the motion of the quantum dot, we also design realistic protocols enabling faster and more coherent spin shuttling. Our findings are generally applicable to a wide range of setups and could pave the way toward large-scale quantum processors. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "The ability of quantum states to be in superposition is one of the key features that sets them apart from the classical world. This “coherence” is rigorously quantified by resource theories, which aim to understand how such properties may be exploited in quantum technologies. There has been much research on what the resource theory of coherence can reveal about quantum metrology, almost all of which has been from the viewpoint of Fisher information. We prove, however, that the relative entropy of coherence, and its recent generalization to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), naturally quantify the performance of Bayesian metrology. In particular, we show how a coherence measure can be applied to an ensemble of states. We then prove that during parameter estimation, the ensemble relative entropy of coherence (C) is equal to the difference between the optimal Holevo information (X), and the mutual information attained by a measurement (I). We call this relation the CXI equality. The ensemble coherence lets us visualize how much information is locked away in superposition and hence is inaccessible with a given measurement scheme and quantifies the advantage that would be gained by using a joint measurement on multiple states. Our results hold regardless of how the parameter is encoded in the state, encompassing unitary, dissipative, and discrete settings. We consider both projective measurements and general POVMs. This work suggests new directions for research in coherence, provides a novel operation interpretation for the relative entropy of coherence and its POVM generalization, and introduces a new tool to study the role of quantum features in metrology.

    "abstract": "Quantum instruments represent the most general type of quantum measurement, as they incorporate processes with both classical and quantum outputs. In many scenarios, it may be desirable to have some “on-demand” device that is capable of implementing one of many possible instruments whenever the experimenter desires. We refer to such objects as programmable instrument devices (PIDs), and this paper studies PIDs from a resource-theoretic perspective. A physically important class of PIDs are those that do not require quantum memories to implement, and these are naturally “free” in this resource theory. Additionally, these free objects correspond precisely to the class of unsteerable channel assemblages in the study of channel steering. The traditional notion of measurement incompatibility emerges as a resource in this theory since any PID controlling an incompatible family of instruments requires a quantum memory to build. We identify an incompatibility preorder between PIDs based on whether one can be transformed into another using processes that do not require additional quantum memories. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for when such transformations are possible based on how well certain guessing games can be played using a given PID. Ultimately our results provide an operational characterization of incompatibility, and they offer semi-device-independent tests for incompatibility in the most general types of quantum instruments.

One prominent example is the case of a dense ensemble illuminated by a strong coherent drive while interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. Despite being subjected to intense investigations, this system retains many open questions. A recent experiment carried out in a pencil-shaped geometry reported measurements that seemed consistent with the emergence of strong collective effects in the form of a ``superradiant'' phase transition in free space, when looking at the light emission properties in the forward direction. Motivated by the experimental observations, we carry out a systematic theoretical analysis of the system's steady-state properties as a function of the driving strength and atom number, $N$. We observe signatures of collective effects in the weak drive regime, which disappear with increasing drive strength as the system evolves into a single-particle-like mixed state comprised of randomly aligned dipoles. Although the steady-state features some similarities to the reported superradiant to normal non-equilibrium transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence, we observe significant qualitative and quantitative differences, including a different scaling of the critical drive parameter (from $N$ to $\\sqrt{N}$). We validate the applicability of a mean-field treatment to capture the steady-state dynamics under currently accessible conditions. Furthermore, we develop a simple theoretical model that explains the scaling properties by accounting for interaction-induced inhomogeneous effects and spontaneous emission, which are intrinsic features of interacting disordered arrays in free space.",

    "abstract": "Circuit quantization is an extraordinarily successful theory that describes the behavior of quantum circuits with high precision. The most widely used approach of circuit quantization relies on introducing a classical Lagrangian whose degrees of freedom are either magnetic fluxes or electric charges in the circuit. By combining nonlinear circuit elements (such as Josephson junctions or quantum phase slips), it is possible to build circuits where a standard Lagrangian description (and thus the standard quantization method) does not exist. Inspired by the mathematics of symplectic geometry and graph theory, we address this challenge, and present a Hamiltonian formulation of nondissipative electrodynamic circuits. The resulting procedure for circuit quantization is independent of whether circuit elements are linear or nonlinear, or if the circuit is driven by external biases. We explain how to rederive known results from our formalism, and provide an efficient algorithm for quantizing circuits, including those that cannot be quantized using existing methods.

Subsequently, we propose a natural extension of the standard scenario for these experiments and show that it circumvents this limitation. This leads us to prove entanglement advantages from every entangled two-qubit Werner state, evidence its generalization to high-dimensional systems, and establish a connection to quantum teleportation.

We show that certain choices of dissipation retaining strong symmetries support a steady-state manifold consisting of two nonlocal qubits and for Hamiltonian perturbations preserving the global symmetry, states in this manifold remain metastable.

While the localized qubits of the cluster Hamiltonian are not conserved by the Lindbladian evolution, they do correspond to weak symmetries and thus retain a memory of their initial state at all times in the quantum trajectories. We utilize this feature to construct protocols to retrieve the quantum information either by monitoring jumps or error mitigation. Our work thus proposes a novel framework to study the dynamics of dissipative SPT phases and opens up the possibility of engineering entangled states relevant to quantum information processing.

    "abstract": "Entanglement, measurement, and classical communication together enable teleportation of quantum states between distant parties, in principle, with perfect fidelity. To what extent do correlations and entanglement of a many-body wave function transfer under teleportation protocols? We address this question for the case of an imperfectly teleported quantum critical wave function, focusing on the ground state of a critical Ising chain. We demonstrate that imperfections, e.g., in the entangling gate adopted for a given protocol, effectively manifest as weak measurements acting on the otherwise pristinely teleported critical state. Armed with this perspective, we leverage and further develop the theory of measurement-altered quantum criticality to quantify the resilience of critical-state teleportation. We identify classes of teleportation protocols for which imperfection (i) preserves both the universal long-range entanglement and correlations of the original quantum critical state, (ii) weakly modifies these quantities away from their universal values, and (iii) obliterates long-range entanglement altogether while preserving power-law correlations, albeit with a new set of exponents. We also show that mixed states describing the average over a series of sequential imperfect teleportation events retain pristine power-law correlations due to a “built-in” decoding algorithm, though their entanglement structure measured by the negativity depends on errors similarly to individual protocol runs. These results may allow one to design teleportation protocols that optimize against errors—highlighting a potential practical application of measurement-altered criticality.

    "abstract": "We show a dissipative phase transition in a driven nonlinear quantum oscillator in which a discrete time-translation symmetry is spontaneously broken in two different ways. The corresponding regimes display either discrete or incommensurate time-crystal order, which we analyze numerically and analytically beyond the classical limit, addressing observable dynamics, phenomenology in different (laboratory and rotating) frames, Liouvillian spectral features, and quantum fluctuations. Via an effective semiclassical description, we show that phase diffusion dominates in the incommensurate time crystal (or continuous time crystal in the rotating frame), which manifests as a band of eigenmodes with a lifetime growing linearly with the mean-field excitation number. Instead, in the discrete time-crystal phase, the leading fluctuation process corresponds to quantum activation with a single mode that has an exponentially growing lifetime. Interestingly, the transition between these two regimes manifests itself already in the quantum regime as a spectral singularity, namely, as an exceptional point mediating between phase diffusion and quantum activation. Finally, we discuss this transition between different time-crystal orders in the context of synchronization phenomena. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "Quantum processors require a signal-delivery architecture with high addressability (low crosstalk) to ensure high performance already at the scale of dozens of qubits. Signal crosstalk causes inadvertent driving of quantum gates, which will adversely affect quantum gate fidelities in scaled-up devices. Here, we demonstrate packaged flip-chip superconducting quantum processors with signal-crosstalk performance competitive with those reported in other platforms. For capacitively coupled qubit-drive lines, we find on-resonant crosstalk better than <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mo>−</a:mo><a:mn>27</a:mn></a:math> dB (average <d:math xmlns:d=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><d:mo>−</d:mo><d:mn>37</d:mn></d:math> dB). For inductively coupled magnetic-flux-drive lines, we find less than 0.13% direct-current flux crosstalk (average 0.05%). These observed crosstalk levels are adequately small and indicate a decreasing trend with increasing distance, which is promising for further scaling up to larger numbers of qubits. We discuss the implications of our results for the design of a low-crosstalk on-chip signal-delivery architecture, including the influence of a shielding tunnel structure, potential sources of crosstalk, and estimation of crosstalk-induced qubit-gate error in scaled-up quantum processors.

They are predicted to emerge as zero-energy modes localized at the boundary of a topological superconductor. No intrinsic topological superconductor is known to date. However, by interfacing conventional superconductors and semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, it is possible to create a system hosting topological states. Hence, epitaxial superconductors and semiconductors have emerged as an attractive material system with atomically sharp interfaces and broad flexibility in device fabrications incorporating Josephson junctions. We discuss the basics of topological superconductivity and provide insight into how to go beyond current state-of-the-art experiments. We argue that the ultimate success in realizing MBS physics requires the observation of non-Abelian braiding and fusion experiments. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "The real-time simulation of large many-body quantum systems is a formidable task, that may only be achievable with a genuine quantum computational platform. Currently, quantum hardware with a number of qubits sufficient to make classical emulation challenging is available. This condition is necessary for the pursuit of a so-called quantum advantage, but it also makes verifying the results very difficult. In this paper, we flip the perspective and utilize known theoretical results about many-body quantum critical dynamics to qualitatively benchmark digital quantum hardware and various error mitigation techniques. In particular, we benchmark against known universal scaling laws in the Hamiltonian simulation of a time-dependent transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian of up to 133 qubits. Incorporating only basic error mitigation and suppression methods, our study shows reliable control up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring a maximum of 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. These results are transferable to applications such as Hamiltonian simulation, variational algorithms, optimization, or quantum machine learning. We demonstrate this on the example of digitized quantum annealing for optimization and identify an optimal working point in terms of both circuit depth and time step on a 133-site optimization problem.

In addition, we show that the low-energy excitations of this super-Hamiltonian can be understood as approximate symmetries, which in turn are related to slowly relaxing hydrodynamic modes in symmetric systems. This connection is made precise by relating the super-Hamiltonian to the superoperator that governs the operator relaxation in noisy symmetric Brownian circuits and this physical interpretation also provides a novel interpretation for Mazur bounds for autocorrelation functions. We find examples of gapped (gapless) super-Hamiltonians indicating the absence (presence) of slow modes, which happens in the presence of discrete (continuous) symmetries. In the gapless cases, we recover hydrodynamic modes such as diffusion, tracer diffusion, and asymptotic scars in the presence of <o:math xmlns:o=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><o:mi>U</o:mi><o:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</o:mo><o:mn>1</o:mn><o:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</o:mo></o:math> symmetry, HSF, and a tower of quantum scars, respectively.

Generic unital quantum channels, for example, have the maximally mixed state with no entanglement as their unique steady state. However, we find that for a unital quantum channel that is “strongly symmetric,” i.e., it preserves a global on-site symmetry, the maximally mixed steady state in certain symmetry sectors can be highly entangled. For a given symmetry, we analyze the entanglement and correlations of the maximally mixed state in the invariant sector (MMIS) and show that the entanglement of formation and distillation are exactly computable and equal for any bipartition. For all Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is separable and for all non-Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is entangled. Remarkably, for non-Abelian continuous symmetries described by compact semisimple Lie groups (e.g., SU(2)), the bipartite entanglement of formation for the MMIS scales logarithmically with the number of qudits <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mi>N</a:mi></a:math>.

Using flux-tunable qubits, we characterize and theoretically model the variation in the coupling strength between the two qubits and each of the ring-resonator modes.

In this work, we present qSWIFT, a high-order randomized algorithm for Hamiltonian simulation. In qSWIFT, the required number of gates for a given precision is independent of the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, while the systematic error is exponentially reduced with regard to the order parameter. In this respect, our qSWIFT is a higher-order counterpart of the previously proposed quantum stochastic drift protocol (qDRIFT), the number of gates in which scales linearly with the inverse of the precision required. We construct the qSWIFT channel and establish a rigorous bound for the systematic error quantified by the diamond norm. qSWIFT provides an algorithm to estimate given physical quantities by using a system with one ancilla qubit, which is as simple as other product-formula-based approaches such as regular Trotter-Suzuki decompositions and qDRIFT. Our numerical experiment reveals that the required number of gates in qSWIFT is significantly reduced compared to qDRIFT. In particular, the advantage is significant for problems where high precision is required; e.g., to achieve a systematic relative propagation error of <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:msup><a:mn>10</a:mn><a:mrow><a:mo>−</a:mo><a:mn>6</a:mn></a:mrow></a:msup></a:math>, the required number of gates in third-order qSWIFT is 1000 times smaller than that of qDRIFT.

    "abstract": "In satellite-based quantum-key-distribution (QKD), the number of secret bits that can be generated in a single satellite pass over the ground station is severely restricted by the pass duration and the free-space optical channel loss. High channel loss may decrease the signal-to-noise ratio due to background noise, reduce the number of generated raw key bits, and increase the quantum bit error rate (QBER), all of which have detrimental effects on the output secret key length. Under finite-size security analysis, a higher QBER increases the minimum raw key length necessary for nonzero secret-key-length extraction due to less efficient reconciliation and postprocessing overheads. We show that recent developments in finite-key analysis allow three different small-satellite-based QKD projects, CQT-Sat, the United Kingdom QUARC-ROKS, and QEYSSat, to produce secret keys even under conditions of very high loss, improving on estimates based on previous finite-key bounds. This suggests that satellites in low Earth orbit can satisfy finite-size security requirements but that this remains challenging for satellites further from Earth. We analyze the performance of each mission to provide an informed route toward improving the performance of small-satellite QKD missions. We highlight the short- and long-term perspectives on the challenges and potential future developments in small-satellite-based QKD and quantum networks. In particular, we discuss some of the experimental and theoretical bottlenecks and the improvements necessary to achieve QKD and wider quantum networking capabilities in daylight and at different altitudes.

    "abstract": "Generating macroscopic nonclassical quantum states is a long-standing challenge in physics. Anharmonic dynamics is an essential ingredient to generate these states, but for large mechanical systems, the effect of the anharmonicity tends to become negligible compared with the effect of decoherence. As a possible solution to this challenge, we propose using a motional squeezed state as a resource to effectively increase the anharmonicity. We analyze the production of negativity in the Wigner distribution of a quantum anharmonic resonator initially in a squeezed state. We find that initial squeezing increases the rate at which negativity is generated. We also analyze the effect of two common sources of decoherence - namely, energy damping and dephasing - and find that the detrimental effects of energy damping are suppressed by strong squeezing. In the limit of large squeezing, which is needed for state-of-the-art systems, we find good approximations for the Wigner function. Our analysis is significant for current experiments attempting to prepare macroscopic mechanical systems in genuine quantum states. We provide an overview of several experimental platforms featuring nonlinear behaviors and low levels of decoherence. In particular, we discuss the feasibility of our proposal with carbon nanotubes and levitated nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "The generation and evolution of entanglement in many-body systems is an active area of research that spans multiple fields, from quantum information science to the simulation of quantum many-body systems encountered in condensed matter, subatomic physics, and quantum chemistry. Motivated by recent experiments exploring quantum information processing systems with electrons trapped above the surface of cryogenic noble gas substrates, we theoretically investigate the generation of entanglement between two electrons via their unscreened Coulomb interaction. The model system consists of two electrons confined in separate electrostatic traps that establish microwave-frequency quantized states of their motion. We compute the motional energy spectra of the electrons, as well as their entanglement, by diagonalizing the model Hamiltonian with respect to a single-particle Hartree product basis. We also compare our results with the predictions of an effective Hamiltonian. The computational procedure outlined here can be employed for device design and guidance of experimental implementations. In particular, the theoretical tools developed here can be used for fine-tuning and optimization of control parameters in future experiments with electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium or solid neon.

    "abstract": "We extend entropy production to a deeply quantum regime involving noncommuting conserved quantities. Consider a unitary transporting conserved quantities (“charges”) between two systems initialized in thermal states. Three common formulas model the entropy produced. They respectively cast entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable, as an information-theoretic uncertainty measure, and as a quantifier of irreversibility. Often, the charges are assumed to commute with each other (e.g., energy and particle number). Yet quantum charges can fail to commute. Noncommutation invites generalizations, which we posit and justify, of the three formulas. The noncommutation of charges, we find, breaks the equivalence of the formulas. Furthermore, different formulas quantify different physical effects of the noncommutation of charges on entropy production. For instance, entropy production can signal contextuality—true nonclassicality—by becoming nonreal. This work opens up stochastic thermodynamics to noncommuting—and so particularly quantum—charges.

    "abstract": "We introduce a framework for fault-tolerant postselection (FTPS) of fault-tolerant codes and channels—such as those based on surface codes—using soft-information metrics based on visible syndrome and erasure information. We introduce several metrics for ranking configurations of syndromes and erasures. In particular, we introduce the (and variants thereof) as a powerful soft-information metric for predicting logical error rates of fault-tolerant channels based on topological error-correcting codes. The logical gap is roughly the unsigned weight difference between inequivalent logical corrections and is adaptable to any tailored noise model or decoder. We deploy this framework to prepare high-quality surface-code magic states with low overhead under a model of independent and identically distributed (IID) Pauli and erasure errors. Postselection strategies based on the logical gap can suppress the encoding error rate (EER) of a magic state preparation channel to the level of the physical error rate with low overhead.

    "abstract": "The field of indefinite causal order (ICO) has seen a recent surge in interest. Much of this research has focused on the quantum SWITCH, wherein multiple parties act in a superposition of different orders in a manner transcending the quantum circuit model. This results in a new resource for quantum protocols, and is exciting for its relation to issues in foundational physics. The quantum SWITCH is also an example of a higher-order quantum operation, in that it not only transforms quantum states, but also other quantum operations. To date, no higher-order quantum operation has been completely experimentally characterized. Indeed, past work on the quantum SWITCH has confirmed its ICO by measuring causal witnesses or demonstrating resource advantages, but the complete process matrix has only been described theoretically. Here, we perform higher-order quantum process tomography. However, doing so requires exponentially many measurements with a scaling worse than standard process tomography. We overcome this challenge by creating a new passively-stable fiber-based quantum SWITCH using active optical elements to deterministically generate and manipulate time-bin encoded qubits. Moreover, our new architecture for the quantum SWITCH can be readily scaled to multiple parties. By reconstructing the process matrix, we estimate its fidelity and tailor different causal witnesses directly for our experiment. To achieve this, we measure a set of tomographically complete settings, that also spans the input operation space. Our tomography protocol allows for the characterization and debugging of higher-order quantum operations with and without an ICO, while our experimental time-bin techniques could enable the creation of a new realm of higher-order quantum operations with an ICO.",

    "abstract": "Error corrected quantum computers have the potential to change the way we solve computational problems. Quantum error correction involves repeated rounds of carefully scheduled gates to measure the stabilizers of a code. A set of scheduling rules is typically imposed on the order of gates to ensure that the circuit can be rearranged into an equivalent circuit that can be easily seen to measure the stabilizers. In this work, we ask what would happen if we break these rules and instead use circuit schedules that we describe as tangled. We find that tangling schedules generates long-range entanglement not accessible using nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates. Our tangled-schedule method provides a new tool for building quantum error-correction circuits and we explore applications to design new architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computers. Notably, we show that, for the widely used Pauli-based model of computation (achieved by lattice surgery), this access to longer-range entanglement can reduce the device connectivity requirements, without compromising on circuit depth.

In this work, we sense the charge of Andreev bound states and Andreev molecules in an InSb-Al hybrid nanowire using an integrated quantum dot operated as a charge sensor. We show how charge sensing measurements can resolve the even and odd states of an Andreev molecule, without affecting the parity.

    "abstract": "We introduce a general statistical learning theory for processes that take as input a classical random variable and output a quantum state. Our setting is motivated by the practical situation in which one desires to learn a quantum process governed by classical parameters that are out of one’s control. This framework is applicable, for example, to the study of astronomical phenomena, disordered systems and biological processes not controlled by the observer. We provide an algorithm for learning with high probability in this setting with a finite amount of samples, even if the concept class is infinite. To do this, we review and adapt existing algorithms for shadow tomography and hypothesis selection, and combine their guarantees with the uniform convergence on the data of the loss functions of interest. As a byproduct, we obtain sufficient conditions for performing shadow tomography of classical-quantum states with a number of copies, which depends on the dimension of the quantum register, but not on the dimension of the classical one. We give concrete examples of processes that can be learned in this manner, based on quantum circuits or physically motivated classes, such as systems governed by Hamiltonians with random perturbations or data-dependent phase shifts.

    "abstract": "Qubit-specific measurement in a superconducting quantum processor requires physical interconnects that traverse 4 orders of magnitude in temperature from 293 K to 10 mK. Although the quantum processor can be thermalized and shielded from electromagnetic noise, the interconnects themselves introduce an unavoidable remote heat bath that causes decoherence of quantum states. In the present work, we report quantitative and device-independent measurements of the power radiated to the quantum processor from its control lines. Our results have been obtained using a calibrated bolometer that operates within a millikelvin environment with time-resolved measurement capability. In the limit of zero applied power, the noise power emitted to the quantum processor is equivalent to that of a blackbody with temperature 63–71 mK for the prototypical drive lines in the study. Experimentally, we increase the applied power of a simulated control signal to map out the resulting temperature rise and thermal time constant of five prototypical drive-line varieties. We input the data to an open quantum system model to demonstrate the trade-off between dissipated signal power, transmon-qubit lifetime, pure dephasing, gate fidelity, and the implied decoherence rates due to self-heating during microwave operations. Beyond explaining dephasing rates observed in the literature, our work sets the stage for accurate noise modeling in novel quantum computer interfacing methods due to our device-agnostic approach.

We discuss the implementation of dynamic cooling in terms of quantum circuits and examine the effects of hardware noise. We successfully demonstrate dynamic cooling in a three-qubit system on a real quantum processor.

    "abstract": "We provide the first tensor-network method for computing quantum weight enumerator polynomials in the most general form. If a quantum code has a known tensor-network construction of its encoding map, our method is far more efficient, and in some cases exponentially faster than the existing approach. As a corollary, it produces decoders and an algorithm that computes the code distance. For non-(Pauli)-stabilizer codes, this constitutes the current best algorithm for computing the code distance. For degenerate stabilizer codes, it can be substantially faster compared to the current methods. We also introduce novel weight enumerators and their applications. In particular, we show that these enumerators can be used to compute logical error rates exactly and thus construct (optimal) decoders for any independent and identically distributed single qubit or qudit error channels. The enumerators also provide a more efficient method for computing nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body states. As the power for these speedups rely on a quantum Lego decomposition of quantum codes, we further provide systematic methods for decomposing quantum codes and graph states into a modular construction for which our technique applies. As a proof of principle, we perform exact analyses of the deformed surface codes, the holographic pentagon code, and the two-dimensional Bacon-Shor code under (biased) Pauli noise and limited instances of coherent error at sizes that are inaccessible by brute force.

In the context of digital quantum simulation, this difficulty prevents a direct adaptation of many time-independent simulation algorithms for time-dependent simulation. However, there exists a framework within the theory of dynamical systems that eliminates time ordering by adding a “clock” degree of freedom. In this work, we provide a computational framework, based on this reduction, for encoding time-dependent dynamics as time-independent systems. As a result, we make two advances in digital Hamiltonian simulation. First, we create a time-dependent simulation algorithm based on performing qubitization on the augmented clock system and, in doing so, provide the first qubitization-based approach to time-dependent Hamiltonians that goes beyond Trotterization of the ordered exponential. Second, we define a natural generalization of multiproduct formulas for time-ordered exponentials and then propose and analyze an algorithm based on these formulas. Unlike other algorithms of similar accuracy, the multiproduct approach achieves commutator scaling, meaning that this method outperforms existing methods for physically local time-dependent Hamiltonians with sufficient smoothness. Our work reduces the disparity between time-dependent and time-independent simulation and indicates a step toward optimal quantum simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians.

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring background radiation is a potential source of correlated decoherence events in superconducting qubits that will challenge error-correction schemes. In order to characterize the radiation environment in an unshielded laboratory representative of superconducting qubits’ environments, we performed broadband, spectroscopic measurements of background radiation events inside a millikelvin refrigerator. The spectrometer was designed to mimic the size and composition of a quantum circuit. Specifically, we measured the background radiation spectra in silicon substrates of two thicknesses, 500 and 1500 µm, and one area, 25 <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:msup><a:mi>mm</a:mi><a:mn>2</a:mn></a:msup></a:math>. The observed spectra span energies from a few kilo-electron-volts up to nearly 10 MeV, are nearly featureless, and decrease in intensity by a factor of 40 000 between 100 keV and 3 MeV for the 500-µm substrate. We integrate the spectra to obtain the average event rates and deposited power levels. These quantities correspond to a rate of 0.023 events per second and a power of 4.9 keV <d:math xmlns:d=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><d:msup><d:mrow><d:mrow><d:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</d:mi></d:mrow></d:mrow><d:mrow><d:mo>−</d:mo><d:mn>1</d:mn></d:mrow></d:msup></d:math>, when counting events that deposit at least 40 keV for the 500-µm-thick substrate. We find that the cryogenic measurements are in good agreement with predictions based on simple measurements of the terrestrial gamma-ray flux outside the refrigerator, published models of cosmic-ray fluxes, a crude model of the cryostat, and radiation-transport simulations. This model requires no free parameters to predict the background radiation spectra in the silicon substrates. The agreement between measurements and predictions demonstrates that the model we present can be used to assess the relative contributions of terrestrial and cosmic-ray sources to background radiation interactions in silicon substrates of varying thickness. These spectroscopic measurements are performed with a novel combination of superconducting microresonators located on micromachined silicon islands that define the interaction volume with background radiation. The resonators transduce deposited energy to a readily detectable electrical signal. Microresonator readout closely resembles dispersive superconducting qubit readout, so similar devices—with or without micromachined islands—are suitable for integration with superconducting quantum circuits as detectors for background radiation events. For our specific laboratory conditions, we find that gamma-ray emissions from radioisotopes are responsible for the majority of events that deposit <h:math xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><h:mi>E</h:mi><h:mo>&lt;</h:mo><h:mn>1</h:mn><h:mspace width=\"0.1em\"/><h:mrow><h:mi>Me</h:mi><h:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">V</h:mi></h:mrow></h:math>. We present results demonstrating that the background radiation spectrum contains relevant contributions from cosmic-ray particles other than muons, particularly a tail of multi-mega-electron-volt events due to protons and neutrons. These observations suggest several paths to reducing the impact of background radiation on quantum circuits, supported by an empirically validated model for generating reliable predictions of radiation interactions with silicon substrates.

Using graph-based representations within the framework of spatially localized operations and classical communication (sLOCC), we mathematically demonstrate a direct translation of the generation schemes of specific entangled states into colored, complex, and weighted digraphs, each corresponding to a given experimental setup. We also show that this graph-theoretical approach allows for the optimization of the generation efficiency of specific multipartite entangled states by exploring a variety of generation schemes. The presented theoretical approach, while already implementable with current linear optics architectures, has the potential to bring clear advantages over existing technologies, such as in quantum computing search algorithms and in the design of new experiments in quantum optics or other platforms.

    "abstract": "Whether a given target state can be prepared by starting with a simple product state and acting with a finite-depth quantum circuit is a key question in condensed matter physics and quantum information science. It underpins classifications of topological phases, as well as the understanding of topological quantum codes, and has obvious relevance for device implementations. Traditionally, this question assumes that the quantum circuit is made up of unitary gates that are . Inspired by the advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, we reconsider this question with <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mi>k</a:mi></a:math>- gates, i.e., gates that act on no more than <d:math xmlns:d=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><d:mi>k</d:mi></d:math> degrees of freedom but are not restricted to be geometrically local. First, we construct explicit finite-depth circuits of symmetric <g:math xmlns:g=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><g:mi>k</g:mi></g:math>-local gates that create symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states from an initial product state. Our construction applies to SPT states protected by global symmetries or subsystem symmetries but not to those with higher-form symmetries, which we conjecture remain nontrivial. Next, we show how to implement arbitrary translationally invariant quantum cellular automata in any dimension using finite-depth circuits of <j:math xmlns:j=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><j:mi>k</j:mi></j:math>-local gates.

We furthermore argue that SPT phases are fragile to <p:math xmlns:p=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><p:mi>k</p:mi></p:math>-local symmetric perturbations. We conclude by discussing the implications for other phases, such as fracton phases, and surveying future directions.

Here, we study the spectrum of the model realized in the experiment using exact diagonalization and physical arguments. We find that isolated bands corresponding to the descendants of the exact bound states of the integrable model are clearly observable in the spectrum for a large range of system sizes. However, our numerical analysis of the localization properties of the eigenstates suggests that the bound states become unstable in the thermodynamic limit.

Previous works on multiqubit electronic spin registers in the environment of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond have only included spins directly coupled to the NV. As this direct coupling is limited by the central spin coherence time, it significantly restricts the maximum attainable size of the register. To address this problem, we present a scalable approach to increase the size of electronic spin registers. Our approach exploits a weakly coupled probe spin together with double-resonance control sequences to mediate the transfer of spin polarization between the central NV spin and an environmental spin that is not directly coupled to it. We experimentally realize this approach to demonstrate the detection and coherent control of an unknown electronic spin outside the coherence limit of a central NV. Our work paves the way for engineering larger quantum spin registers with the potential to advance nanoscale sensing, enable correlated noise spectroscopy for error correction, and facilitate the realization of spin-chain quantum wires for quantum communication.

In this work, we propose a giant-rectification scheme based on the asymmetric interplay between strong particle interactions and a tilted potential, each of which induces an insulating state on its own. While for reverse bias both cooperate and induce a strengthened insulator with an exponentially suppressed current, for forward bias they compete, generating conduction resonances; this leads to a rectification coefficient of many orders of magnitude. We uncover the mechanism underlying these resonances as enhanced coherences between energy eigenstates occurring at avoided crossings in the bulk energy spectrum of the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the complexity of the many-body nonequilibrium conducting state through the emergence of enhanced density-matrix impurity and operator-space entanglement entropy close to the resonances. Our proposal paves the way for implementing a perfect diode in currently available electronic and quantum simulation platforms. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "Entanglement constitutes a main feature that distinguishes quantum from classical physics. Here, however, we show that entanglement may also serve as the essential ingredient for the emergence of classical behavior in a radiating spin system. We consider the relation between the state of a macroscopic spin, such as an atomic ensemble, and the radiation it emits. We introduce a new class of macroscopic spin states, the coherently radiating spin states (CRSSs), defined as the asymptotic eigenstates of the SU(2) lowering operator. We find that a spin emitter in a CRSS radiates classical coherent light, although the CRSS itself is a quantum entangled state exhibiting spin squeezing. We further show that the CRSS is naturally realized in Dicke superradiance and underlies the dissipative Dicke phase transition, hence predicting the optimal scaling of spin squeezing in superradiance. More generally, the CRSS emerges as the ground state of a collective spin Hamiltonian. The CRSS thus provides a promising concept for studying many-body spin systems in various platforms, with applications ranging from quantum metrology and lasing to phase transitions.

    "abstract": "Quantum repeaters have long been established to be essential for distributing entanglement over long distances. Consequently, their experimental realization constitutes a core challenge of quantum communication. However, there are numerous open questions about implementation details for realistic near-term experimental setups. In order to assess the performance of realistic repeater protocols, here we present ReQuSim, a comprehensive Monte Carlo–based simulation platform for quantum repeaters that faithfully includes loss and models a wide range of imperfections such as memories with time-dependent noise. Our platform allows us to perform an analysis for quantum repeater setups and strategies that go far beyond known analytical results: This refers to being able to both capture more realistic noise models and analyze more complex repeater strategies. We present a number of findings centered around the combination of strategies for improving performance, such as entanglement purification and the use of multiple repeater stations, and demonstrate that there exist complex relationships between them. We stress that numerical tools such as ours are essential to model complex quantum communication protocols aimed at contributing to the quantum Internet.7 MoreReceived 6 March 2023Revised 8 November 2023Accepted 23 January 2024DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.010351Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "The last few years have seen rapid development of applications of quantum computation to quantum field theory. The first algorithms for quantum simulation of scattering have been proposed in the context of scalar and fermionic theories, requiring thousands of logical qubits. These algorithms are not suitable to simulate scattering of incoming bound states, as the initial-state preparation relies typically on adiabatically transforming wavepackets of the free theory into wavepackets of the interacting theory. In this paper we present a strategy to excite wavepackets of the interacting theory directly from the vacuum of the interacting theory, allowing the preparation of states of composite particles. This is the first step towards digital quantum simulation of scattering of bound states. The approach is based on the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, which provides a way to construct creation and annihilation operators of a theory in a full, nonperturbative framework. We provide a quantum algorithm requiring a number of ancillary qubits that is logarithmic in the size of the wavepackets, and with a success probability vanishing at most like a polynomial in the lattice parameters and the energy of the wavepacket. The gate complexity for a single iteration of the circuit is equivalent to that of a time evolution for a fixed time. Furthermore, we propose a complete protocol for scattering simulation using this algorithm. We study its efficiency and find improvements with respect to previous algorithms in the literature.

For both architectures, we analyze single- and dual-rail implementations of a bosonic qubit. In the single-rail encoding, we can detect first-order ancilla errors, while the dual-rail encoding additionally allows for the detection of photon losses. For parameter regimes of interest, the postselected infidelity of a QRAM query in a dual-rail architecture is nearly an order of magnitude below that of a corresponding query in a single-rail architecture. These findings suggest that dual-rail encodings are particularly attractive as architectures for QRAM devices in the era before fault tolerance. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

The field probes are fiber coupled and made from nonmetallic components, allowing them to be easily and safely positioned inside a 7 T MRI scanner.

    "abstract": "Atomic high-precision measurements have become a competitive and essential technique for tests of fundamental physics, the Standard Model, and our theory of gravity. It is therefore self-evident that such measurements call for a consistent relativistic description of atoms that eventually originates from quantum field theories like quantum electrodynamics. Most quantum metrological approaches even postulate effective field-theoretical treatments to describe a precision enhancement through techniques like squeezing. However, a consistent derivation of interacting atomic quantum gases from an elementary quantum field theory that includes both the internal structure as well as the center of mass of atoms, has not yet been addressed. We present such a subspace effective field theory for interacting, spin carrying, and possibly charged ensembles of atoms composed of nucleus and electron that form composite bosons called cobosons, where the interaction with light is included in a multipolar description. Relativistic corrections to the energy of a single coboson, light-matter interaction, and the scattering potential between cobosons arise in a consistent and natural manner. In particular, we obtain a relativistic coupling between the coboson’s center-of-mass motion and internal structure encoded by the mass defect. We use these results to derive modified bound-state energies, including the motion of ions, modified scattering potentials, a relativistic extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the mass defect applicable to atomic clocks or quantum clock interferometry.

    "abstract": "Continuous-variable bosonic systems stand as prominent candidates for implementing quantum computational tasks. While various necessary criteria have been established to assess their resourcefulness, sufficient conditions have remained elusive. We address this gap by focusing on promoting circuits that are otherwise simulatable to computational universality. The class of simulatable, albeit non-Gaussian, circuits that we consider is composed of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, Gaussian operations, and homodyne measurements. Based on these circuits, we first introduce a general framework for mapping a continuous-variable state into a qubit state. Subsequently, we cast existing maps into this framework, including the modular and stabilizer subsystem decompositions. By combining these findings with established results for discrete-variable systems, we formulate a sufficient condition for achieving universal quantum computation. Leveraging this, we evaluate the computational resourcefulness of a variety of states, including Gaussian states, finite-squeezing GKP states, and cat states. Furthermore, our framework reveals that both the stabilizer subsystem decomposition and the modular subsystem decomposition (of position-symmetric states) can be constructed in terms of simulatable operations. This establishes a robust resource-theoretical foundation for employing these techniques to evaluate the logical content of a generic continuous-variable state, which can be of independent interest.

    "abstract": "We consider a pair of quantum dot-based spin qubits that interact via microwave photons in a superconducting cavity and that are also parametrically driven by separate external electric fields. For this system, we formulate a model for spin qubit entanglement in the presence of mutually off-resonant qubit and cavity frequencies. We show that the sidebands generated via the driving fields enable highly tunable qubit-qubit entanglement using only ac control and without requiring the qubit and cavity frequencies to be tuned into simultaneous resonance. The model we derive can be mapped to a variety of qubit types, including detuning-driven one-electron spin qubits in double quantum dots and three-electron resonant exchange qubits in triple quantum dots. The high degree of nonlinearity inherent in spin qubits renders these systems particularly favorable for parametric drive-activated entanglement. We determine multiple common resonance conditions for the two driven qubits and the cavity and identify experimentally relevant parameter regimes that enable the implementation of entangling gates with suppressed sensitivity to cavity photon occupation and decay. The parametrically driven sideband resonance approach that we describe provides a promising route toward scalability and modularity in spin-based quantum information processing through drive-enabled tunability that can also be implemented in micromagnet-free electron and hole systems for spin-photon coupling.

This Hadamard gate can be realized by a constant-depth local unitary circuit modulo nonlocality caused by a cross cap. Via folding, the nonorientable surface code can be turned into a bilayer local quantum code, where the folded cross cap is equivalent to a bilayer twist terminated on a gapped boundary and the logical Hadamard only contains local gates with intralayer couplings when being away from the cross cap, as opposed to the interlayer couplings on each site needed in the case of the folded surface code. We further obtain the complete logical Clifford gate set for a stack of nonorientable surface codes and similarly for codes defined on Klein-bottle geometries.

Adiabatic evolution of tensor networks offers a wide range of applications, of which two are explored in this paper: improving tensor network optimization and scanning phase diagrams. By efficiently transporting eigenstates to quantum criticality and performing intermediary density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) optimizations along the way, we demonstrate that we can compute ground and low-lying excited states faster and more reliably than a standard DMRG method at or near quantum criticality. We demonstrate a simple automated step size adjustment and detection of the critical point based on the norm of the adiabatic gauge potential. Remarkably, we are able to reliably transport states through the critical point of the models we study. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "Generalized measurements, also called positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), can offer advantages over projective measurements in various quantum information tasks. Here, we realize a generalized measurement of one and two superconducting qubits with high fidelity and in a single experimental setting. To do so, we propose a hybrid method, the “Naimark-terminated binary tree,” based on a hybridization of Naimark’s dilation and binary tree techniques that leverages emerging hardware capabilities for midcircuit measurements and feed-forward control. Furthermore, we showcase a highly effective use of approximate compiling to enhance POVM fidelity in noisy conditions. We argue that our hybrid method scales better toward larger system sizes than its constituent methods and demonstrate its advantage by performing detector tomography of symmetric, informationally complete POVM (SIC POVM). Detector fidelity is further improved through a composite error-mitigation strategy that incorporates twirling and a newly devised conditional readout error mitigation. Looking forward, we expect improvements in approximate compilation and hardware noise for dynamic circuits to enable generalized measurements of larger multiqubit POVMs on superconducting qubits.

    "abstract": "Decoding algorithms based on approximate tensor-network (TN) contraction have proven tremendously successful in decoding two-dimensional (2D) local quantum codes such as toric or surface codes and color codes, effectively achieving optimal decoding accuracy. In this work, we introduce several techniques to generalize TN decoding to higher dimensions so that it can be applied to three-dimensional (3D) codes as well as 2D codes with noisy syndrome measurements (phenomenological noise or circuit-level noise). The 3D case is significantly more challenging than 2D, as the involved approximate tensor contraction is dramatically less well behaved than its 2D counterpart. Nonetheless, we numerically demonstrate that the decoding accuracy of our approach outperforms state-of-the-art decoders on the 3D surface code, both in the point and loop sectors, as well as for depolarizing noise. Our techniques could prove useful in near-term experimental demonstrations of quantum error correction, when decoding is to be performed off line and accuracy is of the utmost importance. To this end, we show how TN decoding can be applied to circuit-level noise and demonstrate that it outperforms the matching decoder on the rotated surface code.

    "abstract": "Preparing long-range entangled states poses significant challenges for near-term quantum devices. It is known that measurement and feedback (MF) can aid this task by allowing the preparation of certain paradigmatic long-range entangled states with only constant circuit depth. Here, we systematically explore the structure of states that can be prepared using constant-depth local circuits and a single MF round. Using the framework of tensor networks, the preparability under MF translates to tensor symmetries. We detail the structure of matrix-product states (MPSs) and projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) that can be prepared using MF, revealing the coexistence of Clifford-like properties and magic. In one dimension, we show that states with Abelian-symmetry-protected topological order are a restricted class of MF-preparable states. In two dimensions, we parametrize a subset of states with Abelian topological order that are MF preparable. Finally, we discuss the analogous implementation of operators via MF, providing a structural theorem that connects to the well-known Clifford teleportation.

We show how to mitigate this problem by modifying the heterostructure composition, or by varying the vertical electric field, the shuttling velocity, the shape and size of the dot, or the shuttling path. We further show that combinations of these strategies can reduce the shuttling infidelity by several orders of magnitude, putting shuttling fidelities sufficient for error correction within reach.

    "abstract": "Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a highly promising computational paradigm that leverages quantum systems as a computational resource for nonlinear information processing. While its application to time-series analysis is eagerly anticipated, prevailing approaches suffer from the collapse of the quantum state upon measurement, resulting in the erasure of temporal input memories. Neither repeated initializations nor weak measurements offer a fundamental solution, as the former escalates the time complexity while the latter restricts the information extraction from the Hilbert space. To address this issue, we propose the feedback-driven QRC framework. This methodology employs projective measurements on all qubits for unrestricted access to the quantum state, with the measurement outcomes subsequently fed back into the reservoir to restore the memory of prior inputs. We demonstrate that our QRC successfully acquires the fading-memory property through the feedback connections, a critical aspect in time-series processing. Notably, analysis of measurement trajectories reveals three distinct phases depending on the feedback strength, with the memory performance maximized at the edge of chaos. We also evaluate the predictive capabilities of our QRC, demonstrating its suitability for forecasting signals originating from quantum spin systems. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

Despite the apparent constraints of this setup, we demonstrate that error correction is possible and identify the classes of codes that are naturally suited to this platform. Focusing on silicon spin qubits as a practical example of qubits believed to meet our requirements, we provide a protocol for achieving full universal quantum computation with the surface code, while also addressing the additional constraints that are specific to a silicon spin-qubit device. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of this architecture using a realistic noise model, demonstrating that both surface code and more complex quantum low-density parity-check codes efficiently suppress gate and shuttling noise to a level that allows for the execution of quantum algorithms within the classically intractable regime. This work thus brings us one step closer to the execution of quantum algorithms that outperform classical machines. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "As quantum devices make steady progress towards intermediate scale and fault-tolerant quantum computing, it is essential to develop rigorous and efficient measurement protocols that account for known sources of noise. Most existing quantum characterization protocols such as gate-set tomography and randomized benchmarking assume the noise acting on the qubits is Markovian. However, this assumption is often not valid, as for the case of 1/f charge noise or hyperfine nuclear spin noise. Here, we present a general framework for quantum process tomography (QPT) in the presence of time-correlated noise. We further introduce fidelity benchmarks that quantify the relative strength of different sources of Markovian and non-Markovian noise. As an application of our method, we perform a comparative theoretical and experimental analysis of silicon spin qubits. We first develop a detailed noise model that accounts for the dominant sources of noise and validate the model against experimental data. Applying our framework for time-correlated QPT, we find that the number of independent parameters needed to characterize one- and two-qubit gates can be compressed by 10× and 100×, respectively, when compared to the fully generic case. These compressions reduce the amount of tomographic measurements needed in experiment, while also significantly speeding up numerical simulations of noisy quantum circuit dynamics compared to time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation. Using this compressed noise model, we find good agreement between our theoretically predicted process fidelities and two-qubit interleaved randomized benchmarking fidelities of 99.8% measured in recent experiments on silicon spin qubits. More broadly, our formalism can be directly extended to develop efficient and scalable tuning protocols for high-fidelity control of large arrays of quantum devices with non-Markovian noise.Received 14 August 2023Accepted 9 January 2024DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.010306Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Reliable randomness is a core ingredient in algorithms and applications ranging from numerical simulations to statistical sampling and cryptography. The outcomes of measurements on entangled quantum states can violate Bell inequalities, thus guaranteeing their intrinsic randomness. This constitutes the basis for certified randomness generation. However, this certification requires spacelike separated devices, making it unfit for a compact apparatus. Here we provide a general method for certified randomness generation on a small-scale application-ready device and perform an integrated photonic demonstration combining a solid-state emitter and a glass chip. In contrast to most existing certification protocols, which in the absence of spacelike separation are vulnerable to loopholes inherent to realistic devices, the protocol we implement accounts for information leakage and is thus compatible with emerging compact scalable devices. We demonstrate a two-qubit photonic device that achieves the highest standard in randomness, yet is cut out for real-world applications. The full 94.5-h-long stabilized process harnesses a bright and stable single-photon quantum-dot-based source, feeding into a reconfigurable photonic chip, with stability in the milliradian range on the implemented phases and consistent indistinguishability of the entangled photons above 93%. Using the contextuality framework, we certify private randomness generation and achieve a rate compatible with randomness expansion secure against quantum adversaries.

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating high-order moments of quantum states is an elementary precondition for many crucial tasks in quantum computing, such as entanglement spectroscopy, entropy estimation, spectrum estimation, and predicting nonlinear features from quantum states. But in reality, inevitable quantum noise prevents us from accessing the desired value. In this paper, we address this issue by systematically analyzing the feasibility and efficiency of extracting high-order moments from noisy states. We first show that there exists a quantum protocol capable of accomplishing this task if and only if the underlying noise channel is invertible. We then establish a method for deriving protocols that attain optimal sample complexity using quantum operations and classical postprocessing only. Our protocols, in contrast to conventional ones, incur lower overheads and avoid sampling different quantum operations due to a novel technique called the “‘observable shift method,” making the protocols strong candidates for practical use on current quantum devices. The proposed method also indicates the power of entangled protocols in retrieving high-order information, whereas in the existing methods, entanglement does not help. We further construct the protocol for large quantum systems to retrieve the depolarizing channels, making the proposed method scalable. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of how quantum noise could affect high-order information extraction and provides guidance on how to tackle it.

Nevertheless, they are useful for a wide variety of quantum protocols, with numerous proposals assuming access to an optimal NLA device that performs with the maximum possible success probability. Here we propose the first linear-optics NLA protocol that asymptotically achieves this success probability bound by modifying the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn near-deterministic teleporter into an amplifier.

    "abstract": "Cooling a quantum system to its ground state is important for the characterization of nontrivial interacting systems and in the context of a variety of quantum information platforms. It can be achieved by employing measurement-based passive steering protocols, where the steering steps are predetermined and are not based on measurement readouts. However, measurements realized by coupling the system to auxiliary quantum degrees of freedom (“detectors”) are rather costly and protocols in which the number of detectors scales with system size will have limited practical applicability. Here, we identify conditions under which measurement-based cooling protocols can be taken to the ultimate dilute limit where the number of detectors is independent of system size. For two examples of frustration-free one-dimensional spin chains, we show that steering on a single link is sufficient to cool these systems into their unique ground states. We corroborate our analytical arguments with finite-size numerical simulations and discuss further applications of dilute cooling. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

Upon adjusting parameters of local unitary gates, the dynamics can be either chaotic or integrable. The latter corresponds to a generalization of the space-time discretized (Trotterized) higher-spin quantum Heisenberg chain. We demonstrate that breaking of space-reflection symmetry results in a drift in the dynamical spin susceptibility. Remarkably, we find a universal drift velocity given by a simple formula, which, at zero average magnetization, depends only on the values of SU(2) Casimir invariants associated with local spins. In the integrable case, the drift velocity formula is confirmed analytically based on the exact solution of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, by inspecting the large fluctuations of the time-integrated current between two halves of the system in stationary maximum-entropy states, we demonstrate violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, implying that such states cannot be regarded as equilibrium ones. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function of the time-integrated current instead obeys a generalized fluctuation relation. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "Stabilizer codes are the most widely studied class of quantum error-correcting codes and form the basis of most proposals for a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A stabilizer code is defined by a set of parity-check operators, which are measured in order to infer information about errors that may have occurred. In typical settings, measuring these operators is itself a noisy process and the noise strength scales with the number of qubits involved in a given parity check, or its weight. Hastings has proposed a method for reducing the weights of the parity checks of a stabilizer code, though it has previously only been studied in the asymptotic regime. Here, we instead focus on the regime of small to medium-size codes suitable for quantum computing hardware. We both provide a fully explicit description of Hastings’s method and propose a substantially simplified weight-reduction method that is applicable to the class of quantum product codes. Our simplified method allows us to reduce the check weights of hypergraph- and lifted-product codes to at most six, while preserving the number of logical qubits and at least retaining (in fact, often increasing) the code distance. The price we pay is an increase in the number of physical qubits by a constant factor but we find that our method is much more efficient than Hastings’s method in this regard. We benchmark the performance of our codes on a simulated photonic quantum computing architecture based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits and passive linear optics, finding that our weight-reduction method substantially improves code performance.

This setup also encompasses a broad class of adaptive quantum dynamics based on continuous measurement and feedback. As steady-state entanglement increases, there is generically an emergent strong symmetry that leads to a dynamical slow-down. Using this, we can prove rigorous bounds on relaxation times set by steady-state entanglement. We also find that this time must necessarily diverge for maximal entanglement. To test our bound, we consider the dynamics of a random ensemble of local Lindbladians that support pure steady states, finding that the bound does an excellent job of predicting how the dissipative gap varies with the amount of entanglement. Our work provides general insights into how dynamics and entanglement are connected in open systems and has specific relevance to quantum reservoir engineering.

    "abstract": "Validation of quantum advantage claims in the context of Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) currently relies on providing evidence that the experimental samples genuinely follow their corresponding ground truth, i.e., the theoretical model of the experiment that includes all the possible losses that the experimenters can account for. This approach to verification has an important drawback: it is necessary to assume that the ground truth distributions are computationally hard to sample, that is, that they are sufficiently close to the distribution of the ideal, lossless experiment, for which there is evidence that sampling, either exactly or approximately, is a computationally hard task. This assumption, which cannot be easily confirmed, opens the door to classical algorithms that exploit the noise in the ground truth to efficiently simulate the experiments, thus undermining any quantum advantage claim. In this work, we argue that one can avoid this issue by validating GBS implementations using their corresponding ideal distributions directly. We explain how to use a modified version of the linear cross-entropy, a quantity that we call the LXE score, to find reference values that help us assess how close a given GBS implementation is to its corresponding ideal model. Finally, we analytically compute the score that would be obtained by a lossless GBS implementation. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "Quantum correlations, like entanglement, represent the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics and pose essential issues and challenges to the interpretation of this pillar of modern physics. Although quantum correlations are largely acknowledged as a major resource to achieve quantum advantage in many tasks of quantum technologies, their full quantitative description and the axiomatic basis underlying them are still under investigation. Previous works have suggested that the origin of nonlocal correlations is grounded in principles capturing (from outside the quantum formalism) the essence of quantum uncertainty. In particular, the recently introduced principle of relativistic independence has given rise to a new bound intertwining local and nonlocal correlations. Here, we test such a bound by realizing together sequential and joint weak measurements on entangled photon pairs, allowing us to simultaneously quantify both local and nonlocal correlations by measuring incompatible observables on the same quantum system without collapsing its state, a task typically forbidden in the traditional (projective) quantum measurement framework. Our results demonstrate the existence of a fundamental limit on the extent of quantum correlations, shedding light on the profound role of uncertainty in both enabling and balancing them.

While such bound states are protected by integrability in a one-dimensional chain, the experiment found the bound states to be unexpectedly robust when integrability was broken by decorating the circuit with additional qubits, at least for small numbers of qubits (<a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mo>≤</a:mo><a:mspace width=\"0.2em\"/><a:mn>24</a:mn></a:math>) within the experimental capability. Here we scrutinize this result by state-of-the-art classical simulations, which greatly exceed the experimental system sizes and provide a benchmark for future studies in larger circuits. We find that the bound states consisting of a number of photons are indeed robust in the nonintegrable regime, even after scaling to the infinite-time and infinite-system size limit. Moreover, we show that such systems possess unusual spectral properties, with level statistics that deviates from the random matrix theory expectation. On the other hand, for low but finite density of photons, we find a much faster onset of thermalization and significantly weaker signatures of bound states, suggesting that anomalous dynamics may only be a property of dilute systems with density of photons in the thermodynamic limit. The robustness of the bound states is also influenced by the number of decoration qubits and, to a lesser degree, by the regularity of their spatial arrangement.

What is more, our result on quantum dichotomies can also be used to obtain, up to second-order asymptotic terms, optimal conversion rates between pure bipartite entangled states under local operations and classical communication.

Two promising features of bosonic codes are that syndrome measurements are natively analog and that they can be concatenated with discrete-variable codes. In this work, we propose novel decoding methods that explicitly exploit the analog syndrome information obtained from the bosonic qubit readout in a concatenated architecture. Our methods are versatile and can be generally applied to any bosonic code concatenated with a quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of quasi-single shot protocols as a novel approach that significantly reduces the number of repeated syndrome measurements required when decoding under phenomenological noise. To realize the protocol, we present the first implementation of time-domain decoding with the overlapping window method for general QLDPC codes and a novel analog single-shot decoding method. Our results lay the foundation for general decoding algorithms using analog information and demonstrate promising results in the direction of fault-tolerant quantum computation with concatenated bosonic-QLDPC codes.

    "abstract": "Adiabatic time evolution of quantum systems is a widely used tool with applications ranging from state preparation through simplifications of computations and topological transformations to optimization and quantum computing. Adiabatic time evolution generally works well for gapped ground states, but not for thermal states in the middle of the spectrum that lack a protecting energy gap. Here we show that quantum many-body scars - a particular type of highly excited states - are suitable for adiabatic time evolution despite the absence of a protecting energy gap. Considering two rather different models, namely a one-dimensional model constructed from tensor networks and a two-dimensional fractional quantum Hall model with anyons, we find that the quantum scars perform similarly to gapped ground states with respect to adiabatic dynamics when the required final adiabatic fidelity is around 0.99. The maximum speed at which the scar state of the one-dimensional model can be adiabatically transformed decreases as a power law with system size, as opposed to exponentially for both generic thermal and disorder-driven localized states. At constant and very low ramp speed, we find that the deviation of the fidelity from unity scales linearly with ramp speed for scar states, but quadratically for gapped ground states. The gapped ground states hence perform better when the required adiabatic fidelities are very high, such as 0.9999 and above. We identify two mechanisms for leakage out of the scar state and use them to explain our results. While manipulating a single, isolated ground state is common in quantum applications, adiabatic evolution of scar states provides the flexibility to manipulate an entire tower of ground-state-like states simultaneously in a single system.",

Coherent quantum control is an essential tool for understanding and mitigating decoherence. Moreover, characterizing and controlling orbital states is a central challenge for quantum networking, where optical coherence is tied to orbital coherence. We study resonant multiphonon orbital Rabi oscillations in both the frequency and time domain, extracting the strength of the orbital-phonon interactions and the coherence of the acoustically driven orbital states. We reach the strong-driving limit, where the physics is dominated by the coupling induced by the acoustic waves. We find agreement between our measurements, quantum master-equation simulations, and a Landau-Zener transition model in the strong-driving limit. Using perturbation theory, we derive an expression for the orbital Rabi frequency versus the acoustic drive strength that is nonperturbative in the drive strength and agrees well with our measurements for all acoustic powers. Motivated by continuous-wave spin-resonance-based decoherence protection schemes, we model the orbital decoherence and find good agreement between our model and our measured few-to-several-nanoseconds orbital decoherence times.

In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin-encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

A core limitation of these experiments lies in the mode structure of the cavity field, which is hard coded in the shape and geometry of the mirrors. As a result, most applications of cavity QED trade spatial resolution for enhanced sensitivity. Here, we propose and demonstrate a cavity-microscope device capable of controlling in space and time the coupling between atoms and light in a single-mode high-finesse cavity, reaching a spatial resolution an order of magnitude lower than the cavity-mode waist. This is achieved through local Floquet engineering of the atomic level structure, imprinting a corresponding atom-field coupling. We illustrate this capability by engineering micrometer-scale coupling, using cavity-assisted atomic measurements and optimization. Our system forms an optical device with a single optical axis, has the same footprint and complexity as a standard Fabry-Perot cavity or confocal lens pair, and can be used for any atomic species.

We investigate the impact of common analytical error models, such as heating and dephasing, on the distribution of outcomes over randomized displacement trajectories in phase space. We show that analyzing the distinctive behavior of the mean and variance of this distribution—describable as a gamma distribution—enables identification of error processes, and quantitative extraction of error rates and correlations using a minimal number of measurements. We experimentally validate the analytical models by injecting engineered noise into the motional mode of a trapped-ion system and performing the RBB protocol, showing good agreement between experiment and theory.

This allows for the long-sought realization of a state with long-range superconducting order in current lattice quantum simulation machines.

    "abstract": "Atom-loss errors are a major limitation of current state-of-the-art neutral-atom quantum computers and pose a significant challenge for scalable systems. In a quantum processor with cesium atoms, we demonstrate proof-of-principle circuit-based conversion of this form of leakage error to erasure errors via leakage-detection units (LDUs), which nondestructively map information about the presence or absence of the qubit onto the state of an ancilla. We benchmark the performance of the LDU using a three-outcome low-loss state-detection method and find that the LDU detects atom-loss errors with approximately 93.4% accuracy, limited by technical imperfections of our apparatus. We further compile and execute a LDU, wherein the roles of the original data atom and ancilla atom are exchanged under the action of the LDU, providing “free refilling” of atoms in the case of atom loss. This circuit-based leakage-to-erasure error conversion is a critical component of a neutral-atom quantum processor where the quantum information may significantly outlive the lifetime of any individual atom in the quantum register. Finally, we demonstrate that LDUs may also be used to handle other forms of leakage errors where population moves to states outside of the computational subspace.

    "abstract": "Multimode quantum light is enticing for several applications, spanning imaging, spectroscopy, communication, and more. Parametric nonlinear processes have been vital in realizing squeezed and other quantum states of light. However, most work exploiting these processes has focused on generating multimode squeezed vacua and squeezing in mode superpositions (supermodes). Bright squeezing in multiple discrete frequency modes, if realized, could unlock novel applications in quantum-enhanced spectroscopy and optical quantum computing. Here, we show how dissipation engineering of a multimode nonlinear cavity with cascaded three-wave-mixing processes allows us to shape above-threshold frequency combs that feature strong single-mode output amplitude noise squeezing over 10 dB below the shot-noise limit, tunable across the comb. In addition, we demonstrate squeezing for multiple discrete frequency modes above threshold. This bright squeezing arises from enhancement of the (noiseless) nonlinear rate relative to decay rates in the system due to the cascaded generation of photons in a single idler “bath” mode. A natural consequence of the strong nonlinear coupling in our system is the creation of an effective cavity in the synthetic frequency dimension that sustains Bloch oscillations in the modal energy distribution. Bloch mode engineering could provide an opportunity to better control nonlinear energy flow in the synthetic frequency dimension, with exciting applications in quantum random walks and topological photonics. Lastly, we show evidence of long-range correlations in amplitude noise between discrete frequency modes, enabling long-range entanglement in a synthetic frequency dimension and providing a new resource for quantum communication.

    "abstract": "High-fidelity qubit readout is critical in order to obtain the thresholds needed to implement quantum error-correction protocols and achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing. Large-scale silicon qubit devices will have densely packed arrays of quantum dots with multiple charge sensors that are, on average, farther away from the quantum dots, entailing a reduction in readout fidelities. Here, we present a readout technique that enhances the readout fidelity in a linear SiMOS four-dot array by amplifying correlations between a pair of single-electron transistors, known as a twin SET. By recording and subsequently correlating the twin SET traces as we modulate the dot detuning across a charge transition, we demonstrate a reduction in the charge readout infidelity by over one order of magnitude compared to traditional readout methods. We also study the spin-to-charge conversion errors introduced by the modulation technique and conclude that faster modulation frequencies avoid relaxation-induced errors without introducing significant spin-flip errors, favoring the use of the technique at short integration times. This method not only allows for faster and higher-fidelity qubit measurements but it also enhances the signal corresponding to charge transitions that take place farther away from the sensors, enabling a way to circumvent the reduction in readout fidelities in large arrays of qubits.

    "abstract": "In a plethora of physical situations, one can distinguish a mediator—a system that couples other, noninteracting, systems. Often, the mediator itself is not directly accessible to experimentation, yet it is interesting and sometimes crucial to understand if it admits nonclassical properties. An example of this sort that has recently been enjoying considerable attention is that of two quantum masses coupled via a gravitational field. It has been argued that the gain of quantum entanglement between the masses indicates nonclassicality of the states of the whole tripartite system. Here, we focus on the nonclassical properties of the involved interactions rather than the states. We derive inequalities the violation of which indicates noncommutativity and nondecomposability (open-system generalization of noncommuting unitaries) of interactions through the mediators. The derivations are based on properties of general quantum formalism and make minimalistic assumptions about the studied systems; in particular, the interactions can remain uncharacterized throughout the assessment. Furthermore, we also present conditions that solely use correlations between the coupled systems, excluding the need to measure the mediator. Next, we show that the amount of violation places a lower bound on suitably defined degree of nondecomposability. This makes the methods quantitative and at the same time experiment ready. We give applications of these techniques in two different fields: for detecting the nonclassicality of gravitational interaction and in bounding the Trotter error in quantum simulations.

Such systems are found in, e.g., molecular-dynamics simulations within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. By employing a framework based on the Koopman–von Neumann formulation of classical mechanics, we express the Liouville equation of motion as unitary dynamics and utilize phase kickback from a dynamical quantum simulation to calculate the quantum forces acting on classical particles. This approach allows us to simulate the dynamics of these classical particles without the overheads associated with measuring gradients and solving the equations of motion on a classical computer, resulting in a superpolynomial advantage at the price of increased space complexity. We demonstrate that these simulations can be performed in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles, enabling the estimation of thermodynamic properties from the prepared probability density.

    "abstract": "We develop and demonstrate a trainable temporal postprocessor (TPP) harnessing a simple but versatile machine learning algorithm to provide optimal processing of quantum measurement data subject to arbitrary noise processes for the readout of an arbitrary number of quantum states. We demonstrate the TPP on the essential task of qubit state readout, which has historically relied on temporal processing via matched filters in spite of their applicability for only specific noise conditions. Our results show that the TPP can reliably outperform standard filtering approaches under complex readout conditions, such as high-power readout. Using simulations of quantum measurement noise sources, we show that this advantage relies on the TPP’s ability to learn optimal linear filters that account for general quantum noise correlations in data, such as those due to quantum jumps, or correlated noise added by a phase-preserving quantum amplifier. Furthermore, we derive an exact analytic form for the optimal TPP weights: this positions the TPP as a linearly scaling generalization of matched filtering, valid for an arbitrary number of states under the most general readout noise conditions, all while preserving a training complexity that is essentially negligible in comparison with that of training neural networks for processing temporal quantum measurement data. The TPP can be autonomously and reliably trained on measurement data and requires only linear operations, making it ideal for field-programmable gate array implementations in circuit QED for real-time processing of measurement data from general quantum systems.

    "abstract": "The quantum Zeno effect asserts that quantum measurements inhibit simultaneous unitary dynamics when the “collapse” events are sufficiently strong and frequent. This applies in the limit of strong continuous measurement or dissipation. It is possible to implement a dissipative control that is known as “Zeno dragging” by dynamically varying the monitored observable, and hence also the eigenstates, which are attractors under Zeno dynamics. This is similar to adiabatic processes, in that the Zeno-dragging fidelity is highest when the rate of eigenstate change is slow compared to the measurement rate. We demonstrate here two theoretical methods for using such dynamics to achieve control of quantum systems. The first, which we shall refer to as “shortcut to Zeno,” is analogous to the shortcuts to adiabaticity (counterdiabatic driving) that are frequently used to accelerate unitary adiabatic evolution. In the second approach, we apply the Chantasri-Dressel-Jordan stochastic action [PRA 88, 042110 (2013)], and demonstrate that the extremal-probability readout paths derived from this are well suited to setting up a Pontryagin-style optimization of the Zeno-dragging schedule. A fundamental contribution of the latter approach is to show that an action suitable for measurement-driven control optimization can be derived quite generally from statistical arguments. Implementing these methods on the Zeno dragging of a qubit, we find that both approaches yield the same solution, namely, that the optimal control is a unitary that matches the motion of the Zeno-monitored eigenstate. We then show that such a solution can be more robust than a unitary-only operation and we comment on solvable generalizations of our qubit example embedded in larger systems. These methods open up new pathways toward systematically developing dynamic control of Zeno subspaces to realize dissipatively stabilized quantum operations.

    "abstract": "Hybridizing different degrees of freedom or physical platforms potentially offers various advantages in building scalable quantum architectures. Here, we introduce a fault-tolerant hybrid quantum computation by building on the advantages of both discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) systems. In particular, we define a CV-DV hybrid qubit with a bosonic cat code and a single photon, which is implementable in current photonic platforms. Due to the cat code encoded in the CV part, the predominant loss errors are readily correctable without multiqubit encoding, while the logical basis is inherently orthogonal due to the DV part. We design fault-tolerant architectures by concatenating hybrid qubits and an outer DV quantum error-correction code such as a topological code, exploring their potential merit in developing scalable quantum computation. We demonstrate by numerical simulations that our scheme is at least an order of magnitude more resource efficient compared to all previous proposals in photonic platforms, allowing us to achieve a record-high loss threshold among existing CV and hybrid approaches. We discuss the realization of our approach not only in all-photonic platforms but also in other hybrid platforms including superconducting and trapped-ion systems, which allows us to find various efficient routes toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.

For coupling rates larger than the bandwidth of the associated continuum, decoherence can be mitigated, and new stable eigenstates emerge.

Enabled by their small vibrational eigenfrequencies, we achieve the regime of strong continuum couplings and observe the appearance of new resonances. We explain the observed spectroscopic features as molecular states emerging in the presence of the light field using a Fano model.

    "abstract": "Phase slips occur across all Josephson junctions (JJs) at a rate that increases with the impedance of the junction. In superconducting qubits composed of JJ-array superinductors—such as fluxonium—phase slips in the array can lead to decoherence. In particular, phase-slip processes at the individual array junctions can coherently interfere, each with an Aharonov-Casher phase that depends on the offset charges of the array islands. These coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) perturbatively modify the qubit frequency, and therefore charge noise on the array islands will lead to dephasing. By varying the impedance of the array junctions, we design a set of fluxonium qubits in which the expected phase-slip rate within the JJ array changes by several orders of magnitude. We characterize the coherence times of these qubits and demonstrate that the scaling of CQPS-induced dephasing rates agrees with our theoretical model. Furthermore, we perform noise spectroscopy of two qubits in regimes dominated by either CQPS or flux noise. We find that the noise power spectrum associated with CQPS dephasing appears to be featureless at low frequencies and not <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mn>1</a:mn><a:mo>/</a:mo><a:mi>f</a:mi></a:math>.

    "abstract": "In computer and system sciences, higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) are a type of cellular automata that evolve over multiple time steps and generate complex patterns, which have various applications, such as secret-sharing schemes, data compression, and image encryption. In this paper, we introduce HOCA to quantum many-body physics and construct a series of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of matter, in which symmetries are supported on a great variety of subsystems embbeded in the SPT bulk. We call these phases HOCA-generated SPT (HGSPT) phases. Specifically, we show that HOCA can generate not only well-understood SPTs with symmetries supported on either regular (e.g., linelike subsystems in the two-dimensional cluster model) or fractal subsystems, but also a large class of unexplored SPTs with symmetries supported on more choices of subsystems. One example is that has either fractal and linelike subsystem symmetries simultaneously or two distinct types of fractal symmetries simultaneously. Another example is in which chaotic-looking symmetries are significantly different from and thus cannot reduce to fractal or regular subsystem symmetries. We also introduce a new notation system to characterize HGSPTs. We prove that all possible subsystem symmetries in a square lattice can be locally simulated by an HOCA-generated symmetry. As the usual two-point strange correlators are trivial in most HGSPTs, we find that the nontrivial SPT orders can be detected by what we call . We propose a universal procedure to design the spatial configuration of the multi point strange correlators for a given HGSPT phase. Specifically, we find deep connections between multi point strange correlators and the spurious topological entanglement entropy (STEE), both exhibiting long-range behavior in a short-range entangled state. Our HOCA approaches and multi point strange correlators pave the way for a unified paradigm to design, classify, and detect phases of matter with symmetries supported on a great variety of subsystems, and also provide potential useful perspective in surpassing the computational irreducibility of HOCA in a quantum mechanical way.

The system is based on spin-1/2 qubits in a resonator such as atoms in an optical cavity or superconducting qubits coupled to a main bus. By sending light or microwave into the resonator, it induces ac Stark shifts on particular angular-momentum eigenstates (Dicke states) of qubits. Then we are able to generate barriers that hinder transitions between adjacent Dicke states and tear the original Hilbert space into pieces. Therefore, a simple global single-qubit rotation becomes highly nontrivial, and thus generates entanglement among the many-body system. By optimal control of energy shifts on Dicke states, we are able to generate arbitrary symmetric entangled states. We also exemplify that we can create varieties of useful states with near-unity fidelities in only one or very few steps, including W states, spin-squeezed states (SSSs), and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states.

Decoherence and loss are the two main disruptive processes that lead to the loss of nonclassical behavior in quantum correlations. In quantum systems, scattering can contribute to both decoherence and loss. In this work, we present an experimental scheme capable of significantly mitigating the adverse impact of scattering in quantum systems. Our quantum system is composed of a two-mode squeezed light generated with the four-wave-mixing process in hot rubidium vapor and a scatterer is introduced to one of the two modes. An integrating sphere is then placed after the scatterer to recollect the scattered photons. We use mutual information between the two modes as the measure of quantum correlations and demonstrate a 47.5% mutual information recovery from scattering, despite an enormous photon loss of greater than 85%. Our scheme is the very first step toward recovering quantum correlations from disruptive random processes and thus has the potential to bridge the gap between proof-of-principle demonstrations and practical real-world implementations of quantum protocols.

    "abstract": "Color codes are promising quantum error-correction (QEC) codes because they have an advantage over surface codes in that all Clifford gates can be implemented transversally. However, the thresholds of color codes under circuit-level noise are relatively low, mainly because measurements of their high-weight stabilizer generators cause an increase in the circuit depth and, thus, substantial errors are introduced. This makes color codes not the best candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we propose a method to suppress the impact of such errors by optimizing weights of decoders using conditional error probabilities conditioned on the measurement outcomes of flag qubits. In numerical simulations, we improve the threshold of the (4.8.8) color code under circuit-level noise from 0.14% to around 0.27%, which is calculated by using an integer programming decoder. Furthermore, in the (6.6.6) color code, we achieve a circuit-level threshold of around 0.36%, which is almost the same value as the highest value in the previous studies employing the same noise model. In both cases, the effective code distance is also improved compared to a conventional method that uses a single ancilla qubit for each stabilizer measurement. Thereby, the achieved logical error rates at low physical error rates are almost one order of magnitude lower than those of the conventional method with the same code distance. Even when compared to the single-ancilla method with a higher code distance, considering the increased number of qubits used in our method, we achieve lower logical error rates in most cases. This method can also be applied to other weight-based decoders, making the color codes more promising as candidates for the experimental implementation of QEC. Furthermore, one can utilize this approach to improve a threshold of wider classes of QEC codes, such as high-rate quantum low-density parity-check codes.

This expands the class of provable exponential advantages using only a constant overhead quantum memory, or minimal quantum memory, and we provide a number of examples where the state <m:math xmlns:m=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><m:msup><m:mi>ρ</m:mi><m:mo>∗</m:mo></m:msup></m:math> is naturally available in both computational and physical applications. In addition, we precisely quantify the power of classical shadows on single copies under a generalized Clifford ensemble and give a class of quantities that can be efficiently learned. The learning task we study in both the single copy and quantum memory settings is physically natural and corresponds to real-space observables with a limit of bosonic modes, where it achieves an exponential improvement in detecting certain signals under a noisy background. We quantify a new and powerful resource in quantum learning, and we believe the advantage may find applications in improving quantum simulation, learning from quantum sensors, and uncovering new physical phenomena.

    "abstract": "The properties of superconducting devices depend sensitively on the parity (even or odd) of the quasiparticles that they contain. Encoding quantum information in the parity degree of freedom is central in several emerging solid-state qubit architectures, including in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices. In the latter case, accurate, nondestructive, and time-resolved parity measurements are a challenging issue. Here, we report on control and real-time parity measurement in a superconducting island embedded in a superconducting loop and realized in a hybrid two-dimensional heterostructure using a microwave resonator. To avoid microwave losses impeding time-resolved measurements, the device and readout resonator are located on separate chips, connected via flip-chip bonding, and couple inductively through vacuum. The superconducting resonator detects the parity-dependent circuit inductance, allowing for fast parity readout.

    "abstract": "The advancement of quantum simulators motivates the development of a theoretical framework to assist with efficient state preparation in quantum many-body systems. Generally, preparing a target entangled state via unitary evolution with time-dependent couplings is a challenging task and very little is known about the existence of solutions and their properties. In this work we develop a constructive approach for preparing matrix product states (MPS) via continuous unitary evolution. We provide an explicit construction of the operator that exactly implements the evolution of a given MPS along a specified direction in its tangent space. This operator can be written as a sum of local terms of finite range, yet it is in general non-Hermitian. Relying on the explicit construction of the non-Hermitian generator of the dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of a Hermitian sequence of operators that implements the desired MPS evolution with an error that decreases exponentially with the operator range. The construction is benchmarked on an explicit periodic trajectory in a translationally invariant MPS manifold. We demonstrate that the Floquet unitary generating the dynamics over one period of the trajectory features an approximate MPS-like eigenstate embedded among a sea of thermalizing eigenstates. These results show that our construction is not only useful for state preparation and control of many-body systems, but also provides a generic route towards Floquet scars—periodically driven models with quasilocal generators of dynamics that have exact MPS eigenstates in their spectrum.

    "abstract": "Entanglement is a valuable resource in quantum information technologies. The practical implementation of entangled photon sources faces obstacles from imperfections and defects inherent in physical systems, resulting in a loss or degradation of entanglement. The topological photonic insulators, however, have emerged as promising candidates, demonstrating an exceptional capability to resist defect-induced scattering, thus enabling the development of robust entangled sources. Despite their inherent advantages, building programmable topologically protected entangled sources remains challenging due to complex device designs and weak material nonlinearity. Here, we present a development in entangled photon-pair generation achieved through a nonmagnetic and tunable anomalous Floquet insulator, utilizing an optical spontaneous four-wave-mixing process. We verify the nonclassicality and time-energy entanglement of the photons generated by our topological system. Our experiment demonstrates a substantial enhancement in nonclassical photon-pair generation compared to devices reliant only on topological edge states.

    "abstract": "Irreversibility, crucial in both thermodynamics and information theory, is naturally studied by comparing the evolution—the (forward) channel—with an associated reverse—the reverse channel. There are two natural ways to define this reverse channel. Using logical inference, the reverse channel is the Bayesian retrodiction (the Petz recovery map in the quantum formalism) of the original one. Alternatively, we know from physics that every irreversible process can be modeled as an open system: one can then define the corresponding closed system by adding a bath (“dilation”), trivially reverse the global reversible process, and finally remove the bath again. We prove that the two recipes are strictly identical, both in the classical and in the quantum formalism, once one accounts for correlations formed between system and the bath. Having established this, we define and study special classes of maps: (including ), for which no such system-bath correlations are formed for some states; and , when the reverse channel can be implemented with the same devices as the original one. We establish several general results connecting these classes, and a very detailed characterization when both the system and the bath are one qubit. In particular, we show that, when reverse channels are well defined, product preservation is a sufficient but not necessary condition for tabletop reversibility; and that the preservation of local energy spectra is a necessary and sufficient condition to generalized thermal operations.

    "abstract": "Many problems in quantum information theory can be formulated as optimizations over the sequential outcomes of dynamical systems subject to unpredictable external influences. Such problems include many-body entanglement detection through adaptive measurements, computing the maximum average score of a preparation game over a continuous set of target states, and limiting the behavior of a (quantum) finite-state automaton. In this work, we introduce tractable relaxations of this class of optimization problems. To illustrate their performance, we use them to: (a) compute the probability that a finite-state automaton outputs a given sequence of bits; (b) develop a new many-body entanglement-detection protocol; and (c) let the computer an adaptive protocol for magic state detection. As we further show, the maximum score of a sequential problem in the limit of infinitely many time steps is in general incomputable. Nonetheless, we provide general heuristics to bound this quantity and show that they provide useful estimates in relevant scenarios. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

Its practical realization involves the interference of optical modes and the detection of a single photon in an indistinguishable manner. Yet, in the absence of efficient photon-number-resolution capabilities, errors arise from multiphoton components, decreasing the overall process fidelity. Here, we introduce a hybrid detection scheme for Bell-state measurement, leveraging both on-off single-photon detection and quadrature conditioning via homodyne detection. We derive explicit fidelities for quantum teleportation and entanglement-swapping processes employing this strategy, demonstrating its efficacy. We also compare with photon-number-resolving detectors and find a strong advantage of the hybrid scheme in a wide range of parameters.

    "abstract": "The Schmidt decomposition is the go-to tool for measuring bipartite entanglement of pure quantum states. Similarly, it is possible to study the entangling features of a quantum operation using its operator-Schmidt or tensor-product decomposition. While quantum technological implementations of the former are thoroughly studied, entangling properties on the operator level are harder to extract in the quantum computational framework because of the exponential nature of sample complexity. Here, we present an algorithm for unbalanced partitions into a small subsystem and a large one (the environment) to compute the tensor-product decomposition of a unitary the effect of which on the small subsystem is captured in classical memory, while the effect on the environment is accessible as a quantum resource. This quantum algorithm may be used to make predictions about operator nonlocality and effective open quantum dynamics on a subsystem, as well as for finding low-rank approximations and low-depth compilations of quantum circuit unitaries. We demonstrate the method and its applications on a time-evolution unitary of an isotropic Heisenberg model in two dimensions. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

    "abstract": "We investigate and ascertain the ideal inputs to any finite-time physical process. We demonstrate that the expectation values of entropy flow, heat, and work can all be determined via Hermitian observables of the initial state. These Hermitian operators encapsulate the breadth of behavior and the ideal inputs for common thermodynamic objectives. We show how to construct these Hermitian operators from measurements of thermodynamic output from a finite number of effectively arbitrary inputs. The behavior of a small number of test inputs thus determines the full range of thermodynamic behavior from all inputs. For any process, entropy flow, heat, and work can all be extremized by pure input states—eigenstates of the respective operators. In contrast, the input states that minimize entropy production or maximize the change in free energy are nonpure mixed states obtained from the operators as the solution of a convex-optimization problem. To attain these, we provide an easily implementable gradient-descent method on the manifold of density matrices, where an analytic solution yields a valid direction of descent at each iterative step. Ideal inputs within a limited domain, and their associated thermodynamic operators, are obtained with less effort. This allows analysis of ideal thermodynamic inputs within quantum subspaces of infinite-dimensional quantum systems; it also allows analysis of ideal inputs in the classical limit. Our examples illustrate the diversity of “ideal” inputs: distinct initial states minimize entropy production, extremize the change in free energy, and maximize work extraction.

Zurel PRL 260404 (2020)]. This method is closely related to sampling algorithms based on Wigner functions, with the important distinction that Wigner functions can take negative values obstructing the sampling. Indeed, negativity in Wigner functions has been identified as a precondition for a quantum speed-up. However, in the present method of classical simulation, negativity of quasiprobability functions never arises. This model remains probabilistic for all quantum computations.

    "abstract": "In this work, we implement a new method for imaging ultracold atoms with subwavelength resolution capabilities and determine its regime of validity. It uses the laser-driven interaction between excited states to engineer hyperfine ground-state population transfer in a three-level system on scales much smaller than the optical resolution. Subwavelength imaging of a quantum gas is atypical in the sense that the measurement itself perturbs the dynamics of the system. To avoid induced dynamics affecting the measurement, one usually “rapidly” measures the wave function in a so-called strong imaging regime. We experimentally illustrate this regime using a thermal gas ensemble, and demonstrate subwavelength resolution in quantitative agreement with a fully analytical model. Additionally, we show that, counterintuitively, the opposite weak imaging regime can also be exploited to reach subwavelength resolution. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that this regime is a robust solution to select and spatially resolve a 30-nm-wide wave function, which was created and singled out from a tightly confined one-dimensional optical lattice. Using a general dissipation-included formalism, we derive validity criteria for both regimes. The formalism is applicable to other subwavelength methods.

    "abstract": "Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a form of quantum teleportation in which no corrective unitary is required on the part of the receiver. Two primary regimes exist—deterministic PBT in which teleportation is always successful, but is imperfect, and probabilistic PBT, in which teleportation succeeds with probability less than one, but teleportation is perfect upon a success. Two further regimes exist within each of these, in which the resource state used for the teleportation is fixed to a maximally entangled state or free to be optimized. Recent works have resolved the long-standing problem of efficiently implementing port-based teleportation, tackling the two deterministic cases for qudits. Here, we provide algorithms in all four regimes for qubits. Emphasis is placed on the practicality of these algorithms, where we give polynomial improvements in the known gate complexity for PBT, as well as an exponential improvement in the required number of ancillas (albeit in separate protocols). Our approach to the implementation of the square-root measurement in PBT can be directly generalized to other highly symmetric state ensembles. For certain families of states, such a framework yields efficient algorithms in the case in which the Petz-recovery algorithm for the square-root measurement runs in exponential time.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators have been shown to reach lifetimes of the order of a second by maximizing the cavity volume relative to its surface, using better materials, and improving surface treatments. Such cavities represent an ideal platform for quantum computing with bosonic qubits, but their efficient control remains an outstanding problem since the large mode volume results in less efficient coupling to nonlinear elements used for their control. Moreover, this coupling induces additional cavity decay via the inverse Purcell effect that can easily destroy the advantage of a long intrinsic lifetime. Here, we discuss conditions on, and protocols for, efficient utilization of these ultra-high-quality microwave cavities as memories for conventional superconducting qubits. We show that, surprisingly, efficient write and read operations with ultra-high-quality cavities do not require similar quality factors for the qubits and other nonlinear elements used to control them. Through a combination of analytical and numerical calculations, we demonstrate that efficient coupling to cavities with second-scale lifetime is possible with state-of-the-art transmon and superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element devices and outline a route towards controlling cavities with even higher quality factors. Our work explores a potentially viable roadmap towards using ultra-high-quality microwave cavity resonators for storing and processing information encoded in bosonic qubits.

However, it is a nontrivial task in practice due to the uncertainties on the statistics of the state impinging on the detector and to the unavoidable presence of noise that affects the measurement but does not originate from the detector. In this work, we address this problem for a three-dimensional single-atom-resolved detector where shot-to-shot atom-number fluctuations are a central issue in performing a quantum detector tomography. We overcome this difficulty by exploiting the parallel measurement of the counting statistics in subvolumes of the detector, from which we evaluate the effect of shot-to-shot fluctuations and perform a local tomography of the detector. In addition, we illustrate the validity of our method from applying it to Gaussian quantum states with different number statistics. Finally, we show that the response of microchannel plate detectors is well described by using a binomial distribution with the detection efficiency as a single parameter.

    "abstract": "We show that combining ideas from the fields of quantum invariants and optimal control can be used to design optimal quantum control solutions without explicit reference to quantum states. The states are specified only implicitly in terms of operators to which they are eigenstates. The scaling in numerical effort of the resultant approach is not given by the typically exponentially growing effort required for the specification of a time-evolved quantum state, but it is given by the effort required for the specification of a time-evolved operator. For certain Hamiltonians, this effort can be polynomial in the system size. We describe how control problems for state preparation and the realization of propagators can be formulated in this approach, and we provide explicit control solutions for a spin chain with an extended Ising Hamiltonian. The states considered for state-preparation protocols include eigenstates of Hamiltonians with more than pairwise interactions and these Hamiltonians are also used for the definition of target propagators. The cost of describing suitable time-evolving operators grows only quadratically with the system size, allowing us to construct explicit control solutions for up to <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mn>50</a:mn></a:math> spins. While subexponential scaling is obtained only in special cases, we provide several examples that demonstrate favorable scaling beyond the extended Ising model.

    "abstract": "In this work, we show that the kinetically constrained quantum East model lies between a quantum scarred and a many-body localized system featuring an unconventional type of mobility edge in the spectrum. We name this scenario $\\textit{state-dependent}$ mobility edge: while the system does not exhibit a sharp separation in energy between thermal and non-thermal eigenstates, the abundance of non-thermal eigenstates results in slow entanglement growth for $\\textit{many}$ initial states, such as product states, below a finite energy density. We characterize the state-dependent mobility edge by looking at the complexity of classically simulating dynamics using tensor network for system sizes well beyond those accessible via exact diagonalization. Focusing on initial product states, we observe a qualitative change in the dynamics of the bond dimension needed as a function of their energy density. Specifically, the bond dimension typically grows $\\textit{polynomially}$ in time up to a certain energy density, where we locate the state-dependent mobility edge, enabling simulations for long times. Above this energy density, the bond dimension typically grows $\\textit{exponentially}$ making the simulation practically unfeasible beyond short times, as generally expected in interacting theories. We correlate the polynomial growth of the bond dimension to the presence of many non-thermal eigenstates around that energy density, a subset of which we compute via tensor network. The outreach of our findings encompasses quantum sampling problems and the efficient simulation of quantum circuits beyond Clifford families.",

    "abstract": "Successful implementations of quantum technologies require protocols and algorithms that use as few quantum resources as possible. However, many important quantum operations, such as continuous rotation gates in quantum computing or broadband pulses in NMR or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications, can only be implemented approximately using finite quantum resources. This work develops an approach that, on average—at the cost of a modestly increased measurement repetition rate—enables exact implementations. One proceeds by first building a library of a large number of different approximations to the desired gate operation; by randomly selecting these operations according to a preoptimized probability distribution, one can on average implement the desired operation with a rigorously controllable approximation error. The approach relies on sophisticated tools from convex optimization to efficiently find optimal probability distributions. A diverse spectrum of applications are demonstrated as (a) exactly synthesizing rotations in fault-tolerant quantum computers using only low <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mi>T</a:mi></a:math>-count circuits and (b) synthesizing broadband and band-selective pulses of superior performance in quantum optimal control with (c) further applications in NMR or MRI.

    "abstract": "Fault-tolerant syndrome extraction is a key ingredient in implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation. While conventional methods use a number of extra qubits that are linear in the weight of the syndrome, several improvements have been introduced using flag gadgets. In this work, we develop a framework to design flag gadgets using classical codes. Using this framework, we show how to perform fault-tolerant syndrome extraction for any stabilizer code with arbitrary distance using exponentially fewer qubits than conventional methods when qubit measurement and reset are relatively slow compared to a round of error correction. In particular, our method requires only <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><a:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</a:mo><a:mn>2</a:mn><a:mi>t</a:mi><a:mo>+</a:mo><a:mn>1</a:mn><a:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</a:mo><a:mi>t</a:mi><a:mrow><a:mo>⌈</a:mo><a:mrow><a:msub><a:mi>log</a:mi><a:mn>2</a:mn></a:msub><a:mo>﻿</a:mo><a:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</a:mo><a:mi>w</a:mi><a:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</a:mo></a:mrow><a:mo>⌉</a:mo></a:mrow></a:math> flag qubits to fault-tolerantly measure a weight-<h:math xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><h:mi>w</h:mi></h:math> stabilizer. We further take advantage of the saving provided by our construction to fault-tolerantly measure multiple stabilizers using a single gadget and show that it maintains the same exponential advantage when it is used to fault-tolerantly extract the syndromes of quantum low-density parity-check codes. Using the developed framework, we perform computer-assisted search to find several small examples where our constructions reduce the number of qubits required.

    "abstract": "Experimental advances in cavity QED are raising the prospect of using light to probe quantum materials beyond the linear response regime. The capability to access quantum coherent phenomena would significantly advance the field. However, theoretical work on many-body systems coupled to light in the quantum coherent regime has been select. Here, we investigate the radiative properties of a finite-sized quantum wire in a microwave cavity. Examples of quantum wires include single-walled carbon nanotubes, a key experimental system in the field of nano-optics and plasmonics. We find that, for a variety of excited states, the repeated emission of photons results in the generation of many-body quantum entanglement. This leads to an increase in the rate at which subsequent photons are emitted, an example of Dicke superradiance. On the other hand, Pauli blocking tends to reduce this effect. Bosonization, the description of the excitations of a one-dimensional electron system as a gas of bosons, is found to be a powerful theoretical tool in this context. Its application means that many of our results generalize to wires with strong electron-electron interactions. The quantum wire thus represents a new platform to realize Dicke-model physics that does not rely on the various fine tunings necessary in traditional realizations involving many spatially isolated emitters. More broadly, this work demonstrates how quantum entanglement can be generated and measured in a many-body system. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",
