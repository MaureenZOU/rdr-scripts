    "abstract": "More than 3 billion years of evolution have produced an image of biology encoded into the space of natural proteins. Here, we show that language models trained at scale on evolutionary data can generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins. We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to alignment to improve its fidelity. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at a far distance (58% sequence identity) from known fluorescent proteins, which we estimate is equivalent to simulating 500 million years of evolution.",

The earth-abundant, wide-bandgap ( E g \u2248 46 k B T ) tin sulfide (SnS) has shown promising performance in its crystal form. We improved the thermoelectric efficiency in SnS crystals by promoting the convergence of energy and momentum of four valance bands, termed quadruple-band synglisis. We introduced more Sn vacancies to activate quadruple-band synglisis and facilitate carrier transport by inducing SnS 2 in selenium (Se)\u2013alloyed SnS, leading to a high dimensionless figure of merit ( ZT ) of ~1.0 at 300 kelvin and an average ZT of ~1.3 at 300 to 773 kelvin in p-type SnS crystals. We further obtained an experimental efficiency of ~6.5%, and our fabricated cooler demonstrated a maximum cooling temperature difference of ~48.4 kelvin at 353 kelvin. Our observations should draw interest to earth-abundant SnS crystals for applications of waste-heat recovery and thermoelectric cooling.",

We analyzed a global database of soil pollution by arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, nickel, and lead at 796,084 sampling points from 1493 regional studies and used machine learning techniques to map areas with exceedance of agricultural and human health thresholds. We reveal a previously unrecognized high-risk, metal-enriched zone in low-latitude Eurasia, which is attributed to influential climatic, topographic, and anthropogenic conditions. This feature can be regarded as a signpost for the Anthropocene era. We show that 14 to 17% of cropland is affected by toxic metal pollution globally and estimate that between 0.9 and 1.4 billion people live in regions of heightened public health and ecological risks.",

Although ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) is a promising alternative, its poor stability has hindered practical application. We used well-defined extended surface models to identify that RuO 2 undergoes structure-dependent corrosion that causes Ru dissolution. Tantalum (Ta) doping effectively stabilized RuO 2 against such corrosion and enhanced the intrinsic activity of RuO 2 . In an industrial demonstration, Ta-RuO 2 electrocatalyst exhibited stability near that of IrO 2 and had a performance decay rate of ~14 microvolts per hour in a 2800-hour test. At current densities of 1 ampere per square centimeter, it had an overpotential 330 millivolts less than that of IrO 2 .",

Currently, the stability of the most active iridium (Ir) catalysts is impaired by dissolution, redeposition, detachment, and agglomeration of Ir species. Here we present a ripening-induced embedding strategy that securely embeds the Ir catalyst in a cerium oxide support. Cryogenic electron tomography and all-atom kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that synchronizing the growth rate of the support with the nucleation rate of Ir, regulated by sonication, is pivotal for successful synthesis. A PEMWE using this catalyst achieves a cell voltage of 1.72 volts at a current density of 3 amperes per square centimeter with an Ir loading of just 0.3 milligrams per square centimeter and a voltage degradation rate of 1.33 microvolts per hour, as demonstrated by a 6000-hour accelerated aging test.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary challenges in commercializing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is achieving both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and sufficient stability. We integrate wafer-scale continuous monolayer MoS 2 buffers at the top and bottom of a perovskite layer through a transfer process. These films physically block ion migration of perovskite into carrier transport layers and chemically stabilize the formamidinium lead iodide phase through strong coordination interaction. Effective chemical passivation results from the formation of Pb-S bonds, and minority carriers are blocked through a type-I band alignment. Planar p-i-n PSCs (0.074 square centimeters) and modules (9.6 square centimeters) with MoS 2 /perovskite/MoS 2 configuration achieve PCEs up to 26.2% (certified steady-state PCE of 25.9%) and 22.8%, respectively. Moreover, the devices show excellent damp heat (85\u00b0C and 85% relative humidity) stability with <5% PCE loss after 1200 hours and notable high temperature (85\u00b0C) operational stability with <4% PCE loss after 1200 hours.",

With serine hydrolases as a model system, we combined the generative capabilities of RFdiffusion with an ensemble generation method for assessing active site preorganization at each step in the reaction to design enzymes starting from minimal active site descriptions. Experimental characterization revealed catalytic efficiencies ( k cat / K m ) up to 2.2 \u00d7 10 5 M \u22121 s \u22121 and crystal structures that closely match the design models (C\u03b1 root mean square deviations <1 angstrom). Selection for structural compatibility across the reaction coordinate enabled identification of new catalysts remove with five different folds distinct from those of natural serine hydrolases. Our de novo approach provides insight into the geometric basis of catalysis and a roadmap for designing enzymes that catalyze multistep transformations.",

We found that accumulation of primary conjugated and secondary bile acids (BAs) are metabolic features of human hepatocellular carcinoma and experimental liver cancer models. Inhibiting conjugated BA synthesis in hepatocytes through deletion of the BA-conjugating enzyme bile acid\u2013CoA:amino acid N -acyltransferase (BAAT) enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses, reduced tumor growth, and sensitized tumors to anti\u2013programmed cell death protein 1 (anti\u2013PD-1) immunotherapy. Furthermore, different BAs regulated CD8 + T cells differently; primary BAs induced oxidative stress, whereas the secondary BA lithocholic acid inhibited T cell function through endoplasmic reticulum stress, which was countered by ursodeoxycholic acid. We demonstrate that modifying BA synthesis or dietary intake of ursodeoxycholic acid could improve tumor immunotherapy in liver cancer model systems.",

In this work, we report a small-molecule acceptor (SMA), also known as a non\u2013fullerene acceptor (NFA), designed for stretchable organic solar cell ( s -OSC) blends with large mechanical compliance and performance. Blends of the organosilane-functionalized SMA BTP-Si4 with the polymer donor PNTB6-Cl achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >16% and ultimate strain (\u03b5 u ) of >95%. Typical SMAs suppress OSC blend ductility, but the addition of BTP-Si4 enhances it. Although BTP-Si4 is less crystalline than other SMAs, it retains considerable electron mobility and is highly miscible with PNTB6-Cl and is essential for enhancing \u03b5 u . Thus, s -OSCs with PCE > 14% and operating normally under various deformations (>80% PCE retention under an 80% strain) were demonstrated. Analysis of several SMA-polymer blends revealed general molecular structure\u2013miscibility\u2013stretchability relationships for designing ductile blends.",

In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that the synergistic interactions between metal atoms create a fast electron-transfer channel from catalytic iron and cobalt sites, nickel, and tungsten in the polyoxometalate to the electrode, stabilizing the metal sites and preventing dissolution.",

This is accomplished by establishing robust connections between water molecules and the polymer by using sulfuric acid. A sacrificial network is introduced to shield the prime polymer network from collapsing. Under the hydro-locking mode, an alginate-polyacrylamide double-network hydrogel remains soft and stretchable within a temperature range that spans from \u2013115\u00b0 to 143\u00b0C.

The global terrestrial land affected by MYDs has increased at a rate of 49,279 \u00b1 14,771 square kilometers per year from 1980 to 2018. Temperate grasslands have exhibited the greatest declines in vegetation greenness during MYDs, whereas boreal and tropical forests have had comparably minor responses.

    "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cross species barriers and have the potential to cause pandemics. In North America, HPAI A(H5N1) viruses related to the goose/Guangdong 2.3.4.4b hemagglutinin phylogenetic clade have infected wild birds, poultry, and mammals. Our genomic analysis and epidemiological investigation showed that a reassortment event in wild bird populations preceded a single wild bird\u2013to-cattle transmission episode. The movement of asymptomatic or presymptomatic cattle has likely played a role in the spread of HPAI within the United States dairy herd. Some molecular markers that may lead to changes in transmission efficiency and phenotype were detected at low frequencies. Continued transmission of H5N1 HPAI within dairy cattle increases the risk for infection and subsequent spread of the virus to human populations.",

    "abstract": "On 3 October 2023, a multihazard cascade in the Sikkim Himalaya, India, was triggered by 14.7 million cubic meters of frozen lateral moraine collapsing into South Lhonak Lake. The impact generated an ~20-meter tsunami-like impact wave, which breached the moraine and drained ~50 million cubic meters of the lake\u2019s water. The ensuing glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) eroded ~270 million cubic meters of sediment, which overwhelmed infrastructure, including hydropower installations along the Teesta River. The physical scale and human and economic impacts of this event prompt urgent reflection on the role of climate change and human activities in exacerbating such disasters. Insights into multihazard evolution are pivotal for informing policy development, enhancing early warning systems (EWS), and spurring paradigm shifts in GLOF risk management strategies in the Himalaya and other mountain environments.",

    "abstract": "The reversion of vinyl polymers with carbon-carbon backbones to their monomers represents an ideal path to alleviate the growing plastic waste stream. However, depolymerizing such stable materials remains a challenge, with state-of-the-art methods relying on \u201cdesigner\u201d polymers that are neither commercially produced nor suitable for real-world applications. In this work, we report a main chain\u2013initiated, visible light\u2013triggered depolymerization directly applicable to commercial polymers containing undisclosed impurities (e.g., comonomers, additives, or dyes). By in situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the solvent, near-quantitative (>98%) depolymerization of polymethacrylates could be achieved regardless of their synthetic route (e.g., radical or ionic polymerization), end group, and molecular weight (up to 1.6 million daltons). The possibility to perform multigram-scale depolymerizations and confer temporal control renders this methodology a versatile and general route to recycling.",

Their absolute mass holds relevance in fields from particle physics to cosmology. We report on the search for the effective electron antineutrino mass with the KATRIN experiment. KATRIN performs precision spectroscopy of the tritium \u03b2-decay close to the kinematic endpoint. On the basis of the first five measurement campaigns, we derived a best-fit value of m \u03bd 2 = \u2212 0.14 \u2212 0.15 + 0.13 eV 2 , resulting in an upper limit of m \u03bd < 0.45 eV at 90% confidence level. Stemming from 36 million electrons collected in 259 measurement days, a substantial reduction of the background level, and improved systematic uncertainties, this result tightens KATRIN\u2019s previous bound by a factor of almost two.",

Image-based transcriptomics approaches offer an avenue to study such behaviors, yet these approaches have been hindered by the massive density of bacterial messenger RNA. To overcome this challenge, we combined 1000-fold volumetric expansion with multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to create bacterial-MERFISH. This method enables high-throughput, spatially resolved profiling of thousands of operons within individual bacteria. Using bacterial-MERFISH, we dissected the response of Escherichia coli to carbon starvation, systematically mapped subcellular RNA organization, and charted the adaptation of a gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to micrometer-scale niches in the mammalian colon. We envision that bacterial-MERFISH will be broadly applicable to the study of bacterial single-cell heterogeneity in diverse, spatially structured, and native environments.",

We harness the distinct reactivity of sulfenylnitrenes, which insert a single nitrogen atom to transform readily available pyrroles, indoles, and imidazoles into synthetically challenging pyrimidines, quinazolines, and triazines, respectively. Our additive-free method for skeletal editing employs easily accessible, benchtop-stable sulfenylnitrene precursors over a broad temperature range (\u221230 to 150\u00b0C). This approach is compatible with diverse functional groups, including oxidation-sensitive functionalities such as phenols and thioethers, and has been applied to various natural products, amino acids, and pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, we have conducted mechanistic studies and explored regioselectivity outcomes through density functional theory calculations.",

    "abstract": "The role of glioma-associated myeloid cells in tumor growth and immune evasion remains poorly understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of immune and tumor cells from 33 gliomas, identifying two distinct myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations in isocitrate dehydrogenase\u2013wild-type (IDT-WT) glioblastoma: an early progenitor MDSC (E-MDSC) population with up-regulation of metabolic and hypoxia pathways and a monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) population. Spatial transcriptomics demonstrated that E-MDSCs geographically colocalize with metabolic stem-like tumor cells in the pseudopalisading region. Ligand-receptor analysis revealed cross-talk between these cells, where glioma stem-like cells produce chemokines attracting E-MDSCs, which in turn produce growth factors for the tumor cells. This interaction is absent in IDH-mutant gliomas, associated with hypermethylation and repressed gene expression of MDSC-attracting chemokines. Our study elucidates specific MDSCs that may facilitate glioblastoma progression and mediate tumor immunosuppression.",

However, nonalloyed \u03b1-FAPbI 3 is metastable with respect to the photoinactive \u03b4-phase. We have developed a kinetic modulation strategy to fabricate high-quality and stable nonalloyed \u03b1-FAPbI 3 films, assisted by cogenetic volatile iodine intercalation and decalation. The intercalation of iodine facilitated the formation of corner-sharing Pb-I framework building blocks and reduced the kinetic barrier for \u03b1-FAPbI 3 formation, whereas the iodine decalation improved the final perovskite film quality in terms of composition purity and overall homogeneity. Solar cells based on this nonalloyed \u03b1-FAPbI 3 (free of other extrinsic composition ions) achieved a power conversion efficiency of >24%. The devices also exhibited excellent durability, retaining 99% of their original power conversion efficiency after operating for more than 1100 hours at 85\u00b0 \u00b1 5\u00b0C under illumination.",

However, ultrastrong alloys inevitably show decreased strain-hardening capacity, limiting their uniform elongation. We present a supranano (<10 nanometers) and short-range ordering design for grain interiors and grain boundary regions, respectively, in fine-grained alloys based on vanadium, cobalt, and nickel, with additions of tungsten, copper, aluminum, and boron. The pronounced grain boundary\u2013related strengthening and ductilization mechanism is realized through segregation of the short-range ordering near the grain boundary. Furthermore, the supranano ordering with a larger size has an enhanced pinning effect for dislocations and stacking faults, multiplied and accumulated in grain interiors during plastic deformation. These mechanisms promote continuously increased flow stress until fracture of the alloy at 10% strain with 2.6-gigapascal tensile stress.",

In this work, we report an HLB resistance regulatory circuit in Citrus composed of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, PUB21, and its substrate, the MYC2 transcription factor, which regulates jasmonate-mediated defense responses. A helitron insertion in the PUB21 promoter introduced multiple MYC2-binding cis-elements to create a regulatory circuit linking the PUB21 activity with MYC2 degradation. Ectopic expression of a natural dominant-negative PUB21 paralog discovered in distant Citrus relatives stabilized MYC2 and conferred resistance to HLB. Antiproteolysis peptides (APPs), identified by artificial intelligence, stabilized MYC2 by binding and inhibiting PUB21 activity. A 14\u2013amino acid peptide, APP3-14, molecularly controlled HLB in greenhouse and field trials.

    "abstract": "Solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSBs) are promising for electric vehicles because of their potential to provide high energy density and enhanced safety. However, these batteries face short-circuit challenges caused by uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth during cycling. Using operando scanning electron microscopy and phase-field simulations, we determined that failure of SSBs is closely linked to the fatigue of the lithium metal anode, which markedly contributes to interface degradation and dendrite growth in SSBs. This fatigue follows the Coffin-Manson equation in mechanics, indicating that it is an innate characteristic. Clarifying the essential role of fatigue provides a physical basis for understanding failures of SSBs and paves the way to extending their lifespan.",

However, there are many potential starting points for enzyme optimization that remain unexplored. We generated a landscape of 170 lineages of 1894 polyethylene terephthalate depolymerase (PETase) candidates and performed profiling using sampling approaches with features associated with PET-degrading capabilities. We identified three promising yet unexplored PETase lineages and two potent PETases, Mipa-P and Kubu-P. An engineered variant of Kubu-P outperformed benchmarks in terms of PET depolymerization in harsh environments, such as those with high substrate load and ethylene glycol as the solvent.",

The total storage potential is far more sensitive to the scale of materials used than the quantity of carbon stored per unit mass of materials.

However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.",

    "abstract": "Whether a gut-joint axis exists to regulate osteoarthritis is unknown. In two independent cohorts, we identified altered microbial bile acid metabolism with reduced glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) in osteoarthritis. Suppressing farnesoid X receptor (FXR)\u2014the receptor of GUDCA\u2014alleviated osteoarthritis through intestine-secreted glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in mice. GLP-1 receptor blockade attenuated these effects, whereas GLP-1 receptor activation mitigated osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis patients exhibited a lower relative abundance of Clostridium bolteae , which promoted the formation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a precursor of GUDCA. Treatment with C. bolteae and Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved UDCA alleviated osteoarthritis through the gut FXR\u2013joint GLP-1 axis in mice. UDCA use was associated with lower risk of osteoarthritis-related joint replacement in humans. These findings suggest that orchestrating the gut microbiota\u2013GUDCA\u2013intestinal FXR\u2013GLP-1\u2013joint pathway offers a potential strategy for osteoarthritis treatment.",

We demonstrate a new thermal catalytic route for the partial reforming of ethanol into hydrogen and acetic acid with near-zero carbon dioxide emissions. This reaction is enabled by a catalyst containing a high density of atomic Pt 1 and Ir 1 species supported on a reactive alpha-molybdenum carbide substrate, achieving a hydrogen production rate of 331.3 millimoles of hydrogen per gram catalyst per hour and an acetic acid selectivity of 84.5% at 270\u00b0C, and is therefore more energy-efficient compared with standard reforming. Techno-economic analysis of partial ethanol reforming demonstrates the potential profitability for operation at an industrial scale, presenting the opportunity to produce hydrogen and acetic acid with a substantially reduced carbon dioxide footprint.",

The resulting TEC demonstrates a cooling temperature gradient of 50\u00b0C in air. Moreover, this scalable and cost-effective method circumvents energy-intensive and time-consuming steps, such as ingot preparation and subsequently machining processes, offering a transformative solution for thermoelectric device production and heralding a new era of efficient and sustainable thermoelectric technologies.",

    "abstract": "Architected materials derive their properties from the geometric arrangement of their internal structural elements. Their designs rely on continuous networks of members to control the global mechanical behavior of the bulk. In this study, we introduce a class of materials that consist of discrete concatenated rings or cage particles interlocked in three-dimensional networks, forming polycatenated architected materials (PAMs). We propose a general design framework that translates arbitrary crystalline networks into particle concatenations and geometries. In response to small external loads, PAMs behave like non-Newtonian fluids, showing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening responses, which can be controlled by their catenation topologies. At larger strains, PAMs behave like lattices and foams, with a nonlinear stress-strain relation. At microscale, we demonstrate that PAMs can change their shapes in response to applied electrostatic charges. The distinctive properties of PAMs pave the path for developing stimuli-responsive materials, energy-absorbing systems, and morphing architectures.",

Using high-speed x-ray imaging, we demonstrate that the flow vortex\u2013induced protrusion on the rear keyhole wall is crucial in initiating keyhole instability. Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect\u2013induced Lorentz force\u2019s direction. We show that at LPBF length scales, electromagnetic damping is weak, and for alloys with a large Seebeck coefficient, TEMHD becomes the dominant mechanism controlling flow behind the keyhole.",

Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) is a biorenewable and biodegradable alternative to conventional plastics, but microbial P3HB, which has a stereoperfect stereomicrostructure, exhibits no adhesion. In this study, by elucidating the fundamental relationship between chemocatalytically engineered P3HB stereomicrostructures and adhesion properties, we found that biodegradable syndio-rich P3HB exhibits high adhesion strength and outperforms common commercial adhesives, whereas syndiotactic, isotactic, or iso-rich P3HB shows no measurable adhesion. The syndio-rich stereomicrostructure brings about desired thermomechanical and viscoelastic properties of P3HB that enable strong adhesion to a range of substrates tested, including aluminum, steel, glass, and wood, and its performance is insensitive to molar mass and reprocessing or reuse.",

How these developmental decisions are made and what mechanisms exist to suppress differentiation toward alternative fates remains unclear. We employed in vivo CRISPR-Cas9\u2013based perturbation sequencing to assess the role of ~40 transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modulators in T cell fate decisions. Unexpectedly, we found that knockout of the TF Klf2 resulted in aberrant differentiation to exhausted-like CD8 T cells during acute infection. KLF2 was required to suppress the exhaustion-promoting TF TOX and to enable the TF TBET to drive effector differentiation. KLF2 was also necessary to maintain a polyfunctional tumor-specific progenitor state. Thus, KLF2 provides effector CD8 T cell lineage fidelity and suppresses the exhaustion program.",

We report that mice exhibit stereotypic behaviors toward unconscious or dead social partners, which escalate from sniffing and grooming to more forceful actions such as mouth or tongue biting and tongue pulling. The latter intense actions, more prominent in familiar pairs, begin after prolonged immobility and unresponsiveness and cease when the partner regains activity. Their consequences, including improved airway opening and clearance and accelerated recovery from unconsciousness, suggest rescue-like efforts. Oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus respond differentially to the presence of unconscious versus active partners, and their activation, along with oxytocin signaling, is required for the reviving-like actions. This tendency to assist unresponsive members may enhance group cohesion and survival of social species.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal accumulation and spread of pathological \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) fibrils are key events in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the uptake of \u03b1-syn fibrils remain unclear. In this work, we identified FAM171A2 as a PD risk gene that affects \u03b1-syn aggregation. Overexpressing FAM171A2 promotes \u03b1-syn fibril endocytosis and exacerbates the spread and neurotoxicity of \u03b1-syn pathology. Neuronal-specific knockdown of FAM171A2 expression shows protective effects. Mechanistically, the FAM171A2 extracellular domain 1 interacts with the \u03b1-syn C terminus through electrostatic forces, with >1000 times more selective for fibrils. Furthermore, we identified bemcentinib as an effective blocker of FAM171A2\u2013\u03b1-syn fibril interaction with an in vitro binding assay, in cellular models, and in mice. Our findings identified FAM171A2 as a potential receptor for the neuronal uptake of \u03b1-syn fibrils and, thus, as a therapeutic target against PD.",

    "abstract": "Numerous gram-negative bacterial pathogens employ the type III secretion system (T3SS), a multiprotein injectisome, to deliver virulence proteins into host cells and cause diseases. We uncover erucamide as a previously unknown phytoalexin of both dicots and monocots that blocks the T3SS function of multiple bacterial pathogens. Genetically impairing erucamide accumulation or exogenous application in Arabidopsis highlighted erucamide\u2019s role in antibacterial immunity. Erucamide binds Hypersensitive response and conserved C (HrcC), a key T3SS component, to block injectisome assembly. Analyses of erucamide analogs and HrcC mutants indicated that the erucamide-HrcC binding is required for inhibiting T3SS in vitro and antibacterial resistance in plants, suggesting an essential role of erucamide-HrcC binding in disease resistance. This work reveals a plant chemical defense that targets major virulence machinery in bacterial pathogens.",

Butterflies are the most surveyed insect taxa, yet analyses have been limited in geographic scale or rely on data from a single monitoring program. Using records of 12.6 million individual butterflies from >76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programs, we characterized overall and species-specific butterfly abundance trends across the contiguous United States. Between 2000 and 2020, total butterfly abundance fell by 22% across the 554 recorded species. Species-level declines were widespread, with 13 times as many species declining as increasing. The prevalence of declines throughout all regions in the United States highlights an urgent need to protect butterflies from further losses.",

Conformational ensembles built from 1231 structures of 17 serine proteases revealed atomic-level changes across their reaction states. By comparing the enzymatic and solution reaction, we identified molecular features that provide catalysis and quantified their energetic contributions to catalysis. Serine proteases precisely position their reactants in destabilized conformers, creating a downhill energetic gradient that selectively favors the motions required for reaction while limiting off-pathway conformational states. The same catalytic features have repeatedly evolved in proteases and additional enzymes across multiple distinct structural folds. Our ensemble-function analyses revealed previously unknown catalytic features, provided quantitative models based on simple physical and chemical principles, and identified motifs recurrent in nature that may inspire enzyme design.",

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) soil moisture (SM) product reveals a sharp depletion during the early 21st century. During the period 2000 to 2002, soil moisture declined by approximately 1614 gigatonnes, much larger than Greenland\u2019s ice loss of about 900 gigatonnes (2002\u20132006). From 2003 to 2016, SM depletion continued, with an additional 1009-gigatonne loss. This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise (~4.4 millimeters) and Earth\u2019s pole shift (~45 centimeters). Precipitation deficits and stable evapotranspiration likely caused this decline, and SM has not recovered as of 2021, with future recovery unlikely under present climate conditions.",

Patients with cachexia experience extreme fatigue, apathy, and clinical depression, yet the biological mechanisms underlying these behavioral symptoms and their relationship to the disease remain unclear. In a mouse cancer model, cachexia specifically induced increased effort-sensitivity, apathy-like symptoms through a cytokine-sensing brainstem-to-basal ganglia circuit. This neural circuit detects elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) at cachexia onset and translates inflammatory signals into decreased mesolimbic dopamine, thereby increasing effort sensitivity. We alleviated these apathy-like symptoms by targeting key circuit nodes: administering an anti\u2013IL-6 antibody treatment, ablating cytokine sensing in the brainstem, and optogenetically or pharmacologically boosting mesolimbic dopamine. Our findings uncovered a central neural circuit that senses systemic inflammation and orchestrates behavioral changes, providing mechanistic insights into the connection between chronic inflammation and depressive symptoms.",

About 6% (0.54 to 14.64%) of the modeled areas show significant increases in the number of days conducive to high-severity burning during 1981 to 2020, most of which were found during 2001 to 2020 and in the spring and autumn.

However, ICMS currently provides an imperfect sense of touch, limiting manual dexterity and tactile experience. Leveraging our understanding of how tactile features are encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we sought to inform individuals with paralysis about local geometry and apparent motion of objects on their skin. We simultaneously delivered ICMS through electrodes with spatially patterned projected fields (PFs), evoking sensations of edges. We then created complex PFs that encode arbitrary tactile shapes and skin indentation patterns. By delivering spatiotemporally patterned ICMS, we evoked sensation of motion across the skin, the speed and direction of which could be controlled. Thus, we improved individuals\u2019 tactile experience and use of brain-controlled bionic hands.",

However, it is difficult to generate uniform subnanometer pores over large areas on 2D materials. We report that the well-defined eight-membered ring (8-MR) pores, typically formed at the boundaries of two antiparallel grains of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), can serve as molecular sieves for efficient water-ion separation. The density of grain boundaries and, consequently, the number of 8-MR pores can be tuned by regulating the grain size. Optimized MoS 2 membranes outperformed the state-of-the-art membranes in forward osmosis tests by demonstrating both ultrahigh water/sodium chloride selectivity and exceptional water permeance. Creating precise pore structures on atomically thin films through grain boundary engineering presents a promising route for producing membranes suitable for various applications.",

Familiar molluscan groups\u2014gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods\u2014each represent a diverse radiation with myriad morphological, ecological, and behavioral adaptations. The phylum further encompasses many more unfamiliar experiments in animal body-plan evolution. In this work, we reconstructed the phylogeny for living Mollusca on the basis of metazoan BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) genes extracted from 77 (13 new) genomes, including multiple members of all eight classes with two high-quality genome assemblies for monoplacophorans. Our analyses confirm a phylogeny proposed from morphology and show widespread genomic variation. The flexibility of the molluscan genome likely explains both historic challenges with their genomes and their evolutionary success.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have transformed treatment of B cell malignancies. However, their broader application is limited by complex manufacturing processes and the necessity for lymphodepleting chemotherapy, restricting patient accessibility. We present an in vivo engineering strategy using targeted lipid nanoparticles (tLNPs) for messenger RNA delivery to specific T cell subsets. These tLNPs reprogrammed CD8 + T cells in both healthy donor and autoimmune patient samples, and in vivo dosing resulted in tumor control in humanized mice and B cell depletion in cynomolgus monkeys. In cynomolgus monkeys, the reconstituted B cells after depletion were predominantly na\u00efve, suggesting an immune system reset. By eliminating the requirements for complex ex vivo manufacturing, this tLNP platform holds the potential to make CAR T cell therapies more accessible and applicable across additional clinical indications.",

    "abstract": "Sociosexual preference is critical for reproduction and survival. However, neural mechanisms encoding social decisions on sex preference remain unclear. In this study, we show that both male and female mice exhibit female preference but shift to male preference when facing survival threats; their preference is mediated by the dimorphic changes in the excitability of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic (VTA DA ) neurons. In males, VTA DA projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate female preference, and those to the medial preoptic area mediate male preference. In females, firing-pattern (phasic-like versus tonic-like) alteration of the VTA DA -NAc projection determines sociosexual preferences. These findings define VTA DA neurons as a key node for social decision-making and reveal the sexually dimorphic DA circuit mechanisms underlying sociosexual preference.",

In this study, we demonstrate that proteins with shared functions share amino acid sequence codes that guide them to compartment destinations. We developed a protein language model, ProtGPS, that predicts with high performance the compartment localization of human proteins excluded from the training set. ProtGPS successfully guided generation of novel protein sequences that selectively assemble in the nucleolus. ProtGPS identified pathological mutations that change this code and lead to altered subcellular localization of proteins. Our results indicate that protein sequences contain not only a folding code but also a previously unrecognized code governing their distribution to diverse subcellular compartments.",

We report that lattice strain locks Rb ions into the \u03b1-phase of the lattice of a triple-halide WBG perovskite, preventing phase segregation into a nonperovskite Rb-cesium\u2013rich phase. This process cooperates with chloride accommodation and promotes halide homogenization across the entire film volume. The resulting 1.67\u2013electron volt WBG perovskite exhibits photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 14% under 1-sun-equivalent irradiation, corresponding to a quasi\u2013Fermi level splitting of ~1.34 electron volts. A WBG perovskite solar cell with an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.30 volts was prepared, corresponding to 93.5% of the radiative V OC limit and representing the lowest photovoltage loss relative to the theoretical limit observed in WBG perovskites.",

Here, we show that NE remodeling of synaptic function is completely independent from its binding on neuronal receptors. Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses. Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP)\u2013derived and A1 adenosine receptor\u2013mediated control of presynaptic efficacy. These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations.",

Here, we realize an axion insulator in a three-dimensional photonic crystal and probe its topological properties. Demonstrated features include half-quantized Chern numbers on each surface that resembles a fractional Chern insulator, unidirectional chiral hinge states forming topological transport in three dimensions, and arithmetic operations between fractional and integer Chern numbers. Our work experimentally establishes the axion insulator as a three-dimensional topological phase of matter and enables chiral states to form complex, unidirectional three-dimensional networks through braiding.",

In this work, we report a functional role for myostatin as an endocrine hormone that directly promotes pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and thereby ovarian function in mice. Previously, this FSH-stimulating role was attributed to other members of the transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2 family, the activins. Our results both challenge activin\u2019s eponymous role in FSH synthesis and establish an unexpected endocrine axis between skeletal muscle and the pituitary gland.

However, whether peripheral neuroimmune interactions orchestrate endocrine system functions remains unexplored. After fasting, mice lacking type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) displayed disrupted glucose homeostasis, impaired pancreatic glucagon secretion, and inefficient hepatic gluconeogenesis. Additionally, intestinal ILC2s were found in the pancreas, which was dependent on their expression of the adrenergic beta 2 receptor. Targeted activation of catecholaminergic intestinal neurons promoted the accumulation of ILC2s in the pancreas. Our work provides evidence that immune cells can be regulated by neuronal signals in response to fasting, activating an inter-organ communication route that promotes pancreatic endocrine function and regulation of blood glucose levels.",

This study identifies alkylation repair homolog protein 5 (ALKBH5), an RNA N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) demethylase, as a major regulator in metabolic disease. ALKBH5 is up-regulated in the liver during obesity and also phosphorylated by protein kinase A, causing its translocation to the cytosol. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Alkbh5 reduces glucose and lipids by inhibiting the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathways. Targeted knockdown of hepatic Alkbh5 reverses T2DM and MAFLD in diabetic mice, highlighting its therapeutic potential. This study unveils a regulatory mechanism wherein ALKBH5 orchestrates glucose and lipid homeostasis by integrating the GCGR and mTORC1 pathways, providing insight into the regulation of metabolic diseases.",

In this work, we describe the hijacking of plant phosphate sensing by a conserved family of Nudix hydrolase effectors from pathogenic Magnaporthe and Colletotrichum fungi. Structural and enzymatic analyses of the Nudix effector family demonstrate that they selectively hydrolyze PP-InsP. Gene deletion experiments of Nudix effectors in Magnaporthe oryzae , Colletotrichum higginsianum , and Colletotrichum graminicola indicate that PP-InsP hydrolysis substantially enhances disease symptoms in diverse pathosystems. Further, we show that this conserved effector family induces phosphate starvation signaling in plants. Our study elucidates a molecular mechanism, used by multiple phytopathogenic fungi, that manipulates the highly conserved plant phosphate sensing pathway to exacerbate disease.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the ubiquitin kinase PINK1 cause early-onset Parkinson\u2019s disease, but how PINK1 is stabilized at depolarized mitochondrial translocase complexes has remained poorly understood. We determined a 3.1-angstrom resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of dimeric human PINK1 stabilized at an endogenous array of mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) complexes. Symmetric arrangement of two TOM core complexes around a central VDAC2 dimer is facilitated by TOM5 and TOM20, both of which also bind PINK1 kinase C-lobes. PINK1 enters mitochondria through the proximal TOM40 barrel of the TOM core complex, guided by TOM7 and TOM22. Our structure explains how human PINK1 is stabilized at the TOM complex and regulated by oxidation, uncovers a previously unknown TOM-VDAC assembly, and reveals how a physiological substrate traverses TOM40 during translocation.",

    "abstract": "T cells have emerged as orchestrators of pain amplification, but the mechanism by which T cells control pain processing is unresolved. We found that regulatory T cells (T reg cells) could inhibit nociception through a mechanism that was not dependent on their ability to regulate immune activation and tissue repair. Site-specific depletion or expansion of meningeal T reg cells (mT reg cells) in mice led to female-specific and sex hormone\u2013dependent modulation of mechanical sensitivity. Specifically, mT reg cells produced the endogenous opioid enkephalin that exerted an antinociceptive action through the delta opioid receptor expressed by MrgprD + sensory neurons. Although enkephalin restrains nociceptive processing, it was dispensable for T reg cell\u2013mediated immunosuppression. Thus, our findings uncovered a sexually dimorphic immunological circuit that restrains nociception, establishing T reg cells as sentinels of pain homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Supported noble metal cluster catalysts are typically operated under severe conditions involving switching between reducing and oxidizing atmospheres, causing irreversible transformation of the catalyst structure and thereby leading to permanent deactivation. We discovered that various platinum (Pt) precursors spontaneously disperse in a germanium-MFI (Ge-MFI) zeolite, which opposes the Ostwald ripening phenomenon, producing self-regenerating Pt/Ge-MFI catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. These catalysts reversibly switch between Pt clusters and Pt single atoms in response to reducing reaction and oxidizing regeneration conditions. This environmental adaptability allows them to completely self-regenerate over 110 reaction and regeneration cycles in propane dehydrogenation, and they exhibited unprecedented sintering resistance when exposed to air at 800\u00b0C for 10 days. Such spontaneous metal dispersion in a Ge-MFI zeolite is a robust and versatile methodology for fabricating various rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and palladium cluster catalysts.",

    "abstract": "One approach for closed-loop plastics recycling relies on reverting polymers back into monomers because one can then make new plastics without loss of properties. This depolymerization requirement restricts the molecular design to making polymers with high mechanical performance. We report a three-dimensional (3D) printing chemistry through stepwise photopolymerization by forming dithioacetal bonds. The polymerized network can be transformed back into a photoreactive oligomer by dissociation of the dithioacetal bonds. This network-oligomer transformation is reversible, therefore allowing circular 3D printing using the same material. Our approach offers the flexibility of making modular adjustments in the design of the network backbone of a polymer. This allows access to fully recyclable elastomers, crystalline polymers, and rigid glassy polymers with high mechanical toughness, making them potentially suitable for diverse applications.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial damage is a hallmark of metabolic diseases, including diabetes, yet the consequences of compromised mitochondria in metabolic tissues are often unclear. In this work, we report that dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control engages a retrograde (mitonuclear) signaling program that impairs cellular identity and maturity in \u03b2 cells, hepatocytes, and brown adipocytes. Targeted deficiency throughout the mitochondrial quality control pathway, including genome integrity, dynamics, or turnover, impaired the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, activating the mitochondrial integrated stress response, eliciting chromatin remodeling, and promoting cellular immaturity rather than apoptosis to yield metabolic dysfunction. Pharmacologic blockade of the integrated stress response in vivo restored \u03b2 cell identity after the loss of mitochondrial quality control. Targeting mitochondrial retrograde signaling may therefore be promising in the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders.",

In this study, we conducted a multiancestry genome-wide association study in 2.2 million individuals and identified 1026 (97 previously unknown) independent loci. Ancestry-specific analysis indicated an attenuation of newly identified signals on common variants in European ancestry populations and the power of population diversity for further discoveries. We defined genotype effects on allele-specific gene expression and regulatory circuitries in more than 700 human kidneys and 237,000 cells. We found 1363 coding variants disrupting 782 genes, with 601 genes also targeted by regulatory variants and convergence in 161 genes. Integrating 32 types of genetic information, we present the \u201cKidney Disease Genetic Scorecard\u201d for prioritizing potentially causal genes, cell types, and druggable targets for kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is a hallmark of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. Insulin\u2019s actions go beyond metabolic cells and also involve blood vessels, where insulin increases capillary blood flow and delivery of insulin and nutrients. We show that adrenomedullin, whose plasma levels are increased in obese humans and mice, inhibited insulin signaling in human endothelial cells through protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B\u2013mediated dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. In obese mice lacking the endothelial adrenomedullin receptor, insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide\u2013synthase activation and skeletal muscle perfusion were increased. Treating mice with adrenomedullin mimicked the effect of obesity and induced endothelial and systemic insulin resistance. Endothelial loss or blockade of the adrenomedullin receptor improved obesity-induced insulin resistance. These findings identify a mechanism underlying obesity-induced systemic insulin resistance and suggest approaches to treat obesity-associated type 2 diabetes.",

The Chang\u2019e-6 mission retrieved samples from the South Pole\u2013Aitken basin (SPA) on the Moon\u2019s far side. We analyzed basalt fragments collected by Chang\u2019e-6 and found that their composition resembles that of low-titanium basalts previously sampled by the Apollo missions. Uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating indicated a basalt age of 2823.0 \u00b1 5.9 million years and a source 238 U/ 204 Pb ratio (\u03bc-value) of 480 \u00b1 56. This high \u03bc-value indicates that the source contained materials that formed during the late stages of lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization. The results are consistent with the LMO model, but the Chang\u2019e-6 basalt deviates from the trend in Apollo mission samples of younger basalts having higher \u03bc-values. We suggest that this indicates post-LMO modification of the mantle by the SPA impact.",

    "abstract": "RNA-guided systems provide remarkable versatility, enabling diverse biological functions. Through iterative structural and sequence homology-based mining starting with a guide RNA-interaction domain of Cas9, we identified a family of RNA-guided DNA-targeting proteins in phage and parasitic bacteria. Each system consists of a tandem interspaced guide RNA (TIGR) array and a TIGR-associated (Tas) protein containing a nucleolar protein (Nop) domain, sometimes fused to HNH (TasH)\u2013 or RuvC (TasR)\u2013nuclease domains. We show that TIGR arrays are processed into 36-nucleotide RNAs (tigRNAs) that direct sequence-specific DNA binding through a tandem-spacer targeting mechanism. TasR can be reprogrammed for precise DNA cleavage, including in human cells. The structure of TasR reveals striking similarities to box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins and IS110 RNA-guided transposases, providing insights into the evolution of diverse RNA-guided systems.",

    "abstract": "Ancient Mars had surface liquid water and a dense carbon dioxide (CO 2 )\u2013rich atmosphere. Such an atmosphere would interact with crustal rocks, potentially leaving a mineralogical record of its presence. We analyzed the composition of an 89-meter stratigraphic section of Gale crater, Mars, using data collected by the Curiosity rover. An iron carbonate mineral, siderite, occurs in abundances of 4.8 to 10.5 weight %, colocated with highly water-soluble salts. We infer that the siderite formed in water-limited conditions, driven by water-rock reactions and evaporation. Comparison with orbital data indicates that similar strata (deposited globally) sequestered the equivalent of 2.6 to 36 millibar of atmospheric CO 2 . The presence of iron oxyhydroxides in these deposits indicates that a partially closed carbon cycle on ancient Mars returned some previously sequestered CO 2 to the atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "Both neurons and glia communicate through diffusible neuromodulators; however, how neuron-glial interactions in such neuromodulatory networks influence circuit computation and behavior is unclear. During futility-induced behavioral transitions in the larval zebrafish, the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) drives fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity. We found that astroglial purinergic signaling implements the inhibitory arm of this motif. In larval zebrafish, NE triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), extracellular conversion of ATP into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors. Our results suggest a computational and behavioral role for an evolutionarily conserved astroglial purinergic signaling axis in NE-mediated behavioral and brain state transitions and position astroglia as important effectors in neuromodulatory signaling.",

This combination imbues the polymers with resistance to dilation induced by hydrocarbon immersion without the loss of solution-based membrane fabrication techniques. These materials exhibit good separation of liquid-phase alkane isomers at ambient temperatures. The integration of these polymeric membranes into fuel and chemical feedstock separation processes was investigated in a series of experiments. Technoeconomic analyses based on these experiments indicate that the best-performing membrane materials can substantially reduce the energy costs and associated carbon emissions of hydrocarbon separations (two to 10 times, depending on product specifications).",

Within polymers, these linkages will confer distinctive mechanical properties and other emergent behaviors, but polymerizations that form mechanical bonds efficiently and use simple monomeric building blocks are rare. In this work, we introduce a solid-state polymerization in which one monomer infiltrates crystals of another to form a macrocycle and mechanical bond at each repeat unit of a two-dimensional (2D) polymer. This mechanically interlocked 2D polymer is formed as a layered solid that is readily exfoliated in common organic solvents, enabling spectroscopic characterization and atomic-resolution imaging using advanced electron microscopy techniques. The 2D mechanically interlocked polymer is easily prepared on multigram scales, which, along with its solution processibility, enables the facile fabrication of composite fibers with Ultem that exhibit enhanced stiffness and strength.",

However, the mechanisms through which scratching exacerbates inflammation and whether scratching provides benefit to the host are largely unknown. We found that scratching was required for skin inflammation in mouse models dependent on Fc\u03b5RI-mediated mast cell activation. Scratching-induced inflammation required pain-sensing nociceptors, the neuropeptide substance P, and the mast cell receptor MrgprB2. Scratching also increased cutaneous inflammation and augmented host defense to superficial Staphylococcus aureus infection. Thus, through the activation of nociceptor-driven neuroinflammation, scratching both exacerbated allergic skin disease and provided protection from S. aureus , reconciling the seemingly paradoxical role of scratching as a pathological process and evolutionary adaptation.",

We describe a bacterial immune system comprising both a caspase-like protease and a TIR-domain protein. We found that the TIR protein, once it recognizes phage invasion, produces the previously unknown immune signaling molecule adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate-cyclo[N7:1\u2032\u2032]-ribose (N7-cADPR). This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease, which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation. Our study highlights the diversity of TIR-produced immune signaling molecules and demonstrates that cell death regulated by proteases of the caspase family is an ancient mechanism of innate immunity.",

How other animals react to unresponsive conspecifics\u2014and the neural mechanisms driving such behaviors\u2014remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that mice exhibit rescue-like social behaviors toward unresponsive conspecifics, characterized by intense physical contact and grooming directed at the recipient\u2019s facial and mouth areas, which expedite their recovery from unresponsiveness. We identified the medial amygdala (MeA) as a key region that encodes the unresponsive state of others and drives this head-directed physical contact. Notably, the behavioral responses toward unresponsive conspecifics differed from those directed at awake, stressed individuals, and these responses were differentially represented in the MeA. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying prosocial responses toward unresponsive individuals.",

Whereas cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. In this study, we reveal a bacterial antiphage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine triphosphates (dITPs) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates a downstream effector to mediate depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form), resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular deoxyadenosine monophosphate, the precursor of dITP messengers. Our findings uncover a nucleobase modification\u2013based antiphage signaling pathway, establishing noncanonical nucleotides as a new type of immune messengers in bacteria.",

Promoters such as cesium, rhenium, and molybdenum each add a few percent of selectivity enhancements to achieve 90% overall, but their codependence on Cl makes optimizing and understanding their function complex. We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O 2 ) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O 2 on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity.",

We report a heterogeneous copper-catalyzed C=C double-bond cleavage, which enables the remodeling of complex molecules by converting the carbons on either side of the C=C double bond to carbonyl and cyano groups, respectively.

Analyzing global observational datasets of changes in terrestrial carbon pools, we found that \u224835 \u00b1 14 gigatons of carbon (GtC) have been sequestered on land between 1992 and 2019, whereas live biomass changed by \u22481 \u00b1 7 GtC. Global vegetation models instead imply that sequestration has been mostly in live biomass. We identify key processes not included in most models that can explain this discrepancy. Most terrestrial carbon gains are sequestered as nonliving matter and thus are more persistent than previously appreciated, with a substantial fraction linked to human activities such as river damming, wood harvest, and garbage disposal in landfills.",

    "abstract": "We used Hi-C, imaging, proteomics, and polymer modeling to define rules of engagement for SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) complexes as cells refold interphase chromatin into rod-shaped mitotic chromosomes. First, condensin disassembles interphase chromatin loop organization by evicting or displacing extrusive cohesin. Second, condensin bypasses cohesive cohesins, thereby maintaining sister chromatid cohesion as sisters separate. Studies of mitotic chromosomes formed by cohesin, condensin II, and condensin I alone or in combination lead to refined models of mitotic chromosome conformation. In these models, loops are consecutive and not overlapping, implying that condensins stall upon encountering each other. The dynamics of Hi-C interactions and chromosome morphology reveal that during prophase, loops are extruded in vivo at \u223c1 to 3 kilobases per second by condensins as they form a disordered discontinuous helical scaffold within individual chromatids.",

Ion dynamics within the EDL define the limits for charging and discharging processes. Classical EDL models struggle at high electrolyte concentrations, and observing EDL dynamics has been challenging. In this study, an all-optical technique allowed real-time monitoring of EDL dynamics at arbitrary concentration by quasi-instantaneously changing the surface propensity of protons (H 3 O + ) adsorbed at the air-aqueous electrolyte solution interface and by subsequently tracking EDL relaxation with femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy. EDL reorganization occurred on picosecond timescales and was strongly concentration dependent. Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and analytical modeling showed that ion conduction primarily drove EDL dynamics. This research quantified EDL dynamics and identified its primary driver, providing insights for optimization of electrochemical applications.",

    "abstract": "A leading HIV vaccine strategy requires a priming immunogen to induce broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) precursors, followed by a series of heterologous boosters to elicit somatic hypermutation (SHM) and produce bnAbs. In two randomized, open-label phase 1 human clinical trials, IAVI G002 in the United States and IAVI G003 in Rwanda and South Africa (IAVI, International Aids Vaccine Initiative), we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-encoded nanoparticles as priming immunogens (both trials) and first-boosting immunogens (IAVI G002). The vaccines were generally safe and well tolerated, except that 18% of IAVI G002 participants experienced skin reactions. Priming induced bnAb precursors with substantial frequencies and SHM; heterologous boosting elicited increased SHM, affinity, and neutralization activity toward bnAb development; and elicited antibodies exhibited precise bnAb structural mimicry. The results establish clinical proof of concept that heterologous boosting can advance bnAb precursor maturation and demonstrate bnAb priming in Africa, where the HIV burden is highest.",

In this study, we generated 2723 high-coverage whole-genome sequences from the Brazilian population, including urban, rural, and riverine communities representing diverse ethnic backgrounds. We reveal the impressive genomic diversity of Brazilians, identifying >8 million previously unknown variants, including 36,637 predicted deleterious and potentially affecting population health. We found a positive correlation between these deleterious variants and ancestry. Brazilian genomes are a global haplotype mosaic shaped by nonrandom mating, with peak admixture in the 18th and 19th centuries. Within this diversity, ancestry-specific haplotypes exhibit an uneven spatiotemporal distribution. We also identified putatively selected genes in this diverse population, primarily linked to fertility, immune response, and metabolic traits.",

    "abstract": "Conventionally, the size, shape, and biomechanics of cartilages are determined by their voluminous extracellular matrix. By contrast, we found that multiple murine cartilages consist of lipid-filled cells called lipochondrocytes. Despite resembling adipocytes, lipochondrocytes were molecularly distinct and produced lipids exclusively through de novo lipogenesis. Consequently, lipochondrocytes grew uniform lipid droplets that resisted systemic lipid surges and did not enlarge upon obesity. Lipochondrocytes also lacked lipid mobilization factors, which enabled exceptional vacuole stability and protected cartilage from shrinking upon starvation. Lipid droplets modulated lipocartilage biomechanics by decreasing the tissue\u2019s stiffness, strength, and resilience. Lipochondrocytes were found in multiple mammals, including humans, but not in nonmammalian tetrapods. Thus, analogous to bubble wrap, superstable lipid vacuoles confer skeletal tissue with cartilage-like properties without \u201cpacking foam\u2013like\u201d extracellular matrix.",

However, quantum mechanics ultimately limits the metrological precision achievable with laser frequency combs. Quantum squeezing has led to substantial measurement improvements with continuous wave lasers, but experiments demonstrating metrological advantage with squeezed combs are less developed. Using the Kerr effect in nonlinear optical fiber, a 1-gigahertz frequency comb centered at 1560 nanometers is amplitude-squeezed by >3 decibels (dB) over a 2.5-terahertz bandwidth. Dual-comb interferometry yields mode-resolved spectroscopy of hydrogen sulfide gas with a signal-to-noise ratio nearly 3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit. The quantum noise reduction leads to a twofold quantum speedup in the determination of gas concentration, with implications for high-speed measurements of multiple species in dynamic chemical environments.",

Dysregulated lysosomal activity and cholesterol metabolism activate pathogenic inflammation, but their relevance to PAH is unclear. Nuclear receptor coactivator 7 ( NCOA7 ) deficiency in endothelium produced an oxysterol and bile acid signature through lysosomal dysregulation, promoting endothelial pathophenotypes. This oxysterol signature overlapped with a plasma metabolite signature associated with human PAH mortality. Mice deficient for endothelial Ncoa7 or exposed to an inflammatory bile acid developed worsened PAH. Genetic predisposition to NCOA7 deficiency was driven by single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11154337, which alters endothelial immunoactivation and is associated with human PAH mortality. An NCOA7-activating agent reversed endothelial immunoactivation and rodent PAH. Thus, we established a genetic and metabolic paradigm that links lysosomal biology and oxysterol processes to endothelial inflammation and PAH.",

We show that differences in circulating androgens between the three male mating morphs in ruff sandpipers are linked to 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (HSD17B2), encoded by a gene within the supergene that determines the morphs. Low-testosterone males had higher HSD17B2 expression in blood than high-testosterone males, as well as in brain areas related to social behaviors and testosterone production. Derived HSD17B2 isozymes, which are absent in high-testosterone males but preferentially expressed in low-testosterone males, converted testosterone to androstenedione faster than the ancestral isozyme. Thus, a combination of evolutionary changes in regulation, sequence, and structure of a single gene introduces endocrine variation underlying reproductive phenotypes.",

However, inducing chirality in a nonchiral material is challenging because this requires that all mirrors and all roto-inversions be simultaneously broken. Here, we show that chirality of either handedness can be induced in the nonchiral piezoelectric material boron phosphate (BPO 4 ) by irradiation with terahertz pulses. Resonant excitation of either one of two orthogonal, degenerate vibrational modes determines the sign of the induced chiral order parameter. The optical activity of the photo-induced phases is comparable to the static value of prototypical chiral \u03b1-quartz. Our findings offer new prospects for the control of out-of-equilibrium quantum phenomena in complex materials.",

    "abstract": "Social animals live in groups and interact volitionally in complex ways. However, little is known about neural responses under such natural conditions. Here, we investigated hippocampal CA1 neurons in a mixed-sex group of five to 10 freely behaving wild Egyptian fruit bats that lived continuously in a laboratory-based cave and formed a stable social network. In-flight, most hippocampal place cells were socially modulated and represented the identity and sex of conspecifics. Upon social interactions, neurons represented specific interaction types. During active observation, neurons encoded the bat\u2019s own position and head direction, together with the position, direction, and identity of multiple conspecifics. Identity-coding neurons encoded the same bat across contexts. The strength of identity coding was modulated by sex, hierarchy, and social affiliation. Thus, hippocampal neurons form a multidimensional sociospatial representation of the natural world.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the capacity of forests to adapt to climate change is of pivotal importance for conservation science, yet this is still widely unknown. This knowledge gap is particularly acute in high-biodiversity tropical forests. Here, we examined how tropical forests of the Americas have shifted community trait composition in recent decades as a response to changes in climate. Based on historical trait-climate relationships, we found that, overall, the studied functional traits show shifts of less than 8% of what would be expected given the observed changes in climate. However, the recruit assemblage shows shifts of 21% relative to climate change expectation. The most diverse forests on Earth are changing in functional trait composition but at a rate that is fundamentally insufficient to track climate change.",

Although genomic evidence suggests their widespread distribution throughout eastern Asia and possibly Oceania, so far only a few fossils from the Altai and Tibet are confidently identified molecularly as Denisovan. We identified a hominin mandible (Penghu 1) from Taiwan (10,000 to 70,000 years ago or 130,000 to 190,000 years ago) as belonging to a male Denisovan by applying ancient protein analysis. We retrieved 4241 amino acid residues and identified two Denisovan-specific variants. The increased fossil sample of Denisovans demonstrates their wider distribution, including warm and humid regions, as well as their shared distinct robust dentognathic traits that markedly contrast with their sister group, Neanderthals.",

    "abstract": "Starting at middle age, adults often suffer from visceral adiposity and associated adverse metabolic disorders. Lineage tracing in mice revealed that adipose progenitor cells (APCs) in visceral fat undergo extensive adipogenesis during middle age. Thus, despite the low turnover rate of adipocytes in young adults, adipogenesis is unlocked during middle age. Transplantations quantitatively showed that APCs in middle-aged mice exhibited high adipogenic capacity cell-autonomously. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified a distinct APC population, the committed preadipocyte, age-enriched (CP-A), emerging at this age. CP-As demonstrated elevated proliferation and adipogenesis activity. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations indicated that leukemia inhibitory factor receptor signaling was indispensable for CP-A adipogenesis and visceral fat expansion. These findings uncover a fundamental mechanism of age-dependent adipose remodeling, offering critical insights into age-related metabolic diseases.",

Gas vesicle\u2013based ultrasound imaging provides real-time monitoring and allows for customized pattern creation in live animals. We validated DISP by successfully printing near diseased areas in the mouse bladder and deep within rabbit leg muscles in vivo, demonstrating its potential for localized drug delivery and tissue replacement. DISP\u2019s ability to print conductive, drug-loaded, cell-laden, and bioadhesive biomaterials demonstrates its versatility for diverse biomedical applications.",

Computational mining approaches using structure- and surface-based matchmaking algorithms predict more than 1600 CRBN-compatible G-loop proteins across the human proteome, including the newly discovered helical G-loop motif, and identify the noncanonical neosubstrate binding mode of VAV1 that engages CRBN through a molecular surface mimicry mechanism. This work broadens the CRBN target space, redefines rules for neosubstrate recognition, and establishes a platform for the elimination of challenging drug targets by repurposing CRL4 CRBN through next-generation molecular glue degraders.",

However, the idea that mutation can become biased toward adaptive outcomes remains controversial. In this work, we report the evolution of enhanced evolvability through localized hypermutation in experimental populations of bacteria. The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change. Lineages with localized hypermutability were more likely to acquire additional adaptive mutations, revealing an unanticipated benefit.",

    "abstract": "Materials functionalities may be associated with atomic-level structural dynamics occurring on the millisecond timescale. However, the capability of electron microscopy to image structures with high spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution is often limited by poor signal-to-noise ratios. With an unsupervised deep denoising framework, we observed metal nanoparticle surfaces (platinum nanoparticles on cerium oxide) in a gas environment with time resolutions down to 10 milliseconds at a moderate electron dose. On this timescale, many nanoparticle surfaces continuously transition between ordered and disordered configurations. Stress fields can penetrate below the surface, leading to defect formation and destabilization, thus making the nanoparticle fluxional. Combining this unsupervised denoiser with in situ electron microscopy greatly improves spatiotemporal characterization, opening a new window for the exploration of atomic-level structural dynamics in materials.",

In this study, we present ribosome expansion microscopy (RiboExM) to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique (ALIBi) to probe their composition. We generated a super-resolution ribosomal map, revealing subcellular translational hotspots and enrichment of 60 S subunits near polysomes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that Lsg1 tethers 60 S to the ER and regulates translation of select proteins. Additionally, we discovered ribosome heterogeneity at mitochondria guiding translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Lastly, we visualized ribosomes in neurons, revealing a dynamic switch between monosomes and polysomes in neuronal translation. Together, these approaches enable exploration of ribosomal localization and composition at unprecedented resolution.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of nitrogen-containing molecules through carbon\u2013nitrogen (C\u2013N) bond formation is critical for the discovery and preparation of medicines, agrochemicals, and materials. Here, we report the direct insertion of a nitrogen atom into unactivated carbon-carbon double bonds to access aza-allenium intermediates, which can be converted either into nitriles or amidine products, depending on the initial alkene substitution pattern. This operationally simple and highly functionally compatible reaction works on a wide range of unactivated alkenes. PIFA, a commercially available and inexpensive hypervalent iodine reagent, is key to this reactivity. Our mechanistic proposal is supported by chemical trapping experiments, which concomitantly demonstrate the utility of our method to access valuable N -heterocycles. Additionally, our method can be used as a general strategy for synthesizing amides and amines, as well as 15 N-labeled molecules.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomes are vital but often overlooked metabolic organelles. We found that excessive interferon signaling remodeled macrophage peroxisomes. This loss of peroxisomes impaired inflammation resolution and lung repair during severe respiratory viral infections. Peroxisomes were found to modulate lipid metabolism and mitochondrial health in a macrophage type-specific manner and enhanced alveolar macrophage-mediated tissue repair and alveolar regeneration after viral infection. Peroxisomes also prevented excessive macrophage inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 release, limiting accumulation of KRT8 high dysplastic epithelial progenitors following viral injury. Pharmacologically enhancing peroxisome biogenesis mitigated both acute symptoms and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in animal models. Thus, macrophage peroxisome dysfunction contributes to chronic lung pathology and fibrosis after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.",

Using three-dimensional electron microscopy, we performed nanoscale reconstructions of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway after chemogenetic labeling of cellular ensembles recruited during associative learning. Neurons with a remote history of activity coinciding with memory acquisition showed no strong preference for wiring with each other. Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes. Our findings elucidate the physical hallmarks of long-term memory and offer a structural basis for the cellular flexibility of information coding.",

It often causes premature failure of structural materials, and enhancing ratcheting resistance is a challenge in materials engineering. We demonstrate superior ratcheting resistance in high-strength austenitic stainless steel with a gradient hierarchy of dislocation cells. The ratcheting rate is two to four orders of magnitude lower than for coarse-grained counterparts. Its resistance results from sustained microstructural refinement through deformation-induced coherent martensitic transformations to hexagonal close-packed nanolayers within stable dislocation cells. The progressively refined microstructure mitigates cyclic softening and suppresses strain localization during stress cycling, thus reducing ratcheting strain. The gradient dislocation architecture represents a promising design for high-strength, ratcheting-resistant materials.",

Using phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), we generated CAST variants with >200-fold average improved integration activity. The evolved CAST system (evoCAST) achieves ~10 to 30% integration efficiencies of kilobase-size DNA cargoes in human cells across 14 tested genomic target sites, including safe harbor loci, sites used for immunotherapy, and genes implicated in loss-of-function diseases, with undetected indels and low levels of off-target integration.

We addressed this issue by isolating defective octahedra at the perovskite surface using a vapor-deposited polydentate ligand. Surface octahedra isolation suppresses ion migration into the charge transport layer and reduces surface ionic defects, modulating the kinetics of ion migration during light-dark cycles. Our 785-square-centimeter industrial-scale perovskite solar modules achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.6%. Our modules demonstrated enhanced diurnal stability, retaining more than 97% of their initial PCE even after 101 light-dark cycles at 50\u00b0C. Our perovskite modules maintained stable power output during 45 days of outdoor operation under severe summer conditions, exhibiting stability comparable with that of the reference silicon cell.",

Field tests in tropical Singapore demonstrated superior cooling performance compared with commercial white paints.

In this study, we demonstrate that micropatterned human pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived gastruloids enable in vitro modeling of the earliest stages of vascularization. We identify a combination of vascular-inducing factors that give rise to cardiac vascularized organoids with a spatially organized and branched vascular network. To show the broader utility of our vascularization strategy, we use the same vascular-inducing factors to produce hepatic vascularized organoids.

Here, we find an unusual reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in niobium phosphide (NbP) semimetal deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400\u00b0C. In films thinner than 5 nanometers, the room temperature resistivity (~34 microhm centimeters for 1.5-nanometer-thick NbP) is up to six times lower than the resistivity of our bulk NbP films, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness (typically about 100 microhm centimeters). The NbP films are not crystalline but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower effective resistivity is caused by conduction through surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics beyond the limitations of conventional metals.",

To address this gap, we applied CRISPR prime editing to insert recombination handles into repetitive sequences, up to 1697 per cell line, which enables generating large-scale deletions, inversions, translocations, and circular DNA. Recombinase induction produced more than 100 stochastic megabase-sized rearrangements in each cell. We tracked these rearrangements over time to measure selection pressures, finding a preference for shorter variants that avoided essential genes. We characterized 29 clones with multiple rearrangements, finding an impact of deletions on expression of genes in the variant but not on nearby genes. This genome-scrambling strategy enables large deletions, sequence relocations, and the insertion of regulatory elements to explore genome dispensability and organization.",

Spatial differences in soil moisture are perceived by root tips, leading to the patterning of new root branches toward available water in a process called hydropatterning. Little is known about hydropatterning behavior and its genetic basis in crop plants. Here, we developed an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and revealed substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection. Genetic analysis of hydropatterning confirmed the regulatory role of auxin and revealed that the gaseous hormone ethylene locally inhibits root branching from air-exposed tissues. Our results demonstrate how distinct signaling pathways translate spatial patterns of water availability to developmental programs that determine root architecture.",

We demonstrate global RNAPII elevations in mouse gliomas and assorted human tumors in small clinical samples and discover regional elevations corresponding to de novo HER2 amplifications punctuated by likely selective sweeps. RNAPII occupancy at S-phase-dependent histone genes correlated with WHO grade in meningiomas, accurately predicted rapid recurrence, and corresponded to whole-arm chromosome losses. Elevated RNAPII at histone genes in meningiomas and diverse breast cancers is consistent with histone production being rate-limiting for S-phase progression and histone gene hypertranscription driving overproliferation and aneuploidy in cancer, with general implications for precision oncology.",

    "abstract": "Limited color channels in fluorescence microscopy have long constrained spatial analysis in biological specimens. We introduce cycle hybridization chain reaction (cycleHCR), a method that integrates multicycle DNA barcoding with HCR to overcome this limitation. cycleHCR enables highly multiplexed imaging of RNA and proteins using a unified barcode system. Whole-embryo transcriptomics imaging achieved precise three-dimensional gene expression and cell fate mapping across a specimen depth of ~310 \u03bcm. When combined with expansion microscopy, cycleHCR revealed an intricate network of 10 subcellular structures in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In mouse hippocampal slices, multiplex RNA and protein imaging uncovered complex gene expression gradients and cell-type\u2013specific nuclear structural variations. cycleHCR provides a quantitative framework for elucidating spatial regulation in deep tissue contexts for research and has potential diagnostic applications.",

We report the observation of the piezoelectric (PE) effect in half-Heusler (HH) narrow-bandgap semiconductors TiNiSn, ZrNiSn, and TiCoSb. These materials exhibit shear PE strain coefficients that reach ~38 and 33 picocoulombs per newton in ZrNiSn and TiCoSb, respectively, which are high values for noncentrosymmetric nonpolar materials. We demonstrated a TiCoSb-based PE sensor with a large voltage response and capable of charging a capacitor. The PE effect in HHs remains thermally stable up to 1173 kelvin, underscoring their potential for high-temperature applications. Our observations suggest that these HH narrow-bandgap semiconductors may find promising applications for advanced multifunctional technologies.",

    "abstract": "Tandem kinase proteins underlie the innate immune systems of cereal plants, but how they initiate plant immune responses remains unclear. This report identifies wheat protein wheat tandem NBD 1 (WTN1), a noncanonical nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor featuring tandem nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, plant R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC) domains, required for WTK3-mediated disease resistance. Both WTK3 and its allelic variant Rwt4\u2014known for conferring resistance to wheat powdery mildew and blast, respectively\u2014are capable of recognizing the blast effector PWT4. They activate WTN1 to form calcium-permeable channels, akin to ZAR1 and Sr35. Thus, tandem kinase proteins and their associated NLRs operate as \u201csensor-executor\u201d pairs against fungal pathogens. Additionally, evolutionary analyses reveal a coevolutionary trajectory of the tandem kinase-NLR module, highlighting their cooperative role in triggering plant immunity.",

We discovered that hedonic eating is controlled by a neural pathway from the peri\u2013locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using photometry-calibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (VTA DA ) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally regulate hedonic food consumption. VTA DA neuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist used as an antiobesity drug. Mice recovered palatable food appetite and VTA DA neuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by consumption-triggered VTA DA neuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTA DA neurons, which sustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide.",

Using laboratory- and field-based experiments across multiple years in Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ; n = 730), we show that the globally detected anxiolytic pollutant clobazam accumulates in the brain of exposed fish and influences river-to-sea migration success. Clobazam exposure increased the speed with which fish passed through two hydropower dams along their migration route, resulting in more clobazam-exposed fish reaching the sea compared with controls. We argue that such effects may arise from altered shoaling behavior in fish exposed to clobazam. Drug-induced behavioral changes are expected to have wide-ranging consequences for the ecology and evolution of wild populations.",

Nucleolin, a major MycG4-binding protein, exhibits greater affinity for MycG4 than for nucleolin recognition element (NRE) RNA. Nucleolin\u2019s four RNA binding domains (RBDs) are essential for high-affinity MycG4 binding. We present the 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of the nucleolin-MycG4 complex, revealing a folded parallel three-tetrad G-quadruplex with two coordinating potassium ions (K + ), interacting with RBD1, RBD2, and Linker12 through its 6\u2013nucleotide (nt) central loop and 5\u2032 flanking region. RBD3 and RBD4 bind MycG4\u2019s 1-nt loops as demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Cleavage under targets and tagmentation sequencing confirmed nucleolin\u2019s binding to MycG4 in cells. Our results revealed a G4 conformation-based recognition by a regulating protein through multivalent interactions, suggesting that G4s are nucleolin\u2019s primary cellular substrates, indicating G4 epigenetic transcriptional regulation and helping G4-targeted drug discovery.",

In this study, we synthesized an ionic salt from C 60 , 4-(1\u2032,5\u2032-dihydro-1\u2032-methyl-2\u2032 H -[5,6] fullereno-C 60 - I h -[1,9-c]pyrrol-2\u2032-yl) phenylmethanaminium chloride (CPMAC), and used it as the electron shuttle in inverted PSCs. The CH 2 -NH 3 + head group in the CPMA cation improved the ETL interface, and the ionic nature enhanced the packing, leading to a ~threefold increase in the interfacial toughness compared with that of C 60 . Using CPMAC, we obtained ~26% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with ~2% degradation after 2100 hours of 1-sun operation at 65\u00b0C. For minimodules (four subcells, 6 square centimeters), we achieved a PCE of ~23% with <9% degradation after 2200 hours of operation at 55\u00b0C.",

However, the rules governing which synapses will undergo different forms of plasticity in vivo during learning and whether these rules are uniform within individual neurons remain unclear. Using in vivo longitudinal imaging with single-synapse resolution in the mouse motor cortex during motor learning, we found that apical and basal dendrites of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons showed distinct activity-dependent synaptic plasticity rules. The strengthening of apical and of basal synapses is predicted by local coactivity with nearby synapses and activity coincident with postsynaptic action potentials, respectively. Blocking postsynaptic spiking diminished basal synaptic potentiation without affecting apical plasticity. Thus, individual neurons use multiple activity-dependent plasticity rules in a compartment-specific manner in vivo during learning.",

We solve four structures that validate the designed conformations, demonstrate modulation of the conformational landscape by orthosteric ligands and allosteric mutations, and show that physics-based simulations are in agreement with deep-learning predictions and experimental data. Our approach demonstrates that new modes of motion can now be realized through de novo design and provides a framework for constructing biology-inspired, tunable, and controllable protein signaling behavior de novo.",

    "abstract": "Barocaloric (BC) materials offer the potential for highly energy-efficient refrigeration by generating heat absorption through the effect of pressure on a solid-solid phase transition. However, very few of the known materials have the required phase transition in the temperature regions necessary for domestic refrigeration or air conditioning. We introduce organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) as a new family of BC materials. OIPCs display subambient transition temperatures, so-called \u201ccolossal\u201d entropy changes (92 to 240 joules per kilogram per kelvin), and a high sensitivity to pressure, up to 23.7 kelvin per kilobar. The BC responses achieved with these prototype OIPC-BCs are tunable through structural modification of the ions; this wide matrix of possible combinations of structure and function indicates the scope of OIPCs as a new class of material for efficient and sustainable cooling technologies.",

    "abstract": "The most advanced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines against malaria target the central repeat region or closely related sequences within the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). Here, using an antigen-agnostic strategy to investigate human antibody responses to whole sporozoites, we identified a class of mAbs that target a cryptic PfCSP epitope that is only exposed after cleavage and subsequent pyroglutamylation (pGlu) of the newly formed N terminus. This pGlu-CSP epitope is not targeted by current anti-PfCSP mAbs and is not included in the licensed malaria vaccines. MAD21-101, the most potent mAb in this class, confers sterile protection against Pf infection in a human liver\u2013chimeric mouse model. These findings reveal a site of vulnerability on the sporozoite surface that can be targeted by next-generation antimalarial interventions.",

Lattice light-sheet (LLS) microscopy offers fast volumetric imaging but suffers from limited spatial resolution. DNA-based point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) achieves molecular resolution but is restricted to two-dimensional imaging owing to long acquisition times. We have developed two-dye imager (TDI) probes that enable ~15-fold faster imaging. Combining TDI-DNA-PAINT and LLS microscopy on immunological B cells revealed the oligomeric states and interaction of endogenous CD20 with the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab. Our results demonstrate that CD20 is abundantly expressed on microvilli that bind mAbs, which leads to an antibody concentration\u2013dependent B cell polarization and stabilization of microvilli protrusions. These findings could aid rational design of improved immunotherapies targeting tumor-associated antigens.",

    "abstract": "How populations adapt to their environment is a fundamental question in biology. Yet, we know surprisingly little about this process, especially for endangered species, such as nonhuman great apes. Chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, are particularly notable because they inhabit diverse habitats, from rainforest to woodland-savannah. Whether genetic adaptation facilitates such habitat diversity remains unknown, despite it having wide implications for evolutionary biology and conservation. By using newly sequenced exomes from 828 wild chimpanzees (388 postfiltering), we found evidence of fine-scale genetic adaptation to habitat, with signatures of positive selection in forest chimpanzees in the same genes underlying adaptation to malaria in humans. This work demonstrates the power of noninvasive samples to reveal genetic adaptations in endangered populations and highlights the importance of adaptive genetic diversity for chimpanzees.",

Canonical SLs act as signals to microbes and plants, whereas noncanonical SLs are primarily plant hormones. The cytochrome P450 CYP722C catalyzes a critical step, converting CLA to canonical SLs in most angiosperms. Using synthetic biology, we investigated the function of CYP722A , an evolutionary predecessor of CYP722C . CYP722A converts CLA into 16-hydroxy-CLA (16-OH-CLA), a noncanonical SL detected exclusively in the shoots of various flowering plants. 16-OH-CLA application restores control of shoot branching to SL-deficient mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana and is perceived by the SL signaling pathway. We hypothesize that biosynthesis of 16-OH-CLA by CYP722A was a metabolic stepping stone in the evolution of canonical SLs that mediate rhizospheric signaling in many flowering plants.",

However, the dioecious plant Silene latifolia has a giant ~550-megabase Y chromosome, which has remained unsequenced so far. We used a long- and short-read hybrid approach to obtain a high-quality male genome. Comparative analysis of the sex chromosomes with their homologs in outgroups showed that the Y is highly rearranged and degenerated. Recombination suppression between X and Y extended in several steps and triggered a massive accumulation of repeats on the Y as well as in the nonrecombining pericentromeric region of the X, leading to giant sex chromosomes. Using sex phenotype mutants, we identified candidate sex-determining genes on the Y in locations consistent with their favoring recombination suppression events 11 and 5 million years ago.",

    "abstract": "High sugar\u2013containing foods are readily consumed, even after meals and beyond fullness sensation (e.g., as desserts). Although reward-driven processing of palatable foods can promote overeating, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the selective appetite for sugar in states of satiety remain unclear. Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are principal regulators of satiety because they decrease food intake through excitatory melanocortin neuropeptides. We discovered that POMC neurons not only promote satiety in fed conditions but concomitantly switch on sugar appetite, which drives overconsumption. POMC neuron projections to the paraventricular thalamus selectively inhibited postsynaptic neurons through mu-opioid receptor signaling. This opioid circuit was strongly activated during sugar consumption, which was most notable in satiety states. Correspondingly, inhibiting its activity diminished high-sugar diet intake in sated mice.",

We report that nonconvex, dumbbell-shaped nanocrystals (nanodumbbells) exhibit globally interlocking self-assembly behaviors governed by curvature-guided depletion interactions. By tailoring the local curvature of nanodumbbells, we can precisely and flexibly adjust particle bonding directionality, a level of control rarely achievable with conventional convex building blocks. These nanodumbbells can undergo long-range ordered assembly into various intricate two-dimensional superlattices, including the chiral Kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Kagome lattice is a thermodynamically stable phase, with depletion interactions playing a crucial role in stabilizing these non\u2013close-packed structures. The emergence of Kagome lattices and other unusual structures highlights the vast potential of nonconvex nanocrystals for creating sophisticated architectures.",

We circumvent this problem by focusing on the morphology of deglaciation and inception, which we show depends strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity. We demonstrate that although both parameters are important, precession has more influence on deglacial onset, whereas obliquity is more important for the attainment of peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. We find that the set of precession peaks (minima) responsible for terminations since 0.9 million years ago is a subset of those peaks that begin (i.e., the precession parameter starts decreasing) while obliquity is increasing. Specifically, termination occurs with the first of these candidate peaks to occur after each eccentricity minimum. Thus, the gross morphology of 100-thousand-year (100-kyr) glacial cycles appears largely deterministic.",

The microbiota also plays an important role in seeding islet-resident macrophages, and macrophage depletion during development reduces \u03b2 cells. Candida dubliniensis increases \u03b2 cells in a macrophage-dependent manner through distinctive cell wall composition and reduces murine diabetes incidence. Provision of C. dubliniensis after \u03b2 cell ablation or antibiotic treatment improves \u03b2 cell function. These data identify fungi as critical early-life commensals that promote long-term metabolic health.",

We demonstrate an inexpensive mandrel-free method for making polymer muscles that can have a spring index of >50 and a contractile tensile stroke exceeding 97%. This method enables the spring index to be varied along a muscle\u2019s length by varying the plying twist, resulting in muscles that transition between homochiral and heterochiral when either heated or cooled. We demonstrate use of these polymer muscles for robots and environmentally driven comfort-adjusting jackets. This mandrel-free method was used to make high-spring-index carbon nanotube yarns for mechanical energy harvesters, self-powered strain sensors, and solvent-driven and electrochemically driven artificial muscles.",

In tropical mountains, plants are mostly expected to migrate upslope in response to warming. To assess this, we analyze shifts in elevation ranges of species in Mesoamerican cloud forests using three decades of species\u2019 occurrence records. Our findings reveal a mean upslope shift of 1.8 to 2.7 meters per year since 1979 driven by the upslope retreat of the less thermophilic montane species. These shifts are mostly accompanied by retreating lower and upper edges attributed to varying degrees of species\u2019 exposure to deforestation and climate change. Our results highlight the vulnerability of cloud forests under global change and the urgency to increase monitoring of species\u2019 responses.",

We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy. The availability of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during a period of human life that is later lost from our autobiographical record implies that postencoding mechanisms, whereby memories from infancy become inaccessible for retrieval, may be more responsible for infantile amnesia.",

In this study, we show that the SR62 locus is a digenic module encoding the Sr62 TK TK and an NLR (Sr62 NLR ), and we identify the corresponding AvrSr62 effector. AvrSr62 binds to the N-terminal kinase 1 of Sr62 TK , triggering displacement of kinase 2, which activates Sr62 NLR . Modeling and mutation analysis indicated that this is mediated by overlapping binding sites (i) on kinase 1 for binding AvrSr62 and kinase 2 and (ii) on kinase 2 for binding kinase 1 and Sr62 NLR . Understanding this two-component resistance complex may help engineering and breeding plants for durable resistance.",

However, demonstration of exciton transport in EIs is difficult. In this work, we show that the strong interlayer excitonic correlation at equal electron and hole densities in MoSe 2 /WSe 2 double layers separated by a 2-nanometer barrier yields perfect Coulomb drag under zero magnetic field: A charge current in one layer induces an equal but opposite drag current in the other layer at low temperatures. The drag current ratio remains above 0.9 up to about 20 kelvin. As exciton density increases above the Mott density, the excitons dissociate into an electron-hole plasma abruptly, and only frictional drag is observed. Our experiment may lead to the realization of exciton circuitry and superfluidity.",

To investigate the basis for treatment failure, we examined spontaneous mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with either an inflamed T cell\u2013rich or a noninflamed T cell\u2013deprived tumor microenvironment (TME). Our studies reveal that erythropoietin (EPO) secreted by tumor cells determines tumor immunotype. Tumor-derived EPO autonomously generates a noninflamed TME by interacting with its cognate receptor EPOR on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). EPO signaling prompts TAMs to become immunoregulatory through NRF2-mediated heme depletion. Removing either tumor-derived EPO or EPOR on TAMs leads to an inflamed TME and tumor regression independent of genotype, owing to augmented antitumor T cell immunity. Thus, the EPO/EPOR axis functions as an immunosuppressive switch for antitumor immunity.",

By using participatory science data from eBird, we estimated continental population change and relative abundance at 27-kilometer resolution for 495 bird species from 2007 to 2021. Results revealed high and previously undetected spatial heterogeneity in trends; although 75% of species were declining, 97% of species showed separate areas of significantly increasing and decreasing populations. Populations tended to decline most steeply in strongholds where species were most abundant, yet they fared better where species were least abundant. These high-resolution trends improve our ability to understand population dynamics, prioritize recovery efforts, and guide conservation at a time when action is urgently needed.",

Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we developed an interfacial self-regulation concept in which a deformable secondary phase dynamically aggregates at the interface in response to local electro-chemo-mechanical stimuli, enhancing contact. The stripping of a lithium electrode that contains 5 to 20 mole % electrochemically inactive sodium domains causes spontaneous sodium accumulation across the interface, with the sodium deforming to attain intimate electrical contact without blocking lithium transport. This process, characterized with operando x-ray tomography and electron microscopy, mitigates voiding and improves cycling at low stack pressures. The counterintuitive strategy of adding electrochemically inactive alkali metal to improve performance demonstrates the utility of interfacial self-regulation for solid-state batteries.",

In this work, we identified a previously unrecognized hormone-releasing mechanism in the pituitary of the Japanese rice fish (medaka) induced by light. Ca 2+ imaging analysis revealed that melanotrophs, a type of pituitary endocrine cell that secretes melanocyte-stimulating hormone, robustly increase the concentration of intracellular Ca 2+ during short-wavelength light exposure. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule that drives this response. Knocking out opn5m attenuated melanogenesis by reducing tyrosinase expression in the skin. Our findings suggest a mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary melanotrophs triggers a pathway that might contribute to protection from ultraviolet radiation in medaka.",

In this work, we developed a neurobehavioral platform to enable wireless recording of the same premotor neurons in both RCs and FMCs. Neurons often encoded the same hand and mouth actions differently in RCs and FMCs. Furthermore, in FMCs, we identified cells that selectively encoded actions untestable during RCs and others that displayed mixed selectivity for multiple actions, which is compatible with an organization based on cortical motor synergies at different levels of complexity. Cross-context decoding demonstrated that neural activity in FMCs is richer and more generalizable than in RCs, which suggests that neuroethological approaches are better suited to unveil the neural bases of behavior.",

To address these challenges, we developed Genome-Shuffle-seq, a method that enables the multiplex generation and mapping of thousands of SVs (deletions, inversions, translocations, and extrachromosomal circles) throughout mammalian genomes. We also demonstrate the co-capture of SV identity with single-cell transcriptomes, facilitating the measurement of SV impact on gene expression. We anticipate that Genome-Shuffle-seq will be broadly useful for the systematic exploration of the functional consequences of SVs on gene expression, the chromatin landscape, and three-dimensional nuclear architecture, while also initiating a path toward a minimal mammalian genome.",

Tigers persistently occupied human-free, prey-rich protected areas (35,255 square kilometers) but also colonized proximal connected habitats that were shared with ~60 million people. Tiger absence and extinction were characterized by armed conflict, poverty, and extensive land-use changes.

Our results demonstrate that the dactyl club\u2019s periodic region functions as a dispersive, high-quality graded system, exhibiting Bloch harmonics, flat dispersion branches, ultraslow wave modes, and wide Bragg bandgaps in the lower megahertz range.

To test hypotheses about their evolution, we sequenced the genome of Silene latifolia , in which giant heteromorphic sex chromosomes were first discovered in 1923.

However, only with a whole Y chromosome assembly can candidate genes be validated experimentally and their locations determined and related to the suppression of recombination. We describe the genomic changes as the ancestral chromosome evolved into the current XY pair, testing ideas about the evolution of large nonrecombining regions and the mechanisms that created the present recombination pattern.",

Here we show, through field, lab, and virtual reality experimentation, that classical models of collective behavior cannot account for how collective motion emerges in marching desert locusts, whose swarms affect the livelihood of millions. In contrast to assumptions made by these models, locusts do not explicitly align with neighbors. While individuals respond to moving-dot stimuli through the optomotor response, this innate behavior does not mediate social response to neighbors. Instead, locust marching behavior, across scales, can be explained by a minimal cognitive framework, which incorporates individuals\u2019 neural representation of bearings to neighbors and internal consensus dynamics for making directional choices. Our findings challenge long-held beliefs about how order can emerge from disorder in animal collectives.",

To address this, we derived a new phylogenetic model and applied it to multispecies mammalian data. Our analyses reveal (i) strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances over macroevolutionary time, (ii) mutations affecting mRNA abundances minimally impact protein abundances, (iii) mRNA abundances evolve under selection to align with protein abundances, and (iv) mRNA abundances adapt faster than protein abundances owing to greater mutational opportunity. These conclusions are supported by comparisons of model parameters with independent functional genomic data. By decomposing mutational and selective influences on mRNA-protein dynamics, our approach provides a framework for discovering the evolutionary rules that drive divergence in gene expression.",

Comparative genomics analysis has identified RNA families containing hundreds of sequences that adopt conserved secondary structures and likely fold into complex three-dimensional structures. In this study, we used cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures from four RNA families, including ARRPOF and OLE forming dimers and ROOL and GOLLD forming hexameric, octameric, and dodecameric nanostructures, at 2.6- to 4.6-angstrom resolutions. These homo-oligomeric assemblies reveal a plethora of structural motifs that contribute to RNA multivalency, including kissing-loop, palindromic base-pairing, A-stacking, metal ion coordination, pseudoknot, and minor-groove interactions. These results provide the molecular basis of intermolecular interactions driving RNA multivalency with potential functional relevance.",

    "abstract": "The ozonolytic deconstruction of aromatics remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet \u03c0,\u03c0* state over the n,\u03c0* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes.",

Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales.",

In this work, we show that a prominent industrial process, palladium (Pd)\u2013catalyzed vinyl acetate synthesis, proceeds via interconversion of heterogeneous Pd(0) and homogeneous Pd(II) during catalysis, with each species playing a complementary role. Using electrochemical probes, we found that heterogeneous, nanoparticulate Pd(0) serves as an active oxygen reduction electrocatalyst to furnish the high potential required for corrosion to form homogeneous Pd(II), which then catalyzes selective ethylene acetoxylation with reformation of heterogeneous Pd(0). Inhibiting the corrosion of Pd(0) to Pd(II) by galvanic protection results in reversible poisoning of catalysis, evincing the essential role of phase conversion in this catalytic cycle. These results highlight how dynamic phase interconversion can harness and couple complementary reactivity across molecular and material active sites.",

We observed perfect Coulomb drag in the excitonic insulator phase at low temperatures; the counterflow resistance of interlayer excitons remained finite.

    "abstract": "Climate change increasingly drives local population dynamics, shifts geographic distributions, and threatens persistence. Gene flow and rapid adaptation could rescue declining populations yet are seldom integrated into forecasts. We modeled eco-evolutionary dynamics under preindustrial, contemporary, and projected climates using up to 9 years of fitness data from 102,272 transplants (115 source populations) of Boechera stricta in five common gardens. Climate change endangers locally adapted populations and reduces genotypic variation in long-term population growth rate, suggesting limited adaptive potential. Upslope migration could stabilize high-elevation populations and preserve low-elevation ecotypes, but unassisted gene flow modeled with genomic data is too spatially restricted. Species distribution models failed to capture current dynamics and likely overestimate persistence under intermediate emissions scenarios, highlighting the importance of modeling evolutionary processes.",

In this work, we report a technology for intracellular protein editing, drawing from split intein\u2013mediated protein splicing, genetic code expansion, and endogenous protein tagging. This approach enables us to rapidly and site-specifically install residues and chemical handles into a protein. We demonstrate the power of this platform to edit cellular proteins, inserting epitopes, protein-specific sequences, and noncanonical amino acids. Notably, we use an endogenous tagging approach to apply our protein editing technology to endogenous proteins with minimal perturbation. We anticipate that the protein editing technology presented in this work will be applied to a diverse set of problems and phenomena in live mammalian cells.",

Mobile integrons (MIs) are borne on plasmids, acting as a vehicle for hundreds of antimicrobial resistance genes among key pathogens. These elements also carry gene cassettes of unknown function ( gcu s) whose role and adaptive value remain unexplored. In this work, we show that gcu s encode phage resistance systems, many of which are newly discovered. Bacteriophage resistance integron cassettes (BRiCs) can be combined and mixed with resistance cassettes to produce multiphage or drug and phage resistance. The fitness costs of BRiCs are variable and dependent on the genetic context and can be modulated by changing the order of cassettes in the array. Hence, MIs act as highly mobile, low-cost defense islands.",

While mobile integrons are well known for spreading antibiotic resistance genes, the functions of the hundreds of cassettes carried by sedentary integrons remain largely unexplored. We show that many of these cassettes encode small variants of known antiphage systems that favor their inclusion in the integron. We also demonstrate that nearly 10% of the integron cassettes in the pandemic Vibrio cholerae strain encode novel antiphage functions. Most of these novel systems have little or no similarity to previously known ones, with several providing defense through cell lysis or growth arrest. Our work highlights the stabilization and prevalence of small antiphage systems within integrons, making them an untapped biobank of defense mechanisms.",

In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 human clinical trial, the recombinant, germline-targeting envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer BG505 SOSIP.v4.1-GT1.1, adjuvanted with AS01 B , induced bnAb precursors of the VRC01-class at a high frequency in the majority of vaccine recipients. These bnAb precursors, which target the CD4 receptor binding site, had undergone somatic hypermutation characteristic of the VRC01-class. A subset of isolated VRC01-class monoclonal antibodies neutralized wild-type pseudoviruses and was structurally extremely similar to bnAb VRC01.

The design strategies include (i) changing the linkage from amide to imine and (ii) subsequent introduction of shape-persistent units such as triptycene and spirobifluorene. The prepared polyimine membranes exhibit ultrahigh microporosity and enhanced swelling and plasticization resistance compared with conventional polyamide counterparts.

Despite the transformative impact, visible-light photoredox catalysis remains constrained by the thermodynamic limits of photon energy and inefficiencies arising from unproductive back electron transfer, both of which become particularly pronounced in thermodynamically demanding reactions. In this work, we introduce an organic photoredox catalyst system that overcomes these obstacles to drive chemical transformations that require super-reducing capabilities. This advancement is accomplished by coupling the energy of two photons into a single chemical reduction, whereas inefficiencies from back electron transfer are mitigated through a distinct proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism embedded in the catalyst design. The super-reducing capabilities of this organic catalyst system are demonstrated through efficient application in a broad scope of challenging arene reductions.",

Central to such modeling is Glen\u2019s flow law, in which strain rate depends on stress raised to a power of n = 3 to 4. In sharp contrast to this nonlinearity, we found by conducting large-scale, shear-deformation experiments that temperate ice is linear-viscous ( n \u2248 1.0) over common ranges of liquid water content and stress expected near glacier beds and in ice-stream margins. This linearity is likely caused by diffusive pressure melting and refreezing at grain boundaries and could help to stabilize modeled responses of ice sheets to shrinkage-induced stress increases.",

In Eif2s3y , Uty , and Zfy2 deletants, spermatogenesis was impaired. We found that Uty regulates spermatogonial proliferation, revealed a role for Zfy2 in promoting meiotic sex chromosome pairing, and uncovered unexpected effects of Y genes on the somatic testis transcriptome. In the remaining single Y-gene deletants, spermatogenesis appeared unperturbed, but testis transcription was still altered. Multigene deletions, including a human-infertility AZFa model, exhibited phenotypes absent in single Y deletants. Thus, Y genes may regulate spermatogenesis even if they show no phenotypes when deleted individually. This study advances our knowledge of Y evolution and infertility and provides a resource to dissect Y-gene functions in other tissues.",

Recording from large ensembles of hippocampal place cells in freely behaving rats, we observed that replay content is strictly organized over multiple timescales and governed by self-avoidance. After movement cessation, replays avoided the animal\u2019s previous path for 3 seconds. Chains of replays avoided self-repetition over a shorter timescale. We used a continuous attractor model of neural activity to demonstrate that neuronal fatigue both generates replay sequences and produces self-avoidance over the observed timescales. In addition, replay of past experience became predominant later into the stopping period, in a manner requiring cortical input. These results indicate a mechanism for replay generation that unexpectedly constrains which sequences can be produced across time.",

    "abstract": "Influenza virus pandemics and seasonal epidemics have claimed countless lives. Recurrent zoonotic spillovers of influenza viruses with pandemic potential underscore the need for effective countermeasures. In this study, we show that pre-exposure prophylaxis with broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) MEDI8852 is highly effective in protecting cynomolgus macaques from severe disease caused by aerosolized highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus infection. Protection was antibody dose\u2013dependent yet independent of Fc-mediated effector functions at the dose tested. Macaques receiving MEDI8852 at 10 milligrams per kilogram or higher had negligible impairment of respiratory function after infection, whereas control animals were not protected from severe disease and fatality. Given the breadth of MEDI8852 and other bnAbs, we anticipate that protection from unforeseen pandemic influenza A viruses is achievable.",

    "abstract": "In the ancient microbial Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is fixed in a multistep process that ends with acetyl\u2013coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthesis at the bifunctional carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex (CODH/ACS). In this work, we present structural snapshots of the CODH/ACS from the gas-converting acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum , characterizing the molecular choreography of the overall reaction, including electron transfer to the CODH for CO 2 reduction, methyl transfer from the corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CoFeSP) partner to the ACS active site, and acetyl-CoA production. Unlike CODH, the multidomain ACS undergoes large conformational changes to form an internal connection to the CODH active site, accommodate the CoFeSP for methyl transfer, and protect the reaction intermediates. Altogether, the structures allow us to draw a detailed reaction mechanism of this enzyme, which is crucial for CO 2 fixation in anaerobic organisms.",

    "abstract": "Correlated metals may exhibit unusually high resistivity that increases linearly in temperature, breaking through the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound, above which coherent quasiparticles are destroyed. The fate of collective charge excitations, or plasmons, in these systems is a subject of debate. Several studies have suggested that plasmons are overdamped, whereas other studies have detected propagating plasmons. In this work, we present direct nano-optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl 2 . HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl 2 . Photoemission data presented here reveal a highly anisotropic Fermi surface, reconstructed and made partly incoherent, likely through electronic interactions as explained by many-body theory. HPPs remain long-lived despite this, revealing previously unseen imprints of many-body effects on plasmonic collective modes.",

We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry. The derived seismic hydrographs reveal distinct expressions of groundwater and surficial water droughts: Whereas surface and near-surface water storage nearly fully recovered in the epic wet season of 2023, only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was restored. On a decadal scale, we find substantial depletion in aquifers below 50-meter depth, with only limited storm-related recovery. Our analysis underscores the need to monitor deep aquifers for a more complete assessment of total water deficits, using high-resolution tools such as seismic sensing.",

Enhancer codes of orthologous nonneuronal and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid\u2013mediated (GABAergic) cell types show a high degree of similarity across amniotes, whereas excitatory neurons of the mammalian neocortex and avian pallium exhibit varying degrees of similarity.

We demonstrate that brown nitrogen (BrN), the absorptive nitrogenous component of OAs, dominates their global absorption. Using a global model, we quantified BrN abundance, tracked its optical evolution with chemical aging, and assessed its radiative absorption. BrN contributes 76% of OAs\u2019 surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs\u2019 absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN. BrN represents 18% of the global absorptive direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols, with biomass burning being the largest contributor. Our research establishes a nitrogen-centric framework for attributing the climate impacts of OAs.",

    "abstract": "Ceramides play a central role in human health and disease, yet their role as systemic signaling molecules remain poorly understood. In this work, we identify formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) as a membrane receptor that specifically binds long-chain ceramides (C14 to C20). In brown and beige adipocytes, C16:0 ceramide binding to FPR2 inhibits thermogenesis through G i cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathways, an effect that is reversed in the absence of FPR2. We present three cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of FPR2 in complex with G i trimers bound to C16:0, C18:0, and C20:0 ceramides. The hydrophobic tails are deeply embedded in the orthosteric ligand pocket, which has a limited amount of plasticity. Modification of the ceramide binding motif in closely related receptors, such as FPR1 or FPR3, converts them from inactive to active ceramide receptors. Our findings provide a structural basis for adipocyte thermogenesis mediated by FPR2.",

Radiators (Borneo) generate and distribute diversity, incubators (Indochina, New Guinea, and Sulawesi) produce diversity in isolation, corridors (Java, Maluku, Sumatra, and the Thai-Malay Peninsula) connect neighboring regions, and accumulators (Australia, India, Palawan, and the Philippines) acquire diversity generated elsewhere.

By inverting these data, we mapped the extinction curve parameter R ( V ) within the Milky Way in three dimensions and within the Magellanic Clouds in two dimensions. These maps provide improved extinction corrections for astronomical observations. We find that R ( V ) varies with extinction, consistent with dust grains growing by accretion in low-extinction regions and by coagulation in higher-extinction regions. Star-forming regions have high R ( V ) values, indicating either preferential destruction of small dust grains or additional supply of large dust grains in those regions.",

In the extension zone, we found that ice exhibits anisotropic properties. We constructed ice shelf\u2013wide anisotropic viscosity maps that capture the suture zones, which inhibit rift propagation. The inferred stress exponent near the grounding zone dictates the grounding-line ice flux and grounding line stability, whereas the inferred viscosity maps inform the prediction of rifts.

Leveraging the strong atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrated fast qubit-state readout with 99.960 \u2212 24 + 14 % fidelity and two methods for cavity-mediated entanglement generation with integrated error detection. First, we used cavity-carving to generate a Bell state with 91(4)% fidelity and a 32(1)% success rate (the number in parentheses is the standard deviation). Second, we performed a cavity-mediated gate with a deterministic entanglement fidelity of 52.5(18)%, increased to 76(2)% with error detection.

Compared with the ventral nuclei and PFC, the intralaminar and medial nuclei presented earlier and stronger consciousness-related activity. Transient thalamofrontal neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling were both driven by the \u03b8 phase of the intralaminar and medial nuclei during conscious perception.

CXCR3 expression by CD8 T cells was required for their hours-long reengagement with DCs in specific subfollicular niches in lymph nodes. CD4 T cells paused briefly at the sites of CD8 T cell and DC interactions and provided Interleukin-2 (IL-2) before moving to another DC. Our results highlight a previously unappreciated phase of cell-cell interactions during T cell priming and have direct implications for vaccinations and cellular immunotherapies.",

Achieving enantiocontrol over unactivated prochiral alkyl radicals is even more difficult owing to their high reactivity and limited interactions with chiral catalysts. In this study, we report a copper-catalyzed asymmetric amination of unactivated prochiral secondary alkyl radicals, using specifically designed chiral anionic multidentate ligands in a radical substitution reaction. This approach efficiently produces highly enantioenriched \u03b1-chiral alkyl amines and facilitates the enantioselective formal synthesis of a series of important drug molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that bulky peripheral modifications on the ligands help create a truncated cone-shaped chiral pocket, enabling precise enantiodiscrimination through steric hindrance and noncovalent interactions. This strategy holds broad potential for asymmetric transformations involving diverse unactivated prochiral alkyl radicals and nucleophiles.",

    "abstract": "Exoplanets classified as super-Earths are commonly observed on short-period orbits, close to their host stars, but their abundance on wider orbits is poorly constrained. Gravitational microlensing is sensitive to exoplanets on wide orbits. We observed the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0007, which indicates an exoplanet with a planet-to-star mass ratio roughly double the Earth-Sun mass ratio, on an orbit longer than Saturn\u2019s. We combined this event with a larger sample from a microlensing survey to determine the distribution of mass ratios for planets on wide orbits. We infer that there are ~0.35 super-Earth planets per star on Jupiter-like orbits. The observations are most consistent with a bimodal distribution, with separate peaks for super-Earths and gas giants. We suggest that this reflects differences in their formation processes.",

In this work, we examined germline structural variants (SVs) as risk factors for pediatric extracranial solid tumors using germline genome sequencing of 1765 affected children, their 943 unaffected parents, and 6665 adult controls. We discovered a sex-biased association between very large (>1 megabase) germline chromosomal abnormalities and increased risk of solid tumors in male children. The overall impact of germline SVs was greatest in neuroblastoma, where we uncovered burdens of ultrarare SVs that cause loss of function of highly expressed, mutationally constrained genes, as well as noncoding SVs predicted to disrupt chromatin domain boundaries. Collectively, we estimate that rare germline SVs explain 1.1 to 5.6% of pediatric cancer liability, establishing them as an important component of disease predisposition.",

Over 3 years, 71 bats migrated tens to hundreds of kilometers per night, predominantly with incoming warm fronts, which provided them with wind support. Bats also showed unexpected flexibility in their ability to migrate across a wide range of conditions if needed. However, females leaving toward the end of the season showed higher total activity per distance traveled, a possible cost for their flexible migration timing.",

We found that creosote-adapted woodrats have elevated gene dosage across multiple biotransformation enzyme families. These duplication events occurred independently across species and substantially increase expression of biotransformation genes, especially within the glucuronidation pathway. We propose that increased gene dosage resulting from duplication is an important mechanism by which animals initially adapt to novel environmental pressures.",

However, direct evidence of the onset and evolution of animal resource consumption in hominins remains elusive. The nitrogen-15 to nitrogen-14 ratio of collagen provides trophic information about individuals in modern and geologically recent ecosystems (<200,000 years ago), but diagenetic loss of this organic matter precludes studies of greater age. By contrast, nitrogen in tooth enamel is preserved for millions of years. We report enamel-bound organic nitrogen and carbonate carbon isotope measurements of Sterkfontein Member 4 mammalian fauna, including seven Australopithecus specimens. Our results suggest a variable but plant-based diet (largely C 3 ) for these hominins. Therefore, we argue that Australopithecus at Sterkfontein did not engage in regular mammalian meat consumption.",

We conducted a deuterium labeling experiment to determine whether elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), warming, and drought impact soil water storage and transport in a temperate grassland. Elevated CO 2 created a wetter rootzone compared with ambient conditions, whereas warming decreased soil moisture. Soil water remained well mixed in all global change treatments except for summer drought combined with warming and elevated CO 2 . These combined treatments caused the grassland to conserve water and restricted soil water flow to large, rapidly draining pores without mixing with small, slowly draining pores. Our results suggest that drought in a warmer, more CO 2 -rich climate can severely alter grassland ecohydrology by constraining postdrought soil water flow and grassland water use.",

G -factors reached magnitudes as high as 1.30 for drop-cast films and 1.06 for patterned films, approaching theoretical limits. By controlling the evaporation geometry, various domain shapes and sizes were achieved, with homochiral domains exceeding 6 square millimeters that transition smoothly between left- and right-handed chirality. Our results uncovered fundamental relationships between meniscus deposition processes, the alignment of supramolecular filaments and their MSC constituents, and their connection to emergent chiral properties.",

The \u03b7-to-\u03b8 phase transition of alumina is unidirectional in bulk and retains the crystal lattice orientation. We report a rare example of a statistical kinetics study showing that for nanoparticles on a bulk Al(OH) 3 surface, this phase transition occurs nondeterministically through an ergodic equilibrium through the molten state, and the memory of the lattice orientation is lost in this process. The rate of the interconversion was found to be insensitive to the electron dose rate, and this process had a small Gibbs free energy of activation. These nondeterministic kinetics should be a key feature of crystal nucleation occurring in high-surface-energy regions of bulk crystals.",

Animals can adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions, but the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We found that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning; instead, the learned behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over escape responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses.",

    "abstract": "Interest in actinide\u2013carbon bonds has persisted since actinide organometallics were first investigated for applications in isotope separation during the Manhattan Project. Transplutonium organometallics are rarely isolated and structurally characterized, likely owing to limited isotope inventories, a scarcity of suitable laboratory infrastructure, and intrinsic difficulties with the anaerobic conditions required. Herein, we report the discovery of an organometallic \u201cberkelocene\u201d complex prepared from 0.3 milligrams of berkelium-249. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction shows a tetravalent berkelium ion between two substituted cyclooctatetraene ligands, resulting in the formation of berkelium\u2013carbon bonds. The coordination in berkelocene resembles that of uranocene, and calculations show that the berkelium 5f orbitals engage in covalent overlap with the \u03b4-symmetry orbitals of the cyclooctatetraenide ligand \u03c0 system. Charge transfer from the ligands is diminished relative to uranocene and other actinocenes, which maximizes contributions from the stable, half-filled 5f 7 configuration of tetravalent berkelium.",

    "abstract": "Inferring cellular and molecular dynamics of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions from postmortem tissue collected decades after onset is challenging. Using magnetic resonance image (MRI)\u2013guided spatiotemporal RNA profiling in marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), we mapped lesion dynamics and modeled molecular perturbations relevant to MS. Five distinct lesion microenvironments emerged, involving neuroglial responses, tissue destruction and repair, and brain border regulation. Before demyelination, MRI identified a high ratio of proton density\u2013weighted signal to T 1 relaxation time, capturing early hypercellularity, and elevated astrocytic and ependymal senescence signals marked perivascular and periventricular areas that later became demyelination hotspots. As lesions expanded, concentric glial barriers formed, initially dominated by proliferating and diversifying microglia and oligodendrocyte precursors, later replaced by monocytes and lymphocytes. We highlight SERPINE1 + astrocytes as a signaling hub underlying lesion onset in both marmoset EAE and MS.",

In this work, we present four cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of the human LINE-1 TPRT complex, revealing the conformational dynamics of open reading frame 2 protein (ORF2p) and its extensive remodeling of the target DNA for TPRT initiation. We observe nicking of the DNA second strand during reverse transcription of the first strand.

Together with our structural data, this suggests a mechanism by which these factors regulate retrotransposition and supports a model for TPRT that accounts for retrotransposition outcomes observed in cells.",

We performed a canine genome-wide association study for body condition score\u2014a measure of obesity\u2014in 241 Labrador retrievers. Using a cross-species approach, we showed that canine obesity genes are also associated with rare and common forms of obesity in humans. The lead canine association was within the gene DENN domain containing 1B ( DENND1B ). Each copy of the alternate allele was associated with ~7% greater body fat. We demonstrate a role for this gene in regulating signaling and trafficking of melanocortin 4 receptor, a critical controller of energy homeostasis. Thus, canine genetics identified obesity genes and mechanisms relevant to both dogs and humans.",

However, our understanding of epigenetic dynamics during preimplantation development at single-cell resolution remains incomplete. Here, we developed scNanoATAC-seq2, a single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using long-read sequencing for scarce samples. We present a detailed chromatin accessibility landscape of mouse preimplantation development, revealing distinct chromatin signatures in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm during lineage segregation. Differences between zygotes and two-cell embryos highlight reprogramming in chromatin accessibility during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Single-cell long-read sequencing enables in-depth analysis of chromatin accessibility in noncanonical imprinting, imprinted X chromosome inactivation, and low-mappability genomic regions, such as repetitive elements and paralogs. Our data provide insights into chromatin dynamics during mammalian preimplantation development and lineage differentiation.",

We show that uniaxial compression induces clonal multicellularity in haloarchaea, forming tissue-like structures. These archaeal tissues are mechanically and molecularly distinct from their unicellular lifestyle, mimicking several eukaryotic features. Archaeal tissues undergo a multinucleate stage followed by tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. After cellularization, tissue junction elasticity becomes akin to that of animal tissues, giving rise to two cell types\u2014peripheral (Per) and central scutoid (Scu) cells\u2014with distinct actin and protein glycosylation polarity patterns. Our findings highlight the potential convergent evolution of a biophysical mechanism in the emergence of multicellular systems across domains of life.",

We show that combining oral vaccination with engineered or selected niche-competitor strains permits pathogen exclusion and strain replacement in the mouse gut lumen. This approach can be applied either prophylactically to prevent invasion of nontyphoidal Salmonella strains, or therapeutically to displace an established Escherichia coli. Both intact adaptive immunity and metabolic niche competition are necessary for efficient vaccine-enhanced competition. Our findings imply that mucosal antibodies have evolved to work in the context of gut microbial ecology by influencing the outcome of competition. This has broad implications for the elimination of pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacterial reservoirs and for rational microbiota engineering.",

In this study, we observed this braiding phase in both the filling factor 1/3 and 4/3 fractional quantum Hall states by probing three-state random telegraph noise (RTN) in real time. We found that the observed RTN stems from anyon quasiparticle number n fluctuations, and we reconstructed three Aharonov-Bohm oscillation signals phase shifted by 2\u03c0/3, corresponding to the three possible interference branches from braiding around n (mod 3) anyons. Our methods can be readily extended to interference of non-abelian anyons.",

In this work, we use phased genome assemblies to show that adaptive divergence in cryptic color pattern in a stick insect is repeatedly underlain by structural variation, but not a simple chromosomal inversion. We found that color pattern in populations of stick insects on two mountains is associated with translocations that have also been inverted. These translocations differ in size and origin on each mountain, but they overlap partially and involve some of the same gene regions. Moreover, this structural variation is subject to divergent selection and arose without introgression between species. Our results show how the origin of structural variation provides a mechanism for repeated bouts of adaptation.",

Although Gauss incompatibility has long been recognized as the source of morphing in naturally growing slender organs, here we show that the growth profile of rose petals remains Gauss compatible. Their distinctive shape emerges from a different type of geometric incompatibility, the Mainardi-Codazzi-Peterson (MCP) incompatibility, which leads to the formation of localized cusps along the petal margins. We validated this mechanism in model disc petals theoretically, computationally, and experimentally. Our study reveals distinct morphological regimes, ranging from smooth edges to cusp-forming configurations, and demonstrates how stress focusing at cusps influences subsequent petal growth. These findings position MCP incompatibility as a generic mechanism for cusp formation in both natural and manmade self-morphing sheets.",

This strategy relies on an unusual photochemical isomerization of the dihydrobenzofuran core to a highly electrophilic spiro-cyclopropane intermediate that is then intercepted by a halide nucleophile. A variety of aryl ketones are transposed using 370-nanometer centered irradiation. Additionally, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides can be transposed using 310-nanometer centered irradiation.

A second class of proteins were designed to catalyze a silicon-hydrogen insertion and were optimized by directed evolution in whole cells. The evolved proteins incorporated features unlikely to be generated by computational design alone, including a proline in an \u03b1 helix. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that as the proteins evolved toward higher activity, their conformational ensembles narrowed to favor more productive conformations.

Ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses has been proposed to be a key synaptic substrate for antidepressant action. Here, we found that ketamine-induced CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation could be augmented by transiently increasing extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinase (ERK) activity through pharmacological inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases 6 (DUSP6). The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of acute ketamine treatment were extended by DUSP6 inhibition for up to 2 months. The selective deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in excitatory neurons abolished these DUSP6 inhibition\u2013mediated synaptic and behavioral effects. These data suggest that ketamine\u2019s rapid antidepressant effects can be sustained by selectively targeting downstream intracellular signaling.",

    "abstract": "Emotional responses to sensory experience are central to the human condition in health and disease. We hypothesized that principles governing the emergence of emotion from sensation might be discoverable through their conservation across the mammalian lineage. We therefore designed a cross-species neural activity screen, applicable to humans and mice, combining precise affective behavioral measurements, clinical medication administration, and brain-wide intracranial electrophysiology. This screen revealed conserved biphasic dynamics in which emotionally salient sensory signals are swiftly broadcast throughout the brain and followed by a characteristic persistent activity pattern. Medication-based interventions that selectively blocked persistent dynamics while preserving fast broadcast selectively inhibited emotional responses in humans and mice. Mammalian emotion appears to emerge as a specifically distributed neural context, driven by persistent dynamics and shaped by a global intrinsic timescale.",

    "abstract": "Although nodal spin-triplet topological superconductivity appears probable in uranium ditelluride (UTe 2 ), its superconductive order parameter \u0394 k remains unestablished. In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band, which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor and also distinguish a chiral from a nonchiral \u0394 k through enhanced s-wave proximity. In this study, we used s-wave superconductive scan tips and detected intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe 2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging revealed subgap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a -axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity signifies that \u0394 k of UTe 2 is a nonchiral state: B 1 u , B 2 u , or B 3 u . However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a axis is internodal, then a nonchiral B 3 u state is the most consistent for UTe 2 .",

    "abstract": "Present vision restoration technologies have substantial constraints that limit their application in the clinical setting. In this work, we fabricated a subretinal nanoprosthesis using tellurium nanowire networks (TeNWNs) that converts light of both the visible and near-infrared\u2013II spectra into electrical signals. The broad-spectrum coverage is made possible by a combination of narrow bandgaps, strong absorption, and engineered asymmetries. Implanted into blind mice, the TeNWNs restored pupillary reflexes and enabled visually cued learning under visible and near-infrared 1550-nanometer light. In nonhuman primates, TeNWNs elicited robust retina-derived neural responses, confirming biocompatibility and feasibility. By restoring lost photosensitivity and extending vision to near-infrared, this nanoprosthesis offers a promising approach for restoring vision.",

It inhibited PI3K\u03b1 activation in tumors with oncogenic mutations in KRAS or PIK3CA and in tumors with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification or overexpression. In preclinical models, BBO-10203 caused significant tumor growth inhibition across multiple tumor types and showed enhanced efficacy in combination with inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6), estrogen receptor (ER), HER2, and KRAS-G12C mutant, including in tumors harboring mutations in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11).

Roots respond to transient water unavailability by temporarily ceasing branching through the acclimative response xerobranching. In this study, we report how a xerobranching stimulus triggers rapid changes of ROS levels in root nuclei, triggering redox-dependent multimerization of the auxin repressor protein IAA3. Mutations in specific cysteine residues of IAA3 disrupt redox-mediated multimerization and interaction with co-repressor TPL, thereby attenuating IAA3-mediated target gene repression. Other AUX/IAA proteins also vary in their redox-mediated multimerization, which reveals a regulatory mechanism that connects dynamic changes in cellular redox status to auxin signaling. Our study reveals how ROS, auxin, and water availability intersect and shape root adaptive responses, thereby maintaining phenotypic plasticity in plants.",

We used biophysical models (validated by 2685 field observations) to test this hypothesis for 10 ecologically diverse lizards in African and Australian deserts. Historical warming (1950\u20132020) has been more intense in Africa than in Australia, translating to an energetic squeeze for African diurnal species. Although no net impact on Australian diurnal species was observed, warming generated an energetic \u201crelief\u201d (by increasing foraging time) for nocturnal species. Future warming impacts will be more severe in Africa than in Australia, requiring increased rates of food intake (+10% per hour active for diurnal species). The effects of climate warming on desert lizard energy budgets will thus be species-specific but potentially predictable.",

Across locations, reforestation tends to provide species more habitat through both land-cover change and climate mitigation, whereas habitat loss from afforestation and bioenergy cropping typically outweighs the climate mitigation benefits.

In mice, reward and its prediction activate the SVTg, and SVTg stimulation leads to place preference, reduced anxiety, and accumbal dopamine release. Mice self-stimulate the SVTg, which can also be activated directly by the neocortex, resulting in effective inhibition of the lateral habenula, a region associated with depression. This mechanism may also explain why SVTg suppression induces aversion and increases fear. The translational relevance of these findings is supported by evidence in the rat, monkey, and human brainstem, establishing SVTg as a key hub for reward processing, emotional valence, and motivation.",

However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power owing to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations revealed a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow, over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, the ice quake cascades appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude with those measured geodetically, providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations.",

These two archetypes also form on eukaryotic exogenous sequences, depend on sequence composition, and can be predicted using neural networks trained on the native genome.

This allows local control of rigidity transitions between solid and fluid-like states in the collective and enables spatiotemporal control of shape and strength.

The homogeneous, water-compatible reaction conditions are operationally simple and contribute to streamlining synthesis and mild late-stage functionalization.",

In this work, we experimentally show a N 2 O production pathway not previously considered in greenhouse gas budgets, which we name photochemodenitrification. Sunlight induces substantial and consistent N 2 O production under oxic abiotic conditions in fresh and marine waters. We measured photochemical N 2 O production rates using isotope tracers and determined that nitrite is the main substrate and that nitrate can also contribute after being photoreduced to nitrite. Additionally, this N 2 O production was strongly correlated to the radiation dose. Photochemodenitrification exceeded biological N 2 O production in surface waters. Although previously overlooked, this process may contribute considerably to global N 2 O emissions through its occurrence in fresh and marine surface waters.",

Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry.",

To address this, research in quantum optics has explored filtering techniques such as photon ancillas and Rydberg atom blockade to restore entangled states. We introduce an approach to entanglement retrieval that exploits the features of non-Hermitian systems. By designing an anti\u2013parity-time two-state guiding configuration, we demonstrate efficient extraction of entanglement from any input state. This filter is implemented on a lossless waveguide network and achieves near-unity fidelity under single- and two-photon excitation and is scalable to higher photon levels, remaining robust against decoherence during propagation.

Using high-frequency location data of rideshare drivers in Florida ( N = 222,838 individuals), we estimate the effect of driver race on citations and fines for speeding using 19.3 million location pings. Compared with a white driver traveling the same speed, we find that racial or ethnic minority drivers are 24 to 33% more likely to be cited for speeding and pay 23 to 34% more money in fines. We find no evidence that accident and reoffense rates explain these estimates, which suggests that an animus against minorities underlies our results.",

However, low energy density resulting from low breakdown strength and suppressed polarization still remains a daunting challenge for practical applications. We propose a microstructural strategy with dendritic nanopolar (DNP) regions self-assembled into an insulator, which simultaneously enhances breakdown strength and high-field polarizability and minimizes energy loss and thus markedly improves energy storage performance and stability. For illustration, in this study, we achieved a high energy density of 215.8 joules per cubic centimeter with an efficiency of 80.7% at a high electric field of 7.4 megavolts per centimeter in a DNP structure\u2013designed PbZr 0.53 Ti 0.47 O 3 -MgO film. The proposed strategy is generally applicable for development of high-performance dielectric microcapacitors.",

In this study, we show that in organic and conventional arable fields, the multifunctionality of soils decreases with increasing agricultural management intensity. Soil organic carbon content and bacterial biomass, respectively, were the strongest abiotic and biotic predictors of soil multifunctionality. Greater soil multifunctionality was associated with less-frequent inversion tillage and higher frequency of grass-legume cover cropping, and organic farming did not outperform conventional farming. Our results suggest that reducing management intensity will enhance soil multifunctionality in both conventional and organic farming. This implies that, in contexts where high-yielding, high-intensity agriculture prevails, the paradigm of sustainable intensification should be replaced by \u201cproductive deintensification.\u201d",

In this work, we discovered a principle that can establish the 3D glomerular map of the fly antennal lobe by reducing the higher dimensionality serially to 1D projections. During development, olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons first contact their partner projection neuron dendrites on the spherical surface of the antennal lobe, regardless of whether the adult glomeruli lie near the surface or inside. Along this 2D surface, axons of each ORN type take a specific, arc-shaped trajectory that precisely intersects with their partner dendrites. Altering axon trajectories compromises synaptic partner matching. A 3D search is thus reduced to one dimension, simplifying partner matching.",

In contrast, locomotion in artificial systems often depends on centralized processors. Here, we introduce a rapid and autonomous locomotion strategy with synchronized gaits emerging through physical interactions between self-oscillating limbs and the environment, without control signals. Each limb is a single soft tube that only requires a constant flow of air to perform cyclic stepping motions at frequencies reaching 300 hertz. Physical synchronization of several of these self-oscillating limbs enables locomotion speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than those of comparable state-of-the-art robots. Through body-environment dynamics, these seemingly simple devices exhibit autonomy, including obstacle avoidance, amphibious gait transitions, and phototaxis.",

Whereas BRCA1-BARD1 alleviates the CST-imposed EXO1 blockade, it has little effect on BLM-DNA2 restriction. CST mutants impaired for DNA binding or BLM\u2013EXO1 interaction exhibit a hyper-resection phenotype and render BRCA1-deficient cells resistant to poly(ADP\u2013ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.

This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrated. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we performed mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection through local shelving into motional superposition states. We lastly entangled the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generated hyperentanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.",

    "abstract": "In natural habitats, nutrient availability limits bacterial growth. We discovered that bacteria can overcome this limitation by acquiring nutrients by lysing neighboring cells through contact-dependent antagonism. Using single-cell live imaging and isotopic markers, we found that during starvation, the type VI secretion system (T6SS) lysed neighboring cells and thus provided nutrients from lysing cells for growth. Genomic adaptations in antagonists, characterized by a reduced metabolic gene repertoire, and the previously unexplored distribution of the T6SS across bacterial taxa in natural environments suggest that bacterial antagonism may contribute to nutrient transfer within microbial communities in many ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The nature and spectrum of elementary excitations are defining features of a many-body system. In this study, we used a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, that probes these low-energy excitations. We illustrated the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extracted the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings. The ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves, whereas in the antiferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities. Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the excitation spectrum of a many-body system.",

From a circuit screen in mice, we identified a group of thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) neurons activated during sleep deprivation (SD) and required for sleep homeostasis. Optogenetic activation of RE neurons leads to an unusual phenotype: presleep behaviors (grooming and nest organizing) followed by prolonged, intense sleep that resembles RS. Inhibiting RE activity during SD impairs subsequent RS, which suggests that these neurons signal sleep need. RE neurons act upstream of sleep-promoting zona incerta cells, and SD triggers plasticity of this circuit to strengthen their connectivity. These findings reveal a circuit mechanism by which sleep need transforms the functional coupling of a sleep circuit to promote persistent, deep sleep.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing can detail these constraints by systematically profiling homologous cells. The conserved invariant embryonic lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae makes them ideal for comparing cell type gene expression across evolution. Measuring the spatiotemporal divergence of gene expression across embryogenesis, we find a high level of similarity in gene expression programs between species despite tens of millions of years of evolutionary divergence. Nonetheless, thousands of genes show divergence in their cell type specific expression patterns, with enrichment for functions in environmental response and behavior. Neuronal cell types show higher divergence than others such as the intestine and germline. This work identifies likely constraints on the evolution of developmental gene expression.",

The Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt (NGB) in Canada may be the only known remnant of Hadean crust, although its age is debated, ranging from \u22653.75 to 4.3 billion years old. Mafic intrusions within this belt were specifically sampled and analyzed to investigate the timing of their magmatic differentiation. Correlations between samarium/neodymium (Sm/Nd) and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 142 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios correspond to ages of 4157 \u00b1 174 and 4196 \u2212 81 + 53 million years for the long-lived 147 Sm- 143 Nd and the short-lived 146 Sm- 142 Nd systems, respectively. The age agreement between both extant and extinct radiogenic systems, in rocks related through igneous fractionation, is compelling evidence for preservation of Hadean rocks in the NGB, opening a rare window into Earth\u2019s earliest times.",

We then drew inspiration from these findings for the design and development of iridophore-inspired multispectral composite materials with tunable visible and infrared functionalities. Our study provides insight into squid dynamic structural coloration mechanisms and furnishes a technology for camouflage, heat management, display, and sensing applications.",

Using a numerical model informed by 1 year of acoustic observations in the East Antarctic, we estimated the total particulate organic carbon (POC) flux from krill fecal pellets to be 9.68 milligrams of carbon per square meter per day (mg C m \u22122 day \u22121 ). A maximum of 25% of krill migrated to depths >200 m with a strong seasonality component, transporting <10% of the total krill POC flux (1.28 mg C m \u22122 day \u22121 ) to the deep ocean. Accurate carbon flux estimates are essential to inform climate policy and mitigation strategies, and models that include vertical migration will overestimate carbon export if this seasonality is not captured.",

In this study, we found that the transcription factor Casz1 is crucial for early IHC fate consolidation and for OHC survival during mouse development. Loss of Casz1 resulted in transdifferentiation of IHCs into OHCs, without affecting OHC production. However, long-term OHC survival was compromised in Casz1 mutant mice. In addition, the transcription factor Gata3 was down-regulated in Casz1 -deleted IHCs, and overexpressing Gata3 partially rescued IHC properties, OHC numbers, and hearing in Casz1 -deleted mice. Thus, Casz1 plays critical roles in early IHC fate stabilization and OHC survival and could potentially provide a lead for therapies aimed at regenerating both IHCs and OHCs.",

We demonstrate that a single G4 in the leading strand template is sufficient to stall replisomes by arresting the CMG helicase. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of stalled yeast and human CMG complexes reveal that the folded G4 is lodged inside the central CMG channel, arresting translocation. The G4 stabilizes the CMG at distinct translocation intermediates, suggesting an unprecedented helical inchworm mechanism for DNA translocation.

This revealed that effective apoplastic blockage in the endodermis is important for root-to-shoot signals underlying nodulation. Our findings further revealed that in nodules, the genetic machinery for Casparian strip formation is shared with roots. Apoplastic blockage controls the metabolic source-sink status required for nitrogen fixation.

    "abstract": "Despite advances in theory and experiments, how biodiversity influences the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems remains debated. By applying new theory to data on 84,695 plant, animal, and protist assemblages, we show that the general positive effect of species richness on stocks of biomass, as well as much of the variation in the strength and sign of this effect, is predicted by a fundamental macroecological quantity: the scaling of species abundance with body mass. Standing biomass increases with richness when large-bodied species are numerically rare but is independent of richness when species size and abundance are uncoupled. These results suggest a new fundamental law in the structure of ecological communities and show that the impacts of changes in species richness on biomass are predictable.",

We present a method that capitalizes on the rich genealogical information encoded in genomic tree sequences to infer the geographic locations of the shared ancestors of a sample of sequenced individuals. We used this method to infer the geographic history of genetic ancestry of a set of human genomes sampled from Europe, Asia, and Africa, accurately recovering major population movements on those continents. Our findings demonstrate the importance of defining the spatiotemporal context of genetic ancestry when describing human genetic variation and caution against the oversimplified interpretations of genetic data prevalent in contemporary discussions of race and ancestry.",

To address this gap, we developed a collection of bat organoid models spanning five species and four organ types. This multispecies, multiorgan organoid panel showed species- and tissue-specific replication patterns for several viruses, offering robust pathophysiological models for studying respiratory, renal, and enteric zoonotic viruses. Using this platform, we successfully isolated and characterized bat-borne mammalian orthoreoviruses and paramyxoviruses, demonstrating the utility of these organoid panels for virome surveillance. Furthermore, we successfully tested known antiviral drugs for their efficacy against bat virus isolates.",

BRAF regulation, involving monomeric autoinhibition and activation by dimerization, has been intensely scrutinized, but mechanisms enabling oncogenic mutants to evade regulation remain unclear. By using cryo\u2013electron microscopy, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, including the common V600E variant. These mutations disrupted wild-type BRAF's autoinhibited state, mediated by interactions between the cysteine-rich domain and kinase domain, thereby shifting the kinase domain into a preactivated conformation. This structural change likely results from helix \u03b1C displacement. PLX8394, a BRAF inhibitor that stabilizes helix \u03b1C in an inactive conformation, restored the autoinhibited conformation of oncogenic BRAF, explaining the properties of this class of compounds.",

    "abstract": "Glaciers adapt slowly to changing climatic conditions, with long-term implications for sea-level rise and water supply. Using eight glacier models, we simulated global glacier evolution over multicentennial timescales, allowing glaciers to equilibrate with climate under various constant global temperature scenarios. We estimate that glaciers globally will lose 39 (range, 15 to 55)% of their mass relative to 2020, corresponding to a global mean sea-level rise of 113 (range, 43 to 204) mm even if temperatures stabilized at present-day conditions. Under the +1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement goal, more than twice as much global glacier mass remains at equilibration (53% versus 24%) compared with the warming level resulting from current policies (+2.7\u00b0C by 2100 above preindustrial). Our findings stress the need for stringent mitigation policies to ensure the long-term preservation of glaciers.",

Depletion in the copy number of the plasmid-encoded virulence gene pla occurred in later-dated strains of the first and second pandemics, yet the biological relevance of the pla deletion has been difficult to test. We identified modern Y. pestis strains that independently acquired the same pla depletion as ancient strains and herein show that excision of pla from the multicopy pPCP1 plasmid is accompanied by the integration of a separate full pPCP1 harboring pla into the single-copy pCD1 plasmid, reducing pla dosage. Moreover, we demonstrate that this depletion decreases the mortality of mice in models of bubonic plague but not in the pneumonic and septicemic forms of the disease. We hypothesize that pla depletion may have been selectively advantageous in bubonic plague, owing to rodent fragmentation after pandemic-induced mortality.",

Most investment focused on reactive law enforcement\u2014rangers, tracking dogs, access controls, and detection cameras\u2014which helped achieve >700 poacher arrests. Yet we found no statistical evidence that these interventions reduced poaching (horn demand, wealth inequality, embedded criminal syndicates, and corruption likely combine to drive even high-risk poaching). By contrast, reducing poacher reward through dehorning (2284 rhinos across eight reserves) achieved large (~78%) and abrupt reductions in poaching using 1.2% of the budget. Some poaching of dehorned rhinos continued because poachers targeted horn stumps and regrowth, signaling the need for regular dehorning alongside judicious use of law enforcement.",

Using mouse random germline mutagenesis, we identified two missense mutations in G protein\u2013coupled receptor 45 (Gpr45) that lead to obesity through hyperphagia. GPR45 was expressed in paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), where it localized to cilia and recruited G\u03b1 s to increase ciliary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) via ADCY3. GPR45 colocalized with MC4R in PVH cilia and promoted ciliary MC4R activation. Loss of GPR45 in the PVH or MC4R + neurons caused obesity. These findings establish GPR45 as a key regulator of the ciliary melanocortin system, bridging MC4R and ADCY3.",

Moreover, considerable variability was observed in associations between taurine and age-related changes in health outcomes pertaining to gross motor function and energy homeostasis. Our results suggest that changes in circulating taurine are not a universal feature of aging and that its pleiotropic effects may be dependent on the temporal and physiological context of each individual.",

A long-held structure-property relationship is that centrosymmetric crystals cannot differentially absorb circularly polarized light. In this study, we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and characterization of the centrosymmetric material Li 2 Co 3 (SeO 3 ) 4 , which violates this relationship not by defying symmetry-imposed selection rules but by invoking a photophysical process not previously characterized for crystalline solids. This process originates from an interference between linear dichroism and linear birefringence, referred to as LD-LB, and involves strong chiroptical signals that invert upon sample flipping. In addition to enabling a chiroptical response under centrosymmetry, this process opens up photonic engineering opportunities based on crystalline solids.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal inversions can contribute to adaptive speciation by linking coadapted alleles. By querying 1375 genomes of the species-rich Malawi cichlid fish radiation, we discovered five large inversions segregating in the benthic subradiation that each suppress recombination over more than half a chromosome. Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagic Diplotaxodon through admixture, whereas the others established early in the deep benthic clade. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage, and a notable excess of protein changing substitutions points toward selection on neurosensory, physiological, and reproductive genes. These results indicate that repeated interplay between depth adaptation and sex-specific selection on large inversions has been central to the evolution of this iconic system.",

    "abstract": "Random unitaries are central to quantum technologies and the study of complex quantum many-body physics. However, existing protocols for generating random unitaries require long evolution times and deep circuits. In this work, we prove that local quantum circuits can form random unitaries in extremely low depth on any geometry. These shallow circuits have low complexity and create only short-range correlations, yet are indistinguishable from random unitaries with exponential complexity. This finding contrasts sharply with classical systems, in which a long evolution time is required to appear random. Our results have widespread applications across quantum science, from device benchmarking to quantum advantages. Moreover, they reveal that fundamental physical properties\u2014including evolution time, causal structure, and phases of matter\u2014are provably hard to learn.",

Its monoallelic mutation causes CSF1R-associated microgliopathy (CAMP), a major form of adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) and a fatal neurological disease without clinical cure. We developed mouse models harboring human hotspot mutations of CAMP and replaced CSF1R-deficient microglia with CSF1R-normal cells through microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT), which attenuated pathology in mice. We further demonstrated that, in the context of CSF1R deficiency, traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) in ALSP functions similarly to Mr BMT, efficiently replacing microglia and reducing disease progression. We then replaced CSF1R-deficient microglia in eight patients by tBMT. The disease progression was halted during the 24-month follow-up. Together, microglia replacement corrects pathogenic mutations and halts disease progression in mice and humans.",

Mitochondria harbor a host of intrinsic antioxidant defenses, but the contribution of extrinsic, nonmitochondrial antioxidant mechanisms is less well understood. We found a direct role for peroxisomes in maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis through contact-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer. We found that ACBD5 and PTPIP51 form a contact between peroxisomes and mitochondria. The percentage of these contacts increased during mitochondrial oxidative stress and helped to maintain mitochondrial health through the transfer of mitochondrial ROS to the peroxisome lumen. Our findings reveal a multiorganelle layer of mitochondrial antioxidant defense\u2014suggesting a direct mechanism by which peroxisomes contribute to mitochondrial health\u2014and broaden the scope of known membrane contact site functions.",

We use the global Android smartphone network to develop an earthquake detection capability, an alert delivery system, and a user feedback framework. Over 3 years of operation, the system detected an average of 312 earthquakes per month with magnitudes from M 1.9 to M 7.8 in T\u00fcrkiye. Alerts were delivered in 98 countries for earthquakes with M \u22654.5, corresponding to ~60 events and 18 million alerts per month. User feedback shows that 85% of people receiving an alert felt shaking, and 36, 28, and 23% received the alert before, during, and after shaking, respectively. We show how smartphone-based earthquake detection algorithms can be implemented at scale and improved through postevent analysis.",

We used RFdiffusion to design pMHCI-binding proteins that make extensive contacts with the peptide and identified specific binders for 11 target pMHCs starting from either experimental or predicted pMHCI structures. Upon incorporation into chimeric antigen receptors, designs for eight targets conferred peptide-specific T cell activation.

The structure of the TCRm-pMHC complex at 2.05-\u00c5 resolution revealed a rigid TCR-like docking mode with an unusual degree of focus on the up-facing NY-ESO-1 side chains, suggesting the potential for reduced off-target reactivity. Indeed, a structure-informed in silico screen of 14,363 HLA-A*02 peptides correctly predicted two off-target peptides, yet our TCRm maintained peptide selectivity and cytotoxicity as a T cell engager.

In this study, we report the synthesis of a catenane enabled by a molecular motor that winds molecular strands into discrete entangled structures, each defined by a specific number of mechanical crossings. Light energy drives unidirectional motor rotation, enabling path-dependent control over a sequence of thermodynamically disfavored yet mechanically distinct and kinetically stable winding states, which are covalently captured and subsequently released to yield a catenane. This machine-directed approach offers a general proof-of-concept strategy for the template-free construction of mechanically interlocked molecules.",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites are highly divergent from model eukaryotes. Large-scale genome engineering methods effective in model organisms are frequently inapplicable, and systematic studies of gene function are few. We generated more than 175,000 transposon insertions in the Plasmodium knowlesi genome, averaging an insertion every 138 base pairs, and used this \u201csupersaturation\u201d mutagenesis to score essentiality for 98% of genes. The density of mutations allowed mapping of putative essential domains within genes, providing a completely new level of genome annotation for any Plasmodium species. Although gene essentiality was largely conserved across P. knowlesi , Plasmodium falciparum , and rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei , a large number of shared genes are differentially essential, revealing species-specific adaptations. Our results indicated that Plasmodium essential gene evolution was conditionally linked to adaptive rewiring of metabolic networks for different hosts.",

Twelve years of university field trial and farm survey data from 10 US Corn Belt states indicate that maize hybrids expressing toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt maize) exhibited declining protection from rootworm feeding with increased planting while pest pressures simultaneously decreased. The analysis revealed a tendency to overplant Bt maize, leading to substantial economic losses; this was particularly striking in eastern Corn Belt states. Our findings highlight the need to go beyond the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d perspective to protect sustainable use of Bt and other crop biotechnology resources.

Generally, oxygen is cognitively imperceptible to mammals that instead sense rising carbon dioxide as a proxy for low oxygen. Not perceiving oxygen, however, is risky for diving mammals. We argue that any ability to alter dives based upon direct perception of oxygen should have been strongly selected for. We exposed diving seals to inhaled gas mixes that were experimentally altered to affect circulating levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Dive duration was positively correlated with circulating oxygen levels but unaffected by carbon dioxide levels and pH. These results suggest that seals do cognitively perceive circulating oxygen and use this to alter dive behavior.",

Combining lysosomal proteomics with functional genomic datasets, we identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP; formerly phospholipase B domain\u2013containing 1) as the hydrolase most tightly associated with elevated endocytosis. Untargeted metabolomics and biochemical reconstitution demonstrated that LyLAP is a processive monoaminopeptidase with preference for amino-terminal leucine. This activity was necessary and sufficient for the breakdown of hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP was up-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which relies on macropinocytosis for nutrient uptake. In PDA cells, LyLAP ablation led to the buildup of undigested hydrophobic peptides, lysosomal membrane damage, and growth inhibition. Thus, LyLAP enables lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins and protects lysosomal integrity in highly endocytic cancer cells.",

By using deep learning on 31,115 dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans from UK Biobank, we identified 180 loci associated with seven highly heritable pelvic phenotypes. Birth canal phenotypes showed sex-specific genetic architecture, aligning with reproductive function. Larger birth canals were linked to slower walking pace and reduced back pain but increased hip osteoarthritis risk, whereas narrower birth canals were associated with reduced pelvic floor disorder risk but increased obstructed labor risk. Lastly, genetic correlation between birth canal and head widths provides evidence of coevolution between the human pelvis and brain, partially mitigating the dilemma.",

Although translation- and transcription-related genes often cluster near the origin of replication, the extent of positional biases across gene families remains unclear. We hypothesized that natural selection broadly favors specific chromosomal positions to optimize growth rate\u2013dependent expression. Analyzing 910 bacterial species and proteomics data from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis , we found that about two-thirds of bacterial gene families are positionally biased. Natural selection drives genes mainly toward the origin or terminus of replication, with the strongest selection in fast-growing species. Our findings reveal chromosomal positioning as a fundamental mechanism for coordinating gene expression with growth rate, highlighting evolutionary constraints on bacterial genome architecture.",

Glycosyrin inhibits the plant-secreted \u03b2-galactosidase BGAL1, which would otherwise initiate the release of immunogenic peptides from bacterial flagellin. Here, we report the structure, biosynthesis, and multifunctional roles of glycosyrin. High-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy and chemical synthesis revealed that glycosyrin is an iminosugar with a five-membered pyrrolidine ring and a hydrated aldehyde that mimics monosaccharides. Glycosyrin biosynthesis was controlled by virulence regulators, and its production is common in bacteria and prevents flagellin recognition and alters the extracellular glycoproteome and metabolome of infected plants. These findings highlight a potentially wider role for glycobiology manipulation by plant pathogens across the plant kingdom.",

Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion.

By tuning the lattice confinement and applying imaging spectroscopy, we map out favorable atomic coherence regimes. We transition through various interaction regimes and observe coherent superexchange, tunable through on-site interaction and site-to-site energy shift, affecting the Ramsey fringe contrast over timescales >1 second.

Our new material challenges this interpretation. We propose taphonomic explanations for apparent molluscan features and instead identify prominent anatomical similarities to coeval chancelloriids from nearby strata. Our reinterpretation of Shishania as an early-diverging chancelloriid helps to consolidate a model for the early evolution of this enduringly problematic group of sponge-like metazoans.",

By contrast, the skyrmion formation mechanism in centrosymmetric materials remains elusive. Here, we reveal the intrinsic electronic structure of the centrosymmetric GdRu 2 Si 2 by selectively measuring magnetic domains using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We found robust Fermi surface (FS) nesting, consistent with the magnetic modulation q -vector detected by the previous resonant x-ray scattering measurements. The pseudogap opens at the nested FS portions, which vary for different magnetic domains. The anomalous pseudogap disconnects the FS to generate Fermi arcs with twofold symmetry. These results indicate that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction plays a decisive role in generating the screw spin modulation responsible for the skyrmion formation in GdRu 2 Si 2 . Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexible nature of magnetism in GdRu 2 Si 2 by manipulating magnetic domains with magnetic field and temperature cyclings, providing potential future applications for data storage and processing devices.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) involves the recognition of preexisting modifications by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which recruits the methyltransferase suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1) to methylate the adjacent newly incorporated histones, establishing a positive feedback loop. However, how this positive feedback is restricted to maintain H3K9me3 homeostasis remains largely unknown. We performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5 ASB7 E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3. ASB7 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 and promotes SUV39H1 degradation. During mitosis, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylates ASB7, preventing its interaction with SUV39H1, leading to SUV39H1 stabilization and H3K9me3 restoration. Our findings reveal a dynamic circuit involving HP1, SUV39H1, and ASB7 that governs H3K9me3 homeostasis, ensuring faithful epigenetic inheritance and preventing excessive heterochromatin formation.",

We developed knock-in mouse models representing distinct classes of FOXA1 mutations. Histopathological and multiomic analyses of prostate tissues and organoids revealed that Class 1 mutations, in conjunction with p53 inactivation, drive androgen-dependent adenocarcinomas through coactivation of mTORC1/2 and oncogenic AR signaling stemming from chimeric AR-half enhancers. By contrast, Class 2 mutations induce intraluminal plasticity by reprogramming differentiated luminal cells into a progenitor-like state through activation of KLF5 and AP-1 neo-enhancer circuitries, which enables enhanced survival and proliferation even under castrate androgen levels. Our findings establish FOXA1 as a multifaceted oncogene, with distinct mutational classes divergently evolving to drive prostate tumorigenesis or therapy-resistant progression.",

We report an assemblage of 35 wooden implements from the site of Gantangqing in southwestern China, which was found associated with stone tools, antler billets (soft hammers), and cut-marked bones and is dated from ~361,000 to ~250,000 years at a 95% confidence interval. The wooden implements include digging sticks and small, complete, hand-held pointed tools. The sophistication of many of these tools offsets the seemingly \u201cprimitive\u201d aspects of stone tool assemblages in the East Asian Early Paleolithic. This discovery suggests that wooden implements might have played an important role in hominin survival and adaptation in Middle Pleistocene East Asia.",

This extensive sequence divergence makes comparative analyses between centromeres challenging. In this study, we identified a chromosome-specific architectural pattern across the human genome, defined by the conserved spacing of a functionally relevant centromeric DNA motif. The distribution of these sites along chromosome arms constitutes the human \u201ccenteny map.\u201d By using a custom Genomic Centromere Profiling (GCP) pipeline, we leveraged the motif\u2019s position, orientation, and organization to construct structural models that enable reclassification of human chromosomal clusters, detection of centromere expansion, and identification of structural variants and misassembled regions. The high-resolution maps derived from this pattern not only provide a framework for comparative analysis of centromeres across evolution and disease but also offer a new dimension for chromosome annotation, assembly, and characterization.",

    "abstract": "Climate and ecosystem dynamics vary across timescales, but research into climate-driven vegetation dynamics usually focuses on singular timescales. We developed a spectral analysis\u2013based approach that provides detailed estimates of the timescales at which vegetation tracks climate change, from 10 1 to 10 5 years. We report dynamic similarity of vegetation and climate even at centennial frequencies (149 \u22121 to 18,012 \u22121 year \u22121 , that is, one cycle per 149 to 18,012 years). A breakpoint in vegetation turnover (797 \u22121 year \u22121 ) matches a breakpoint between stochastic and autocorrelated climate processes, suggesting that ecological dynamics are governed by climate across these frequencies. Heightened vegetation turnover at millennial frequencies (4650 \u22121 year \u22121 ) highlights the risk of abrupt responses to climate change, whereas vegetation-climate decoupling at frequencies >149 \u22121 year \u22121 may indicate long-lasting consequences of anthropogenic climate change for ecosystem function and biodiversity.",

This Fe-catalyzed method harnesses \u03b1-Cl radicals and couples an exceptionally wide array of carbenes in (2+1) cyclopropanations and \u03c3-bond insertions. This mild, robust, and electronically tunable synthetic method facilitated the development of a better classification system for catalytic metal carbenes (validated by both kinetic and thermodynamic quantification), as well as a carbene \u201cclick-like\u201d reaction and aqueous adaptation for chemical biology applications.",

Analysis of 700,000 cells identified diverse excitatory and inhibitory neurons patterned along the developmental axes of the neural tube. Patterning neural progenitors prior to TF overexpression expanded neuronal diversity by enabling access to regulons active in primary tissue counterparts.

This sample geometry allows not only efficient detection but also electrical control of the antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe 2 electrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic resonance enables detailed studies of the physics governing these high-frequency dynamics.",

We describe a general approach for designing proteins that bind intrinsically disordered protein regions in diverse extended conformations with side chains fitting into complementary binding pockets. We used the approach to design binders for 39 highly diverse unstructured targets, including polar targets, and obtained designs with 100-picomolar to 100-nanomolar affinities in 34 cases, testing ~22 designs per target. The designs function in cells and as detection reagents and are specific for their intended targets in all-by-all binding experiments.

We identified several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria and Streptomyces . Although these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, substantially influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.",

    "abstract": "Pelage coloration, which serves numerous functions, is crucial to the evolution of behavior, physiology, and habitat preferences of mammals. However, little is known about the coloration of Mesozoic mammaliaforms that coevolved with dinosaurs. In this study, we used a dataset of melanosome (melanin-containing organelle) morphology and quantitatively measured hair colors from 116 extant mammals to reliably reconstruct the coloration of six Mesozoic mammaliaforms, including a previously undescribed euharamiyidan. Unlike the highly diverse melanosomes discovered in feathered dinosaurs, hairs in six mammaliaforms of different lineages and diverse ecomorphotypes showed uniform melanosome geometry, corresponding to dark-brown coloration consistent with crypsis and nocturnality. Our results suggest that the melanosome variation and color expansion seen in extant mammals may have occurred during their rapid radiation and diversification after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.",

    "abstract": "Most phenotype-associated genetic variants map to noncoding regulatory regions of the human genome, but their mechanisms remain elusive in most cases. We developed a highly efficient strategy, Perturb-multiome, to simultaneously profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single cells with CRISPR-mediated perturbation of master transcription factors (TFs). We examined the connection between TFs, accessible regions, and gene expression across the genome throughout hematopoietic differentiation. We discovered that variants within TF-sensitive accessible chromatin regions in erythroid differentiation, although representing <0.3% of the genome, show a ~100-fold enrichment for blood cell phenotype heritability, which is substantially higher than that for other accessible chromatin regions. Our approach facilitates large-scale mechanistic understanding of phenotype-associated genetic variants by connecting key cis-regulatory elements and their target genes within gene regulatory networks.",

We introduce fiber-optic geodesy, leveraging low-frequency distributed acoustic sensing (LFDAS) recordings along a telecommunication fiber-optic cable, to track dike intrusions near Grindav\u00edk, Iceland, on a minute timescale. LFDAS revealed distinct strain responses from nine intrusive events, six resulting in fissure eruptions. Geodetic inversion of LFDAS strain reveals detailed magmatic intrusions, with inferred dike volume rate peaking systematically 15 to 22 min before the onset of each eruption. Our results demonstrate DAS\u2019s potential for a dense strainmeter array, enabling high-resolution, nearly real-time imaging of subsurface quasistatic deformations. In active volcanic regions, LFDAS recordings can offer critical insights into magmatic evolution, eruption forecasting, and hazard assessment.",

Supported by nuclear magnetic resonance studies, AXRPD unambiguously determines the crystallographic organization of aluminum pairs, recognized spectroscopically as \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 sites, linking their distribution to superior catalytic activity in propene oligomerization.

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic defense-associated reverse transcriptases (DRTs) were recently identified with antiviral functions; however, their functional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here we show that DRT9 forms a hexameric complex with its upstream noncoding RNA (ncRNA) to mediate antiphage defense by inducing cell growth arrest through abortive infection. Upon phage infection, the phage-encoded ribonucleotide reductase NrdAB complex increases intracellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate levels, activating DRT9 to synthesize long, polyadenylate [poly(A)]\u2013rich single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), which likely sequesters the essential phage single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein and disrupts phage propagation. We further determined the cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of the DRT9-ncRNA hexamer complex, providing mechanistic insights into its cDNA synthesis. These findings highlight the diversity of RT-based antiviral defense mechanisms, expand our understanding of RT biological functions, and provide a structural basis for developing DRT9-based biotechnological tools.",

    "abstract": "During tissue formation, dynamic cell shape changes drive morphogenesis while asymmetric divisions create cellular diversity. We found that the shifts in cell morphology that shape tissues could concomitantly act as conserved instructive cues that trigger asymmetric division and direct core identity decisions underpinning tissue building. We performed single-cell morphometric analyses of endothelial and other mesenchymal-like cells. Distinct morphological changes switched cells to an \u201cisomorphic\u201d mode of division, which preserved pre-mitotic morphology throughout mitosis. In isomorphic divisions, interphase morphology appeared to provide a geometric code defining mitotic symmetry, fate determinant partitioning, and daughter state. Rab4-positive endosomes recognized this code, allowing them to respond to pre-mitotic morphology and segregate determinants accordingly. Thus, morphogenetic shape change sculpts tissue form while also generating cellular heterogeneity, thereby driving tissue assembly.",

In this work, we show that this competitive cancellation is essential for understanding computation in the cerebellum. In marmosets, we identified a vector for each Purkinje cell (P cell) along which its spikes displaced the eyes. Two spikes in two different P cells produced superposition of their vectors. In the resulting population activity, the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. Mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands and the goal of the movement. Molecular layer interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P cell population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped.",

The companion star has 1.0 to 1.6 solar masses, eclipses the pulsar for about 17% of the orbit, and is undetected at other wavelengths, so it is most likely a stripped helium star. We interpret this system as having recently undergone a common envelope phase, producing a compact binary.",

However, the extent to which these turf algae alter the surrounding chemical environment or affect the rebound potential of kelp forests (through chemically mediated interactions) remains unknown. Here, we used underwater visual surveys, comprehensive chemical profiling, and laboratory experiments to reveal that turf algae release bioactive compounds into the water that fundamentally alter the reef \u201cchemical landscape\u201d and directly suppress kelp recruitment. Therefore, our study reveals that chemical ecology is critical in shaping modern kelp forest ecosystems and their resilience. Further, it demonstrates that reversing climate-driven state shifts will require not only curbing global carbon emissions but also implementing targeted local interventions that break harmful ecological feedback loops and foster recovery.",

We estimated the divergence from its closest tick-borne relative to 6000 to 4000 years ago, which suggests an emergence coinciding with human lifestyle changes such as the advent of wool-based textiles. Pan-genome analysis indicated that much of the evolution characteristic of B. recurrentis had occurred by ~2300 years ago, though further gene turnover, particularly in plasmid partitioning, persisted until ~1000 years ago.

However, the recent discovery of a second pathogen causing leprosy, M. lepromatosis , mainly found in the Americas, challenges this view. Here, we show that M. lepromatosis infected humans in the Americas before European contact. By screening 389 ancient and 408 contemporary samples, we have expanded the genetic data available for the species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed distinct human-infecting clades of M. lepromatosis , with one dominating North America since colonial times. The presence of millennia-old strains in North and South America indicates that M. lepromatosis may have been widespread during the Late Holocene, demonstrating that M. lepromatosis leprosy has a long-standing history in the Americas before European arrival.",

We assembled a multi-taxa tracking dataset (11 million geopositions from 15,845 tracked individuals across 121 species) to provide a global assessment of space use of highly mobile marine megafauna, showing that 63% of the area that they cover is used 80% of the time as important migratory corridors or residence areas. The GBF 30% threshold (Target 3) will be insufficient for marine megafauna\u2019s effective conservation, leaving important areas exposed to major anthropogenic threats. Coupling area protection with mitigation strategies (e.g., fishing regulation, wildlife-traffic separation) will be essential to reach international goals and conserve biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are prevalent DNA structures that regulate transcription but also threaten genome stability. How G4 dynamics are controlled remains poorly understood. Here, we report that RNA transcripts govern G4 landscapes through coordinated G-loop assembly and disassembly. G-loop assembly involves activation of the ATM and ATR kinases, followed by homology-directed invasion of RNA opposite the G4 strand mediated by BRCA2 and RAD51. Disassembly of the G-loop resolves the G4 structure through DHX36-FANCJ\u2013mediated G4 unwinding, which triggers nucleolytic incision and subsequent hybrid strand renewal by DNA synthesis. Inhibition of G-loop disassembly causes global G4 and R-loop accumulation, leading to transcriptome dysregulation, replication stress, and genome instability. These findings establish an intricate G-loop assembly-disassembly mechanism that controls G4 landscapes and is essential for cellular homeostasis and survival.",

Decades of effort have repeatedly updated nitrogen fixation estimates for terrestrial and open ocean systems, yet other aquatic systems in between have largely been ignored. Here we present an evaluation of nitrogen fixation for inland and coastal waters. We demonstrate that water column and sediment nitrogen fixation is ubiquitous across these diverse aquatic habitats, with rates ranging six orders of magnitude. We conservatively estimate that, despite accounting for less than 10% of the global surface area, inland and coastal aquatic systems fix 40 (30 to 54) teragrams of nitrogen per year, equivalent to 15% of the nitrogen fixed on land and in the open ocean. Inland systems contribute more than half of this biological nitrogen fixation.",

Although plastic bag bans and taxes are increasingly implemented worldwide, their effectiveness in reducing plastic litter remains unknown. Leveraging the patchwork of bag policies across different geographic scales in the United States and citizen science data on 45,067 shoreline cleanups, we assess the impact of these policies on plastic bag litter. We find that plastic bag policies lead to a 25 to 47% decrease in plastic bags as a share of total items collected at cleanups relative to areas without policies, with taxes possibly further reducing shoreline litter. At a time when many jurisdictions are considering bag policies, while others are preemptively prohibiting them, our study provides evidence that they mitigate shoreline plastic pollution.",

    "abstract": "Mammals display prominent diversity in the ability to regenerate damaged ear pinna, but the genetic changes underlying the failure of regeneration remain elusive. We performed comparative single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses of rabbits and mice recovering from pinna damage. Insufficient retinoic acid (RA) production, caused by the deficiency of rate-limiting enzyme Aldh1a2 and boosted RA degradation, was responsible for the failure of mouse pinna regeneration. Switching on Aldh1a2 or RA supplementation reactivated regeneration. Evolutionary inactivation of multiple Aldh1a2-linked regulatory elements accounted for the deficient Aldh1a2 expression upon injury in mice and rats. Furthermore, the activation of Aldh1a2 by a single rabbit enhancer was sufficient to improve ear pinna regeneration in transgenic mice. Our study identified a genetic switch involved in the evolution of regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Marine protected areas (MPAs) are expanding worldwide, but industrial fishing within their boundaries remains poorly understood. By combining vessel Global Positioning System data with satellite imagery, we detected industrial fishing in 47% of coastal MPAs worldwide between 2022 and 2024, with two-thirds of vessel detections (67%) untracked by public monitoring. These untracked vessels were most prevalent (80%) in MPAs with the most restrictive management category, which aims to prohibit all extractive activities. The presence and density of fishing vessels were mainly driven by the size and remoteness of MPAs rather than their management category itself. Including untracked vessels increased estimated fishing effort within MPAs by 28%, to an average of 4 hours per square kilometer per year. These results highlight the continued presence of industrial fishing vessels in MPAs and an important gap in our understanding of fishing pressure on protected areas worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Key actors of mammalian immunity originated from bacterial antiphage systems. The full extent of immune system conservation between bacteria and eukaryotes is unknown. Here, we show that the silent information regulator 2 (SIR2) protein domain, present in antiphage systems, plays a role in eukaryotic innate immunity. We identified SIRal, a human protein with a SIRim domain (subtype of SIR2) that plays a pivotal role in the animal Toll-like receptor pathway of innate immunity and protects against bacterial and viral infections. Proteins containing a SIRim domain are found across 19% of eukaryotic genomes, including zebrafish, where SIRal plays a role in inflammation. This work opens up avenues of research on the immune role of eukaryotic SIRim proteins as well as on the involvement of SIRal in human pathology.",

To understand the origin of these hallmarks, we studied the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome in the brain of short-lived killifish.

These findings uncover a potential vulnerable point in the aging brain\u2019s biology\u2014the biogenesis of basic DNA and RNA binding proteins.

These advancements depend on our ability to optimize the desirable versus undesirable effects of deformation twins, which are three-dimensional (3D) microstructural domains that form under mechanical stresses. Previously only characterized through surface or thin-film measurements, we present 3D in situ characterization of deformation twinning inside an embedded grain over mesoscopic fields of view using dark-field x-ray microscopy supported by crystal plasticity finite element analysis. The results revealed the role of triple junctions on twin nucleation and the sequence and irregularity of twin growth and showed that twin-grain junctions, twin-twin junctions, and twin boundaries were the sites of localized dislocation accumulation.",

Although studies\u2014typically focusing on individual species\u2014have documented earlier morning onset of bird vocalization in light-polluted landscapes, a synthesis of light pollution effects across species, space, and season is lacking. We used a global acoustic dataset of more than 60 million detections, representing 583 diurnal bird species, to synthesize effects of light pollution on avian vocalization. On average, light pollution prolonged vocal activity by 50 min. Light pollution responses were strongest for species with large eyes, open nests, migratory habits, and large ranges and during the breeding season. Prolonged activity may confer negative, neutral, or positive fitness effects; documenting these fitness effects and curbing light pollution are challenges for 21st-century conservation.",

In this work, we performed ultrahigh-field functional magnetic resonance imaging of the lPAG in 93 participants during a placebo analgesia paradigm performed at different body locations. We found that analgesic responses are somatotopically organized in the lPAG and its descending outputs to the rostral ventromedial medulla.

To help address this controversy, we synthesized and probed 40 M 4 AlC 3 layered carbide phases containing two to nine metals and found that short-range ordering from enthalpy was present until the entropy increased enough to achieve complete disordering of the transition metals in their atomic planes. We transformed all of these layered carbide phases into two-dimensional (2D) sheets and showed the effects of the order versus disorder on their surface properties and electronic behavior. This study suggests the key effect that the competition between enthalpy and entropy has on short-range order in multicompositional materials.",

In this work, we apply Indigenous and Western scientific methods, including genomics and isotope profiling, on fossils from across Beringia to explore the effect of climate change on horses. We find that Late Pleistocene horses from Alaska and northern Yukon are related to populations from Eurasia and crossed the Bering land bridge multiple times during the last glacial interval. We also find deeply divergent lineages north and south of the American ice sheets that genetically influenced populations across Beringia and into Eurasia. As climate warmed and horses entered the ice-free corridor connecting Beringia and midcontinental America, restricted mobility and food availability impeded population growth. Our combined Western and Indigenous framework offers critical guidance for wildlife conservation amid ongoing climate change.",

We studied the functional development of vestibulo-ocular reflex circuit components in the larval zebrafish, with and without sensation. Blind fish stabilize gaze normally, and neural responses to body tilts mature before behavior. In contrast, synapses between motor neurons and the eye muscles mature with a time course similar to behavioral maturation. Larvae without vestibular sensory experience, but with mature neuromuscular junctions, had a strong vestibulo-ocular reflex. Development of the neuromuscular junction, and not sensory experience, therefore determines the rate of maturation of an ancient behavior.",

We report state-prepared and state-resolved measurements of methane scattering from a room-temperature gold surface that demonstrate total destructive interference between molecular states related by a reflection symmetry operation. High-contrast interference effects prevail for all processes investigated, including vibrationally excited and vibrationally inelastic collisions. The results demonstrate the distinctly quantum mechanical effect of discrete symmetries in molecular collision dynamics.",

The pronounced luminescence of the well-defined molecular system under the distinct carrier-envelope phase of the THz pulse revealed that sequential state-selective electron-tunneling processes to the frontier molecular orbitals promoted ultrafast exciton formation in the molecule at the STM junction. Furthermore, ultrafast control of exciton formation was achieved using phase- and delay-controlled THz pulse pairs, providing a route for the regulation of molecular dynamics and the emergence of new molecular functions.",

The DNA strands were distorted accordingly, showing one full base-pair bulge and a loss of histone contact at the site of motor binding in the adenosine diphosphate* (ADP*) and apo* (unbound) states. We also identified several important elements for regulation of the remodeling activity. Notably, an enzyme conformation exiting the remodeling cycle reveals a linker DNA\u2013sensing brake mechanism. Together, our findings elucidate a multistate model of ISWI action, providing a comprehensive mechanism of DNA translocation and regulation underpinning chromatin remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Variants in GBA1 resulting in decreased lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity are a common risk factor for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Incomplete penetrance of GBA1 variants suggests that additional genes contribute to PD and DLB manifestation. By using a pooled genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified copper metabolism MURR1 domain\u2013containing 3 (COMMD3) protein, a component of the COMMD/coiled-coil domain\u2013containing protein 22 (CCDC22)/CCDC93 (CCC) and Commander complexes, as a modifier of GCase and lysosomal activity. Loss of COMMD3 increased the release of lysosomal proteins through extracellular vesicles, leading to their impaired delivery to endolysosomes and consequent lysosomal dysfunction. Rare variants in the Commander gene family were associated with increased PD risk. Thus, COMMD genes and related complexes regulate lysosomal homeostasis and may represent modifiers in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with lysosomal dysfunction.",

Its realization requires the on-demand generation and synchronization of single electrons. In this work, we demonstrate the coherent collision of single electrons, generated by voltage pulses, in a graphene Mach-Zehnder interferometer. By measuring shot noise resulting from the collisions, we unveil fundamental characteristics of colliding electrons, highlighting the complementarity between the indistinguishable and distinguishable parts of their wave functions. The former is manifested through fermionic Hong-Ou-Mandel destructive interference, whereas the latter is discerned through double-winding Aharonov-Bohm interference in the noise. The interference visibilities of around 60% enable comprehensive quantum state tomography. Our findings may place coherent operations involving flying qubits within reach in graphene.",

However, despite their importance, the conservation of grassy ecosystems\u2014compared with that of forests\u2014has been neglected around the world, leading to a greater loss rate than forest ecosystems in many regions . Here, we examine this bias in public conservation discourse and policies that give priority to forests and neglect the conservation of grassy ecosystems worldwide.

In South America, early migrants split into four groups\u2014Amazonians, Andeans, Chaco Amerindians, and Patagonians\u2014~13,900 years ago.

At low densities, the Wigner solid forms nanocrystalline domains pinned by local disorder. It exhibits a quantum densification behavior with increased densities in the solid phase. Above a threshold density, the Wigner solid melts locally and enters a mixed phase in which solid and liquid regions coexist. The liquid regions expand and form a percolation network at even higher densities.",

These 1D-HEO nanoribbons exhibit high structural stability at elevated temperatures (to 1000\u00b0C), elevated pressures (to 12 gigapascals), and long exposure to harsh acid or base chemical environments. Moreover, they exhibit notable mechanical properties, with an excellent modulus of resilience reaching 40 megajoules per cubic meter. High-pressure experiments reveal an intriguing transformation of the 1D-HEO nanoribbons from orthorhombic to cubic structures at 15 gigapascals followed by the formation of fully amorphous HEOs above 30 gigapascals, which are recoverable to ambient conditions. These transformations introduce additional entropy (structural disorder) besides configurational entropy. This finding offers a way to create low-dimensional, resilient, and high-entropy materials.",

We further improved the prediction by using the experimental result for the hydrogen-like tin g factor, inferring from it the unknown higher-order quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects.

We show that promoter variants with predicted expression-altering consequences produce outlier expression at both the RNA and protein levels in thousands of individuals and that these variants experience strong negative selection in human populations. We observed that clinically relevant genes in patients with rare diseases are enriched for such variants and validated their functional impact through reporter assays.

Applying ExIGS to progeria-derived fibroblasts revealed that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant chromatin regulation that may erode cell identity. Lamin was found to generally repress transcription, suggesting that variation in nuclear morphology may affect gene regulation across tissues and aged cells.

These raised agricultural fields are deeply enmeshed in the broader cultural landscape, as ceremonial and other features were also found. Our results demonstrate a rich anthropogenic landscape created by small-scale ancestral Menominee communities, located near the northern limits of maize agriculture. The excellent preservation of this site is exceptional in eastern North America and suggests that the precolonial landscape was more anthropogenically influenced than currently recognized.",

The Retron-Septu system integrates retron and Septu antiphage defenses. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures reveal asymmetric nucleoprotein complexes comprising a reverse transcriptase, msDNA (a hybrid of msdDNA and msrRNA), and two PtuAB copies. msdDNA and msrRNA are essential for assembling this complex, with msrRNA adopting a conserved lariat-like structure that regulates reverse transcription. Notably, the assembled Retron-Septu complex is inactive, with msdDNA occupying the PtuA DNA binding site. Activation occurs upon disassembly, releasing PtuAB, which degrades single-stranded DNA to restrict phage replication. This \u201carrest-and-release\u201d mechanism underscores the dynamic regulatory roles of msDNA, advancing our understanding of antiphage defense strategies.",

    "abstract": "Tailoring carrier density in atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is challenging because of the inherently limited physical space for incorporating charge dopants. Here, we report that interlayer charge-transfer doping in type III van der Waals heterostructures can be greatly modulated by an external gate to realize a hyperdoping effect. Systematic gated-Hall measurements revealed that the modulated carrier density is about five times that of the gate capacitive charge, achieving an ultrahigh 2D hole density of 1.49 \u00d7 10 14 per square centimeter, far exceeding the maximum possible electrostatic doping limit imposed by typical dielectric breakdown. The highly efficient hole-doping enables high-performance p-type 2D transistors with an ultralow contact resistance of ~0.041 kilohm micrometers and a record-high ON-state current density of ~2.30 milliamperes per micrometer.",

    "abstract": "Translation termination is essential in all living organisms because it ensures that proteins have lengths strictly defined by their genes. This universal process is mediated by peptide release factors (RFs) that recognize stop codons and catalyze the hydrolysis of peptidyl transfer RNA (peptidyl-tRNA) on the ribosome, presumably by activating a water molecule. We report structures of the bacterial ribosome in complex with peptidyl-tRNA and RFs in the prepeptide release state. No hydrolytic water molecule was seen in the peptidyl transferase center. Instead, RFs induced rearrangements of the peptidyl-tRNA adenine 76 (A76) ribose pucker that orient the 2\u2032-OH for the nucleophilic attack onto the neighboring carbonyl group. These findings suggest a catalytic mechanism of RF-mediated peptide release and provide a structural basis for the universal conservation of the catalytic domain in peptide RFs.",

    "abstract": "Taste is crucial in shaping animal perception. Sourness, one of the primary tastes, is aversive in mammals, whereas many birds frequently consume acidic fruits, suggesting a potential tolerance. Our study uncovers a mechanism enabling avian sour tolerance that involves changes to the sour receptor [otopetrin 1 (OTOP1)]. We demonstrate that sour tolerance is a conserved trait in birds, with avian OTOP1 exhibiting acid-induced inhibition and OTOP1 modulation affecting sour perception and tolerance. Ancestral reconstruction reveals that the increase in acid tolerance may have evolved at the same point in the songbird phylogeny as the regain of sweet sensing in this clade. This shift might have enabled songbirds to feed on a wider range of fruits, affecting the evolution and diversification of the songbird radiation.",

The synthesized macrocycles include eight macrocyclic polyamides with 114-, 138-, and 162-atom rings, and one 114-atom ring macrocyclic polyimide.

Using satellite observations of ocean chlorophyll a (Chl) concentration, we show that the surface ocean experienced a poleward greening from 2003 to 2022. Contemporaneously, the subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere experienced a decrease in Chl. As such, the latitudinal disparity in Chl, as documented by an inequality index, has been increasing over the past two decades, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Rising water temperatures may primarily influence the Chl trends. The increasing Chl inequality\u2014marked by \u201cgreener green and bluer blue\u201d waters\u2014has the potential to cascade to higher trophic levels, with implications for the fisheries and economies of coastal nations.",

We found that the exposure data required for retrospective risk assessment were available for less than 1% of chemicals with potential environmental concern ( n \u2248 297,000). In contrast to the situation with persistent and often inorganic contaminants in the 1970s, current monitoring schemes lack control of a much larger number of organic chemicals and their degradates. Insufficient chemical and spatial coverage of monitoring, along with analytical limits being far too high to track some of the most toxic chemicals, biases risk perceptions for important chemicals.",

In this work, we describe the changing genetic and cultural landscapes of early Holocene West Anatolia using 30 new paleogenomes. We show that Neolithization in West Anatolia was a multifaceted process, characterized by the assimilation of Neolithic practices by local foragers, the influx of eastern populations, and their admixture, with their descendants subsequently establishing Neolithic Southeast Europe. We then coanalyzed genetic and cultural similarities across early Holocene Anatolian and Aegean Neolithic villages using 58 material culture elements. Cultural distances among villages correlate with their spatial distances but not with their genetic distances after controlling for geography. This suggests that cultural change was often decoupled from genetically visible mobility.",

Leading up to the earthquake, the recurrence interval for SSEs in the preslip area shortened from an average of 2 years, estimated from observations over the past 30 years, to 1 year, consistent with simulations in which the weakening of the Nankai megathrust was attributed to the cause.",

In this work, we analyze formation pore pressure records from three offshore borehole observatories at the Nankai subduction zone, Honshu, Japan, to capture detailed slip-time histories of two slow slip events (SSEs) along the outermost reaches of the plate boundary. Slip initiates ~30 kilometers landward of the trench; migrates seaward at 1 to 2 kilometers per day to within a few kilometers of, and possibly breaching, the trench; and coincides with the onset and migration of tremor and/or very-low-frequency earthquakes. The SSE source region lies in a zone of high pore fluid pressure and low stress, which provides clear observational evidence linking these factors to shallow slow earthquakes.",

    "abstract": "Current research on ferroelectric polymers centers predominantly on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)\u2013based fluoropolymers because of their superior performance. However, they are considered \u201cforever chemicals\u201d with environmental concerns. We describe a family of rationally designed fluorine-free ferroelectric polymers, featuring a polyoxypropylene main chain and disulfonyl alkyl side chains with a C3 spacer: \u2212SO 2 CH 2 CHRCH 2 SO 2 \u2212 (R = \u2212H or \u2212CH 3 ). Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate that strong dipole-dipole interactions between neighboring disulfonyl groups induce ferroelectric ordering in the condensed state, which can be tailored by changing the R group: ferroelectric for R = \u2212H or relaxor ferroelectric for R = \u2212CH 3 . At low electric fields, the relaxor polymer exhibits electroactuation and electrocaloric performance comparable with those of state-of-the-art PVDF-based tetrapolymers.",

This particular membrane forms within an electric double layer in water constructed by voltage application without supporting electrolytes\u2014in which deprotonated resorcinol and an aldehyde react three-dimensionally with a self-termination mechanism\u2014and is spontaneously released when the voltage bias is removed.

However, the multidimensional nature of social memory encompassing sexual information remains unelucidated. We found that neurons in the ventral CA1 region (vCA1) of the mouse hippocampus encoded the identities and social properties, specifically sex and strain, of familiar conspecifics by using both rate and theta-based temporal coding. Optogenetic reactivation of social memories of females, but not males, induced place preference. Ablation of the upstream hippocampal dorsal CA2 region or the medial amygdala disrupted the representation of sex and the sexual dichotomy of social memory valence. Thus, vCA1 neurons use dual coding schemes to represent the identities and social properties of familiar conspecifics as a cohesive memory.",

In this study, we probed channel-pattern origins by mapping thread dynamics along 84 rivers from 36 years of global satellite imagery using particle image velocimetry. Results show that single-thread channels originate from a balance between lateral erosion and accretion, which enables a thread to migrate while maintaining equilibrium width. In contrast, multithread channels originate from imbalance\u2014erosion outpaces accretion in individual threads, causing threads to repeatedly widen and split. Thread-width imbalance provides a mechanistic explanation for how multithread channels develop on Earth and other planets and, in application, can help lower the cost of nature-based river restoration projects.",

Our findings also reveal that superior residual neuromuscular function can enable prosthetic movement speeds surpassing that of intact physiology.

However, the Schottky gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. We used a ferroic HfO 2 - ZrO 2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway for improved performance in transistors based on 2DEG.",

Here, we showed that tRNA-Asp-GTC-3\u2032tDR, a hypoxia-induced tDR derived from the 3\u2032 end of tRNA-Asp-GTC, activated autophagic flux in kidney cells and its silencing blocked autophagic flux. Functional gain-/loss-of-function studies in murine kidney disease models demonstrated a substantial renoprotective function of tRNA-Asp-GTC-3\u2032tDR. Mechanistically, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3\u2032tDR assembled stable G-quadruplex structures and sequestered pseudouridine synthase 7 (PUS7), preventing catalytic pseudouridylation of histone mRNAs. The resulting pseudouridylation deficiency directed histone mRNAs to the autophagosome-lysosome pathway, triggering RNA autophagy. This tDR-induced RNA autophagy pathway was activated during murine and human kidney diseases, suggesting clinical relevance. Thus, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3\u2032tDR plays a role in regulating RNA autophagy, which helps to maintain homeostasis in kidney cells and protects against kidney injury.",

Such a synthesis gap is exemplified by pyridine and pyridazine. Pyridine (a six-membered C 5 N ring) has risen to prominence in discovery chemistry, its ease of assembly spurring further synthetic development. Despite a host of favorable properties, pyridazine (an analogous C 4 N 2 ring) has comparatively lagged behind\u2014a discrepancy attributable to its often-challenging preparation, which arises from an electronically dissonant heteroatom arrangement. In this work, we achieve a single-atom skeletal edit that produces pyridazines from pyridines by direct carbon-to-nitrogen atom replacement: Azide introduction at the ortho position enables a photoinitiated rearrangement of N -amino-2-azidopyridinium cations. This transformation links the two heterocycles such that the richness of pyridine retrosynthesis becomes available to pyridazines.",

We find that recent changes in primates are associated with immune barrier function and lipid and xenobiotic metabolism and that human-specific genetic features affect these functions. Enhancer assays, genetic deletion, and in silico mutagenesis resolve evolutionarily important enhancers of lactase ( LCT ) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 ( IGFBP2 ).

We report carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from fossil cercopithecid monkeys and integrate the data into a view of hominin dietary evolution, finding that changes in graminivorous behavior preceded corresponding changes in dental morphology by ~700,000 years. Decoupling diets and morphologies in time was conducive to determining when and to exploring why dietary changes helped to propel human evolution.",

    "abstract": "Extreme metabolic adaptations can elucidate genetic programs that govern mammalian metabolism. Here, we used convergent evolutionary changes in hibernating lineages to define conserved cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and metabolic programs. We characterized mouse hypothalamus gene expression and chromatin dynamics across fed, fasted, and refed states and then used comparative genomics of hibernating versus nonhibernating lineages to identify cis elements with convergent changes in hibernators. Multi-omics approaches pinpointed CREs, hub genes, regulatory programs, and cell types underlying lineage divergence. Hibernators accumulated loss-of-function effects for CREs regulating hypothalamic responses, and the refeeding period after fasting served as a key phase for molecular processes with convergent evolutionary changes. This work provides a genetic framework for harnessing hibernator adaptations to understand human metabolic control.",

We capitalized on electrically driven surface acoustic waves and the extreme light concentration afforded by gap plasmons to achieve this goal. We placed gold nanoparticles in a particle-on-mirror configuration with a few-nanometer-thick, compressible polymer spacer. Surface acoustic waves were then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the gigahertz regime. We observed evidence that the surface acoustic waves produced mechanical deformations in the polymer and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics led to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning. Our approach provides a design strategy for electrically driven dynamic metasurfaces and fundamental explorations of high-frequency, polymer dynamics in ultraconfined geometries.",

Using cooperative photobiocatalysis, we developed a stereoselective three-component radical-mediated C\u2013C coupling previously unknown in both organic chemistry and biochemistry. Directed evolution of repurposed pyridoxal decarboxylases enabled full fragment variability in this three-component coupling, giving rise to six classes of valuable products, many of which were inaccessible with other methods, even in a racemic fashion. This enzymatic platform integrates a range of asymmetric catalysis principles, including remote stereocenter construction, stereodivergent catalysis, kinetic resolution, and parallel kinetic resolution, achieving excellent diastereo- and enantiocontrol over radical intermediates. The broad substrate scope and complementary specificities of evolved enzyme variants enabled combinatorial library synthesis, affording structurally and stereochemically diverse scaffolds for medicinal chemistry.",

In this work, we introduce a single-photon detection mechanism using highly photosensitive nonequilibrium electron phases in moir\u00e9 materials. Using tunable bands in bilayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride superlattices, we engineer negative differential conductance and a sensitive bistable state capable of detecting single photons. Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 micrometers) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometers) and temperatures up to 25 kelvin. This detector offers prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor compatibility and seamless integration into photonic-integrated circuits.

We found that maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG), ingested in the first week of life, restrained microbiota-dependent adaptive immune responses weeks later, after weaning. This activity was linked to maternal antibodies that could bind bacteria in the neonatal gut and the ability of microbe-IgG complexes to engage Fc and complement-dependent effector functions in offspring. Ingestion of microbiota-specific maternal IgG also limited aberrant neonatal responses to dietary antigens encountered at weaning. These discoveries suggest that maternal IgG engages the immune system of offspring in early postnatal life to tune mucosal responses and reinforce intestinal homeostasis in the face of dynamic shifts in food and bacterial antigens during development.",

Genetic rescue can boost the fitness of small populations, but perceived risks of outbreeding depression can limit its use. We quantified these trade-offs in hundreds of endangered Pacific pocket mice ( Perognathus longimembris pacificus ) by combining whole-genome sequences with fitness data. The impacts of genomic erosion in remnant populations were reversed in an admixed breeding program, suggesting the potential benefits of genetic rescue. However, differences in chromosome numbers increase the risk of genetic incompatibilities. Fitness analyses suggested that although admixed karyotypes may have reduced fertility, non-admixed mice with low heterozygosity and high genetic load had even lower fitness, pointing to a greater risk of extinction if populations remain isolated.",

However, global mitigation from forestation remains uncertain owing to varying estimates of carbon sequestration rates (notably in soil) and land availability. In this study, we developed global maps of soil carbon change that reveal carbon gains and losses with forestation, primarily in the topsoil. Constraining land availability to avoid unintended albedo-induced warming and safeguard water and biodiversity (389 million hectares available for forestation globally) would sequester 39.9 petagrams of carbon by 2050, substantially below previous estimates. This estimate drops to 12.5 petagrams of carbon with land further limited to existing policy commitments (120 million hectares). Achieving greater mitigation requires expanding dedicated forestation areas and strengthening commitments from nations with considerable but untapped potential.",

Intensive selection at GSDMC began ~4750 ya with the domestication bottleneck, leading regulatory variants to high frequency by ~4150 ya. GSDMC genotypes are linked to body conformation in horses and to spinal anatomy, motor coordination, and muscular strength in mice.

We found that cumulative impacts are projected to increase 2.2 to 2.6 times globally, with coastal habitats facing higher impacts but offshore regions facing faster increases, especially in equatorial regions. Furthermore, many countries dependent on marine resources will have large increases in impacts. Incorporating these results into strategic policy and management will support more sustainable use and protection of marine ecosystems and the services they provide.",

    "abstract": "Evidence links air pollution to dementia, yet its role in Lewy body dementia (LBD) remains unclear. In this work, we showed in a cohort of 56.5 million individuals across the United States that fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure raises LBD risk. Mechanistically, we found that PM 2.5 exposure led to brain atrophy in wild-type mice, an effect not seen in \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn)\u2013deficient mice. PM 2.5 exposure generated a highly pathogenic \u03b1Syn strain, PM 2.5 \u2013induced preformed fibril (PM-PFF), with enhanced proteinase K resistance and neurotoxicity, resembling \u03b1Syn LBD strains. PM 2.5 samples from China, the United States, and Europe consistently induced proteinase-resistant \u03b1Syn strains and in vivo pathology. Transcriptomic analyses revealed shared responses between PM 2.5 -exposed mice and LBD patients, underscoring PM 2.5 \u2019s role in LBD and stressing the need for interventions to reduce air pollution and its associated neurological disease burden.",

    "abstract": "Conventional wisdom suggests that wildfires in the western United States (WUS) degrade air quality nationwide as a result of aerosol emissions and eastward transport. However, we found that heat produced by wildfires, a commonly neglected effect, can reduce fine particle concentrations (PM 2.5 ) in the eastern United States (EUS) by an amount comparable to the increases in the WUS during the fire season. This phenomenon arises from fire heat\u2013induced convection in the WUS and subsequent downstream meteorological changes distant from fires. Enhanced wet deposition and weakened eastward transport of fire aerosols lower PM 2.5 levels in the EUS. Therefore, neglecting the effect of fire heat on PM 2.5 pollution leads to an overestimate of 1200 additional premature deaths and 3.3 billion USD in economic losses, particularly in the densely populated EUS.",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin is essential in shaping social behavior across the lifespan. Although the role of oxytocin signaling in parental care has been widely investigated, little is known about its function in social behavior during early life. We studied the role of oxytocin in mouse pup social behavior during acute separation from the mother as well as upon reunion. The activity of oxytocin neurons was increased by acute maternal separation. Behaviorally, maternally separated pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, which were further modulated by nipple attachment behavior. These effects were attenuated by blocking the oxytocin receptor during maternal separation. Optogenetic silencing of oxytocin neurons during maternal separation disrupted vocal behavior during separation and reunion. Our findings reveal an important role of oxytocin in context-dependent vocal communication in mouse pups.",

To study its evolution, especially under vector control pressure, we sequenced 656 modern specimens (collected 2014 to 2018) and 45 historic specimens (collected 1927 to 1967) from 16 African countries. Despite high genetic diversity, the species shows stable but considerable continental population structure. Although one population showed little differentiation over a century and 4000 kilometers, nearby, we found two genetically distinct ecotypes. Vector control has resulted in strong signals of selection, with some resistance alleles shared across populations through gene flow and others arising independently. Fortunately, we found that a promising gene drive target in Anopheles gambiae is highly conserved in An. funestus . These insights will enable more strategic insecticide usage and gene drive deployment, supporting malaria elimination.",

    "abstract": "The Turkana pastoralists of Kenya inhabit arid, water-limited environments and rely largely on livestock for subsistence. Working with Turkana communities, we sequenced 367 whole genomes and identified eight regions with evidence for recent positive selection. One of these regions includes a putative regulatory element for STC1 \u2014a kidney-expressed gene involved in metabolism and the response to dehydration. We show that STC1 is induced by antidiuretic hormone in human cells, is associated with urea levels in the Turkana themselves, and is under strong and recent selection in this population as well as a second East African population, the Daasanach. This work highlights how integrating anthropological and genomic approaches can lead to a new understanding of human physiology with biomedical relevance.",

Seismic wavespeeds track crustal deformation and stress changes, but typical monitoring methods are most sensitive to shallow depths. Using receiver functions, we tracked rupture-zone wavespeed and anisotropy changes throughout the crust during the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. Shallow coseismic wavespeed reductions recovered within months, whereas a deeper postseismic wavespeed drop persisted without measurable recovery over several years. The deep, persistent wavespeed drop likely reflects accumulating damage driven by postseismic deformation, suggesting two possible scenarios: (i) a slow interseismic recovery where wavespeed and anisotropy track long-term stress evolution; or (ii) permanent deformation of an immature fault zone. Both scenarios affect the dynamics and energy budget of the seismic cycle.",

In this work, we demonstrated a two-qubit controlled-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atom binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepared and measured a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 \u2212 5 + 5 % and a concurrence of 0.67 \u2212 0.05 + 0.05 . With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear spin\u2013based quantum computers.",

Rupture propagation is observable at fine scales using dense seismic networks. Fiber-optic sensing allows for long-term deployments of ultradense arrays that enable high-resolution measurements of infrequent, large earthquakes. We recorded the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7 Mendocino Fault earthquake with a nearby fiber-optic array and imaged its behavior with seismic beamforming. The rupture propagated to the east at subshear velocity; stagnated near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a zone of structural complexity; and subsequently transitioned to supershear velocity. The correlation between source physics and structure shows how lithospheric heterogeneity affects first-order characteristics of earthquake ruptures. Our results also demonstrate the potential for fiber-optic sensing to improve real-time estimation of key parameters for early warning.",

When an anyon excitation is emitted toward a quantum point contact (QPC) in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid, this memory translates into tunneling events that may occur long after the anyon excitation has exited the QPC. In this work, we used triggered anyon pulses incident on a QPC in a filling factor \u03bd = 1/3 FQH fluid to investigate anyon tunneling in the time domain. We observed that braiding increases the tunneling timescale, which is set by the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension that characterizes the edge-state dynamics. Our experiment introduces time-domain measurements for characterizing the braiding phase and scaling dimension of anyons.",

We found that Cat1 provides immunity by cleaving and depleting oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) molecules from the infected host, inducing a growth arrest that prevents viral propagation. Cat1 forms dimers that stack upon each other to generate long filaments that are maintained by bound cOA ligands, with stacked TIR domains forming the NAD + cleavage catalytic sites. Furthermore, Cat1 filaments assemble into distinct trigonal and pentagonal networks that enhance NAD + degradation. Cat1 presents an unprecedented chemistry and higher-order protein assembly for the CRISPR-Cas response.",

This Hawaiian lineage also boasts an unprecedented and macabre practice of decorating its portable larval home with the body parts of the spider prey it harvests from the web where it resides. Phylogenomic data suggest that the origin of this unique spider cohabitant is at least six million years old, more than one million years older than Hawaii\u2019s current high islands. After decades of searching, only one species has been discovered, and it is restricted to 15 square kilometers of a single mountain range on the island of O\u02bbahu, meaning that other members of the lineage have disappeared from older islands.

The biophysical properties that these polymeric scaffolds require for signal transduction are not clearly defined. Here, we engineered single-component DF signalosomes. We found that functionality depends on the stability provided by the DF polymer, which could also be achieved with a bacterial DF domain, a synthetic filament-forming domain, and amyloid-like sequences. This demonstrates the importance of polymer stability and inducibility irrespective of the motif\u2019s origin. By varying the number of included TRAF6 interaction motifs, we demonstrate that avidity is a tunable property that can control the amplitude of signaling outputs.

Using a carcinogen-induced model of LUSC with no added genetic hits or cell type bias, we found that carcinogen exposure leads to non-neutral competition among basal cells, aberrant clonal expansions, and basal cell mobilization along the airways. Ultimately, preinvasive lesions developed from a few highly mutated clones that dominate most of the bronchial tree. Multisite sequencing in human patients confirmed the presence of clonally related preinvasive lesions across distinct airway regions. Our work identifies a transition in basal cell clonal dynamics, and an associated shift in basal cell fate, as drivers of field cancerization in the lung.",

    "abstract": "Blind quantum computing is a promising application of distributed quantum systems, in which a client can perform computations on a remote server without revealing any details of the applied circuit. Although the most promising realizations of quantum computers are based on various matter-qubit platforms, implementing blind quantum computing on matter qubits remains a challenge. Using silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in nanophotonic diamond cavities with an efficient optical interface, we demonstrated a universal quantum gate set consisting of single- and two-qubit blind gates over a distributed two-node network. Using these ingredients, we performed a distributed algorithm with blind operations across our two-node network, proving a route to develop blind quantum computation with matter qubits in distributed, modular architectures.",

Of all intervention kilns, 65% adopted the improved practices. Treatment assignment reduced energy use by 10.5% ( P -value <0.001) and decreased CO 2 and PM 2.5 emissions by 171 and 0.45 metric tons, respectively, per kiln per year. Valuing the CO 2 reductions using a social cost of carbon of 185 USD per metric ton, we find that the social benefits outweigh costs by a factor of 65 to 1. The intervention, which required no new capital investment, also decreased fuel costs and increased brick quality. Our results demonstrate the potential for privately profitable, as well as publicly beneficial, improvements to address environmental problems in informal industries.",

Several of these giants have vanished within the past 130,000 years, but the timing and macroevolutionary drivers behind this pattern of rise and collapse remain unclear for some megaherbivore lineages. Using trait modeling that combines total-evidence evolutionary trees and a comprehensive size dataset, we show that sloth body mass evolved with major lifestyle shifts and that most terrestrial lineages reached their largest sizes through slower evolutionary rates compared with extant arboreal forms. Size disparity increased during the late Cenozoic climatic cooling, but paleoclimatic changes do not explain the rapid extinction of ground sloths that started approximately 15,000 years ago. Their abrupt demise suggests human-driven factors in the decline and extinction of ground sloths.",

However, early mammalian embryos lack efficient spindle assembly mechanisms, and it remains unclear how error-free chromosome segregation is achieved. In this work, we imaged early mouse embryos and identified a network of nuclear actin cables that organize prophase chromosomes at the nuclear periphery. Following nuclear envelope breakdown, the network contracts and gathers chromosomes toward the cell center. Network contraction was driven by filament disassembly in a myosin II\u2013independent manner. Additionally, we identified a network of branched actin filaments that attenuates metaphase spindle elongation. We also visualized nuclear actin in human embryos, suggesting a conserved role for actin in ensuring mitotic fidelity during early mammalian development.",

However, plants acclimate their respiratory response to temperature on longer timescales, potentially weakening the carbon-climate feedback. The magnitude of this acclimation is uncertain despite its importance for predicting future climate change. We develop an optimality-based theory dynamically linking stem respiration with leaf water supply to predict its thermal acclimation. We show that the theory accurately reproduces observations of spatial and seasonal change. We estimate the global value for current annual stem CO 2 efflux as 27.4 \u00b1 5.9 PgC. By 2100, incorporating thermal acclimation reduces projected stem respiration without considering acclimation by 24 to 46%, thus reducing land ecosystem carbon emissions.",

We mapped, validated, and dated key genes associated with seed coat color evolution ( VaPAP1 for loss of mottled black and VaANR1 for gain of red colors). The frequency increases of variants affecting key domestication syndrome substantially predated the wild-cultigen divergence. Together, our results resolve the conflict between genetic and archaeological evidence about adzuki origins and reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of archaeobotanically unobservable traits, consistent with a role of early weak selection during domestication.",

By leveraging cross-mapping and genome-wide association analysis, we identified the N terminus of the clock protein CYCLE as a major causal effector underlying embryonic diapause differences in the silk moth. We found that the nondiapause phenotype in polyvoltine strains results from a specific deletion that disrupts an alternative isoform of CYCLE. We further demonstrated that different CYCLE isoforms contribute to a functional diversity in modulating circadian rhythms and diapause, which has been preserved in Lepidoptera for at least 110 million years. Our study proposes a model that explains how adaptive phenotypes can evolve rapidly without affecting related essential functions.",

Numerous three-dimensionally preserved fossils constitute one of the most taxonomically rich Late Cretaceous avialan assemblages, including members of Hesperornithes, Ichthyornithes, and near-crown or crown birds (Neornithes), recording a previously undocumented interval in avialan evolution. Abundant perinatal fossils represent the oldest evidence of birds nesting at polar latitudes, which demonstrates that birds began using seasonal polar environments for breeding during the Cretaceous, long before their modern descendants.",

Ecological theory, supported by numerical simulations and genomics, frames NOB as opportunists exploiting a fleeting supply of oxygen. Consistent with in situ observations, simulated NOB contribute substantially to total oxygen consumption at AMZ boundaries, which implies that NOB may provide a major stabilizing feedback to AMZs. Fine-scale ocean currents increase the metabolic diversity in AMZs, which could stabilize AMZ volume under climate change.",

We present a model of the corona that evolves continuously in time, by assimilating photospheric magnetic field observations as they become available. This approach reproduces dynamical features that do not appear in time-stationary models. We used the model to predict coronal structure during the total solar eclipse of 8 April 2024 near the maximum of the solar activity cycle. There is better agreement between the model predictions and eclipse observations in coronal regions located above recently assimilated photospheric data.",

Currently, the sulfur analogs are almost exclusively prepared by de novo synthesis; the existing approach to swap carbon with sulfur is inefficient and involves stoichiometric mercury reagents. In this study, we report a two-step carbonyl-to-sulfur (CO-to-S) atom swap approach, enabled by a rationally designed N \u2032-alkyl-hydrazonamide (NAHA) reagent that promotes forming pre-aromatic intermediates twice sequentially by different mechanisms, thereby achieving homolytic cleavage of both \u03b1-C\u2212C bonds of the ketone substrates. A Ts\u2212S\u2212Ts (Ts, p -toluenesulfonyl) reagent mediates this process through successive intermolecular and intramolecular alkyl radical trapping by the central sulfur. This method shows a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity, providing a streamlined route to sulfur-containing scaffolds from readily available ketones.",

Neural population activity drifted continuously along a one-dimensional manifold during all behaviors and behavioral states, including sleep, which points to an intrinsic origin of the drift. In awake animals, boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in population dynamics, which segmented the neural activity into temporal units. During tasks with recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the drift, encoding event information across multiple timescales.

We also identified ZFP91 as a representative Zincore client, binding the conserved promoter motif CTTTAAR. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy of a Zincore-ZFP91-DNA complex revealed a SEPHS1 arginine clamp to recognize the DNA-bound zinc finger domains. This mode of binding explains recognition of different ZNFs and stabilizes ZFP91 onto its cognate DNA motif.

    "abstract": "In multilayer moir\u00e9 heterostructures, the interference of multiple twist angles ubiquitously leads to tunable ultralong-wavelength patterns known as supermoir\u00e9 lattices. However, their impact on the system\u2019s many-body electronic phase diagram remains largely unexplored. We present local compressibility measurements revealing numerous incompressible states resulting from supermoir\u00e9 lattice\u2013scale isospin symmetry breaking driven by strong interactions. By using the supermoir\u00e9 lattice occupancy as a probe of isospin symmetry, we observed an unexpected doubling of the miniband filling near \u03bd = \u2212 2 , possibly indicating a hidden phase transition or normal-state pairing proximal to the superconducting phase. Our work establishes supermoir\u00e9 lattices as a tunable parameter for designing quantum phases and as an effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in moir\u00e9 materials.",

    "abstract": "The anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1) is essential for embryogenesis and the survival of many cell types that tolerate loss of its relatives, BCL-XL and BCL-2. Apoptosis-unrelated roles of MCL-1 in metabolism may contribute to this requirement, although their relevance for embryogenesis and postnatal life remains unclear. We hypothesized that BCL-XL and BCL-2 may substitute MCL-1\u2019s anti-apoptotic but not its apoptosis-unrelated functions. Replacing MCL-1 with BCL-XL or BCL-2 supported embryo development by rescuing the Mcl-1 \u2212/\u2212 preimplantation lethality. Mcl-1 Bcl-xL/Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1 Bcl-2/Bcl-2 mice were born on a mixed background, although they showed metabolic defects. Thus MCL-1\u2019s apoptosis-unrelated functions appear critical in later development, with BCL-XL, but not BCL-2, partially compensating. These findings clarify MCL-1\u2019s distinct physiological roles, critically informing MCL-1 inhibitor development as cancer therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) synthesizes telomeric repeats at chromosome ends using a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and a telomerase RNA (hTR in humans). Previous structural work showed that human telomerase is typically monomeric, containing a single copy of TERT and hTR. Evidence for dimeric complexes exists, although the composition, high-resolution structure, and function remain elusive. Here, we report the cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a human telomerase dimer bound to telomeric DNA. The structure reveals a 26-subunit assembly and a dimerization interface mediated by the Hinge and ACA box (H/ACA) RNP of telomerase. Premature aging disease mutations map to this interface. Disrupting dimer formation affects RNP assembly, bulk telomerase activity, and telomere maintenance in cells. Our findings address a long-standing enigma surrounding the telomerase dimer and suggest a role for the dimer in telomerase assembly.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes are involved in three major empirical patterns: (i) Y (or W) chromosomes are often nonrecombining and degenerate; (ii) heterogametic offspring (XY or ZW) from interspecific crosses are more often sterile or inviable compared with homogametic offspring (Haldane\u2019s rule); and (iii) the X (or Z) has a disproportionately large effect on reproductive isolation between species compared with autosomes (the large X effect). Each observation has received its own tailored explanation involving multiple genetic and evolutionary causes. In this work, we show that these empirical patterns all emerge from a single theory for sex chromosome evolution incorporating the coevolution of cis- and trans-acting regulators of gene expression and leading to systematic misexpression of dosage-compensated genes in heterogametic F1 hybrids, for both young and old sex chromosomes.",

We combined isotope labeling, computed-tomography three-dimensional models, behavioral field experiments, and mathematical models to show that Squamellaria plant hosts reduce conflict among their multiple ant symbiont species by offering nesting sites (domatia) divided into compartments with separate entrances. As long as compartmentalization is maintained, different symbiont species can peacefully coexist, but experimental removal of compartment walls leads to deadly conflicts. Modeling suggests that compartmentalization optimizes nutritional benefits by increasing the time during which domatia harbor large ant colonies. These results reveal a conflict-reduction mechanism that allows hosts to take advantage of unrelated symbionts, which may be widespread in multipartner mutualisms.",

Spatially broad DA release has been extensively characterized, but how DA transmission affects striatal function at a subcellular scale remains poorly understood. Using 2P imaging and whole-cell electrophysiology, we defined the spatiotemporal properties of DA transmission onto striatal indirect pathway spiny projection neurons. Sparse activation of DA release sites evoked localized DA signals, producing spatially discrete, D2 receptor\u2013mediated responses across dendrites. The spatiotemporal properties of DA receptor signaling differed between downstream intracellular pathways. We propose that membrane-delimited G\u03b2\u03b3 signaling occurs in parallel to intracellular second messenger pathways, but on different spatial and temporal scales, providing a mechanism for precise decoding of DA signals by striatal neurons.",

A prevalent hypothesis posits that the Arp8 module within INO80 enables a ruler-like activity. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we show that on nucleosomes with 40 bp of flanking DNA, the Arp8 module rotates 180\u00b0 away from the DNA. Deleting the Arp8 module enables rapid sliding irrespective of flanking DNA length. Thus, rather than enabling a ruler-like activity, the Arp8 module acts as a brake on INO80 remodeling when flanking DNA is short. This autoinhibition\u2013based mechanism has broad implications for understanding how primitive nucleosome mobilization enzymes may have evolved into sophisticated remodelers.",

Building on this approach, we have now engineered conditional attenuation into a porphyran-utilizing strain of Phocaeicola vulgatus by replacing native essential gene regulation with a porphyran-inducible promoter to allow reversible engraftment. Engineering a five-gene oxalate degradation pathway into the reversibly engrafting strain resulted in a therapeutic candidate that reduced hyperoxaluria, a cause of kidney stones, in preclinical models. Our phase 1/2a clinical trial demonstrated porphyran dose\u2013dependent abundance and reversible engraftment in humans, reduction of oxalate in the urine, and characterized genetic stability challenges to achievinglong-term treatment.",

Notable events include the North Atlantic MHW (276-year return period) and the Southwest Pacific (141 years). Using ECCO2 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean-Phase II) high-resolution daily data, we conducted a mixed-layer heat budget analysis and identified region-specific drivers: enhanced shortwave flux and a shallower mixed layer in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, reduced cloud cover and increased advection in the Southwest Pacific, and oceanic advections in the Tropical Eastern Pacific. The 2023 MHWs highlight the intensifying impacts of a warm climate and the challenges in understanding extreme events.",

A graph-theoretic dual framework is introduced that simultaneously encodes the metasurface-based multiport interferometer designs and its resulting nonclassical correlations, enabling the direct translation of linear quantum optical networks into a single-layer metasurface. We also demonstrate the ability of metasurfaces to produce multipath-entangled states and perform transformations equivalent to higher-order Hadamard interferometers.

In this TAD, we uncovered genetic circuits for metabolic responses and hibernation-linked cis elements forming regulatory contacts with neighboring genes. Deletions of individual cis elements in mice differentially altered Fto , Irx3 , and Irx5 expression, reshaping downstream gene expression programs and affecting metabolism, torpor, obesogenesis, and foraging in distinct ways.

    "abstract": "Increasing drought pressure under anthropogenic climate change may jeopardize the potential of tropical forests to capture carbon in woody biomass and act as a long-term carbon dioxide sink. To evaluate this risk, we assessed drought impacts in 483 tree-ring chronologies from across the tropics and found an overall modest stem growth decline (2.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 2.2 to 2.7%) during the 10% driest years since 1930. Stem growth declines exceeded 10% in 25% of cases and were larger at hotter and drier sites and for gymnosperms compared with angiosperms. Growth declines generally did not outlast drought years and were partially mitigated by growth stimulation in wet years. Thus, pantropical forest carbon sequestration through stem growth has hitherto shown drought resilience that may, however, diminish under future climate change.",

One such phase exists only at fields greater than 40 tesla, a considerable scale given its critical temperature of only 2 K. Here, we extend measurements of this state with fields outside of the bc crystallographic plane and reveal its core structure: The superconducting phase wraps around the b axis in a halo-like fashion and appears to be stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. This angle dependence points to a multicomponent spin-triplet order parameter with a finite angular momentum of the Cooper pairs. The pairing mechanism remains enigmatic, and UTe 2 \u2019s specific magnetophilic superconducting tendencies seem incompatible with existing models for field-enhanced superconductivity.",

Furthermore, we found that the sensitivities of ITF to temperature and dust are in a ratio that agrees with laboratory measurements of droplet freezing, showing that ITF can be attributed to dust aerosol.",

Observing this fundamental quantum effect experimentally\u2014particularly, revealing the collective nature of the structural quantum fluctuations\u2014remains an unmet challenge for complex molecules. In this work, we achieved this for an 11-atom molecule by inducing its Coulomb explosion with an x-ray free-electron laser. We show that the structural fluctuations manifest themselves in correlated variations of ion momenta obtained through coincident detection of the atomic fragments from individual molecules. Our analysis scheme allows extracting these variations, despite our measurements covering only a fraction of the full 33-dimensional momentum space, thereby establishing a general approach for extracting information on high-dimensional structural dynamics using Coulomb explosion.",

    "abstract": "Magnetoelectric sensing holds promise for flexible sensors, offering precise detection of both electric and magnetic fields with minimal power consumption. However, its practical use has been constrained by weak magnetoelectric effects and limited overall performance, particularly under mechanical strain. Herein, we fabricated robust magnetoelectric polymer-inorganic nanocomposites through an interfacial cocrystallization strategy. By leveraging diazonium chemistry on vanadium diselenide (VSe 2 ) monolayers, we created a submolecular-flat interface between ferromagnetic VSe 2 and ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanocrystals. This highly crystalline interface has few mobile polymer chains and thus limits energy dissipation and enhances interfacial energy transfer. The scalable composite films show exceptional magnetoelectric performance, with a magnetocapacitive coefficient of 23.6%. These films enable ultrafast magnetoelectric detection, approaching a 10-fold increase in speed compared with conventional sensors, and offer opportunities for integrating multifunctional materials such as thermoelectric coolers into wearable devices.",

In this study, we describe the engineering of an epoxidase capable of selectively epoxidizing the internal alkene of farnesol with high regioselectivity and enantioselectivity. The resulting epoxidized intermediate has been successfully applied to simplify the synthesis of a variety of meroterpenoids, reducing the total number of synthetic steps by more than half in most cases.",

In this work, we experimentally controlled the abundance of the central enzyme in methanogenesis, methyl\u2013coenzyme M reductase (MCR), in Methanosarcina acetivorans and tested whether its cellular concentration alters methane isotopic compositions. We found that during growth on methanol and acetate, lowering the expression of mcr increases the degree of hydrogen isotope exchange between methane and water. Using an isotope-enabled model of methanogenesis, we found that these changes result from an increase in reversibility of enzymes involved in the oxidation of the substrate methyl group. This result indicates that methane produced from organic compounds can deviate from commonly assumed pathway-specific isotope effects, with implications for the interpretation of environmentally relevant methane sources.",

By clonal activation of neurons expressing the male-determinant FruM, we identified insulin-like peptide\u2013producing cells (IPCs) and their putative postsynaptic targets, proboscis-innervating motoneurons, as those critical for gift giving. We demonstrate that loss of FruM from D. subobscura IPCs abrogates neurite extension and gift giving, whereas FruM overexpression in their D. melanogaster counterparts induces overgrowth of neurites that harbor functional synapses, culminating in increased regurgitation. We suggest that the acquisition of FruM expression by IPCs was a key event occurring in an ancestral D. subobscura that conferred a latent capability to perform nuptial gift giving.",

Whether cells exploit mitochondrial metabolism to protect from infection is unclear. In this work, we found that the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) activates a mitochondrial defense based on the essential B vitamin folate. During infection of cultured mammalian cells with the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii , ATF4 increased mitochondrial DNA levels by driving the one-carbon metabolism processes that use folate in mitochondria. Triggered by host detection of mitochondrial stress induced by parasite effectors, ATF4 limited Toxoplasma access to folates required for deoxythymidine monophosphate synthesis, thereby restricting parasite growth. Thus, ATF4 rewires mitochondrial metabolism to mount a folate-based metabolic defense against Toxoplasma .",

We collected mushrooms from different parts of rings over a 7-year period and identified new mutations in different tissues by whole-genome sequencing. We found evidence that fertile and sterile tissues had accumulated different mutations, suggesting that the germ line, destined for spore production, is already defined in the mycelium in this species. Moreover, the germ line carried fewer mutations than sterile tissues, indicating a lower mutation rate. Our findings suggest that early germline sequestration is more widespread than previously considered across multicellular life.",

    "abstract": "Platelets are anucleate blood cells vital for hemostasis and immunity. During cell death and aberrant mitosis, nucleated cells release DNA, resulting in \u201ccell-free\u201d DNA in plasma (cfDNA). An excess of cfDNA is deleterious. Given their ability to internalize pathogen-derived nucleic acids, we hypothesized that platelets may also clear endogenous cfDNA. We found that, despite lacking a nucleus, platelets contained a repertoire of DNA fragments mapping across the nuclear genome. We detected fetal DNA in maternal platelets and cancer-derived DNA in platelets from patients with premalignant and cancerous lesions. As current liquid biopsy approaches utilize platelet-depleted plasma, important genetic information contained within platelets is being missed. This study establishes a physiological role for platelets that has not previously been highlighted, with broad translational relevance.",

We report hierarchical supramolecular assemblies with giant chiroptical activity and mechanical attributes achieved through coassembly of achiral amphiphilic unimolecular micelles and chiral additives. Chiral fibrillar assemblies emerge from the nanostructured environment imposed by the micelles, driven by progressive chirality transfer through multiple hydrogen bonds between components. Integrating multifarious achiral luminescent molecules and nanocrystals into these assemblies leads to full-color circularly polarized luminescence\u2013active materials with dissymmetry factors of ~10 \u22121 . A concentration-dependent chirality inversion is accessed through tailoring the coassembly kinetics. This strategy enables efficient red CPL, crucial for quantum and optical technologies.",

However, achieving this reaction manifold by using enzymes has remained elusive. In this study, we introduce a photobiocatalytic approach for radical benzylic C(sp 3 )\u2012N coupling using a copper-substituted nonheme enzyme. Using rhodamine B as a photoredox catalyst, we identified a copper-substituted phenylalanine hydroxylase that facilitates enantioconvergent decarboxylative amination between N -hydroxyphthalimide esters and anilines. Directed evolution remodeled the active site, resulting in high enantioselectivities for most substrates. On the basis of molecular modeling and mechanistic studies, we propose that the enzyme accommodates a copper-anilide complex that reacts with a benzylic radical. This study expands the scope of non-natural biocatalytic transition metal catalysis to copper-catalyzed radical coupling.",

Whereas Berry curvature\u2013mediated transport effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric\u2013induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here, we show that spin-momentum locking, a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit\u2013coupled materials, leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measured and electrically controlled in 111-oriented LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and enable previously unexplored strategies to design functionalities based on quantum geometry.",

We find that the Denisovan-like MUC19 haplotype is under positive selection and carries a higher copy number of a 30\u2013base-pair variable number tandem repeat, and that copy numbers of this repeat are exceedingly high in admixed American populations. Finally, we find that some Neanderthals carry the Denisovan-like MUC19 haplotype, and that it was likely introgressed into modern human populations through Neanderthal introgression rather than Denisovan introgression.",

We investigated how energy disorders affect vibrational polariton dynamics by probing ultrafast dynamics in 2,6-di- tert -butylphenol in liquids (inhomogeneous) and solids (homogeneous) using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. In liquids, energy disorder disrupted delocalization, preventing vibrational energy transfer. By contrast, with reduced inhomogeneity, vibrational strong coupling in solids restored delocalization and enabled energy transfer. We established a stringent delocalization criterion, requiring collective coupling strengths exceeding three times inhomogeneous linewidths to sustain polariton coherence. This finding highlights energy disorder\u2019s detrimental effects and outlines strategies to overcome localization\u2014either by minimizing disorder through chemical control or by achieving sufficient couplings using advanced photonic structures.",

This study uses a statistical evaluation of new geochemical datasets to quantify the critical minerals that are mined annually in US ores but go unrecovered. Ninety percent recovery of by-products from existing domestic metal mining operations could meet nearly all US critical mineral needs; one percent recovery would substantially reduce import reliance for most elements that we evaluated. Policies and technological advancements can enable by-product recovery, which is a resource-efficient approach to critical mineral supply that reduces waste, impact, and geopolitical risk.",

Central to this defense is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where UBR4 acts as an essential E4 ubiquitin ligase, amplifying degradation marks on defective proteins. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy analysis of UBR4 in complex with its cofactors KCMF1 and CALM1 reveals a massive 1.3-megadalton ring structure, featuring a central substrate-binding arena and flexibly attached catalytic units. Our structure shows how UBR4 binds substrate and extends lysine-48\u2013specific ubiquitin chains. Efficient substrate targeting depends on both preubiquitination and specific N-degrons, with KCMF1 acting as a key substrate filter. The architecture of the E4 megacomplex is conserved across eukaryotes, but species-specific adaptations allow UBR4 to perform its precisely tuned quality control function in diverse cellular environments.",

We assessed carbon and nitrogen dynamics across the northern Yellowstone ecosystem, where one of the last remaining large migratory populations resides. Bison stabilized net aboveground production while accelerating nitrogen turnover, increasing aboveground nitrogen pools while carbon pools remained stable, which improved landscape nutritional quality. Effects were strongest in wet, nutrient-rich habitats that received higher bison densities and grazing than is recommended in rangeland management, while soil and plant conditions suggested landscape resilience. Restoration should embrace heterogeneity in densities and effects across habitats and spatial scales beyond those guiding most current recovery efforts.",

High wastewater flows and low winds led to nighttime H 2 S peaks, reaching 4500 parts per billion (ppb)\u2014exceeding typical urban levels of <1 ppb. H 2 S levels and community malodor reports were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient r = 0.92), validating long-dismissed community voices and highlighting an environmental injustice.

ML penetrance was variable across variant classes, but highest for pathogenic and loss-of-function variants, and was associated with clinical outcomes and functional data. Compared with conventional case-versus-control approaches, ML penetrance provided refined quantitative estimates and aided the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and loss-of-function variants by delineating clinical trajectories over time.

In white adipose tissue (WAT), we identified three macrophage populations with distinct localization, turnover, and phenotypes. Septal adipose tissue macrophages (sATMs), marked by CD209b and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, were long-lived and positioned in close proximity to adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) within the WAT septum. Within this shared niche, sATMs instructed the differentiation of ASCs into white adipocytes through transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b21 (TGF\u03b21). Depletion of sATMs, or the selective loss of TGF\u03b21 within tissue-resident macrophages, redirected ASC fate toward thermogenic adipocytes, enhancing WAT beiging and protecting against diet-induced obesity. These findings highlight the role of a discrete, anatomically defined macrophage population that governs ASC fate and orchestrates adipose tissue expansion.",

We used a multiomics comparison of the transcriptomes of ciliated and unciliated embryonic cells to identify TFs up-regulated in ciliated cells. We also used conditional genetics in mouse embryos and stem cells and found that the TFs SP5 and SP8 regulate cilia formation and gene expression. In embryos lacking Sp5 and Sp8 , primary and motile cilia were shorter than normal and reduced in number across cell types, contributing to situs inversus and hydrocephalus. Moreover, expression of SP8 was sufficient to induce primary cilia in unciliated cells.

    "abstract": "A planet\u2019s interior is a time capsule, preserving clues to its early history. We report the discovery of kilometer-scale heterogeneities throughout Mars\u2019 mantle, detected seismically through pronounced wavefront distortion of energy arriving from deeply probing marsquakes. These heterogeneities, likely remnants of the planet\u2019s formation, imply a mantle that has undergone limited mixing driven by sluggish convection. Their size and survival constrain Mars\u2019 poorly known mantle rheology, indicating a high viscosity of 10 21.3 to 10 21.9 pascal-seconds and low temperature dependence, with an effective activation energy of 70 to 90 kilojoules per mole, suggesting a mantle deforming by dislocation creep. The limited mixing, coupled with ubiquitous, scale-invariant heterogeneities, reflects a highly disordered mantle, characteristic of the more primitive interior evolution of a single-plate planet, contrasting sharply with the tectonically active Earth.",

We electron-irradiated Ad submicrocrystals at 80 to 200 kilo\u2013electron volts and 100 to 296 kelvin in vacuum for tens of seconds. This process yielded defect-free nanodiamonds (NDs) of cubic crystal structure, accompanied by hydrogen gas evolution.

A sizable kinetic isotope effect indicates that C\u2013H cleavage was rate-determining, and other hydrocarbons tested failed to form NDs.",

Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase subgroup XII (LRR-RLK-XII) represents one of the largest PRR families owing to lineage-specific diversification. Through bioinformatics and synthetic biology approaches, we characterized LRR-RLK-XIIs from 285 plant species and identified a receptor, \u201cSCORE,\u201d that perceives cold shock protein (CSP) peptides. SCORE orthologs from multiple angiosperm lineages exhibit CSP recognition polymorphisms, indicating recurrent selection for pathogen recognition through substitutions at key amino acid residues. Through functional phylogenomics and protein structure predictions, we engineered SCORE variants capable of detecting multiple phytopathogen CSP peptides, thus revealing the diverse PRR recognition landscape in plants. Our strategy holds promise for engineering plant immune receptors, particularly for perennial crops.",

This transient deformation event, with an equivalent moment magnitude of 6.1, was coupled with local inflation below major hydrocarbon fields.

    "abstract": "Reducing charge carrier transport losses, improving selectivity, and minimizing non-radiative recombination are essential for enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. We used a hybrid two-step perovskite deposition method that is compatible with industry-standard textured silicon, incorporating a perovskite surface treatment based on 1,3-diaminopropane dihydroiodide. The interaction of this molecule with the perovskite surface increased the majority charge carrier concentration at the electron-selective contact, which reduced interfacial recombination. Simultaneously, this field-effect passivation increased the electron concentration across the entire intrinsic perovskite absorber, which increased conductivity and reduced transport losses. Combined, this yields high-performance, fully-textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, achieving a 1-sun AM1.5G conversion efficiency of 33.1% with an open-circuit voltage of 2.01 volts, and an extended outdoor stability in the Red Sea Coast.",

In this study, we found instead that a local \u201ctug-of-war\u201d competition between contractile cells regulated extrusion in the intestinal epithelium. We combined quantitative live microscopy, optogenetic induction of tissue tension, genetic perturbation of myosin II activity, and local disruption of the basal cortex in mouse intestines and intestinal organoids. These approaches revealed that a dynamic actomyosin network generates tension throughout the intestinal villi, including the villus tip region. Mechanically weak cells unable to maintain this tension underwent extrusion. Thus, epithelial barrier integrity depends on intercellular mechanics.",

The usual products are multicarbon mixtures because the critical step of heterolytic hydrogen (H 2 ) dissociation at high temperatures complicates selectivity control. In this study, we report that irradiating gold\u2013titanium dioxide at 365 nanometers induces heterolytic H 2 dissociation at ambient temperature. This process likely relies on interfacial electric dipoles from photogenerated electrons and holes situated on the metallic gold nanoparticles and interfacial gold\u2013oxygen\u2013titanium scaffolds. The heterolytic H 2 dissociation is further promoted by light-induced coating of gold nanoparticles with a titanium oxide layer. The resulting nucleophilic hydrogen species reduce CO 2 to ethane in >99% yield under light irradiation in a flow apparatus. Furthermore, cascading with a subsequent photocatalytic ethane dehydrogenation generates ethylene in >99% yield over 1500 hours of irradiation.",

We analyzed the recent (21 January 2022 to 20 March 2025) continuous seismic data, which showed a sharp increase in seismicity at the highly populated CFc. Our analysis expanded the seismicity catalog from around 12,000 to more than 54,000 earthquakes. The more complete picture of seismicity revealed a sharply defined caldera ring fault system (RFS) featuring a very narrow depth range of seismicity, clearly illuminated shallow faults in the northern part of the caldera, and uncovered a source of very shallow hybrid earthquakes likely related to the hydrothermal system. To date, we have not observed any direct signature of upward migration of magma, nor have we observed seismic activity at depths below 3.7 kilometers on or inside the RFS.",

Exceptions follow structure-function associations that arose independently multiple times, specifically, the gain of D1 claws with subterranean habits and the loss of D1 ungues with oral-only feeding behavior. We hypothesize that early acquisition of D1 nails and manually dexterous food handling was crucial for rodents to adaptively leverage cranial specializations for efficient gnawing and thereby exploit hard seeds and nuts, a niche that they dominated after the extinction of multituberculates. Our study recasts ideas about rodent evolution and uncovers a previously unrecognized contributor to their successful radiation.",

However, conformally wrapping these film devices onto three-dimensional surfaces often leads to stress-induced damage. We propose a \u201cdrop-printing\u201d strategy that enables damage-free film transfer using a droplet. The droplet acts as a lubricating layer between the film and the target surface, facilitating local sliding during shape-adaptive deformation. This mechanism prevents in-plane film stretching and reduces stress concentration. Even nonstretchable and fragile films can be intactly and accurately wrapped onto delicate surfaces, such as microscale microorganisms and optical fibers. Two-micrometer-thick silicon films, without any stretchable engineering, can form conformal neural-electronic interfaces by being drop-printed on nerves and brain tissue. The interfaces achieve light-controlled in vivo neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal resolution.",

However, depending on the regulated promoter identity, TF function can vary, and the principles underlying this context dependence remain unclear. We demonstrate an inverse scaling relationship between the promoter\u2019s basal activity and its regulation by a given TF. Specifically, activation is weaker and repression is stronger on stronger promoters. This scaling applies to both activators and repressors, which suggests a common underlying mechanism where TFs regulate expression by stabilizing RNAP binding at the promoter. The consequence of this relationship is that TFs buffer expression by affecting constant regulated expression levels across promoters of different basal activity, ensuring homeostatic control despite genetic or environmental changes.",

Protonation of neutral 4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) occurs at the acid ( O -protomer) and amine ( N -protomer) functionalities, yielding two distinct species with relative energies dependent on the degree of hydration. Here, we measured the rates of intramolecular proton transfer in 4ABAH + \u00b7(H 2 O) 6 ions upon protomer-selective vibrational excitation of initially cold (6 K) cluster ions isolated in a cryogenic ion trap. Interconversion rates were observed on the microsecond time scale.

    "abstract": "Carbon fixation through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle accounts for the majority of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) uptake from the atmosphere. The CBB cycle generates C3 carbohydrates but is inefficient at producing acetyl\u2013coenzyme A (CoA) (C2), which is the universal precursor for synthesizing lipids. In this work, we introduced in Arabidopsis thaliana a new-to-nature CO 2 fixing cycle, malyl-CoA-glycerate (McG) cycle, which together with the CBB cycle forms a dual-cycle CO 2 fixation system. This cycle can fix one additional carbon by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and convert the photorespiration product, glycolate, to acetyl-CoA. Plants with the McG cycle show enhanced protein abundance in their photosystems and enhanced photosystem II efficiency. McG plants had doubled CO 2 fixation rates under atmospheric CO 2 , increased lipid production, pronounced growth enhancement, and tripled the seed yield.",

    "abstract": "Speciation, the process by which new reproductively isolated species emerge from ancestral populations, results from the gradual accumulation of barriers to gene flow within genomes. To date, the notion that interspecific genetic exchange (introgression) occurs more frequently between plant species than animals has gained a strong footing in scientific discourse. By examining the dynamics of gene flow across a continuum of divergence in both kingdoms, we observed the opposite relationship: Plants experience less introgression than animals at the same level of genetic divergence, suggesting that species barriers are established more rapidly in plants. This pattern raises questions about which differences in microevolutionary processes between plants and animals influence the dynamics of reproductive isolation establishment at the macroevolutionary scale.",

    "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte hypocontractility underlies inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Yet, whether fibroblasts modify DCM phenotypes remains unclear despite their regulation of fibrosis, which strongly predicts disease severity. Expression of a hypocontractility-linked sarcomeric variant in mice triggered cardiac fibroblast expansion from the de novo formation of hyperproliferative-mechanosensitized fibroblast states, which occurred prior to eccentric myocyte remodeling. Initially this fibroblast response reorganized fibrillar collagen and stiffened the myocardium albeit without depositing fibrotic tissue. These adaptations coincided with heightened matrix-integrin receptor interactions and diastolic tension sensation at focal adhesions within fibroblasts. Targeted p38 deletion arrested these cardiac fibroblast responses in DCM mice, which prevented cardiomyocyte remodeling and improved contractility. In conclusion, p38-mediated fibroblast responses were essential regulators of DCM severity, marking a potential cellular target for therapeutic intervention.",

Most studies rely on field surveys performed in the past century, leaving gaps in our understanding of longer-term trends. Using a \u201ccommunity genomics\u201d approach, we estimated community assembly over millions of years and more recent demographic trends of ant species in the Fijian archipelago. We found that 79% of endemic species are in decline, starting after the arrival of humans approximately 3000 years ago and accelerating in the past 300 years, whereas recent arrivals are expanding. The primary correlate of population decline among endemic species was found to be sensitivity to habitat disturbance. This study demonstrates the value of contemporary collections for estimating long-term community trends and highlights the vulnerability of endemic island species to anthropogenic change.",

Leucine Zipper-like Transcription Regulator 1 (LZTR1), a substrate adapter of the Cullin-3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, binds specific RAS GTPases and promotes their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We present structures of LZTR1 Kelch domains bound to RIT1, MRAS, and KRAS, revealing interfaces that govern RAS isoform selectivity and nucleotide specificity. Biochemical and structural analyses of disease-associated Kelch domain mutations revealed three types of alterations: impaired substrate interaction, loop destabilization, and blade-blade repulsion. In cellular and mouse models, mutations disrupting substrate binding phenocopied LZTR1 loss, underscoring its substrate specificity. These findings define RAS recognition mechanisms by LZTR1 and suggest a molecular glue strategy to degrade oncogenic KRAS.",

Although El Ni\u00f1o events in the equatorial Pacific are known to suppress total summer rainfall throughout India, we show using observational data spanning 1901 to 2020 that, counterintuitively, they simultaneously intensify extreme daily rainfall. This is partly driven by increases in extreme daily values of convective buoyancy, provided that both the undilute instability of near-surface air and the dilution by mixing with drier air above are considered. El Ni\u00f1o could plausibly drive similar changes in other tropical regions, and our framework could be further applied to changes in hourly extremes, to other internal variability modes, and to forced trends under climate change.",

Here, we demonstrate in Arabidopsis thaliana that transgenerational stability of experimentally-induced hypomethylation at TE loci is constrained by small RNAs derived from related copies. Using data from >700 strains collected worldwide, we uncover similar and recurrent hypomethylation at hundreds of these TE loci, often near genes. Most natural epivariants we tested can be inherited without DNA sequence changes and are therefore bona fide epialleles, although genetic factors modulate their recurrence or persistence. Epiallelic variants often cause gene expression changes and may be targets of selection, thus revealing their contribution to heritable phenotypic variation in nature.",

By relocating promoter-reporter constructs into thousands of alternative positions within a single locus, we dissected the positional relationship between the mouse Sox2 gene and its distal enhancer. This revealed an intricate, sharply confined activation landscape in which the native Sox2 gene occupies an optimal position for its activation. Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. The confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its ~1-kilobase coding region. Our local relocation approach provides high-resolution functional maps of a genomic locus and reveals that a gene can strongly constrain the realm of influence of its enhancer.",

Here we introduce an approach to tile mammalian chromosomes with self-mapping fluorescent labels and track them at ultraresolution. We find that sequences separated by submegabase distances transition to proximity in tens of seconds. This rapid search is dependent on cohesin and is exhibited only within domains. Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, rather than structural boundaries. The genomic separation\u2013dependent scaling of the search time for cis interactions violated predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor-driven folding. We also uncover cohesin-dependent processive motion at 2.7 kilobases per second. Together, these multiscale dynamics reveal the organization of the genome into kinetically associated domains.",

Using spatially disaggregated, nationwide data from Mongolia, from 1984 to 2024, we exploited seasonal variation in grazing locations to quasi-experimentally estimate the causal effects of livestock herd size, weather, and climate change on rangeland primary productivity. At interannual frequency, herd size modestly but significantly negatively affects primary productivity, with notable variation across ecological zones. The effects of weather fluctuations are, however, an order of magnitude larger. At the decadal scale, over which herders can adapt to climate change, herd size effects disappear, and temperature effects dominate. In Mongolia, climate change seems to drive most long-term change in rangeland primary productivity.",

Using genomic samples taken at a single time point to generate contemporary effective population size estimates in a temperate montane forest, we accurately predict fluctuations across three censuses. Our approach facilitates the use of genomic demography to parameterize multispecies community models in ecology and shows that population genomic data can provide accurate predictions for ecological dynamics.",

Although previous efforts have focused on computational speedups, a definitive and provable quantum advantage that is unattainable by any classical system has remained elusive. In this work, we demonstrate a provable photonic quantum advantage by implementing a quantum-enhanced protocol for learning a high-dimensional physical process. Using imperfect Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen entanglement, we achieve a sample complexity reduction of 11.8 orders of magnitude compared to classical methods without entanglement. These results show that large-scale, provable quantum advantage is achievable with current photonic technology and represent a key step toward practical quantum-enhanced learning protocols in quantum metrology and machine learning.",

Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.",

We present a framework for informing habitat conservation policies based on the enhancement of habitat quantity and quality and define thresholds of habitat quantity at which it becomes effective to also prioritize habitat quality. We applied this framework to insect pollinators, an important part of agroecosystem biodiversity, by synthesizing 59 studies from 19 countries. Given low habitat quality, hoverflies had the lowest threshold at 6% semi-natural habitat cover, followed by solitary bees (16%), bumble bees (18%), and butterflies (37%). These figures represent minimum habitat thresholds in agricultural landscapes, but when habitat quantity is restricted, marked increases in quality are required to reach similar outcomes.",

By contrast, we found that faster feedbacks involving organic matter are not only critical to Earth system recovery but can also create unexpected instability. Our Earth system model experiments show how sedimentary organic carbon burial, amplified by redox-sensitive phosphorus regeneration, can outweigh silicate weathering and paradoxically drive climate overcooling in response to massive CO 2 release. This instability depends on the initial balance between silicate weathering and organic carbon burial in addition to the state of global phosphorus cycling. It is most strongly expressed at intermediate ocean redox states, which may help us understand the timing of past ice ages.",

We defined strategies for the optimal application of bridge systems, leveraging mechanistic insights to improve their targeting specificity. Through rational engineering of the ISCro4 bridge RNA and deep mutational scanning of its recombinase, we achieved up to 20% insertion efficiency into the human genome and genome-wide specificity as high as 82%. We further demonstrated intrachromosomal inversion and excision, mobilizing up to 0.93 megabases of DNA.

This approach revealed preferred ordering of different atomic species with the dominant occurrence of Si\u2013Ge\u2013Sn triplets.

    "abstract": "Distinguishing functional splice sites from abundant cryptic sites in precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) represents a fundamental challenge in decoding mammalian genomes. We demonstrate that the specific RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB9 directly interacts with the 3\u2032 AG dinucleotide binding factor U2AF1 to initiate 3\u2032 splice site recognition. Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II\u2013mediated 5\u2032 splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II. Collectively, these results reveal dynamic U2AF cycling that partitions Pol II subunit\u2013facilitated splice site recognition and subsequent Pol II\u2013independent spliceosome assembly steps during cotranscriptional splicing.",

Morphometric and phylogenetic analyses suggest that it is an early member of the Asian H. longi clade, which includes the Denisovans and is the main part of the sister group to the H. sapiens clade. Both the H. sapiens and H. longi clades have deep roots extending beyond the Middle Pleistocene and probably experienced rapid early diversification.

By investigating plasmids from clinically relevant bacteria sampled and isolated between 1917 and 1954 and comparing them to modern plasmids, we have captured over 100 years of evolution. We show that while virtually all PAE plasmids were devoid of resistance genes and most never acquired them, a minority evolved to drive the global spread of resistance to first line and last resort antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. Modern plasmids have evolved through complex microevolution and fusion events into a distinct group of highly recombinogenic, multi-replicon, self-transmissible plasmids that now pose the highest risk to resistance dissemination, and therefore to human health.",

We identified key social behavioral strategies and decision-making processes in mice that facilitate successful cooperation. These processes are represented in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ACC activity causally contributes to cooperative behavior. We extended our findings to artificial intelligence systems by training artificial agents in a similar cooperation task. The agents developed behavioral strategies and neural representations reminiscent of those observed in the biological brain, revealing parallels between cooperative behavior in biological and artificial systems.",

We systematically screened 200 million human protein pairs and predicted 17,849 interactions with an expected precision of 90%, of which 3,631 interactions were not identified in previous experimental screens.

Previous studies suggest a role for symbiotic fungistatic microbes in bringing about weed control. However, how termites employ these microbes to suppress fungal weeds without affecting the fungal cultivar remains unknown. We show that the fungus-farming termite Odontotermes obesus uses specific behaviors to remove, isolate, and suppress the growth of the fungal weed Pseudoxylaria , primarily by encasing it with soil boluses containing fungistatic microbes. These behaviors efficiently suppress the weed without affecting the crop. This integration of specific behaviors with termite-derived microbes appears to be the proximate mechanism of how microbes are topically used by termites to confine the weed while keeping the crop unaffected.",

A structure of Cap10 revealed a transfer RNA transglycosylase family enzyme remodeled to bind a partner cGAS/DncV\u2013like nucleotidyltransferase that is modified with an N-terminal 7-amido-7-deazaguanine (NDG) nucleobase. A structure of Cap9 explained how this QueC-like enzyme co-opts a 7-deazapurine biosynthetic reaction to install NDG. We show that Cap9, Cap10, and protein deazaguanylation are essential for host defense against phage infection. Our results define a 7-deazapurine protein modification and explain how nucleobase biosynthetic machinery has been repurposed for antiviral immunity.",

We report dual transposon sequencing (dual Tn-seq), a platform for assaying the fitness of a comprehensive double mutant pool in parallel. Dual Tn-seq couples random barcode transposon site sequencing with the Cre- lox system, enabling deep sampling of 73% of the 1.3 million possible double gene deletions in Streptococcus pneumoniae . The genetic interactions identified span a wide range of biochemical processes, revealing new factors in presumably well-studied pathways, exemplified by a cytidine triphosphate synthase PyrJ. Moreover, this approach should permit further investigation of growth condition\u2013specific genetic interactions. Because dual Tn-seq does not require the construction of a large array of single mutants, it should be readily adaptable to various microorganisms.",

We demonstrate that minimal platinum (Pt) loading for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can be achieved through atom abstraction. At low loadings of Pt with copper (Cu), reduction over silica or other oxide supports formed nanoparticles (NPs) with Pt mainly dispersed in the bulk. Addition of tin (Sn) to the alloy led to formation of surface Pt 1 Sn 1 dimers. The larger atomic radius of Sn compared to Cu drove it to the surface, and its stronger interactions with Pt abstracted it from the bulk. Single metallic Pt atoms were stabilized on fully open surfaces, resulting in nearly 100% surface exposure. This configuration reduced Pt usage by one order of magnitude for propane dehydrogenation and improved catalytic stability.",

We investigate effects of two major remodelers, ACF and RSC, using chromatin condensates and single-molecule footprinting. We find that both remodelers inhibit the formation of condensed chromatin. However, the remodelers have distinct effects on preformed chromatin condensates. ACF spaces nucleosomes without decondensing the chromatin, explaining how ACF maintains nucleosome organization in transcriptionally repressed genomic regions. By contrast, RSC catalyzes ATP-dependent decondensation of chromatin. RSC also drives micron-scale movements of entire chromatin condensates. These additional activities of RSC may contribute to its central role in transcription. The biological importance of remodelers may thus reflect both their effects on nucleosome mobilization and the corresponding consequences on chromatin dynamics at the mesoscale.",

Here, we report nitrogen-isotope evidence that modern-like upwelling occurred in the EEP during the Pliocene and has persisted over the past 5 million years. We explain the reduced Pliocene cold tongue as an expression of the reduced temperature difference between surface and subsurface waters in the tropical Pacific. The attendant reduction in the vertical density gradient may have maintained EEP upwelling despite the expected slackening of the trade winds under Pliocene warmth.",

We evaluated the ability of open-source AI-powered protein design software to create variants of proteins of concern that could evade detection by the biosecurity screening tools used by nucleic acid synthesis providers, identifying a vulnerability where AI-redesigned sequences could not be detected reliably by current tools. In response, we developed and deployed patches, greatly improving detection rates of synthetic homologs more likely to retain wild type\u2013like function.",

Economic disasters increased sharply from 2015 onward, with 43% of the 200 most damaging events occurring in the last decade.

However, the discovery of a Late Cretaceous freshwater otophysan challenges this view. Integrating fossil, morphological, and genomic data, we estimate a younger crown group origin of ~154 million years ago. Notably, ancestral range and habitat reconstructions indicate marine origins for the otophysan crown groups, with at least two transitions to fresh water. Functional simulations of the Weberian ossicles of this fossil suggest that the distinctive hearing capabilities of otophysans evolved in conjunction with fusion of hearing ossicle parts and freshwater adaptations.",

Here, we used in vitro translation to reconstitute GCN2 activation by amino acid stress and compared collided ribosome populations induced by diverse translational stressors. Initiation of GCN2 signaling required the di-ribosome sensor GCN1, which recruits GCN2 to ribosomes in a collision-dependent manner, where GCN2 becomes activated by key ribosomal interactions and stably associated with collided ribosomes. Our findings define the molecular requirements and dynamics of GCN2 activation.",

    "abstract": "Plant roots release exudates to encourage microbiome assembly, which influences the function and stress resilience of plants. How specific exudates drive spatial colonization patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that endodermal Casparian strips\u2014forming the root\u2019s extracellular diffusion barrier\u2014restrict nutrient leakage into the rhizosphere, coinciding with and controlling spatial colonization patterns of rhizobacteria. We find that vasculature-derived glutamine leakage is a major bacterial chemoattractant and enhancer of proliferation, defining a previously unknown pathway for root exudate formation. Bacteria defective in amino acid chemoperception display reduced attraction toward leakage sites, and roots with Casparian strip defects display bacterial overproliferation, dependent on bacterial capacity for amino acid metabolization. Associated chronic immune stimulation suggests that endodermal nutrient restriction is crucial for regulating microbial colonization and assembly, limiting excessive proliferation that could compromise plant health.",
