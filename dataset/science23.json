    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have leveraged evolutionary information in multiple sequence alignments to predict protein structure. We demonstrate direct inference of full atomic-level protein structure from primary sequence using a large language model. As language models of protein sequences are scaled up to 15 billion parameters, an atomic-resolution picture of protein structure emerges in the learned representations. This results in an order-of-magnitude acceleration of high-resolution structure prediction, which enables large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins. We apply this capability to construct the ESM Metagenomic Atlas by predicting structures for >617 million metagenomic protein sequences, including >225 million that are predicted with high confidence, which gives a view into the vast breadth and diversity of natural proteins.",

We present AlphaMissense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic.",

Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40% and output quality rose by 18%.

It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10 days at 0.25\u00b0 resolution globally in under 1 minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems.",

However, there is no consensus on whether flash droughts have become the new normal because slow droughts may also increase. In this study, we show that drought intensification rates have sped up over subseasonal time scales and that there has been a transition toward more flash droughts over 74% of the global regions identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Extreme Events during the past 64 years. The transition is associated with amplified anomalies of evapotranspiration and precipitation deficit caused by anthropogenic climate change. In the future, the transition is projected to expand to most land areas, with larger increases under higher-emission scenarios. These findings underscore the urgency for adapting to faster-onset droughts in a warmer future.",

We demonstrate a direct synthetic route for scalable and atom-economic synthesis of MXenes, including compounds that have not been synthesized from MAX phases, by the reactions of metals and metal halides with graphite, methane, or nitrogen. The direct synthesis enables chemical vapor deposition growth of MXene carpets and complex spherulite-like morphologies that form through buckling and release of MXene carpet to expose fresh surface for further reaction. The directly synthesized MXenes showed excellent energy storage capacity for lithium-ion intercalation.",

However, achieving such a biomimetic system that can seamlessly integrate with the human body remains a challenge. Through rational design and engineering of material properties, device structures, and system architectures, we realized a monolithic soft prosthetic electronic skin (e-skin). It is capable of multimodal perception, neuromorphic pulse-train signal generation, and closed-loop actuation. With a trilayer, high-permittivity elastomeric dielectric, we achieved a low subthreshold swing comparable to that of polycrystalline silicon transistors, a low operation voltage, low power consumption, and medium-scale circuit integration complexity for stretchable organic devices. Our e-skin mimics the biological sensorimotor loop, whereby a solid-state synaptic transistor elicits stronger actuation when a stimulus of increasing pressure is applied.",

However, a challenge with this approach is a trade-off between the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) and the fill factor (FF). Here, we overcame this challenge by introducing a thick (about 100 nanometers) insulator layer with random nanoscale openings. We performed drift-diffusion simulations for cells with this porous insulator contact (PIC) and realized it using a solution process by controlling the growth mode of alumina nanoplates. Leveraging a PIC with an approximately 25% reduced contact area, we achieved an efficiency of up to 25.5% (certified steady-state efficiency 24.7%) in p-i-n devices. The product of V oc \u00d7 FF was 87.9% of the Shockley-Queisser limit. The surface recombination velocity at the p-type contact was reduced from 64.2 to 9.2 centimeters per second. The bulk recombination lifetime was increased from 1.2 to 6.0 microseconds because of improvements in the perovskite crystallinity. The improved wettability of the perovskite precursor solution allowed us to demonstrate a 23.3% efficient 1-square-centimeter p-i-n cell. We demonstrate here its broad applicability for different p-type contacts and perovskite compositions.",

    "abstract": "Compared with the n-i-p structure, inverted (p-i-n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) promise increased operating stability, but these photovoltaic cells often exhibit lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) because of nonradiative recombination losses, particularly at the perovskite/C 60 interface. We passivated surface defects and enabled reflection of minority carriers from the interface into the bulk using two types of functional molecules. We used sulfur-modified methylthio molecules to passivate surface defects and suppress recombination through strong coordination and hydrogen bonding, along with diammonium molecules to repel minority carriers and reduce contact-induced interface recombination achieved through field-effect passivation. This approach led to a fivefold longer carrier lifetime and one-third the photoluminescence quantum yield loss and enabled a certified quasi-steady-state PCE of 25.1% for inverted PSCs with stable operation at 65\u00b0C for >2000 hours in ambient air. We also fabricated monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells with 28.1% PCE.",

In this work, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to systematically survey cells across the entire adult human brain. We sampled more than three million nuclei from approximately 100 dissections across the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain in three postmortem donors. Our analysis identified 461 clusters and 3313 subclusters organized largely according to developmental origins and revealing high diversity in midbrain and hindbrain neurons. Astrocytes and oligodendrocyte-lineage cells also exhibited regional diversity at multiple scales. The transcriptomic census of the entire human brain presented in this work provides a resource for understanding the molecular diversity of the human brain in health and disease.",

In this work, we report a continuous-flow electrolyzer equipped with 25\u2013square centimeter\u2013effective area gas diffusion electrodes wherein nitrogen reduction is coupled with hydrogen oxidation. We show that the classical catalyst platinum is not stable for hydrogen oxidation in the organic electrolyte, but a platinum-gold alloy lowers the anode potential and avoids the decremental decomposition of the organic electrolyte. At optimal operating conditions, we achieve, at 1 bar, a faradaic efficiency for ammonia production of up to 61 \u00b1 1% and an energy efficiency of 13 \u00b1 1% at a current density of \u22126 milliamperes per square centimeter.",

However, intercalation of non\u2013van der Waals structures, which can expand the family of 2D materials, is difficult. We report a structural editing protocol for layered carbides (MAX phases) and their 2D derivatives (MXenes). Gap-opening and species-intercalating stages were respectively mediated by chemical scissors and intercalants, which created a large family of MAX phases with unconventional elements and structures, as well as MXenes with versatile terminals. The removal of terminals in MXenes with metal scissors and then the stitching of 2D carbide nanosheets with atom intercalation leads to the reconstruction of MAX phases and a family of metal-intercalated 2D carbides, both of which may drive advances in fields ranging from energy to printed electronics.",

We found that macrophage polarity\u2014defined by CXCL9 and SPP1 (CS) expression but not by conventional M1 and M2 markers\u2014had a noticeably strong prognostic association. CS macrophage polarity also identified a highly coordinated network of either pro- or antitumor variables, which involved each tumor-associated cell type and was spatially organized.

    "abstract": "Decreased dendritic spine density in the cortex is a hallmark of several neuropsychiatric diseases, and the ability to promote cortical neuron growth has been hypothesized to underlie the rapid and sustained therapeutic effects of psychedelics. Activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) is essential for psychedelic-induced cortical plasticity, but it is currently unclear why some 5-HT2AR agonists promote neuroplasticity, whereas others do not. We used molecular and genetic tools to demonstrate that intracellular 5-HT2ARs mediate the plasticity-promoting properties of psychedelics; these results explain why serotonin does not engage similar plasticity mechanisms. This work emphasizes the role of location bias in 5-HT2AR signaling, identifies intracellular 5-HT2ARs as a therapeutic target, and raises the intriguing possibility that serotonin might not be the endogenous ligand for intracellular 5-HT2ARs in the cortex.",

However, as the field continues to seek ever-higher durability, additional tools that avoid progressive ligand intercalation are needed to minimize degradation at high temperatures. We used ammonium ligands that are nonreactive with the bulk of perovskites and investigated a library that varies ligand molecular structure systematically. We found that fluorinated aniliniums offer interfacial passivation and simultaneously minimize reactivity with perovskites. Using this approach, we report a certified quasi\u2013steady-state power-conversion efficiency of 24.09% for inverted-structure PSCs.

The extensive off-stoichiometric defects have a larger impact on the transport properties of SnSe, which motivated us to develop a lattice plainification strategy for defects engineering. We demonstrated that Cu can fill Sn vacancies to weaken defects scattering and boost carrier mobility, facilitating a power factor exceeding ~100 microwatts per centimeter per square kelvin and a dimensionless figure of merit ( ZT ) of ~1.5 at 300 kelvin, with an average ZT of ~2.2 at 300 to 773 kelvin. We further realized a single-leg efficiency of ~12.2% under a temperature difference (\u0394 T ) of ~300 kelvin and a seven-pair Peltier cooling \u0394 T max of ~61.2 kelvin at ambient temperature.

    "abstract": "No design rules have yet been established for producing solid electrolytes with a lithium-ion conductivity high enough to replace liquid electrolytes and expand the performance and battery configuration limits of current lithium ion batteries. Taking advantage of the properties of high-entropy materials, we have designed a highly ion-conductive solid electrolyte by increasing the compositional complexity of a known lithium superionic conductor to eliminate ion migration barriers while maintaining the structural framework for superionic conduction. The synthesized phase with a compositional complexity showed an improved ion conductivity. We showed that the highly conductive solid electrolyte enables charge and discharge of a thick lithium-ion battery cathode at room temperature and thus has potential to change conventional battery configurations.",

We developed a cellular ceramic that can achieve highly efficient light scattering and a near-perfect solar reflectivity of 99.6%. These qualities, coupled with high thermal emissivity, allow the ceramic to provide continuous subambient cooling in an outdoor setting with a cooling power of >130 watts per square meter at noon, demonstrating energy-saving potential on a worldwide scale. The color, weather resistance, mechanical robustness, and ability to depress the Leidenfrost effect are key features ensuring the durable and versatile nature of the cooling ceramic, thereby facilitating its commercialization in various applications, particularly building construction.",

Here, we analyze the 1972 largest global lakes using three decades of satellite observations, climate data, and hydrologic models, finding statistically significant storage declines for 53% of these water bodies over the period 1992\u20132020. The net volume loss in natural lakes is largely attributable to climate warming, increasing evaporative demand, and human water consumption, whereas sedimentation dominates storage losses in reservoirs. We estimate that roughly one-quarter of the world\u2019s population resides in a basin of a drying lake, underscoring the necessity of incorporating climate change and sedimentation impacts into sustainable water resources management.",

Here, we reveal the underlying mechanisms of facet-dependent degradation of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) films. We show that the (100) facet is substantially more vulnerable to moisture-induced degradation than the (111) facet. With combined experimental and theoretical studies, the degradation mechanisms are revealed; a strong water adhesion following an elongated lead-iodine (Pb-I) bond distance is observed, which leads to a \u03b4-phase transition on the (100) facet. Through engineering, a higher surface fraction of the (111) facet can be achieved, and the (111)-dominated crystalline FAPbI 3 films show exceptional stability against moisture. Our findings elucidate unknown facet-dependent degradation mechanisms and kinetics.",

However, developing passive cooling structures that are both practical to manufacture and apply while also displaying long-term environmental stability is challenging. We developed a randomized photonic composite consisting of a microporous glass framework that features selective LWIR emission along with relatively high solar reflectance and aluminum oxide particles that strongly scatter sunlight and prevent densification of the porous structure during manufacturing. This microporous glass coating enables a temperature drop of ~3.5\u00b0 and 4\u00b0C even under high-humidity conditions (up to 80%) during midday and nighttime, respectively. This radiative \u201ccooling glass\u201d coating maintains high solar reflectance even when exposed to harsh conditions, including water, ultraviolet radiation, soiling, and high temperatures.",

To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest capacity reported for polarization multiplexing. Combining the position multiplexing scheme, the metasurface can generate 36 distinct images, forming a holographic keyboard pattern.

The contrastive learning framework empowers CLEAN to confidently (i) annotate understudied enzymes, (ii) correct mislabeled enzymes, and (iii) identify promiscuous enzymes with two or more EC numbers\u2014functions that we demonstrate by systematic in silico and in vitro experiments.

We overcame these issues by encapsulating the aerogel fiber with a stretchable layer, mimicking the core-shell structure of polar bear hair. Despite its high internal porosity over 90%, our fiber is stretchable up to 1000% strain, which is greatly improved compared with that of traditional aerogel fibers (~2% strain). In addition to its washability and dyeability, our fiber is mechanically robust, retaining its stable thermal insulation property after 10,000 stretching cycles (100% strain). A sweater knitted with our fiber was only one-fifth as thick as down, with similar performance. Our strategy for this fiber provides rich possibilities for developing multifunctional aerogel fibers and textiles.",

This reflects differences between the project ex ante baselines and ex post counterfactuals according to observed deforestation in control areas.

We studied how human gut bacteria influence colonization of two major bacterial pathogens, both in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Whereas single species alone had negligible effects, colonization resistance greatly increased with community diversity. Moreover, this community-level resistance rested critically upon certain species being present. We explained these ecological patterns through the collective ability of resistant communities to consume nutrients that overlap with those used by the pathogen. Furthermore, we applied our findings to successfully predict communities that resist a novel target strain. Our work provides a reason why microbiome diversity is beneficial and suggests a route for the rational design of pathogen-resistant communities.",

Various electric pulse patterns were emulated by PFM with ultralow energy consumption. The fluidic property of PFM enabled the mimicking of chemical-regulated electric pulses. More importantly, chemical-electric signal transduction was implemented with a single PFM. With its structural similarity to ion channels, PFM is versatile and easily interfaces with biological systems, paving a way to building neuromorphic devices with advanced functions by introducing rich chemical designs.",

Through genome association analysis of sorghum, a naturally high-alkaline\u2013tolerant crop, we detected a major locus, Alkaline Tolerance 1 ( AT1 ), specifically related to alkaline-salinity sensitivity. An at1 allele with a carboxyl-terminal truncation increased sensitivity, whereas knockout of AT1 increased tolerance to alkalinity in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize. AT1 encodes an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit that affects the phosphorylation of aquaporins to modulate the distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) . These processes appear to protect plants against oxidative stress by alkali. Designing knockouts of AT1 homologs or selecting its natural nonfunctional alleles could improve crop productivity in sodic lands.",

    "abstract": "The origin of high-energy cosmic rays, atomic nuclei that continuously impact Earth\u2019s atmosphere, is unknown. Because of deflection by interstellar magnetic fields, cosmic rays produced within the Milky Way arrive at Earth from random directions. However, cosmic rays interact with matter near their sources and during propagation, which produces high-energy neutrinos. We searched for neutrino emission using machine learning techniques applied to 10 years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. By comparing diffuse emission models to a background-only hypothesis, we identified neutrino emission from the Galactic plane at the 4.5\u03c3 level of significance. The signal is consistent with diffuse emission of neutrinos from the Milky Way but could also arise from a population of unresolved point sources.",

We present a solid-solvent processing strategy to fabricate an ultrathin MMM (thickness less than 100 nanometers) with filler loading up to 80 volume %. We used polymer as a solid solvent to dissolve metal salts to form an ultrathin precursor layer, which immobilizes the metal salt and regulates its conversion to a metal-organic framework (MOF) and provides adhesion to the MOF in the matrix. The resultant membrane exhibits fast gas-sieving properties, with hydrogen permeance and/or hydrogen\u2013carbon dioxide selectivity one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of state-of-the-art membranes.",

    "abstract": "The catalytic performance of heterogeneous catalysts can be tuned by modulation of the size and structure of supported transition metals, which are typically regarded as the active sites. In single-atom metal catalysts, the support itself can strongly affect the catalytic properties. Here, we demonstrate that the size of cerium dioxide (CeO 2 ) support governs the reactivity of atomically dispersed palladium (Pd) in carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation. Catalysts with small CeO 2 nanocrystals (~4 nanometers) exhibit unusually high activity in a CO-rich reaction feed, whereas catalysts with medium-size CeO 2 (~8 nanometers) are preferred for lean conditions. Detailed spectroscopic investigations reveal support size\u2013dependent redox properties of the Pd-CeO 2 interface.",

Experiments and molecular simulations confirmed the underlying membrane formation mechanism. Our ice-confined PA nanofiltration membrane features high-density ionized structure and exceptional transport channels, realizing superior water permeance and excellent ion selectivity.",

One common porosity occurs when an unstable vapor depression zone (keyhole) forms because of excess laser energy input. With simultaneous high-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging and thermal imaging, coupled with multiphysics simulations, we discovered two types of keyhole oscillation in laser powder bed fusion of Ti-6Al-4V. Amplifying this understanding with machine learning, we developed an approach for detecting the stochastic keyhole porosity generation events with submillisecond temporal resolution and near-perfect prediction rate. The highly accurate data labeling enabled by operando x-ray imaging allowed us to demonstrate a facile and practical way to adopt our approach in commercial systems.",

We introduce a phosphonic acid\u2013functionalized fullerene derivative in mixed-cation perovskites as a grain boundary modulator to consolidate the crystal structure, which enhances the tolerance of the film against illumination, heat, and moisture. We also developed a redox-active radical polymer, poly(oxoammonium salt), that can effectively p-dope the hole-transporting material by hole injection and that also mitigates lithium ion diffusion. Power conversion efficiencies of 23.5% for 1-square-centimeter mixed\u2013cation-anion PSCs and 21.4% for 17.1-square-centimeter minimodules were achieved. The PSCs retained 95.5% of their initial efficiencies after 3265 hours at maximum power point tracking under continuous 1-sun illumination at 70\u00b0 \u00b1 5\u00b0C.",

    "abstract": "Enantioselective redox transformations typically rely on costly transition metals as catalysts and often stoichiometric amounts of chemical redox agents as well. Electrocatalysis represents a more sustainable alternative, in particular through the use of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in place of a chemical oxidant. In this work, we describe strategies for HER-coupled enantioselective aryl carbon-hydrogen bond (C\u2013H) activation reactions using cobalt in place of a precious metal catalyst for the asymmetric oxidation. Thus, highly enantioselective carbon-hydrogen and nitrogen-hydrogen (C\u2013H and N\u2013H) annulations of carboxylic amides were achieved, which gave access to point and axially chiral compounds. Furthermore, the cobalt-mediated electrocatalysis enabled the preparation of various phosphorus (P)\u2013stereogenic compounds by selective desymmetrization through dehydrogenative C\u2013H activation reactions.",

    "abstract": "Does Facebook enable ideological segregation in political news consumption? We analyzed exposure to news during the US 2020 election using aggregated data for 208 million US Facebook users. We compared the inventory of all political news that users could have seen in their feeds with the information that they saw (after algorithmic curation) and the information with which they engaged. We show that (i) ideological segregation is high and increases as we shift from potential exposure to actual exposure to engagement; (ii) there is an asymmetry between conservative and liberal audiences, with a substantial corner of the news ecosystem consumed exclusively by conservatives; and (iii) most misinformation, as identified by Meta\u2019s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program, exists within this homogeneously conservative corner, which has no equivalent on the liberal side. Sources favored by conservative audiences were more prevalent on Facebook\u2019s news ecosystem than those favored by liberals.",

We show the existence of a fourth meningeal layer that compartmentalizes the subarachnoid space in the mouse and human brain, designated the subarachnoid lymphatic-like membrane (SLYM). SLYM is morpho- and immunophenotypically similar to the mesothelial membrane lining of peripheral organs and body cavities, and it encases blood vessels and harbors immune cells. Functionally, the close apposition of SLYM with the endothelial lining of the meningeal venous sinus permits direct exchange of small solutes between cerebrospinal fluid and venous blood, thus representing the mouse equivalent of the arachnoid granulations. The functional characterization of SLYM provides fundamental insights into brain immune barriers and fluid transport.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal development in the human cerebral cortex is considerably prolonged compared with that of other mammals. We explored whether mitochondria influence the species-specific timing of cortical neuron maturation. By comparing human and mouse cortical neuronal maturation at high temporal and cell resolution, we found a slower mitochondria development in human cortical neurons compared with that in the mouse, together with lower mitochondria metabolic activity, particularly that of oxidative phosphorylation. Stimulation of mitochondria metabolism in human neurons resulted in accelerated development in vitro and in vivo, leading to maturation of cells weeks ahead of time, whereas its inhibition in mouse neurons led to decreased rates of maturation. Mitochondria are thus important regulators of the pace of neuronal development underlying human-specific brain neoteny.",

We measured backpropagated gradients for phase-shifter voltages by interfering forward- and backward-propagating light and simulated in situ backpropagation for 64-port photonic neural networks trained on MNIST image recognition given errors.

Diseased HSCs can be replaced with gene-engineered or healthy HSCs through HSC transplantation (HSCT). However, current protocols carry major side effects and have limited access. We developed CD117/LNP\u2013messenger RNA (mRNA), a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that encapsulates mRNA and is targeted to the stem cell factor receptor (CD117) on HSCs. Delivery of the anti\u2013human CD117/LNP\u2013based editing system yielded near-complete correction of hematopoietic sickle cells. Furthermore, in vivo delivery of pro-apoptotic PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis) mRNA with CD117/LNP affected HSC function and permitted nongenotoxic conditioning for HSCT. The ability to target HSCs in vivo offers a nongenotoxic conditioning regimen for HSCT, and this platform could be the basis of in vivo genome editing to cure genetic disorders, which would abrogate the need for HSCT.",

We present a distinctive approach that uses a highly ionic reaction environment to increase the polymer reactivity and lower the energy of ionic transition states. Combining endothermic cleavage of the polymer C\u2013C bonds with exothermic alkylation reactions of the cracking products enables full conversion of polyethylene and polypropylene to liquid isoalkanes (C 6 to C 10 ) at temperatures below 100\u00b0C. Both reactions are catalyzed by a Lewis acidic species that is generated in a chloroaluminate ionic liquid. The alkylate product forms a separate phase and is easily separated from the reactant catalyst mixture. The process can convert unprocessed postconsumer items to high-quality liquid alkanes with high yields.",

Whereas the effects of Berry curvature have been observed through phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnets, the quantum metric has rarely been explored. Here, we report a nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole by interfacing even-layered MnBi 2 Te 4 with black phosphorus. The quantum metric nonlinear Hall effect switches direction upon reversing the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spins and exhibits distinct scaling that is independent of the scattering time. Our results open the door to discovering quantum metric responses predicted theoretically and pave the way for applications that bridge nonlinear electronics with AFM spintronics.",

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)\u2013mediated neuroinflammation is involved in the progression of tau-mediated neurodegeneration, and emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota regulates neuroinflammation in an APOE genotype\u2013dependent manner. However, evidence of a causal link between the microbiota and tau-mediated neurodegeneration is lacking. In this study, we characterized a genetically engineered mouse model of tauopathy expressing human ApoE isoforms reared under germ-free conditions or after perturbation of their gut microbiota with antibiotics. Both of these manipulations reduced gliosis, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration in a sex- and ApoE isoform\u2013dependent manner.

Lithium oxide formation involves a four-electron reaction that is more difficult to achieve than the one- and two-electron reaction processes that result in lithium superoxide (LiO 2 ) and lithium peroxide (Li 2 O 2 ), respectively. By using a composite polymer electrolyte based on Li 10 GeP 2 S 12 nanoparticles embedded in a modified polyethylene oxide polymer matrix, we found that Li 2 O is the main product in a room temperature solid-state lithium-air battery.

A combination of operando electron microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy revealed that thin TiO x overlayers formed on nickel/titanium dioxide catalysts during 400\u00b0C reduction were completely removed under carbon dioxide hydrogenation conditions. Conversely, after 600\u00b0C reduction, exposure to carbon dioxide hydrogenation reaction conditions led to only partial reexposure of nickel, forming interfacial sites in contact with TiO x and favoring carbon\u2013carbon coupling by providing a carbon species reservoir. Our findings challenge the conventional understanding of SMSIs and call for more-detailed operando investigations of nanocatalysts at the single-particle level to revisit static models of structure-activity relationships.",

    "abstract": "Conversion of plastic wastes to fatty acids is an attractive means to supplement the sourcing of these high-value, high-volume chemicals. We report a method for transforming polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) at ~80% conversion to fatty acids with number-average molar masses of up to ~700 and 670 daltons, respectively. The process is applicable to municipal PE and PP wastes and their mixtures. Temperature-gradient thermolysis is the key to controllably degrading PE and PP into waxes and inhibiting the production of small molecules. The waxes are upcycled to fatty acids by oxidation over manganese stearate and subsequent processing. PP \ua7b5-scission produces more olefin wax and yields higher acid-number fatty acids than does PE \ua7b5-scission. We further convert the fatty acids to high-value, large\u2013market-volume surfactants. Industrial-scale technoeconomic analysis suggests economic viability without the need for subsidies.",

Developments in lighting technology complicate any measurement because of changes in lighting practice and emission spectra. We investigated the change in global sky brightness from 2011 to 2022 using 51,351 citizen scientist observations of naked-eye stellar visibility. The number of visible stars decreased by an amount that can be explained by an increase in sky brightness of 7 to 10% per year in the human visible band. This increase is faster than emissions changes indicated by satellite observations. We ascribe this difference to spectral changes in light emission and to the average angle of light emissions.",

    "abstract": "We elucidate grapevine evolution and domestication histories with 3525 cultivated and wild accessions worldwide. In the Pleistocene, harsh climate drove the separation of wild grape ecotypes caused by continuous habitat fragmentation. Then, domestication occurred concurrently about 11,000 years ago in Western Asia and the Caucasus to yield table and wine grapevines. The Western Asia domesticates dispersed into Europe with early farmers, introgressed with ancient wild western ecotypes, and subsequently diversified along human migration trails into muscat and unique western wine grape ancestries by the late Neolithic. Analyses of domestication traits also reveal new insights into selection for berry palatability, hermaphroditism, muscat flavor, and berry skin color. These data demonstrate the role of the grapevines in the early inception of agriculture across Eurasia.",

By aligning genomes for 240 species, we identify bases that, when mutated, are likely to affect fitness and alter disease risk. At least 332 million bases (~10.7%) in the human genome are unusually conserved across species (evolutionarily constrained) relative to neutrally evolving repeats, and 4552 ultraconserved elements are nearly perfectly conserved. Of 101 million significantly constrained single bases, 80% are outside protein-coding exons and half have no functional annotations in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) resource. Changes in genes and regulatory elements are associated with exceptional mammalian traits, such as hibernation, that could inform therapeutic development.

Yet, a grand challenge is to unify both features in one material. We show that a plain medium-manganese steel can be processed to have a tensile strength >2.2 gigapascals at a uniform elongation >20%. This requires a combination of multiple transversal forging, cryogenic treatment, and tempering steps. A hierarchical microstructure that consists of laminated and twofold topologically aligned martensite with finely dispersed retained austenite simultaneously activates multiple micromechanisms to strengthen and ductilize the material. The dislocation slip in the well-organized martensite and the gradual deformation-stimulated phase transformation synergistically produce the high ductility. Our nanostructure design strategy produces 2 gigapascal\u2013strength and yet ductile steels that have attractive composition and the potential to be produced at large industrial scales.",

In this work, reaction-rate constants were extracted from evolving cavity transmission spectra, revealing resonant suppression of the intracavity reaction rate for alcoholysis of phenyl isocyanate with cyclohexanol. We observed up to an 80% suppression of the rate by tuning cavity modes to be resonant with the reactant isocyanate (NCO) stretch, the product carbonyl (CO) stretch, and cooperative reactant-solvent modes (CH). These results were interpreted using an open quantum system model that predicted resonant modifications of the vibrational distribution of reactants from canonical statistics as a result of light\u2013matter quantum coherences, suggesting links to explore between chemistry and quantum science.",

We explored ligand-protected metal nanoclusters (LPMNCs), which can have strong, stable, and tunable emission, as waveguides. Two alloy LPMNCs, Pt 1 Ag 18 and Au x Ag 19\u2013 x (7 \u2264 x \u2264 9), were synthesized and structurally determined. Crystals of both exhibited excellent optical waveguide performance, with optical loss coefficients of 5.26 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 7.77 \u00d7 10 \u22123 decibels per micrometer, respectively, lower than those demonstrated by most inorganic, organic, and hybrid materials. The crystal packing and molecular orientation of the Pt 1 Ag 18 compound led to an extremely high polarization ratio of 0.91. Aggregation enhanced the quantum yields of Pt 1 Ag 18 and Au x Ag 19\u2013 x LPMNCs by 115- and 1.5-fold, respectively. This photonic cluster with low loss and high polarization provides a generalizable and versatile platform for active waveguides and polarizable materials.",

Using a massively parallel assay for m 6 A (MPm 6 A), we discover that m 6 A specificity is globally regulated by suppressors that prevent m 6 A deposition in unmethylated transcriptome regions. We identify exon junction complexes (EJCs) as m 6 A suppressors that protect exon junction\u2013proximal RNA within coding sequences from methylation and regulate mRNA stability through m 6 A suppression. EJC suppression of m 6 A underlies multiple global characteristics of mRNA m 6 A specificity, with the local range of EJC protection sufficient to suppress m 6 A deposition in average-length internal exons but not in long internal and terminal exons. EJC-suppressed methylation sites colocalize with EJC-suppressed splice sites, which suggests that exon architecture broadly determines local mRNA accessibility to regulatory complexes.",

    "abstract": "The Hayabusa2 spacecraft collected samples from the surface of the carbonaceous near-Earth asteroid (162173) Ryugu and brought them to Earth. The samples were expected to contain organic molecules, which record processes that occurred in the early Solar System. We analyzed organic molecules extracted from the Ryugu surface samples. We identified a variety of molecules containing the atoms CHNOS, formed by methylation, hydration, hydroxylation, and sulfurization reactions. Amino acids, aliphatic amines, carboxylic acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds were detected, which had properties consistent with an abiotic origin. These compounds likely arose from an aqueous reaction on Ryugu\u2019s parent body and are similar to the organics in Ivuna-type meteorites. These molecules can survive on the surfaces of asteroids and be transported throughout the Solar System.",

    "abstract": "The piezoelectric properties of lead zirconate titanate [Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 or PZT] ceramics could be enhanced by fabricating textured ceramics that would align the crystal grains along specific orientations. We present a seed-passivated texturing process to fabricate textured PZT ceramics by using newly developed Ba(Zr,Ti)O 3 microplatelet templates. This process not only ensures the template-induced grain growth in titanium-rich PZT layers but also facilitates desired composition through interlayer diffusion of zirconium and titanium. We successfully prepared textured PZT ceramics with outstanding properties, including Curie temperatures of 360\u00b0C, piezoelectric coefficients d 33 of 760 picocoulombs per newton and g 33 of 100 millivolt meters per newton, and electromechanical couplings k 33 of 0.85. This study addresses the challenge of fabricating textured rhombohedral PZT ceramics by suppressing the otherwise severe chemical reaction between PZT powder and titanate templates.",

    "abstract": "The ratio of carbon assimilation to water evapotranspiration (ET) of an ecosystem, referred to as ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE eco ), is widely expected to increase because of the rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ( C a ). However, little is known about the interactive effects of rising C a and climate change on WUE eco . On the basis of upscaled estimates from machine learning methods and global FLUXNET observations, we show that global WUE eco has not risen since 2001 because of the asymmetric effects of an increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which depressed photosynthesis and enhanced ET. An undiminished ET trend indicates that rising temperature and VPD may play a more important role in regulating ET than declining stomatal conductance. Projected increases in VPD are predicted to affect the future coupling of the terrestrial carbon and water cycles.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of small-molecule inhibitors requires suitable binding pockets on protein surfaces. Proteins that lack this feature are considered undruggable and require innovative strategies for therapeutic targeting. KRAS is the most frequently activated oncogene in cancer, and the active state of mutant KRAS is such a recalcitrant target. We designed a natural product\u2013inspired small molecule that remodels the surface of cyclophilin A (CYPA) to create a neomorphic interface with high affinity and selectivity for the active state of KRAS G12C (in which glycine-12 is mutated to cysteine). The resulting CYPA:drug:KRAS G12C tricomplex inactivated oncogenic signaling and led to tumor regressions in multiple human cancer models. This inhibitory strategy can be used to target additional KRAS mutants and other undruggable cancer drivers. Tricomplex inhibitors that selectively target active KRAS G12C or multiple RAS mutants are in clinical trials now (NCT05462717 and NCT05379985).",

    "abstract": "Some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have a tera\u2013electron volt (TeV) afterglow, but the early onset of this has not been observed. We report observations with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) of the bright GRB 221009A, which serendipitously occurred within the instrument\u2019s field of view. More than 64,000 photons >0.2 TeV were detected within the first 3000 seconds. The TeV flux began several minutes after the GRB trigger and then rose to a peak ~10 seconds later. This was followed by a decay phase, which became more rapid ~650 seconds after the peak. We interpret the emission using a model of a relativistic jet with half-opening angle of ~0.8\u00b0. This is consistent with the core of a structured jet and could explain the high isotropic energy of this GRB.",

    "abstract": "The design of molecular sieves is vital for gas separation, but it suffers from a long-standing issue of slow adsorption kinetics due to the intrinsic contradiction between molecular sieving and diffusion within restricted nanopores. We report a molecular sieve ZU-609 with local sieving channels that feature molecular sieving gates and rapid diffusion channels. The precise cross-sectional cutoff of molecular sieving gates enables the exclusion of propane from propylene. The coexisting large channels constituted by sulfonic anions and helically arranged metal-organic architectures allow the fast adsorption kinetics of propylene, and the measured propylene diffusion coefficient in ZU-609 is one to two orders of magnitude higher than previous molecular sieves. Propylene with 99.9% purity is obtained through breakthrough experiments with a productivity of 32.2 L kg \u22121 .",

    "abstract": "Soft materials tend to be highly permeable to gases, making it difficult to create stretchable hermetic seals. With the integration of spacers, we demonstrate the use of liquid metals, which show both metallic and fluidic properties, as stretchable hermetic seals. Such soft seals are used in both a stretchable battery and a stretchable heat transfer system that involve volatile fluids, including water and organic fluids. The capacity retention of the battery was ~72.5% after 500 cycles, and the sealed heat transfer system showed an increased thermal conductivity of approximately 309 watts per meter-kelvin while strained and heated. Furthermore, with the incorporation of a signal transmission window, we demonstrated wireless communication through such seals. This work provides a route to create stretchable yet hermetic packaging design solutions for soft devices.",

    "abstract": "Loss of nuclear TDP-43 is a hallmark of neurodegeneration in TDP-43 proteinopathies, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). TDP-43 mislocalization results in cryptic splicing and polyadenylation of pre\u2013messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) encoding stathmin-2 (also known as SCG10), a protein that is required for axonal regeneration. We found that TDP-43 binding to a GU-rich region sterically blocked recognition of the cryptic 3\u2032 splice site in STMN2 pre-mRNA. Targeting dCasRx or antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) suppressed cryptic splicing, which restored axonal regeneration and stathmin-2\u2013dependent lysosome trafficking in TDP-43\u2013deficient human motor neurons. In mice that were gene-edited to contain human STMN2 cryptic splice-polyadenylation sequences, ASO injection into cerebral spinal fluid successfully corrected Stmn2 pre-mRNA misprocessing and restored stathmin-2 expression levels independently of TDP-43 binding.",

Various high-efficiency caloric cooling techniques meet this goal, but scaling them up to technologically meaningful performance remains challenging. We have developed an elastocaloric cooling system with a maximum cooling power of 260 watts and a maximum temperature span of 22.5 kelvin. These values are among the highest reported for any caloric cooling system. Its key feature is the compression of fatigue-resistant elastocaloric nitinol (NiTi) tubes configured in a versatile multimode heat exchange architecture, which allows the harnessing of both high delivered cooling power and large temperature spans. Our system shows that elastocaloric cooling, which only emerged 8 years ago, is a promising direction for commercializing caloric cooling.",

We used density functional theory calculations to elucidate the conditions that lead to cluster formation and show how adatom formation energies enable efficient screening of the conditions required for adsorbate-induced cluster formation. We studied a combination of eight face-centered cubic transition metals and 18 common surface intermediates and identified systems relevant to catalytic reactions, such as carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation and ammonia (NH 3 ) oxidation. We used kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to elucidate the CO-induced cluster formation process on a copper surface. Scanning tunneling microscopy of CO on a nickel (111) surface that contains steps and dislocations points to the structure sensitivity of this phenomenon. Metal-metal bond breaking that leads to the evolution of catalyst structures under realistic reaction conditions occurs much more broadly than previously thought.",

We xenografted human or mouse neurons into the brain of a mouse model of AD. Only human neurons displayed tangles, Gallyas silver staining, granulovacuolar neurodegeneration (GVD), phosphorylated tau blood biomarkers, and considerable neuronal cell loss. The long noncoding RNA MEG3 was strongly up-regulated in human neurons . This neuron-specific long noncoding RNA is also up-regulated in AD patients. MEG3 expression alone was sufficient to induce necroptosis in human neurons in vitro. Down-regulation of MEG3 and inhibition of necroptosis using pharmacological or genetic manipulation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3, or mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) rescued neuronal cell loss in xenografted human neurons. This model suggests potential therapeutic approaches for AD and reveals a human-specific vulnerability to AD.",

Common TEiMs use pure metals or binary alloys but have performance stability issues. Conventional selection of TEiMs generally relies on trial-and-error experimentation. We developed a TEiM screening strategy that is based on phase diagram predictions by density functional theory calculations. By combining the phase diagram with electrical resistivity and melting points of potential reaction products, we discovered that the semimetal MgCuSb is a reliable TEiM for high-performance MgAgSb. The MgCuSb/MgAgSb junction exhibits low interfacial contact resistivity (\u03c1 c <1 microhm square centimeter) even after annealing at 553 kelvin for 16 days. The fabricated two-pair MgAgSb/Mg 3.2 Bi 1.5 Sb 0.5 module demonstrated a high conversion efficiency of 9.25% under a 300 kelvin temperature gradient. We performed an international round-robin testing of module performance to confirm the measurement reliability. The strategy can be applied to other thermoelectric materials, filling a vital gap in the development of thermoelectric modules.",

However, because plants associate with diverse microbial communities that shape their phenotypes, shifts in microbial associations may provide an alternative source of climate tolerance. Here, we show that tree seedlings inoculated with microbial communities sourced from drier, warmer, or colder sites displayed higher survival when faced with drought, heat, or cold stress, respectively. Microbially mediated drought tolerance was associated with increased diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, whereas cold tolerance was associated with lower fungal richness, likely reflecting a reduced burden of nonadapted fungal taxa. Understanding microbially mediated climate tolerance may enhance our ability to predict and manage the adaptability of forest ecosystems to changing climates.",

We identified 80 associated genomic loci ( P < 6.09 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ) for heart MRI traits, which shared genetic influences with cardiovascular and brain diseases. Genetic correlations were observed between heart MRI traits and brain-related traits and disorders. Mendelian randomization suggests that heart conditions may causally contribute to brain disorders.

We demonstrate the importance of disentangling the target reaction from the secondary reactions for the case of direct syngas conversion to light olefins by incorporating germanium-substituted AlPO-18 within the framework of the metal oxide\u2013zeolite (OXZEO) catalyst concept. The attenuated strength of the catalytically active Br\u00f8nsted acid sites allows enhancing the targeted carbon-carbon coupling of ketene intermediates to form olefins by increasing the active site density while inhibiting secondary reactions that consume the olefins. Thus, a light-olefins selectivity of 83% among hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide conversion of 85% were obtained simultaneously, leading to an unprecedented light-olefins yield of 48% versus current reported light-olefins yields of \u226427%.",

We identified 12 major classes that are organized as ~600 distinct cell states, which map to precise spatial anatomical domains at 5 pcw. We described detailed differentiation trajectories of the human forebrain and midbrain and found a large number of region-specific glioblasts that mature into distinct pre-astrocytes and pre\u2013oligodendrocyte precursor cells.

STRs maximize the number of weakly preferred microstates near target sites, thereby increasing TF density, with impacts well predicted by statistical mechanics. Confirming that STRs also affect TF binding in cells, neural networks trained only on in vivo occupancies predicted effects identical to those observed in vitro. Approximately 90% of TFs preferentially bound STRs that need not resemble known motifs, providing a cis -regulatory mechanism to target TFs to genomic sites.",

    "abstract": "Historically, mpox has been characterized as an endemic zoonotic disease that transmits through contact with the reservoir rodent host in West and Central Africa. However, in May 2022, human cases of mpox were detected spreading internationally beyond countries with known endemic reservoirs. When the first cases from 2022 were sequenced, they shared 42 nucleotide differences from the closest mpox virus (MPXV) previously sampled. Nearly all these mutations are characteristic of the action of APOBEC3 deaminases, host enzymes with antiviral function. Assuming APOBEC3 editing is characteristic of human MPXV infection, we developed a dual-process phylogenetic molecular clock that\u2014inferring a rate of ~6 APOBEC3 mutations per year\u2014estimates that MPXV has been circulating in humans since 2016. These observations of sustained MPXV transmission present a fundamental shift to the perceived paradigm of MPXV epidemiology as a zoonosis and highlight the need for revising public health messaging around MPXV as well as outbreak management and control.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing of silica glass is dominated by techniques that rely on traditional particle sintering. At the nanoscale, this limits their adoption within microsystem technology, which prevents technological breakthroughs. We introduce the sinterless, two-photon polymerization 3D printing of free-form fused silica nanostructures from a polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) resin. Contrary to particle-loaded sacrificial binders, our POSS resin itself constitutes a continuous silicon-oxygen molecular network that forms transparent fused silica at only 650\u00b0C. This temperature is 500\u00b0C lower than the sintering temperatures for fusing discrete silica particles to a continuum, which brings silica 3D printing below the melting points of essential microsystem materials. Simultaneously, we achieve a fourfold resolution enhancement, which enables visible light nanophotonics. By demonstrating excellent optical quality, mechanical resilience, ease of processing, and coverable size scale, our material sets a benchmark for micro\u2013 and nano\u20133D printing of inorganic solids.",

    "abstract": "The rich diversity of morphology and behavior displayed across primate species provides an informative context in which to study the impact of genomic diversity on fundamental biological processes. Analysis of that diversity provides insight into long-standing questions in evolutionary and conservation biology and is urgent given severe threats these species are facing. Here, we present high-coverage whole-genome data from 233 primate species representing 86% of genera and all 16 families. This dataset was used, together with fossil calibration, to create a nuclear DNA phylogeny and to reassess evolutionary divergence times among primate clades. We found within-species genetic diversity across families and geographic regions to be associated with climate and sociality, but not with extinction risk. Furthermore, mutation rates differ across species, potentially influenced by effective population sizes. Lastly, we identified extensive recurrence of missense mutations previously thought to be human specific. This study will open a wide range of research avenues for future primate genomic research.",

By contrast, certain species of bacteria selectively colonize immune-privileged tumor cores and can be engineered as antigen-independent platforms for therapeutic delivery. To bridge these approaches, we developed a platform of probiotic-guided CAR-T cells (ProCARs), in which tumor-colonizing probiotics release synthetic targets that label tumor tissue for CAR-mediated lysis in situ. This system demonstrated CAR-T cell activation and antigen-agnostic cell lysis that was safe and effective in multiple xenograft and syngeneic models of human and mouse cancers. We further engineered multifunctional probiotics that co-release chemokines to enhance CAR-T cell recruitment and therapeutic response.",

Although heterogeneous cellular microstructures are believed to play pivotal roles in their three-dimensional (3D) shape formation, programming 3D curved mesosurfaces with cellular designs remains elusive in man-made systems. We report a rational microlattice design that allows transformation of 2D films into programmable 3D curved mesosurfaces through mechanically guided assembly. Analytical modeling and a machine learning\u2013based computational approach serve as the basis for shape programming and determine the heterogeneous 2D microlattice patterns required for target 3D curved surfaces. About 30 geometries are presented, including both regular and biological mesosurfaces. Demonstrations include a conformable cardiac electronic device, a stingray-like dual mode actuator, and a 3D electronic cell scaffold.",

For transistor-type bioelectronic devices, the semiconductors that need to have direct interfacing with biotissues for effective signal transduction do not adhere well with wet tissues, thereby limiting the stability and conformability at the interface. We report a bioadhesive polymer semiconductor through a double-network structure formed by a bioadhesive brush polymer and a redox-active semiconducting polymer. The resulting semiconducting film can form rapid and strong adhesion with wet tissue surfaces together with high charge-carrier mobility of ~1 square centimeter per volt per second, high stretchability, and good biocompatibility. Further fabrication of a fully bioadhesive transistor sensor enabled us to produce high-quality and stable electrophysiological recordings on an isolated rat heart and in vivo rat muscles.",

In this work, we present a simple solution to this long-standing challenge: Switching the potential waveform from classical direct current to rapid alternating polarity renders various functional groups compatible and enables the reaction on sustainable carbon-based electrodes (amorphous carbon). This breakthrough enabled access to valuable molecules that range from useful unnatural amino acids to promising polymer building blocks from readily available carboxylic acids, including biomass-derived acids. Preliminary mechanistic studies implicate the role of waveform in modulating the local pH around the electrodes and the crucial role of acetone as an unconventional reaction solvent for Kolbe reaction.",

Inhibiting monocyte migration reduced arrhythmia in Ccr2 \u2212\u2215\u2212 HOMER mice.

Such precision has previously required attaching disproportionately large beads to the protein, but MINFLUX requires the detection of only about 20 photons from an approximately 1-nanometer-sized fluorophore. Therefore, we were able to study the stepping of the motor protein kinesin-1 on microtubules at up to physiological adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) concentrations. We uncovered rotations of the stalk and the heads of load-free kinesin during stepping and showed that ATP is taken up with a single head bound to the microtubule and that ATP hydrolysis occurs when both heads are bound. Our results show that MINFLUX quantifies (sub)millisecond conformational changes of proteins with minimal disturbance.",

Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a major effector of AMPK that increases expression of lysosome genes in response to energetic stress, but how AMPK activates TFEB remains unresolved. We demonstrate that AMPK directly phosphorylates five conserved serine residues in folliculin-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1), suppressing the function of the folliculin (FLCN)\u2013FNIP1 complex. FNIP1 phosphorylation is required for AMPK to induce nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFEB-dependent increases of peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR\u03b1) messenger RNAs. Thus, mitochondrial damage triggers AMPK-FNIP1\u2013dependent nuclear translocation of TFEB, inducing sequential waves of lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis.",

We also identified trans -effect networks of noncoding loci when cis target genes encoded transcription factors or microRNAs.

On the basis of structural analysis, we hypothesized that human STING is a proton channel. Indeed, we found that STING activation induced a pH increase in the Golgi and that STING reconstituted in liposomes enabled transmembrane proton transport. Compound 53 (C53), a STING agonist that binds the putative channel interface, blocked STING-induced proton flux in the Golgi and in liposomes. STING-induced LC3B lipidation and inflammasome activation were also inhibited by C53, suggesting that STING\u2019s channel activity is critical for these two processes. Thus, STING\u2019s interferon-induction function can be decoupled from its roles in LC3B lipidation and inflammasome activation.",

However, challenges for thermoregulatory clothing exist for harsh application scenarios, such as full day/night cycles, frigid polar regions, and space travel.

The flexible OPV-EC thermoregulatory clothing (OETC) can extend the human thermal comfort zone from 22\u00b0\u201328\u00b0C to 12.5\u00b0\u201337.6\u00b0C with a fast thermoregulation rate. The low energy consumption and high efficiency of the EC device allows for 24 hours of controllable and dual-mode thermoregulation with 12 hours of sunlight energy input. This self-powered wearable thermoregulatory platform has a simple structure, compact design, high efficiency, and strong self-adaptability with sunlight as the sole energy source.",

    "abstract": "Mapping molecular structure to odor perception is a key challenge in olfaction. We used graph neural networks to generate a principal odor map (POM) that preserves perceptual relationships and enables odor quality prediction for previously uncharacterized odorants. The model was as reliable as a human in describing odor quality: On a prospective validation set of 400 out-of-sample odorants, the model-generated odor profile more closely matched the trained panel mean than did the median panelist. By applying simple, interpretable, theoretically rooted transformations, the POM outperformed chemoinformatic models on several other odor prediction tasks, indicating that the POM successfully encoded a generalized map of structure-odor relationships. This approach broadly enables odor prediction and paves the way toward digitizing odors.",

    "abstract": "Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted increasing interest as sustainable plastics because of their biorenewability and biodegradability in the ambient environment. However, current semicrystalline PHAs face three long-standing challenges to broad commercial implementation and application: lack of melt processability, mechanical brittleness, and unrealized recyclability, the last of which is essential for achieving a circular plastics economy. Here we report a synthetic PHA platform that addresses the origin of thermal instability by eliminating \u03b1-hydrogens in the PHA repeat units and thus precluding facile cis-elimination during thermal degradation. This simple \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstitution in PHAs enhances the thermal stability so substantially that the PHAs become melt-processable. Synergistically, this structural modification also endows the PHAs with the mechanical toughness, intrinsic crystallinity, and closed-loop chemical recyclability.",

By inducing the down-regulation of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) in the ileum, post-ABX gut recolonization by Enterocloster species drove the emigration of enterotropic \u03b14\u03b27 + CD4 + regulatory T 17 cells into the tumor. These deleterious ABX effects were mimicked by oral gavage of Enterocloster species, by genetic deficiency, or by antibody-mediated neutralization of MAdCAM-1 and its receptor, \u03b14\u03b27 integrin. By contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation or interleukin-17A neutralization prevented ABX-induced immunosuppression. In independent lung, kidney, and bladder cancer patient cohorts, low serum levels of soluble MAdCAM-1 had a negative prognostic impact. Thus, the MAdCAM-1\u2013\u03b14\u03b27 axis constitutes an actionable gut immune checkpoint in cancer immunosurveillance.",

Meteorology plays a vital role in wildfire behaviors, and the links between wildfires and climate have been widely studied. However, it is not fully clear how fire-weather feedback affects short-term wildfire variability, which undermines our ability to mitigate fire disasters. Here, we show the primacy of synoptic-scale feedback in driving extreme fires in Mediterranean and monsoon climate regimes in the West Coast of the United States and Southeastern Asia. We found that radiative effects of smoke aerosols can modify near-surface wind, air dryness, and rainfall and thus worsen air pollution by enhancing fire emissions and weakening dispersion. The intricate interactions among wildfires, smoke, and weather form a positive feedback loop that substantially increases air pollution exposure.",

However, the functional properties of colonist-induced T cells are not well defined, limiting our ability to understand anticommensal immunity and harness it therapeutically. We addressed both challenges by engineering the skin bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis to express tumor antigens anchored to secreted or cell-surface proteins. Upon colonization, engineered S. epidermidis elicits tumor-specific T cells that circulate, infiltrate local and metastatic lesions, and exert cytotoxic activity. Thus, the immune response to a skin colonist can promote cellular immunity at a distal site and can be redirected against a target of therapeutic interest by expressing a target-derived antigen in a commensal.",

Our detector combines graphene with metamaterial perfect absorbers with direct illumination from a single-mode fiber, which breaks with the conventional miniaturization of photodetectors on an integrated photonic platform. This design allows for much higher optical powers while still allowing record-high bandwidths and data rates. Our results demonstrate that graphene photodetectors can outperform conventional technologies in terms of speed, bandwidth, and operation across a large spectral range.",

While current devices use a single type of dynamic polymer for all functional layers to ensure strong interlayer adhesion, this approach requires manual layer alignment. In this study, we used two dynamic polymers, which have immiscible backbones but identical dynamic bonds, to maintain interlayer adhesion while enabling autonomous realignment during healing. These dynamic polymers exhibit a weakly interpenetrating and adhesive interface, whose width is tunable. When multilayered polymer films are misaligned after damage, these structures autonomously realign during healing to minimize interfacial free energy. We fabricated devices with conductive, dielectric, and magnetic particles that functionally heal after damage, enabling thin-film pressure sensors, magnetically assembled soft robots, and underwater circuit assembly.",

However, the intrinsic high coercive field of the fluorite-structure oxide ferroelectric devices leads to incompatible operating voltage and limited endurance performance. We discovered a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\u2013compatible rhombohedral ferroelectric Hf(Zr) 1+ x O 2 material rich in hafnium-zirconium [Hf(Zr)]. X-ray diffraction combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals that the excess Hf(Zr) atoms intercalate within the hollow sites. We found that the intercalated atoms expand the lattice and increase the in-plane and out-of-plane stresses, which stabilize both the rhombohedral phase (r-phase) and its ferroelectric properties. Our ferroelectric devices, which are based on the r-phase Hf(Zr) 1+ x O 2 , exhibit an ultralow coercive field (~0.65 megavolts per centimeter). Moreover, we achieved a high endurance of more than 10 12 cycles at saturation polarization. This material discovery may help to realize low-cost and long-life memory chips.",

In diseases of aging, modifiable factors can be compounded over the life span. We report that diet-induced obesity earlier in life triggers persistent reprogramming of the innate immune system, lasting long after normalization of metabolic abnormalities. Stearic acid, acting through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), is sufficient to remodel chromatin landscapes and selectively enhance accessibility at binding sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1). Myeloid cells show less oxidative phosphorylation and shift to glycolysis, ultimately leading to proinflammatory cytokine transcription, aggravation of pathological retinal angiogenesis, and neuronal degeneration associated with loss of visual function. Thus, a past history of obesity reprograms mononuclear phagocytes and predisposes to neuroinflammation.",

We then used process-based and empirically tested modeling to produce a global assessment of metal mining contamination in river systems and the numbers of human populations and livestock exposed. Worldwide, metal mines affect 479,200 kilometers of river channels and 164,000 square kilometers of floodplains.

In this work, we used dealuminated Beta zeolite to support copper nanoparticles (Cu/Beta-deAl) and showed that these particles become smaller in methanol vapor at 200\u00b0C, decreasing from ~5.6 to ~2.4 nanometers in diameter, which is opposite to the general sintering phenomenon. A reverse ripening process was discovered, whereby migratable copper sites activated by methanol were trapped by silanol nests and the copper species in the nests acted as new nucleation sites for the formation of small nanoparticles. This feature reversed the general sintering channel, resulting in robust catalysts for dimethyl oxalate hydrogenation performed with supported copper nanoparticles for use in industry.",

    "abstract": "Variation in cytoarchitecture is the basis for the histological definition of cortical areas. We used single cell transcriptomics and performed cellular characterization of the human cortex to better understand cortical areal specialization. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of 8 areas spanning cortical structural variation showed a highly consistent cellular makeup for 24 cell subclasses. However, proportions of excitatory neuron subclasses varied substantially, likely reflecting differences in connectivity across primary sensorimotor and association cortices. Laminar organization of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes also differed across areas. Primary visual cortex showed characteristic organization with major changes in the excitatory to inhibitory neuron ratio, expansion of layer 4 excitatory neurons, and specialized inhibitory neurons. These results lay the groundwork for a refined cellular and molecular characterization of human cortical cytoarchitecture and areal specialization.",

We combined data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project with an algorithm that assigns circadian phases to 914 donors, by integrating temporal information from multiple tissues in each individual, to identify messenger RNA (mRNA) rhythms in 46 tissues. Clock transcripts showed conserved timing relationships and tight synchrony across the body. mRNA rhythms varied in breadth, covering global and tissue-specific functions, including metabolic pathways and systemic responses. The clock structure was conserved across sexes and age groups. However, overall gene expression rhythms were highly sex-dimorphic and more sustained in females. Rhythmic programs generally dampened with age across the body.",

    "abstract": "The response to tumor-initiating inflammatory and genetic insults can vary among morphologically indistinguishable cells, suggesting as yet uncharacterized roles for epigenetic plasticity during early neoplasia. To investigate the origins and impact of such plasticity, we performed single-cell analyses on normal, inflamed, premalignant, and malignant tissues in autochthonous models of pancreatic cancer. We reproducibly identified heterogeneous cell states that are primed for diverse, late-emerging neoplastic fates and linked these to chromatin remodeling at cell-cell communication loci. Using an inference approach, we revealed signaling gene modules and tissue-level cross-talk, including a neoplasia-driving feedback loop between discrete epithelial and immune cell populations that was functionally validated in mice. Our results uncover a neoplasia-specific tissue-remodeling program that may be exploited for pancreatic cancer interception.",

To systematically decipher the effects of human genetic variants, we obtained whole-genome sequencing data for 809 individuals from 233 primate species and identified 4.3 million common protein-altering variants with orthologs in humans. We show that these variants can be inferred to have nondeleterious effects in humans based on their presence at high allele frequencies in other primate populations. We use this resource to classify 6% of all possible human protein-altering variants as likely benign and impute the pathogenicity of the remaining 94% of variants with deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy for diagnosing pathogenic variants in patients with genetic diseases.",

Efforts to retool the plant immune system have been limited to modifying natural components and can be nullified by the emergence of new pathogen strains. Made-to-order synthetic plant immune receptors provide an opportunity to tailor resistance to pathogen genotypes present in the field. In this work, we show that plant nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) can be used as scaffolds for nanobody (single-domain antibody fragment) fusions that bind fluorescent proteins (FPs). These fusions trigger immune responses in the presence of the corresponding FP and confer resistance against plant viruses expressing FPs. Because nanobodies can be raised against most molecules, immune receptor\u2013nanobody fusions have the potential to generate resistance against plant pathogens and pests delivering effectors inside host cells.",

A linear relation between thermopower and hydrogen production rate was established as an essential design principle for devices. The system exhibited a thermopower of 8.2 millivolts per kelvin and a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of up to 0.4%. A large-area generator (112 square centimeters) consisting of 36 units yielded an open-circuit voltage of 4.4 volts and a power of 20.1 milliwatts, as well 0.5 millimoles of hydrogen and 0.2 millimoles of oxygen after 6 hours of outdoor operation.",

We used comparative single-nucleus transcriptomics to analyze samples of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from adult humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques, and common marmosets to understand human-specific features of the neocortex. Human, chimpanzee, and gorilla MTG showed highly similar cell-type composition and laminar organization as well as a large shift in proportions of deep-layer intratelencephalic-projecting neurons compared with macaque and marmoset MTG. Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes had more-divergent expression across species compared with neurons or oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and neuronal expression diverged more rapidly on the human lineage. Only a few hundred genes showed human-specific patterning, suggesting that relatively few cellular and molecular changes distinctively define adult human cortical structure.",

However, conventional rigid pumps, with their associated noise and vibration, are unsuitable for most wearables. We report fluidic pumps in the form of stretchable fibers. This allows pressure sources to be integrated directly into textiles, enabling untethered wearable fluidics. Our pumps consist of continuous helical electrodes embedded within the walls of thin elastomer tubing and generate pressure silently through charge-injection electrohydrodynamics. Each meter of fiber generates 100 kilopascals of pressure, and flow rates approaching 55 milliliters per minute are possible, which is equivalent to a power density of 15 watts per kilogram. The benefits in design freedom are considerable, which we illustrate with demonstrations of wearable haptics, mechanically active fabrics, and thermoregulatory textiles.",

However, this reaction typically requires ultraviolet light, which limits applicability. In this study, we introduce disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC), a supramolecular approach to induce the E -to- Z isomerization by using light of a desired color, including red. DESC relies on a combination of a macrocyclic host and a photosensitizer, which act together to selectively bind and sensitize E -azobenzenes for isomerization. The Z isomer lacks strong affinity for and is expelled from the host, which can then convert additional E- azobenzenes to the Z state. In this way, the host\u2013photosensitizer complex converts photon energy into chemical energy in the form of out-of-equilibrium photostationary states, including ones that cannot be accessed through direct photoexcitation.",

We report a site-directable aryl C-to-N replacement reaction allowing unified access to various pyridine isomers through a nitrene-internalization process. In a two-step, one-pot procedure, aryl azides are first photochemically converted to 3 H -azepines, which then undergo an oxidatively triggered C2-selective cheletropic carbon extrusion through a spirocyclic azanorcaradiene intermediate to afford the pyridine products. Because the ipso carbon of the aryl nitrene is excised from the molecule, the reaction proceeds regioselectively without perturbation of the remainder of the substrate. Applications are demonstrated in the abbreviated synthesis of a pyridyl derivative of estrone, as well as in a prototypical nitrogen scan.",

    "abstract": "Most cancers exhibit aneuploidy, but its functional significance in tumor development is controversial. Here, we describe ReDACT (Restoring Disomy in Aneuploid cells using CRISPR Targeting), a set of chromosome engineering tools that allow us to eliminate specific aneuploidies from cancer genomes. Using ReDACT, we created a panel of isogenic cells that have or lack common aneuploidies, and we demonstrate that trisomy of chromosome 1q is required for malignant growth in cancers harboring this alteration. Mechanistically, gaining chromosome 1q increases the expression of MDM4 and suppresses p53 signaling, and we show that TP53 mutations are mutually exclusive with 1q aneuploidy in human cancers. Thus, tumor cells can be dependent on specific aneuploidies, raising the possibility that these \u201caneuploidy addictions\u201d could be targeted as a therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Zeolites are microporous silicates with a large variety of applications as catalysts, adsorbents, and cation exchangers. Stable silica-based zeolites with increased porosity are in demand to allow adsorption and processing of large molecules but challenge our synthetic ability. We report a new, highly stable pure silica zeolite called ZEO-3, which has a multidimensional, interconnected system of extra-large pores open through windows made by 16 and 14 silicate tetrahedra, the least dense polymorph of silica known so far. This zeolite was formed by an unprecedented one-dimensional to three-dimensional (1D-to-3D) topotactic condensation of a chain silicate. With a specific surface area of more than 1000 square meters per gram, ZEO-3 showed a high performance for volatile organic compound abatement and recovery compared with other zeolites and metal-organic frameworks.",

We discovered a noncovalent, nonpeptidic inhibitor scaffold with lead-like properties that is differentiated from current main protease inhibitors. Our approach leveraged crowdsourcing, machine learning, exascale molecular simulations, and high-throughput structural biology and chemistry. We generated a detailed map of the structural plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, extensive structure-activity relationships for multiple chemotypes, and a wealth of biochemical activity data. All compound designs (>18,000 designs), crystallographic data (>490 ligand-bound x-ray structures), assay data (>10,000 measurements), and synthesized molecules (>2400 compounds) for this campaign were shared rapidly and openly, creating a rich, open, and intellectual property\u2013free knowledge base for future anticoronavirus drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Interfacing electronics with neural tissue is crucial for understanding complex biological functions, but conventional bioelectronics consist of rigid electrodes fundamentally incompatible with living systems. The difference between static solid-state electronics and dynamic biological matter makes seamless integration of the two challenging. To address this incompatibility, we developed a method to dynamically create soft substrate-free conducting materials within the biological environment. We demonstrate in vivo electrode formation in zebrafish and leech models, using endogenous metabolites to trigger enzymatic polymerization of organic precursors within an injectable gel, thereby forming conducting polymer gels with long-range conductivity. This approach can be used to target specific biological substructures and is suitable for nerve stimulation, paving the way for fully integrated, in vivo\u2013fabricated electronics within the nervous system.",

We present TOGA (Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments), a method that integrates structural gene annotation and orthology inference. TOGA implements a different paradigm to infer orthologous loci, improves ortholog detection and annotation of conserved genes compared with state-of-the-art methods, and handles even highly fragmented assemblies. TOGA scales to hundreds of genomes, which we demonstrate by applying it to 488 placental mammal and 501 bird assemblies, creating the largest comparative gene resources so far. Additionally, TOGA detects gene losses, enables selection screens, and automatically provides a superior measure of mammalian genome quality. TOGA is a powerful and scalable method to annotate and compare genes in the genomic era.",

    "abstract": "Waste plastics are an abundant feedstock for the production of renewable chemicals. Pyrolysis of waste plastics produces pyrolysis oils with high concentrations of olefins (>50 weight %). The traditional petrochemical industry uses several energy-intensive steps to produce olefins from fossil feedstocks such as naphtha, natural gas, and crude oil. In this work, we demonstrate that pyrolysis oil can be used to produce aldehydes through hydroformylation, taking advantage of the olefin functionality. These aldehydes can then be reduced to mono- and dialcohols, oxidized to mono- and dicarboxylic acids, or aminated to mono- and diamines by using homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. This route produces high-value oxygenated chemicals from low-value postconsumer recycled polyethylene. We project that the chemicals produced by this route could lower greenhouse gas emissions ~60% compared with their production through petroleum feedstocks.",

These highly valuable compounds are sourced by extraction from the bark, and their biosynthetic pathway is unknown. Here, we sequenced the Q. saponaria genome. Through genome mining and combinatorial expression in tobacco, we identified 16 pathway enzymes that together enable the production of advanced QS pathway intermediates that represent a bridgehead for adjuvant bioengineering. We further identified the enzymes needed to make QS-7, a saponin with excellent therapeutic properties and low toxicity that is present in low abundance in Q. saponaria bark extract. Our results enable the production of Q. saponaria vaccine adjuvants in tobacco and open the way for new routes to access and engineer natural and new-to-nature immunostimulants.",

    "abstract": "Comparative analysis of primate genomes within a phylogenetic context is essential for understanding the evolution of human genetic architecture and primate diversity. We present such a study of 50 primate species spanning 38 genera and 14 families, including 27 genomes first reported here, with many from previously less well represented groups, the New World monkeys and the Strepsirrhini. Our analyses reveal heterogeneous rates of genomic rearrangement and gene evolution across primate lineages. Thousands of genes under positive selection in different lineages play roles in the nervous, skeletal, and digestive systems and may have contributed to primate innovations and adaptations. Our study reveals that many key genomic innovations occurred in the Simiiformes ancestral node and may have had an impact on the adaptive radiation of the Simiiformes and human evolution.",

    "abstract": "During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, multiple variants escaping preexisting immunity emerged, causing reinfections of previously exposed individuals. Here, we used antigenic cartography to analyze patterns of cross-reactivity among 21 variants and 15 groups of human sera obtained after primary infection with 10 different variants or after messenger RNA (mRNA)\u20131273 or mRNA-1273.351 vaccination. We found antigenic differences among pre-Omicron variants caused by substitutions at spike-protein positions 417, 452, 484, and 501. Quantifying changes in response breadth over time and with additional vaccine doses, our results show the largest increase between 4 weeks and >3 months after a second dose. We found changes in immunodominance of different spike regions, depending on the variant an individual was first exposed to, with implications for variant risk assessment and vaccine-strain selection.",

However, reconstructing CO 2 beyond direct measurements requires the use of paleoproxies and herein lies the challenge, as proxies differ in their assumptions, degree of understanding, and even reconstructed values. In this study, we critically evaluated, categorized, and integrated available proxies to create a high-fidelity and transparently constructed atmospheric CO 2 record spanning the past 66 million years. This newly constructed record provides clearer evidence for higher Earth system sensitivity in the past and for the role of CO 2 thresholds in biological and cryosphere evolution.",

We present a new and highly efficient catalyst created by modifying a Ni-Bi liquid alloy with the addition of Mo to produce a ternary NiMo-Bi liquid alloy catalyst (LAC). This catalyst exhibited a considerably low activation energy of 81.2 kilojoules per mole, which enabled MP at temperatures between 450 and 800 Celsius and a hydrogen generation efficiency of 4.05 ml per gram of nickel per minute. At 800 Celsius, the catalyst exhibited 100% H 2 selectivity and 120 hours of stability.",

The protein-metabolite interactions that mediate these networks are frequently low affinity and challenging to systematically discover. We developed mass spectrometry integrated with equilibrium dialysis for the discovery of allostery systematically (MIDAS) to identify such interactions. Analysis of 33 enzymes from human carbohydrate metabolism identified 830 protein-metabolite interactions, including known regulators, substrates, and products as well as previously unreported interactions. We functionally validated a subset of interactions, including the isoform-specific inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by long-chain acyl\u2013coenzyme A. Cell treatment with fatty acids caused a loss of pyruvate-lactate interconversion dependent on lactate dehydrogenase isoform expression. These protein-metabolite interactions may contribute to the dynamic, tissue-specific metabolic flexibility that enables growth and survival in an ever-changing nutrient environment.",

We mapped the metabolic capabilities of 224 leaf isolates from Arabidopsis thaliana by assessing the growth of each strain on 45 environmentally relevant carbon sources in vitro. We used these data to build curated genome-scale metabolic models for all strains, which we combined to simulate >17,500 interactions.

By using time series single-cell RNA sequencing to profile brassinosteroid-responsive gene expression specific to different cell types and developmental stages of the Arabidopsis root, we identified the elongating cortex as a site where brassinosteroids trigger a shift from proliferation to elongation associated with increased expression of cell wall\u2013related genes. Our analysis revealed HOMEOBOX FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 7 ( HAT7 ) and GT-2-LIKE 1 ( GTL1 ) as brassinosteroid-responsive transcription factors that regulate cortex cell elongation. These results establish the cortex as a site of brassinosteroid-mediated growth and unveil a brassinosteroid signaling network regulating the transition from proliferation to elongation, which illuminates aspects of spatiotemporal hormone responses.",

We report that cyclobutane-based mechanophore cross-linkers that break through force-triggered cycloreversion lead to networks that are up to nine times as tough as conventional analogs. The response is attributed to a combination of long, strong primary polymer strands and cross-linker scission forces that are approximately fivefold smaller than control cross-linkers at the same timescales. The enhanced toughness comes without the hysteresis associated with noncovalent cross-linking, and it is observed in two different acrylate elastomers, in fatigue as well as constant displacement rate tension, and in a gel as well as elastomers.",

Microbial DPP4 was able to decrease the active glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and disrupt glucose metabolism in mice with a leaky gut. Furthermore, the current drugs targeting human DPP4, including sitagliptin, had little effect on microbial DPP4.

We experimentally report an attractive strain hardening rate throughout the deformation stage at 77 kelvin in a stable single-phase alloy with gradient dislocation cells that even surpasses its coarse-grained counterparts. Contrary to conventional understanding, the exceptional strain hardening arises from a distinctive dynamic structural refinement mechanism facilitated by the emission and motion of massive multiorientational tiny stacking faults (planar defects), which are fundamentally distinct from the traditional linear dislocation\u2013mediated deformation. The dominance of atomic-scale planar deformation faulting in plastic deformation introduces a different approach for strengthening and hardening metallic materials, offering promising properties and potential applications.",

    "abstract": "Second- and third-row transition metal complexes are widely employed in photocatalysis, whereas earth-abundant first-row transition metals have found only limited use because of the prohibitively fast decay of their excited states. We report an unforeseen reactivity mode for productive photocatalysis that uses cobalt polypyridyl complexes as photocatalysts by exploiting Marcus inverted region behavior that couples increases in excited-state energies with increased excited-state lifetimes. These cobalt (III) complexes can engage in bimolecular reactivity by virtue of their strong redox potentials and sufficiently long excited-state lifetimes, catalyzing oxidative C(sp 2 )\u2013N coupling of aryl amides with challenging sterically hindered aryl boronic acids. More generally, the results imply that chromophores can be designed to increase excited-state lifetimes while simultaneously increasing excited-state energies, providing a pathway for the use of relatively abundant metals as photoredox catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Photon emission is the hallmark of light-matter interaction and the foundation of photonic quantum science, enabling advanced sources for quantum communication and computing. Although single-emitter radiation can be tailored by the photonic environment, the introduction of multiple emitters extends this picture. A fundamental challenge, however, is that the radiative dipole-dipole coupling rapidly decays with spatial separation, typically within a fraction of the optical wavelength. We realize distant dipole-dipole radiative coupling with pairs of solid-state optical quantum emitters embedded in a nanophotonic waveguide. We dynamically probe the collective response and identify both super- and subradiant emission as well as means to control the dynamics by proper excitation techniques. Our work constitutes a foundational step toward multiemitter applications for scalable quantum-information processing.",

    "abstract": "Negative refraction provides a platform to manipulate mid-infrared and terahertz radiation for molecular sensing and thermal emission applications. However, its implementation based on metamaterials and plasmonic media presents challenges with optical losses, limited spatial confinement, and lack of active tunability in this spectral range. We demonstrate gate-tunable negative refraction at mid-infrared frequencies using hybrid topological polaritons in van der Waals heterostructures. Specifically, we visualize wide-angle negatively refracted polaritons in \u03b1-MoO 3 films partially decorated with graphene, undergoing reversible planar nanoscale focusing. Our atomically thick heterostructures weaken scattering losses at the interface while enabling an actively tunable transition of normal to negative refraction through electrical gating. We propose polaritonic negative refraction as a promising platform for infrared applications such as electrically tunable super-resolution imaging, nanoscale thermal manipulation, enhanced molecular sensing, and on-chip optical circuitry.",

However, existing technologies typically involve photocurable resins that reduce material purity and degrade properties. We develop a general strategy for laser direct printing of inorganic nanomaterials, as exemplified by more than 10 semiconductors, metal oxides, metals, and their mixtures. Colloidal nanocrystals are used as building blocks and photochemically bonded through their native ligands. Without resins, this bonding process produces arbitrary three-dimensional (3D) structures with a large inorganic mass fraction (~90%) and high mechanical strength. The printed materials preserve the intrinsic properties of constituent nanocrystals and create structure-dictated functionalities, such as the broadband chiroptical responses with an anisotropic factor of ~0.24 for semiconducting cadmium chalcogenide nanohelical arrays.",

By intersecting our results with genetic risk factors for human brain diseases, we identified the cortical cell types and lineages most vulnerable to genetic insults of different brain disorders, especially autism. We find that lineage-specific gene expression programs up-regulated in female cells are especially enriched for the genetic risk factors of autism.

Using an ensemble of observations, we quantified global land water availability over the past two decades. We show that the Southern Hemisphere has dominated the declining trend in global water availability from 2001 to 2020. The significant decrease occurs mainly in South America, southwestern Africa, and northwestern Australia. In the Northern Hemisphere, the complex regional increasing and decreasing trends cancel each other, resulting in a negligible hemispheric trend. The variability and trend in water availability in the Southern Hemisphere are largely driven by precipitation associated with climate modes, particularly the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation. This study highlights their dominant role in controlling global water availability.",

We discovered that the temperature dependence of weathering expressed as an activation energy increases from laboratory to watershed as transport, clay precipitation, disaggregation, and fracturing increasingly couple to dissolution. A simple upscaling to the global system indicates that the temperature dependence decreases to ~22 kilojoules per mole because (i) the lack of runoff limits weathering and retains base metal cations on half the land surface and (ii) other landscapes are regolith-shielded and show little weathering response to temperature. By comparing weathering from laboratory to globe, we reconcile some aspects of kinetic and thermodynamic controls on CO 2 drawdown by natural or enhanced weathering.",

We report that the microbiota reprograms intestinal lipid metabolism in mice by repressing the expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Snhg9 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 9) in small intestinal epithelial cells. Snhg9 suppressed the activity of peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3)\u2014a central regulator of lipid metabolism\u2014by dissociating the PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor sirtuin 1 from cell cycle and apoptosis protein 2 (CCAR2). Forced expression of Snhg9 in the intestinal epithelium of conventional mice impaired lipid absorption, reduced body fat, and protected against diet-induced obesity. The microbiota repressed Snhg9 expression through an immune relay encompassing myeloid cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells. Our findings thus identify an unanticipated role for a lncRNA in microbial control of host metabolism.",

This allows the transmission phase at the nanoscale to be controlled by the hole diameter. We fabricated an EUV metalens with a 10-millimeter focal length that supports numerical apertures of up to 0.05 and used it to focus ultrashort EUV light bursts generated by high-harmonic generation down to a 0.7-micrometer waist. Our approach introduces the vast light-shaping possibilities provided by dielectric metasurfaces to a spectral regime that lacks materials for transmissive optics.",

We provide a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of genetic variation across an alignment of 241 placental mammal genome assemblies, addressing prior concerns regarding limited genomic sampling across species. We compared neutral genome-wide phylogenomic signals using concatenation and coalescent-based approaches, interrogated phylogenetic variation across chromosomes, and analyzed extensive catalogs of structural variants. Interordinal relationships exhibit relatively low rates of phylogenomic conflict across diverse datasets and analytical methods. Conversely, X-chromosome versus autosome conflicts characterize multiple independent clades that radiated during the Cenozoic. Genomic time trees reveal an accumulation of cladogenic events before and immediately after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, implying important roles for Cretaceous continental vicariance and the K-Pg extinction in the placental radiation.",

    "abstract": "Carbon storage in forests is a cornerstone of policy-making to prevent global warming from exceeding 1.5\u00b0C. However, the global impact of management (for example, harvesting) on the carbon budget of forests remains poorly quantified. We integrated global maps of forest biomass and management with machine learning to show that by removing human intervention, under current climatic conditions and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration, existing global forests could increase their aboveground biomass by up to 44.1 (error range: 21.0 to 63.0) petagrams of carbon. This is an increase of 15 to 16% over current levels, equating to about 4 years of current anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Therefore, without strong reductions in emissions, this strategy holds low mitigation potential, and the forest sink should be preserved to offset residual carbon emissions rather than to compensate for present emissions levels.",

    "abstract": "The role of chirality in determining the spin dynamics of photoinduced electron transfer in donor-acceptor molecules remains an open question. Although chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) has been demonstrated in molecules bound to substrates, experimental information about whether this process influences spin dynamics in the molecules themselves is lacking. Here we used time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that CISS strongly influences the spin dynamics of isolated covalent donor\u2013chiral bridge\u2013acceptor (D-B\u03c7-A) molecules in which selective photoexcitation of D is followed by two rapid, sequential electron-transfer events to yield D \u2022+ -B\u03c7-A \u2022\u2013 . Exploiting this phenomenon affords the possibility of using chiral molecular building blocks to control electron spin states in quantum information applications.",

Here, we comprehensively examined human brain cell epigenomes by probing DNA methylation and chromatin conformation at single-cell resolution in 517 thousand cells (399 thousand neurons and 118 thousand non-neurons) from 46 regions of three adult male brains. We identified 188 cell types and characterized their molecular signatures. Integrative analyses revealed concordant changes in DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, chromatin organization, and gene expression across cell types, cortical areas, and basal ganglia structures. We further developed single-cell methylation barcodes that reliably predict brain cell types using the methylation status of select genomic sites. This multimodal epigenomic brain cell atlas provides new insights into the complexity of cell-type\u2013specific gene regulation in adult human brains.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is shifting the growing seasons of plants, affecting species performance and biogeochemical cycles. Yet how the timing of autumn leaf senescence in Northern Hemisphere forests will change remains uncertain. Using satellite, ground, carbon flux, and experimental data, we show that early-season and late-season warming have opposite effects on leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring after the year\u2019s longest day (the summer solstice). Across 84% of the northern forest area, increased temperature and vegetation activity before the solstice led to an earlier senescence onset of, on average, 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 days per \u00b0C, whereas warmer post-solstice temperatures extended senescence duration by 2.6 \u00b1 0.1 days per \u00b0C. The current trajectories toward an earlier onset and slowed progression of senescence affect Northern Hemisphere\u2013wide trends in growing-season length and forest productivity.",

    "abstract": "Using DNA methylation profiles ( n = 15,456) from 348 mammalian species, we constructed phyloepigenetic trees that bear marked similarities to traditional phylogenetic ones. Using unsupervised clustering across all samples, we identified 55 distinct cytosine modules, of which 30 are related to traits such as maximum life span, adult weight, age, sex, and human mortality risk. Maximum life span is associated with methylation levels in HOXL subclass homeobox genes and developmental processes and is potentially regulated by pluripotency transcription factors. The methylation state of some modules responds to perturbations such as caloric restriction, ablation of growth hormone receptors, consumption of high-fat diets, and expression of Yamanaka factors. This study reveals an intertwined evolution of the genome and epigenome that mediates the biological characteristics and traits of different mammalian species.",

In this work, we show that the atmospheric Arctic Dipole (AD) associated with anticyclonic winds over North America and cyclonic winds over Eurasia modulates inflows from the North Atlantic across the Nordic Seas. The alternating AD phases create a \u201cswitchgear mechanism.\u201d From 2007 to 2021, this switchgear mechanism weakened northward inflows and enhanced sea-ice export across Fram Strait and increased inflows throughout the Barents Sea. By favoring stronger Arctic Ocean circulation, transferring freshwater into the Amerasian Basin, boosting stratification, and lowering oceanic heat fluxes there after 2007, AD+ contributed to slowing sea-ice loss. A transition to an AD\u2212 phase may accelerate the Arctic sea-ice decline, which would further change the Arctic climate system.",

However, the electric fields required to reverse their polarization direction and unlock electronic and optical functions need substantial reduction for operational compatibility with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics. To understand this process, we observed and quantified real-time polarization switching of a representative ferroelectric wurtzite (Al 0.94 B 0.06 N) at the atomic scale with scanning transmission electron microscopy. The analysis revealed a polarization reversal model in which puckered aluminum/boron nitride rings in the wurtzite basal planes gradually flatten and adopt a transient nonpolar geometry. Independent first-principles simulations reveal the details and energetics of the reversal process through an antipolar phase. This model and local mechanistic understanding are a critical initial step for property engineering efforts in this emerging material class.",

Routes that oxidatively remove hydrogen as water have safety and cost challenges. We coupled chemical looping\u2013selective hydrogen (H 2 ) combustion and PDH with multifunctional ferric vanadate\u2013vanadium oxide (FeVO 4 -VO x ) redox catalysts. Well-dispersed VO x supported on aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) provides dehydrogenation sites, and adjacent nanoscale FeVO 4 acts as an oxygen carrier for subsequent H 2 combustion. We achieved an integral performance of 81.3% propylene selectivity at 42.7% propane conversion at 550\u00b0C for 200 chemical looping cycles for the reoxidization of FeVO 4 . Based on catalytic experiments, spectroscopic characterization, and theory calculations, we propose a hydrogen spillover\u2013mediated coupling mechanism. The hydrogen species generated at the VO x sites migrated to adjacent FeVO 4 for combustion, which shifted PDH toward propylene. This mechanism is favored by the proximity between the dehydrogenation and combustion sites.",

Furthermore, we found two hippopotamid butchery sites associated with mosaic vegetation and a C 4 grazer\u2013dominated fauna. Tool flaking proficiency was comparable with that of younger Oldowan assemblages, but pounding activities were more common. Tool use-wear and bone damage indicate plant and animal tissue processing. Paranthropus sp. teeth, the first from southwestern Kenya, possessed carbon isotopic values indicative of a diet rich in C 4 foods.

However, a method that allows simultaneous profiling of chromatin architecture and gene expression has not been reported. Here, we developed an assay named \u201cHi-C and RNA-seq employed simultaneously\u201d (HiRES) and performed it on thousands of single cells from developing mouse embryos. Single-cell three-dimensional genome structures, despite being heavily determined by the cell cycle and developmental stages, gradually diverged in a cell type\u2013specific manner as development progressed. By comparing the pseudotemporal dynamics of chromatin interactions with gene expression, we found a widespread chromatin rewiring that occurred before transcription activation. Our results demonstrate that the establishment of specific chromatin interactions is tightly related to transcriptional control and cell functions during lineage specification.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms that maintain microbial biodiversity is a critical aspiration in ecology. Past work on microbial coexistence has largely focused on species pairs, but it is unclear whether pairwise coexistence in isolation is required for coexistence in a multispecies community. To address this question, we conducted hundreds of pairwise competition experiments among the stably coexisting members of 12 different enrichment communities in vitro. To determine the outcomes of these experiments, we developed an automated image analysis pipeline to quantify species abundances. We found that competitive exclusion was the most common outcome, and it was strongly hierarchical and transitive. Because many species that coexist within a stable multispecies community fail to coexist in pairwise co-culture under identical conditions, we concluded that multispecies coexistence is an emergent phenomenon. This work highlights the importance of community context for understanding the origins of coexistence in complex ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Neuropeptides are key signaling molecules in the endocrine and nervous systems that regulate many critical physiological processes. Understanding the functions of neuropeptides in vivo requires the ability to monitor their dynamics with high specificity, sensitivity, and spatiotemporal resolution. However, this has been hindered by the lack of direct, sensitive, and noninvasive tools. We developed a series of GRAB (G protein\u2013coupled receptor activation\u2012based) sensors for detecting somatostatin (SST), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), cholecystokinin (CCK), neuropeptide Y (NPY), neurotensin (NTS), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These fluorescent sensors, which enable detection of specific neuropeptide binding at nanomolar concentrations, establish a robust tool kit for studying the release, function, and regulation of neuropeptides under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",

The spectroscopic features of the organic matter are consistent with those in chemically primitive carbonaceous chondrite meteorites that experienced parent-body aqueous alteration (reactions with liquid water). The morphology of the organic carbon includes nanoglobules and diffuse carbon associated with phyllosilicate and carbonate minerals. Deuterium and/or nitrogen-15 enrichments indicate that the organic matter formed in a cold molecular cloud or the presolar nebula.

Here, we report six cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of GPR120 in complex with FA hormones or TUG891 and G i or G iq trimers. Aromatic residues inside the GPR120 ligand pocket were responsible for recognizing different double-bond positions of these FAs and connect ligand recognition to distinct effector coupling. We also investigated synthetic ligand selectivity and the structural basis of missense single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We reveal how GPR120 differentiates rigid double bonds and flexible single bonds. The knowledge gleaned here may facilitate rational drug design targeting to GPR120.",

Further, we observe that removing reshared content produces clear decreases in news knowledge within the sample, although there is some uncertainty about how this would generalize to all users. Contrary to expectations, the treatment does not significantly affect political polarization or any measure of individual-level political attitudes.",

Despite the commercial value of limonoids, a complete biosynthetic route has not been described.

Unfortunately, the enormous use of plastics and lack of effective disposal or recycling options have created a plastic waste catastrophe. In this work, we report an approach to create chemically recyclable polyolefin-like materials with diverse mechanical properties through the construction of multiblock polymers from hard and soft oligomeric building blocks synthesized with ruthenium-mediated ring-opening metathesis polymerization of cyclooctenes. The multiblock polymers exhibit broad mechanical properties, spanning elastomers to plastomers to thermoplastics, while integrating a high melting transition temperature ( T m ) and low glass transition temperature ( T g ), making them suitable for use across diverse applications ( T m as high as 128\u00b0C and T g as low as \u201360\u00b0C). After use, the different plastics can be combined and efficiently deconstructed back to the fundamental hard and soft building blocks for separation and repolymerization to realize a closed-loop recycling process.",

Plants offer advantages for addressing this problem because their cells do not migrate or rearrange during morphogenesis, which simplifies analysis. We synthesize results from experimental analysis and computational modeling to show how mechanical interactions between cellulose fibers translate through wall, cell, and tissue levels to generate complex plant tissue shapes. Genes can modify mechanical properties and stresses at each level, though the values and pattern of stresses differ from one level to the next. The dynamic cellulose network provides elastic resistance to deformation while allowing growth through fiber sliding, which enables morphogenesis while maintaining mechanical strength.",

Whether restoring neurological functions requires directed regeneration of axons from specific neuronal subpopulations to their natural target regions remains unclear. To address this question, we applied projection-specific and comparative single-nucleus RNA sequencing to identify neuronal subpopulations that restore walking after incomplete SCI. We show that chemoattracting and guiding the transected axons of these neurons to their natural target region led to substantial recovery of walking after complete SCI in mice, whereas regeneration of axons simply across the lesion had no effect. Thus, reestablishing the natural projections of characterized neurons forms an essential part of axon regeneration strategies aimed at restoring lost neurological functions.",

We incorporated FLSHclust into a CRISPR discovery pipeline and identified 188 previously unreported CRISPR-linked gene modules, revealing many additional biochemical functions coupled to adaptive immunity. We experimentally characterized three HNH nuclease\u2013containing CRISPR systems, including the first type IV system with a specified interference mechanism, and engineered them for genome editing.

    "abstract": "Twisted interfaces between stacked van der Waals (vdW) cuprate crystals present a platform for engineering superconducting order parameters by adjusting stacking angles. Using a cryogenic assembly technique, we construct twisted vdW Josephson junctions (JJs) at atomically sharp interfaces between Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ x crystals, with quality approaching the limit set by intrinsic JJs. Near 45\u00b0 twist angle, we observe fractional Shapiro steps and Fraunhofer patterns, consistent with the existence of two degenerate Josephson ground states related by time-reversal symmetry (TRS). By programming the JJ current bias sequence, we controllably break TRS to place the JJ into either of the two ground states, realizing reversible Josephson diodes without external magnetic fields. Our results open a path to engineering topological devices at higher temperatures.",

    "abstract": "A closed-loop, autonomous molecular discovery platform driven by integrated machine learning tools was developed to accelerate the design of molecules with desired properties. We demonstrated two case studies on dye-like molecules, targeting absorption wavelength, lipophilicity, and photooxidative stability. In the first study, the platform experimentally realized 294 unreported molecules across three automatic iterations of molecular design-make-test-analyze cycles while exploring the structure-function space of four rarely reported scaffolds. In each iteration, the property prediction models that guided exploration learned the structure-property space of diverse scaffold derivatives, which were realized with multistep syntheses and a variety of reactions. The second study exploited property models trained on the explored chemical space and previously reported molecules to discover nine top-performing molecules within a lightly explored structure-property space.",

However, the flow-sensing mechanism has long remained elusive. In this work, we show that immotile cilia at the node undergo asymmetric deformation along the dorsoventral axis in response to the flow. Application of mechanical stimuli to immotile cilia by optical tweezers induced calcium ion transients and degradation of Dand5 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the targeted cells. The Pkd2 channel protein was preferentially localized to the dorsal side of immotile cilia, and calcium ion transients were preferentially induced by mechanical stimuli directed toward the ventral side. Our results uncover the biophysical mechanism by which immotile cilia at the node sense the direction of fluid flow.",

The cellular and molecular events in the developing hippocampus that underlie the emergence of precise, episodic-like memory are unclear. In mice, the absence of a competitive neuronal engram allocation process in the immature hippocampus precluded the formation of sparse engrams and precise memories until the fourth postnatal week, when inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus mature. This age-dependent shift in precision of episodic-like memories involved the functional maturation of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in subfield CA1 through assembly of extracellular perineuronal nets, which is necessary and sufficient for the onset of competitive neuronal allocation, sparse engram formation, and memory precision.",

Since 2018, more than 10 billion snow crab have disappeared from the eastern Bering Sea, and the population collapsed to historical lows in 2021. We link this collapse to a marine heatwave in the eastern Bering Sea during 2018 and 2019. Calculated caloric requirements, reduced spatial distribution, and observed body conditions suggest that starvation played a role in the collapse. The mortality event appears to be one of the largest reported losses of motile marine macrofauna to marine heatwaves globally.",

However, the regulatory programs governing cell identity and function remain unclear. Using a single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq), we explored open chromatin landscapes across 1.1 million cells in 42 brain regions from three adults. Integrating this data unveiled 107 distinct cell types and their specific utilization of 544,735 candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements (cCREs) in the human genome. Nearly a third of the cCREs demonstrated conservation and chromatin accessibility in the mouse brain cells. We reveal strong links between specific brain cell types and neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and major depression, and have developed deep learning models to predict the regulatory roles of noncoding risk variants in these disorders.",

Rapid GABAergic neuron viral genetic labeling plus Patch-seq (patch-clamp electrophysiology plus single-cell RNA sequencing) sampling in human brain slices was used to reliably target and analyze GABAergic neuron subclasses and individual transcriptomic types. This characterization elucidated transitions between PVALB and SST subclasses, revealed morphological heterogeneity within an abundant transcriptomic type, identified multiple spatially distinct types of the primate-specialized double bouquet cells (DBCs), and shed light on cellular differences between homologous mouse and human neocortical GABAergic neuron types.

Therefore, without rigorously showing that it can outperform traditional species-focused alternatives, its broad-scale adoption in conservation is unlikely. We present a large-scale replicated and controlled set of whole-lake experiments in fish conservation (20 lakes monitored over 6 years with more than 150,000 fish sampled) to examine the outcomes of ecosystem-based habitat enhancement (coarse woody habitat addition and shallow littoral zone creation) versus a widespread, species-focused alternative that has long dominated fisheries management practice (i.e., fish stocking). Adding coarse woody habitats alone did not, on average, enhance fish abundance, but creating shallow water habitat consistently did, especially for juvenile fish. Species-focused fish stocking completely failed. We provide strong evidence questioning the performance of species-focused conservation actions in aquatic ecosystems and instead recommend ecosystem-based management of key habitats.",

Lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) harness receptors, such as the cation-independent mannose 6\u2013phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), to direct extracellular proteins to lysosomes. In this work, we used a genome-wide CRISPR knockout approach to identify modulators of LYTAC-mediated membrane protein degradation in human cells. We found that disrupting retromer genes improved target degradation by reducing LYTAC recycling to the plasma membrane. Neddylated cullin-3 facilitated LYTAC-complex lysosomal maturation and was a predictive marker for LYTAC efficacy. A substantial fraction of cell surface CI-M6PR remains occupied by endogenous M6P-modified glycoproteins. Thus, inhibition of M6P biosynthesis increased the internalization of LYTAC-target complexes. Our findings inform design strategies for next-generation LYTACs and elucidate aspects of cell surface receptor occupancy and trafficking.",

Here, we demonstrated that immotile LRO cilia are mechanosensors for shear force using a methodological pipeline that combines optical tweezers, light sheet microscopy, and deep learning to permit in vivo analyses in zebrafish. Mechanical manipulation of immotile LRO cilia activated intraciliary calcium transients that required the cation channel Polycystin-2. Furthermore, mechanical force applied to LRO cilia was sufficient to rescue and reverse cardiac situs in zebrafish that lack motile cilia. Thus, LRO cilia are mechanosensitive cellular levers that convert biomechanical forces into calcium signals to instruct left-right asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Taxon-specific small RNA loci are widespread in eukaryotic genomes, yet their role in lineage-specific adaptation, phenotypic diversification, and speciation is poorly understood. Here, we report that a speciation locus in monkeyflowers ( Mimulus ), YELLOW UPPER ( YUP ), contains an inverted repeat region that produces small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in a phased pattern. Although the inverted repeat is derived from a partial duplication of a protein-coding gene that is not involved in flower pigmentation, one of the siRNAs targets and represses a master regulator of floral carotenoid pigmentation. YUP emerged with two protein-coding genes that control other aspects of flower coloration as a \u201csuperlocus\u201d in a subclade of Mimulus and has contributed to subsequent phenotypic diversification and pollinator-mediated speciation in the descendant species.",

    "abstract": "Thousands of genomic regions have been associated with heritable human diseases, but attempts to elucidate biological mechanisms are impeded by an inability to discern which genomic positions are functionally important. Evolutionary constraint is a powerful predictor of function, agnostic to cell type or disease mechanism. Single-base phyloP scores from 240 mammals identified 3.3% of the human genome as significantly constrained and likely functional. We compared phyloP scores to genome annotation, association studies, copy-number variation, clinical genetics findings, and cancer data. Constrained positions are enriched for variants that explain common disease heritability more than other functional annotations. Our results improve variant annotation but also highlight that the regulatory landscape of the human genome still needs to be further explored and linked to disease.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, different organelles interact at membrane contact sites stabilized by tethers. Mitochondrial mitofusin 2 (MFN2) acts as a membrane tether that interacts with an unknown partner on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this work, we identified the MFN2 splice variant ERMIT2 as the ER tethering partner of MFN2. Splicing of MFN2 produced ERMIT2 and ERMIN2, two ER-specific variants. ERMIN2 regulated ER morphology, whereas ERMIT2 localized at the ER-mitochondria interface and interacted with mitochondrial mitofusins to tether ER and mitochondria. This tethering allowed efficient mitochondrial calcium ion uptake and phospholipid transfer. Expression of ERMIT2 ameliorated the ER stress, inflammation, and fibrosis typical of liver-specific Mfn2 knockout mice. Thus, ER-specific MFN2 variants display entirely extramitochondrial MFN2 functions involved in interorganellar tethering and liver metabolic activities.",

In this work, we demonstrate dipolar spin-exchange interactions between single calcium monofluoride (CaF) molecules trapped in an optical tweezer array. We realized the spin- 1 2 quantum XY model by encoding an effective spin- 1 2 system into the rotational states of the molecules and used it to generate a Bell state through an iSWAP operation. Conditioned on the verified existence of molecules in both tweezers at the end of the measurement, we obtained a Bell state fidelity of 0.89(6). Using interleaved tweezer arrays, we demonstrate single-site molecular addressability.",

    "abstract": "It is known that interactions between nociceptors and dendritic cells (DCs) can modulate immune responses in barrier tissues. However, our understanding of the underlying communication frameworks remains rudimentary. Here, we show that nociceptors control DCs in three molecularly distinct ways. First, nociceptors release the calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide that imparts a distinct transcriptional profile on steady-state DCs characterized by expression of pro\u2013interleukin-1\u03b2 and other genes implicated in DC sentinel functions. Second, nociceptor activation induces contact-dependent calcium fluxes and membrane depolarization in DCs and enhances their production of proinflammatory cytokines when stimulated. Finally, nociceptor-derived chemokine CCL2 contributes to the orchestration of DC-dependent local inflammation and the induction of adaptive responses against skin-acquired antigens. Thus, the combined actions of nociceptor-derived chemokines, neuropeptides, and electrical activity fine-tune DC responses in barrier tissues.",

Although the proteasome also eliminates proteins that are not ubiquitinated, how this occurs mechanistically is unclear. Here, we found that midnolin promoted the destruction of many nuclear proteins, including transcription factors encoded by the immediate-early genes. Diverse stimuli induced midnolin, and its overexpression was sufficient to cause the degradation of its targets by a mechanism that did not require ubiquitination. Instead, midnolin associated with the proteasome via an \u03b1 helix, used its Catch domain to bind a region within substrates that can form a \u03b2 strand, and used a ubiquitin-like domain to promote substrate destruction. Thus, midnolin contains three regions that function in concert to target a large set of nuclear proteins to the proteasome for degradation.",

In this work, we report that the loss of CII, but not that of CI, reduces melanoma tumor growth by increasing antigen presentation and T cell\u2013mediated killing. This is driven by succinate-mediated transcriptional and epigenetic activation of major histocompatibility complex\u2013antigen processing and presentation (MHC-APP) genes independent of interferon signaling. Furthermore, knockout of methylation-controlled J protein (MCJ), to promote electron entry preferentially through CI, provides proof of concept of ETC rewiring to achieve antitumor responses without side effects associated with an overall reduction in mitochondrial respiration in noncancer cells. Our results may hold therapeutic potential for tumors that have reduced MHC-APP expression, a common mechanism of cancer immunoevasion.",

Our population genetic analysis reveals that the origin of modern maize can be traced to an admixture between ancient maize and Zea mays ssp. mexicana in the highlands of Mexico some 4000 years after domestication began. We show that variation in admixture is a key component of maize diversity, both at individual loci and for additive genetic variation underlying agronomic traits. Our results clarify the origin of modern maize and raise new questions about the anthropogenic mechanisms underlying dispersal throughout the Americas.",

We used SPEAC-seq (systematic perturbation of encapsulated associated cells followed by sequencing), in combination with in vivo genetic perturbations, to identify microglia-produced amphiregulin as a suppressor of disease-promoting astrocyte responses in multiple sclerosis preclinical models and clinical samples. Thus, SPEAC-seq enables the high-throughput systematic identification of cell\u2013cell communication mechanisms.",

We report observations of the repeating FRB 20190520B spanning 17 months, which show that the FRB\u2019s Faraday rotation is highly variable and twice changes sign. The FRB also depolarizes below radio frequencies of about 1 to 3 gigahertz. We interpret these properties as being due to changes in the parallel component of the magnetic field integrated along the line of sight, including reversing direction of the field. This could result from propagation through a turbulent magnetized screen of plasma, located 10 \u20135 to 100 parsecs from the FRB source. This is consistent with the bursts passing through the stellar wind of a binary companion of the FRB source.",

    "abstract": "Volumetric printing, an emerging additive manufacturing technique, builds objects with enhanced printing speed and surface quality by forgoing the stepwise ink-renewal step. Existing volumetric printing techniques almost exclusively rely on light energy to trigger photopolymerization in transparent inks, limiting material choices and build sizes. We report a self-enhancing sonicated ink (or sono-ink) design and corresponding focused-ultrasound writing technique for deep-penetration acoustic volumetric printing (DAVP). We used experiments and acoustic modeling to study the frequency and scanning rate\u2013dependent acoustic printing behaviors. DAVP achieves the key features of low acoustic streaming, rapid sonothermal polymerization, and large printing depth, enabling the printing of volumetric hydrogels and nanocomposites with various shapes regardless of their optical properties. DAVP also allows printing at centimeter depths through biological tissues, paving the way toward minimally invasive medicine.",

However, current editing approaches are directed primarily toward relatively small cohorts of patients with specific mutations. Here, we describe a cardioprotective strategy potentially applicable to a broad range of patients with heart disease. We used base editing to ablate the oxidative activation sites of CaMKII\u03b4, a primary driver of cardiac disease. We show in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells that editing the CaMKII\u03b4 gene to eliminate oxidation-sensitive methionine residues confers protection from ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. Moreover, CaMKII\u03b4 editing in mice at the time of IR enables the heart to recover function from otherwise severe damage. CaMKII\u03b4 gene editing may thus represent a permanent and advanced strategy for heart disease therapy.",

Here, we show that human CD1c + CD5 + DCs are reduced in melanoma-affected lymph nodes, with CD5 expression on DCs correlating with patient survival. Activating CD5 on DCs enhanced T cell priming and improved survival after ICB therapy. CD5 + DC numbers increased during ICB therapy, and low interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations promoted their de novo differentiation. Mechanistically, CD5 expression by DCs was required to generate optimally protective CD5 hi T helper and CD8 + T cells; further, deletion of CD5 from T cells dampened tumor elimination in response to ICB therapy in vivo. Thus, CD5 + DCs are an essential component of optimal ICB therapy.",

However, for many functional processes, including transcription initiation, the pairwise motion of distal chromosomal elements such as enhancers and promoters is essential and necessitates dynamic fluidity. Here, we used a live-imaging assay to simultaneously measure the positions of pairs of enhancers and promoters and their transcriptional output while systematically varying the genomic separation between these two DNA loci. Our analysis reveals the coexistence of a compact globular organization and fast subdiffusive dynamics. These combined features cause an anomalous scaling of polymer relaxation times with genomic separation leading to long-ranged correlations. Thus, encounter times of DNA loci are much less dependent on genomic distance than predicted by existing polymer models, with potential consequences for eukaryotic gene expression.",

By synthesizing terrestrial and aquatic studies globally (2594 experimental tests from 610 articles), we reveal substantial herbivore control of vegetation under restoration. Herbivores at restoration sites reduced vegetation abundance more strongly (by 89%, on average) than those at relatively undegraded sites and suppressed, rather than fostered, plant diversity. These effects were particularly pronounced in regions with higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Excluding targeted herbivores temporarily or introducing their predators improved restoration by magnitudes similar to or greater than those achieved by managing plant competition or facilitation. Thus, managing herbivory is a promising strategy for enhancing vegetation restoration efforts.",

JWST spectroscopy of the galaxy, at rest-frame optical wavelengths, detects strong nebular emission lines that are attributable to oxygen and hydrogen. The measured redshift is z = 9.51 \u00b1 0.01, corresponding to 510 million years after the Big Bang. The galaxy has a radius of 16.2 \u2212 7.2 + 4.6 parsecs, which is substantially more compact than galaxies with equivalent luminosity at z ~ 6 to 8, leading to a high star formation rate surface density.",

We show that at low temperatures ( T ), such metals generically exhibit strange metal behavior with a T -linear resistivity arising from spatially random fluctuations in the fermion-scalar Yukawa couplings about a nonzero spatial average. We also find a T ln(1/ T ) specific heat and a rationale for the Planckian bound on the transport scattering time.

Results showed that human ancestors went through a severe population bottleneck with about 1280 breeding individuals between around 930,000 and 813,000 years ago. The bottleneck lasted for about 117,000 years and brought human ancestors close to extinction. This bottleneck is congruent with a substantial chronological gap in the available African and Eurasian fossil record. Our results provide new insights into our ancestry and suggest a coincident speciation event.",

Here, we report that DONSON, a metazoan protein mutated in microcephalic primordial dwarfism, is required for CMG assembly in vertebrates. Using AlphaFold to screen for protein-protein interactions followed by experimental validation, we show that DONSON scaffolds a vertebrate pre-LC containing GINS, TOPBP1, and DNA pol \u03b5. Our evidence suggests that DONSON docks the pre-LC onto MCM2-7, delivering GINS to its binding site in CMG. A patient-derived DONSON mutation compromises CMG assembly and recapitulates microcephalic dwarfism in mice. These results unify our understanding of eukaryotic replication initiation, implicate defective CMG assembly in microcephalic dwarfism, and illustrate how in silico protein-protein interaction screening accelerates mechanistic discovery.",

We report a photochemically driven deracemization protocol in which a single chiral catalyst effects two mechanistically different steps, C\u2013C bond cleavage and C\u2013C bond formation, to achieve multiplicative enhancement of stereoinduction, which leads to high levels of stereoselectivity. Ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation of a titanium catalyst coordinated by a chiral phosphoric acid or bisoxazoline efficiently enriches racemic alcohols that feature adjacent and fully substituted stereogenic centers to enantiomeric ratios up to 99:1. Mechanistic investigations support a pathway of sequential radical-mediated bond scission and bond formation through a common prochiral intermediate and reveal that, although the overall stereoenrichment is high, the selectivity in each individual step is moderate.",

    "abstract": "We visualized negative refraction of phonon polaritons, which occurs at the interface between two natural crystals. The polaritons\u2014hybrids of infrared photons and lattice vibrations\u2014form collimated rays that display negative refraction when passing through a planar interface between the two hyperbolic van der Waals materials: molybdenum oxide (MoO 3 ) and isotopically pure hexagonal boron nitride (h 11 BN). At a special frequency \u03c9 0 , these rays can circulate along closed diamond-shaped trajectories. We have shown that polariton eigenmodes display regions of both positive and negative dispersion interrupted by multiple gaps that result from polaritonic-level repulsion and strong coupling.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the regulatory landscape of the human genome is a long-standing objective of modern biology. Using the reference-free alignment across 241 mammalian genomes produced by the Zoonomia Consortium, we charted evolutionary trajectories for 0.92 million human candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and 15.6 million human transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). We identified 439,461 cCREs and 2,024,062 TFBSs under evolutionary constraint. Genes near constrained elements perform fundamental cellular processes, whereas genes near primate-specific elements are involved in environmental interaction, including odor perception and immune response. About 20% of TFBSs are transposable element\u2013derived and exhibit intricate patterns of gains and losses during primate evolution whereas sequence variants associated with complex traits are enriched in constrained TFBSs. Our annotations illuminate the regulatory functions of the human genome.",

In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of a monocoordinate bismuthinidene that features a rigid and bulky ligand. All magnetic measurements [superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)] point to a diamagnetic compound. However, multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations predict the ground state of the compound to be dominated (76%) by a spin triplet. The apparent diamagnetism is explained by an extremely large SOC-induced positive zero-field splitting of more than 4500 wavenumbers that leaves the M S = 0 magnetic sublevel thermally isolated in the electronic ground state.",

Although quantum error correction ultimately promises fault-tolerant operation, the required qubit overhead and error thresholds are daunting. In a complementary proposal, colocated, auxiliary \u201cspectator\u201d qubits act as in situ probes of noise and enable real-time, coherent corrections of data qubit errors. We used an array of cesium spectator qubits to correct correlated phase errors on an array of rubidium data qubits. By combining in-sequence readout, data processing, and feedforward operations, these correlated errors were suppressed within the execution of the quantum circuit. The protocol is broadly applicable to quantum information platforms and establishes key tools for scaling neutral-atom quantum processors: mid-circuit readout of atom arrays, real-time processing and feedforward, and coherent mid-circuit reloading of atomic qubits.",

    "abstract": "Crystals grow in supersaturated solutions. A mysterious counterexample is dolomite CaMg(CO 3 ) 2 , a geologically abundant sedimentary mineral that does not readily grow at ambient conditions, not even under highly supersaturated solutions. Using atomistic simulations, we show that dolomite initially precipitates a cation-disordered surface, where high surface strains inhibit further crystal growth. However, mild undersaturation will preferentially dissolve these disordered regions, enabling increased order upon reprecipitation. Our simulations predict that frequent cycling of a solution between supersaturation and undersaturation can accelerate dolomite growth by up to seven orders of magnitude. We validated our theory with in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy, directly observing bulk dolomite growth after pulses of dissolution. This mechanism explains why modern dolomite is primarily found in natural environments with pH or salinity fluctuations. More generally, it reveals that the growth and ripening of defect-free crystals can be facilitated by deliberate periods of mild dissolution.",

We found that although mammals resemble one another in total TE content and diversity, they show substantial differences with regard to recent TE accumulation. This includes multiple recent expansion and quiescence events across the mammalian tree. Young TEs, particularly long interspersed elements, drive increases in genome size, whereas DNA transposons are associated with smaller genomes. Mammals tend to accumulate only a few types of TEs at any given time, with one TE type dominating. We also found association between dietary habit and the presence of DNA transposon invasions. These detailed annotations will serve as a benchmark for future comparative TE analyses among placental mammals.",

However, their usage in emerging wearable electronics is limited by inelastic deformation. We developed intrinsically elastic ferroelectrics by combining ferroelectric response and elastic resilience into one material by slight cross-linking of plastic ferroelectric polymers. The precise slight cross-linking can realize the complex balance between crystallinity and resilience. Thus, we obtained an elastic ferroelectric with a stable ferroelectric response under mechanical deformation up to 70% strain. This elastic ferroelectric exerts potentials in applications related to wearable electronics, such as elastic ferroelectric sensors, information storage, and energy transduction.",

We show that the superionic conduction in a trigonal halide, such as Li 3 MCl 6 [where metal (M) is Y or Er], is governed by the in-plane lithium percolation paths and stacking interlayer distance. These two factors are inversely correlated with each other by the partial occupancy of M, serving as both a diffusion inhibitor and pillar for maintaining interlayer distance. These findings suggest that a critical range or ordering of M exists in trigonal halides, and we showcase the achievement of high ionic conductivity by adjusting the simple M ratio (per Cl or Li). We provide general design criteria for superionic trigonal halide electrolytes.",

We have identified cell walls isolated from Lp WJL , as well as muramyl dipeptide and mifamurtide, as sufficient cues to stimulate animal growth despite undernutrition. Further, we found that NOD2 is necessary in intestinal epithelial cells for Lp WJL -mediated IGF-1 production and for postnatal growth promotion in malnourished conventional animals. These findings indicate that, coupled with renutrition, bacteria cell walls or purified NOD2 ligands have the potential to alleviate stunting.",

    "abstract": "A promising way to mitigate inequality is by addressing students\u2019 worries about belonging. But where and with whom is this social-belonging intervention effective? Here we report a team-science randomized controlled experiment with 26,911 students at 22 diverse institutions. Results showed that the social-belonging intervention, administered online before college (in under 30 minutes), increased the rate at which students completed the first year as full-time students, especially among students in groups that had historically progressed at lower rates. The college context also mattered: The intervention was effective only when students\u2019 groups were afforded opportunities to belong. This study develops methods for understanding how student identities and contexts interact with interventions. It also shows that a low-cost, scalable intervention generalizes its effects to 749 4-year institutions in the United States.",

    "abstract": "The gravitationally lensed supernova Refsdal appeared in multiple images produced through gravitational lensing by a massive foreground galaxy cluster. After the supernova appeared in 2014, lens models of the galaxy cluster predicted that an additional image of the supernova would appear in 2015, which was subsequently observed. We use the time delays between the images to perform a blinded measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe, quantified by the Hubble constant ( H 0 ). Using eight cluster lens models, we infer H 0 = 64.8 \u2212 4.3 + 4.4 kilometers\u00a0per\u00a0second\u00a0per\u00a0megaparsec . Using the two models most consistent with the observations, we find H 0 = 66.6 \u2212 3.3 + 4.1 kilometers\u00a0per\u00a0second\u00a0per\u00a0megaparsec . The observations are best reproduced by models that assign dark-matter halos to individual galaxies and the overall cluster.",

Here, chiral superstructures can be rapidly formed by magnetically assembling materials of any chemical compositions at all scales, from molecules to nano- and microstructures. We show that a quadrupole field chirality is generated by permanent magnets caused by consistent field rotation in space. Applying the chiral field to magnetic nanoparticles produces long-range chiral superstructures controlled by field strength at the samples and orientation of the magnets. Transferring the chirality to any achiral molecules is enabled by incorporating guest molecules such as metals, polymers, oxides, semiconductors, dyes, and fluorophores into the magnetic nanostructures.",

These structures revealed the distribution of functional states of the elongation cycle, a Z transfer RNA binding site, and the dynamics of ribosome expansion segments.

However, the moir\u00e9 pattern is highly sensitive to the interlayer atomic registry, and current assembly techniques suffer from imprecise control of the average twist angle, spatial inhomogeneity in the local twist angle, and distortions caused by random strain. We manipulated the moir\u00e9 patterns in hetero- and homobilayers through in-plane bending of monolayer ribbons, using the tip of an atomic force microscope. This technique achieves continuous variation of twist angles with improved twist-angle homogeneity and reduced random strain, resulting in moir\u00e9 patterns with tunable wavelength and ultralow disorder. Our results may enable detailed studies of ultralow-disorder moir\u00e9 systems and the realization of precise strain-engineered devices.",

We developed an implantable bioelectronic system capable of continuous, real-time, long-term monitoring of the local temperature and thermal conductivity of a kidney for detecting inflammatory processes associated with graft rejection, as demonstrated in rat models. The system detects ultradian rhythms, disruption of the circadian cycle, and/or a rise in kidney temperature. These provide warning signs of acute kidney transplant rejection that precede changes in blood serum creatinine/urea nitrogen by 2 to 3 weeks and approximately 3 days for cases of discontinued and absent administration of immunosuppressive therapy, respectively.",

SCF1 is apparently specific to C. auris , and its expression mediates adhesion to inert and biological surfaces across isolates from all five clades. Unlike canonical fungal adhesins, which function through hydrophobic interactions, Scf1 relies on exposed cationic residues for surface association. SCF1 is required for C. auris biofilm formation, skin colonization, virulence in systemic infection, and colonization of inserted medical devices.",

Highlighting a role for the RSR in metabolic regulation, ZAK-knockout mice are protected from developing high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) diet-induced blood glucose intolerance and liver steatosis.

We generated HARs and chimpanzee accelerated regions with an automated pipeline and an alignment of 241 mammalian genomes. Combining deep learning with chromatin capture experiments in human and chimpanzee neural progenitor cells, we discovered a significant enrichment of HARs in topologically associating domains containing human-specific genomic variants that change three-dimensional (3D) genome organization. Differential gene expression between humans and chimpanzees at these loci suggests rewiring of regulatory interactions between HARs and neurodevelopmental genes. Thus, comparative genomics together with models of 3D genome folding revealed enhancer hijacking as an explanation for the rapid evolution of HARs.",

    "abstract": "The domestication of forest trees for a more sustainable fiber bioeconomy has long been hindered by the complexity and plasticity of lignin, a biopolymer in wood that is recalcitrant to chemical and enzymatic degradation. Here, we show that multiplex CRISPR editing enables precise woody feedstock design for combinatorial improvement of lignin composition and wood properties. By assessing every possible combination of 69,123 multigenic editing strategies for 21 lignin biosynthesis genes, we deduced seven different genome editing strategies targeting the concurrent alteration of up to six genes and produced 174 edited poplar variants. CRISPR editing increased the wood carbohydrate-to-lignin ratio up to 228% that of wild type, leading to more-efficient fiber pulping. The edited wood alleviates a major fiber-production bottleneck regardless of changes in tree growth rate and could bring unprecedented operational efficiencies, bioeconomic opportunities, and environmental benefits.",

    "abstract": "Cooling through solid-state electrocaloric materials is an attractive replacement for vapor compression. Despite recent efforts, devices that are potentially commercially competitive have not been developed. We present an electrocaloric cooler with a maximum temperature span of 20.9 kelvin and a maximum cooling power of 2.1 watts under the moderate applied electric field of 10 volts per micrometer without any observed breakdown. Moreover, the maximum coefficient of performance, even taking into account energy expended on fluid pumping, reaches 54% of Carnot\u2019s efficiency as long as energy is properly recovered. We believe that this demonstration shows electrocaloric cooling to be a very promising alternative to vapor compression cooling.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity is stimulated to promote metabolic adaptation upon energy stress. However, sustained metabolic stress may cause cell death. The mechanisms by which AMPK dictates cell death are not fully understood. We report that metabolic stress promoted receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) activation mediated by TRAIL receptors, whereas AMPK inhibited RIPK1 by phosphorylation at Ser 415 to suppress energy stress\u2013induced cell death. Inhibiting pS415-RIPK1 by Ampk deficiency or RIPK1 S415A mutation promoted RIPK1 activation. Furthermore, genetic inactivation of RIPK1 protected against ischemic injury in myeloid Ampk\u03b11 -deficient mice. Our studies reveal that AMPK phosphorylation of RIPK1 represents a crucial metabolic checkpoint, which dictates cell fate response to metabolic stress, and highlight a previously unappreciated role for the AMPK-RIPK1 axis in integrating metabolism, cell death, and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) are the primary pathways for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during interphase, whereas microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) has been regarded as a backup mechanism. Through CRISPR-Cas9\u2013based synthetic lethal screens in cancer cells, we identified subunits of the 9-1-1 complex (RAD9A-RAD1-HUS1) and its interacting partner, RHINO, as crucial MMEJ factors. We uncovered an unexpected function for RHINO in restricting MMEJ to mitosis. RHINO accumulates in M phase, undergoes Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) phosphorylation, and interacts with polymerase \u03b8 (Pol\u03b8), enabling its recruitment to DSBs for subsequent repair. Additionally, we provide evidence that MMEJ activity in mitosis repairs persistent DSBs that originate in S phase. Our findings offer insights into the synthetic lethal relationship between the genes POLQ and BRCA1 and BRAC2 and the synergistic effect of Pol\u03b8 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.",

Such extended interaction range can be enabled by using nonlocal degrees of freedom such as photonic modes in an otherwise locally connected structure. Here, we present a superconducting quantum simulator in which qubits are connected through an extensible photonic-bandgap metamaterial, thus realizing a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with tunable hopping range and on-site interaction. Using individual site control and readout, we characterize the statistics of measurement outcomes from many-body quench dynamics, which enables in situ Hamiltonian learning. Further, the outcome statistics reveal the effect of increased hopping range, showing the predicted crossover from integrability to ergodicity. Our work enables the study of emergent randomness from chaotic many-body evolution and, more broadly, expands the accessible Hamiltonians for quantum simulation using superconducting circuits.",

    "abstract": "The structural integrity of vaccine antigens is critical to the generation of protective antibody responses, but the impact of protease activity on vaccination in vivo is poorly understood. We characterized protease activity in lymph nodes and found that antigens were rapidly degraded in the subcapsular sinus, paracortex, and interfollicular regions, whereas low protease activity and antigen degradation rates were detected in the vicinity of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Correlated with these findings, immunization regimens designed to target antigen to FDCs led to germinal centers dominantly targeting intact antigen, whereas traditional immunizations led to much weaker responses that equally targeted the intact immunogen and antigen breakdown products. Thus, spatially compartmentalized antigen proteolysis affects humoral immunity and can be exploited.",

We examined volcanic areas on Venus that were imaged two or three times by Magellan and identified an ~2.2-square-kilometer volcanic vent that changed shape in the 8-month interval between two radar images. Additional volcanic flows downhill from the vent are visible in the second-epoch images, although we cannot rule out that they were present but invisible in the first epoch because of differences in imaging geometry. We interpret these results as evidence of ongoing volcanic activity on Venus.",

Electron microscopy later confirmed the doctrine and allowed the identification of synaptic connections. In this work, we used volume electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions to characterize the nerve net of a ctenophore, a marine invertebrate that belongs to one of the earliest-branching animal lineages. We found that neurons in the subepithelial nerve net have a continuous plasma membrane that forms a syncytium. Our findings suggest fundamental differences of nerve net architectures between ctenophores and cnidarians or bilaterians and offer an alternative perspective on neural network organization and neurotransmission.",

Thickness-limited lateral resolution, lack of depth resolution, and electron dose-constrained focusing limit local structural studies of zeolites in conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We demonstrate that a multislice ptychography method based on four-dimensional scanning TEM (4D-STEM) data can overcome these limitations. Images obtained from a ~40-nanometer-thick MFI zeolite exhibited a lateral resolution of ~0.85 angstrom that enabled the identification of individual framework oxygen (O) atoms and the precise determination of the orientations of adsorbed molecules. Furthermore, a depth resolution of ~6.6 nanometers allowed probing of the three-dimensional distribution of O vacancies, as well as the phase boundaries in intergrown MFI and MEL zeolites. The 4D-STEM ptychography can be generally applied to other materials with similar high electron-beam sensitivity.",

Using mutations affecting the two Diptericins ( Dpt ) of Drosophila melanogaster , we reveal the specific role of DptA for the pathogen Providencia rettgeri and DptB for the gut mutualist Acetobacter . The presence of DptA- or DptB- like genes across Diptera correlates with the presence of Providencia and Acetobacter in their environment. Moreover, DptA- and DptB- like sequences predict host resistance against infection by these bacteria across the genus Drosophila . Our study explains the evolutionary logic behind the bursts of rapid evolution of an antimicrobial peptide family and reveals how the host immune repertoire adapts to changing microbial environments.",

Commensals stimulated the recruitment of monocytes through CD44 to a spatially distinct vascular compartment.

Syncytia formed via CD36 and were observed in human cirrhosis as a possible antimicrobial defense that evolved with fibrosis.",

The immunological mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain unknown. By mapping 376 immunodominant \u201cpublic epitopes\u201d at high resolution and characterizing several of their cognate antibodies, we concluded that germline-encoded sequences in antibodies drive recurrent recognition. Systematic analysis of antibody-antigen structures uncovered 18 human and 21 partially overlapping mouse germline-encoded amino acid\u2013binding (GRAB) motifs within heavy and light V gene segments that in case studies proved critical for public epitope recognition. GRAB motifs represent a fundamental component of the immune system\u2019s architecture that promotes recognition of pathogens and leads to species-specific public antibody responses that can exert selective pressure on pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Species persistence can be influenced by the amount, type, and distribution of diversity across the genome, suggesting a potential relationship between historical demography and resilience. In this study, we surveyed genetic variation across single genomes of 240 mammals that compose the Zoonomia alignment to evaluate how historical effective population size ( N e ) affects heterozygosity and deleterious genetic load and how these factors may contribute to extinction risk. We find that species with smaller historical N e carry a proportionally larger burden of deleterious alleles owing to long-term accumulation and fixation of genetic load and have a higher risk of extinction. This suggests that historical demography can inform contemporary resilience. Models that included genomic data were predictive of species\u2019 conservation status, suggesting that, in the absence of adequate census or ecological data, genomic information may provide an initial risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "A panoply of unconventional electronic states has been observed in moir\u00e9 superlattices. Engineering similar bosonic phases remains, however, largely unexplored. We report the observation of a bosonic correlated insulator in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe 2 /WS 2 ) moir\u00e9 superlattices composed of excitons, that is, tightly bound electron-hole pairs. We develop a pump probe spectroscopy method that we use to observe an exciton incompressible state at exciton filling \u03bd ex = 1 and charge neutrality, indicating a correlated insulator of excitons. With varying charge density, the bosonic correlated insulator continuously transitions into an electron correlated insulator at charge filling \u03bd e = 1, suggesting a mixed correlated insulating state between the two limits. Our studies establish semiconducting moir\u00e9 superlattices as an intriguing platform for engineering bosonic phases.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 lockdowns in early 2020 reduced human mobility, providing an opportunity to disentangle its effects on animals from those of landscape modifications. Using GPS data, we compared movements and road avoidance of 2300 terrestrial mammals (43 species) during the lockdowns to the same period in 2019. Individual responses were variable with no change in average movements or road avoidance behavior, likely due to variable lockdown conditions. However, under strict lockdowns 10-day 95th percentile displacements increased by 73%, suggesting increased landscape permeability. Animals\u2019 1-hour 95th percentile displacements declined by 12% and animals were 36% closer to roads in areas of high human footprint, indicating reduced avoidance during lockdowns. Overall, lockdowns rapidly altered some spatial behaviors, highlighting variable but substantial impacts of human mobility on wildlife worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Nanoscale chromatin organization regulates gene expression. Although chromatin is notably reprogrammed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA), the organization of chromatin regulatory factors during this universal process remains unclear. In this work, we developed chromatin expansion microscopy (ChromExM) to visualize chromatin, transcription, and transcription factors in vivo. ChromExM of embryos during ZGA revealed how the pioneer factor Nanog interacts with nucleosomes and RNA polymerase II (Pol II), providing direct visualization of transcriptional elongation as string-like nanostructures. Blocking elongation led to more Pol II particles clustered around Nanog, with Pol II stalled at promoters and Nanog-bound enhancers. This led to a new model termed \"kiss and kick\", in which enhancer\u2013promoter contacts are transient and released by transcriptional elongation. Our results demonstrate that ChromExM is broadly applicable to study nanoscale nuclear organization.",

In vivo electrophysiology recording of local field potentials and single-unit spikes have been selectively achieved in the cortex and olfactory bulb.

This platform technology can be readily extended as both research tools and medical devices for the detection and intervention of neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for impaired cardiovascular health. Because the aging myocardium is characterized by microcirculatory dysfunction, and because nerves align with vessels, we assessed the impact of aging on the cardiac neurovascular interface. We report that aging reduces nerve density in the ventricle and dysregulates vascular-derived neuroregulatory genes. Aging down-regulates microRNA 145 (miR-145) and derepresses the neurorepulsive factor semaphorin-3A. miR-145 deletion, which increased Sema3a expression or endothelial Sema3a overexpression, reduced axon density, mimicking the aged-heart phenotype. Removal of senescent cells, which accumulated with chronological age in parallel to the decline in nerve density, rescued age-induced denervation, reversed Sema3a expression, preserved heart rate patterns, and reduced electrical instability. These data suggest that senescence-mediated regulation of nerve density contributes to age-associated cardiac dysfunction.",

Examples range from detecting DNA damage by chemotherapeutics, to identifying drug-specific PTM signatures of kinase inhibitors, to demonstrating that rituximab kills CD20-positive B cells by overactivating B cell receptor signaling. DecryptM profiling of 31 cancer drugs in 13 cell lines demonstrates the broad applicability of the approach. The resulting 1.8 million dose-response curves are provided as an interactive molecular resource in ProteomicsDB.",

    "abstract": "Atomic-scale ferroelectrics are of great interest for high-density electronics, particularly field-effect transistors, low-power logic, and nonvolatile memories. We devised a film with a layered structure of bismuth oxide that can stabilize the ferroelectric state down to 1 nanometer through samarium bondage. This film can be grown on a variety of substrates with a cost-effective chemical solution deposition. We observed a standard ferroelectric hysteresis loop down to a thickness of ~1 nanometer. The thin films with thicknesses that range from 1 to 4.56 nanometers possess a relatively large remanent polarization from 17 to 50 microcoulombs per square centimeter. We verified the structure with first-principles calculations, which also pointed to the material being a lone pair\u2013driven ferroelectric material. The structure design of the ultrathin ferroelectric films has great potential for the manufacturing of atomic-scale electronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Despite substantial advances in targeting mutant KRAS, tumor resistance to KRAS inhibitors (KRASi) remains a major barrier to progress. Here, we report proteostasis reprogramming as a key convergence point of multiple KRASi-resistance mechanisms. Inactivation of oncogenic KRAS down-regulated both the heat shock response and the inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) branch of the unfolded protein response, causing severe proteostasis disturbances. However, IRE1\u03b1 was selectively reactivated in an ER stress\u2013independent manner in acquired KRASi-resistant tumors, restoring proteostasis. Oncogenic KRAS promoted IRE1\u03b1 protein stability through extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinase (ERK)\u2013dependent phosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1, leading to IRE1\u03b1 disassociation from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase degradation (HRD1) E3-ligase. In KRASi-resistant tumors, both reactivated ERK and hyperactivated AKT restored IRE1\u03b1 phosphorylation and stability. Suppression of IRE1\u03b1 overcame resistance to KRASi. This study reveals a druggable mechanism that leads to proteostasis reprogramming and facilitates KRASi resistance.",

We introduce an atomistic and machine learning strategy for the combinatorial assembly and design of enzymes (CADENZ) to design fragments that combine with one another to generate diverse, low-energy structures with stable catalytic constellations. We applied CADENZ to endoxylanases and used activity-based protein profiling to recover thousands of structurally diverse enzymes. Functional designs exhibit high active-site preorganization and more stable and compact packing outside the active site. Implementing these lessons into CADENZ led to a 10-fold improved hit rate and more than 10,000 recovered enzymes. This design-test-learn loop can be applied, in principle, to any modular protein family, yielding huge diversity and general lessons on protein design principles.",

However, silicone-based components are integral to numerous advanced technologies and everyday consumer products. We developed a silicone 3D printing technique that produces precise, accurate, strong, and functional structures made from several commercially available silicone formulations. To achieve this level of performance, we developed a support material made from a silicone oil emulsion. This material exhibits negligible interfacial tension against silicone-based inks, eliminating the disruptive forces that often drive printed silicone features to deform and break apart. The versatility of this approach enables the use of established silicone formulations in fabricating complex structures and features as small as 8 micrometers in diameter.",

Beyond its recognized role as a site of hematopoiesis, we highlight roles in metabolism, coagulation, vascular development, and hematopoietic regulation. We reconstructed the emergence and decline of YS hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from hemogenic endothelium and revealed a YS-specific accelerated route to macrophage production that seeds developing organs.

In this study, we used an optogenetic manipulation to perturb the sequential structure, but not global network dynamics, of place cells as rats traversed specific spatial trajectories. This perturbation abolished replay of those trajectories and the development of predictive representations, leading to impaired learning of new optimal trajectories during memory-guided navigation. However, place cell assembly reactivation and reward-context associative learning were unaffected. Our results show a mechanistic dissociation between two complementary hippocampal codes: an associative code (through coactivity) and a predictive code (through sequences).",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria must maintain adequate amounts of metabolites for protective and biosynthetic functions. However, how mitochondria sense the abundance of metabolites and regulate metabolic homeostasis is not well understood. In this work, we focused on glutathione (GSH), a critical redox metabolite in mitochondria, and identified a feedback mechanism that controls its abundance through the mitochondrial GSH transporter, SLC25A39. Under physiological conditions, SLC25A39 is rapidly degraded by mitochondrial protease AFG3L2. Depletion of GSH dissociates AFG3L2 from SLC25A39, causing a compensatory increase in mitochondrial GSH uptake. Genetic and proteomic analyses identified a putative iron-sulfur cluster in the matrix-facing loop of SLC25A39 as essential for this regulation, coupling mitochondrial iron homeostasis to GSH import. Altogether, our work revealed a paradigm for the autoregulatory control of metabolic homeostasis in organelles.",

Inspired by calcium phosphate biomineralization, we herein disclose a protocol of treating acid-grade fluorspar with dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K 2 HPO 4 ) under mechanochemical conditions.

The pathogenesis of tauopathies remains unclear, which impedes the development of disease-modifying treatments. Here, by systematically analyzing human tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, we identified a few TRIMs that could potently inhibit tau aggregation. Among them, TRIM11 was markedly down-regulated in AD brains. TRIM11 promoted the proteasomal degradation of mutant tau as well as superfluous normal tau. It also enhanced tau solubility by acting as both a molecular chaperone to prevent tau misfolding and a disaggregase to dissolve preformed tau fibrils. TRIM11 maintained the connectivity and viability of neurons. Intracranial delivery of TRIM11 through adeno-associated viruses ameliorated pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments in multiple animal models of tauopathies. These results suggest that TRIM11 down-regulation contributes to the pathogenesis of tauopathies and that restoring TRIM11 expression may represent an effective therapeutic strategy.",

PC-PYY is packaged into secretory granules and is secreted into and retained by surface mucus, which optimizes PC-PYY activity. Although PC-PYY shows some antibacterial activity, it displays selective antifungal activity against virulent Candida albicans hyphae\u2014but not the yeast form. PC-PYY is a cationic molecule that interacts with the anionic surfaces of fungal hyphae to cause membrane disruption and transcriptional reprogramming that selects for the yeast phenotype. Hence, PC-PYY is an antifungal AMP that contributes to the maintenance of gut fungal commensalism.",

We found that sex-biased gene expression varied considerably across organs and species and was often cell-type specific. Sex differences increased abruptly around sexual maturity instead of increasing gradually during organ development. Finally, sex-biased gene expression evolved rapidly at the gene level, with differences between organs in the evolutionary mechanisms used, but more slowly at the cellular level, with the same cell types being sexually dimorphic across species.",

We tested to what extent the proximate mechanisms of emotional contagion are evolutionarily conserved by assessing the role of oxytocin, known to regulate empathic behaviors in mammals, in social fear contagion in zebrafish. Using oxytocin and oxytocin receptor mutants, we show that oxytocin is both necessary and sufficient for observer zebrafish to imitate the distressed behavior of conspecific demonstrators. The brain regions associated with emotional contagion in zebrafish are homologous to those involved in the same process in rodents (e.g., striatum, lateral septum), receiving direct projections from oxytocinergic neurons located in the pre-optic area. Together, our results support an evolutionary conserved role for oxytocin as a key regulator of basic empathic behaviors across vertebrates.",

A naturally occurring toggle switch underlies fate decisions toward either nucleolar or mitochondrial decline during the aging of yeast cells. We rewired this endogenous toggle to engineer an autonomous genetic clock that generates sustained oscillations between the nucleolar and mitochondrial aging processes in individual cells. These oscillations increased cellular life span through the delay of the commitment to aging that resulted from either the loss of chromatin silencing or the depletion of heme. Our results establish a connection between gene network architecture and cellular longevity that could lead to rationally designed gene circuits that slow aging.",

    "abstract": "Although some lineages of animals and plants have made impressive adaptive radiations when provided with ecological opportunity, the propensities to radiate vary profoundly among lineages for unknown reasons. In Africa\u2019s Lake Victoria region, one cichlid lineage radiated in every lake, with the largest radiation taking place in a lake less than 16,000 years old. We show that all of its ecological guilds evolved in situ. Cycles of lineage fusion through admixture and lineage fission through speciation characterize the history of the radiation. It was jump-started when several swamp-dwelling refugial populations, each of which were of older hybrid descent, met in the newly forming lake, where they fused into a single population, resuspending old admixture variation. Each population contributed a different set of ancient alleles from which a new adaptive radiation assembled in record time, involving additional fusion-fission cycles. We argue that repeated fusion-fission cycles in the history of a lineage make adaptive radiation fast and predictable.",

    "abstract": "Fitness landscape theory predicts that rugged landscapes with multiple peaks impair Darwinian evolution, but experimental evidence is limited. In this study, we used genome editing to map the fitness of >260,000 genotypes of the key metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase in the presence of the antibiotic trimethoprim, which targets this enzyme. The resulting landscape is highly rugged and harbors 514 fitness peaks. However, its highest peaks are accessible to evolving populations via abundant fitness-increasing paths. Different peaks share large basins of attraction that render the outcome of adaptive evolution highly contingent on chance events. Our work shows that ruggedness need not be an obstacle to Darwinian evolution but can reduce its predictability. If true in general, the complexity of optimization problems on realistic landscapes may require reappraisal.",

We have developed spatial transcriptomics of variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) sequences (Spatial VDJ), a method that maps B cell and T cell receptor sequences in human tissue sections. Spatial VDJ captures lymphocyte clones that match canonical B and T cell distributions and amplifies clonal sequences confirmed by orthogonal methods. We found spatial congruency between paired receptor chains, developed a computational framework to predict receptor pairs, and linked the expansion of distinct B cell clones to different tumor-associated gene expression programs. Spatial VDJ delineates B cell clonal diversity and lineage trajectories within their anatomical niche. Thus, Spatial VDJ captures lymphocyte spatial clonal architecture across tissues, providing a platform to harness clonal sequences for therapy.",

Teleosts are the largest and most diversified group of extant vertebrates, but relationships among their three oldest extant lineages remain unresolved. On the basis of seven high-quality new genome assemblies in Elopomorpha (tarpons, eels), we revisited the topology of the deepest branches of the\u00a0teleost phylogeny using independent gene sequence and chromosomal rearrangement phylogenomic approaches. These analyses converged to a single scenario that unambiguously places the Elopomorpha and Osteoglossomorpha (arapaima, elephantnose fish) in a monophyletic sister group to all other teleosts, i.e., the Clupeocephala lineage (zebrafish, medaka). This finding resolves more than 50 years of controversy on the evolutionary relationships of these lineages and highlights the power of combining different levels of genome-wide information to solve complex phylogenies.",

The mechanisms bacteria use to colonize the gut therefore present valuable targets for clinical intervention. We now report that bacteria use phase separation to enhance fitness in the mammalian gut. We establish that the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the broadly and highly conserved transcription termination factor Rho is necessary and sufficient for phase separation in vivo and in vitro in the human commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron . Phase separation increases transcription termination by Rho in an IDR-dependent manner. Moreover, the IDR is critical for gene regulation in the gut. Our findings expose phase separation as vital for host-commensal bacteria interactions and relevant for novel clinical applications.",

However, intrinsic losses impose a serious restriction on imaging resolution, a problem that has hindered widespread applications of superlenses. Optical waves of complex frequency that exhibit a temporally attenuating behavior have been proposed to offset the intrinsic losses in superlenses through the introduction of virtual gain, but experimental realization has been lacking because of the difficulty of imaging measurements with temporal decay. In this work, we present a multifrequency approach to constructing synthetic excitation waves of complex frequency based on measurements at real frequencies. This approach allows us to implement virtual gain experimentally and observe deep-subwavelength images. Our work offers a practical solution to overcome the intrinsic losses of plasmonic systems for imaging and sensing applications.",

We demonstrate a 325-milligram soft combustion microactuator that can achieve displacements of 140%, operate at frequencies >100 hertz, and generate forces >9.5 newtons. With these actuators, we powered an insect-scale quadrupedal robot, which demonstrated a variety of gait patterns, directional control, and a payload capacity 22 times its body weight.

Evolutionary expansion of human neocortex is marked by distinctive pyramidal neurons with extensive L1 branching, but whether L1 interneurons are similarly diverse is underexplored. Using Patch-seq recordings from human neurosurgical tissue, we identified four transcriptomic subclasses with mouse L1 homologs, along with distinct subtypes and types unmatched in mouse L1. Subclass and subtype comparisons showed stronger transcriptomic differences in human L1 and were correlated with strong morphoelectric variability along dimensions distinct from mouse L1 variability. Accompanied by greater layer thickness and other cytoarchitecture changes, these findings suggest that L1 has diverged in evolution, reflecting the demands of regulating the expanded human neocortical circuit.",

Here, we show that the IRF 2\u00d7CO2 is not constant, but rather depends on the climatological base state, increasing by about 25% for every doubling of CO 2 , and has increased by about 10% since the preindustrial era primarily due to the cooling within the upper stratosphere, implying a proportionate increase in climate sensitivity. This base-state dependence also explains about half of the intermodel spread in IRF 2\u00d7CO2 , a problem that has persisted among climate models for nearly three decades.",

We report a uniform composite hydrogel that displays substantial mechanical nonreciprocity, owing to direction-dependent buckling of embedded nanofillers. This material exhibits an elastic modulus more than 60 times higher when sheared in one direction compared with the opposite direction. Consequently, it can transform symmetric vibrations into asymmetric ones that are applicable for mass transport and energy harvest. Furthermore, it exhibits an asymmetric deformation when subjected to local interactions, which can induce directional motion of various objects, including macroscopic objects and even small living creatures.

Here, we report that coherent chiral phonons, driven by circularly polarized terahertz light pulses, polarize the paramagnetic spins in cerium fluoride in a manner similar to that of a quasi-static magnetic field on the order of 1 tesla. Through time-resolved Faraday rotation and Kerr ellipticity, we found that the transient magnetization is only excited by pulses resonant with phonons, proportional to the angular momentum of the phonons, and growing with magnetic susceptibility at cryogenic temperatures. The observation quantitatively agrees with our spin-phonon coupling model and may enable new routes to investigating ultrafast magnetism, energy-efficient spintronics, and nonequilibrium phases of matter with broken TRS.",

    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement is a key resource in currently developed quantum technologies. Sharing this fragile property between superconducting microwave circuits and optical or atomic systems would enable new functionalities, but this has been hindered by an energy scale mismatch of >10 4 and the resulting mutually imposed loss and noise. In this work, we created and verified entanglement between microwave and optical fields in a millikelvin environment. Using an optically pulsed superconducting electro-optical device, we show entanglement between propagating microwave and optical fields in the continuous variable domain. This achievement not only paves the way for entanglement between superconducting circuits and telecom wavelength light, but also has wide-ranging implications for hybrid quantum networks in the context of modularization, scaling, sensing, and cross-platform verification.",

    "abstract": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) drives circadian clock coherence through intercellular coupling, which is resistant to environmental perturbations. We report that primary cilia are required for intercellular coupling among SCN neurons to maintain the robustness of the internal clock in mice. Cilia in neuromedin S\u2013producing (NMS) neurons exhibit pronounced circadian rhythmicity in abundance and length. Genetic ablation of ciliogenesis in NMS neurons enabled a rapid phase shift of the internal clock under jet-lag conditions. The circadian rhythms of individual neurons in cilia-deficient SCN slices lost their coherence after external perturbations. Rhythmic cilia changes drive oscillations of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling and clock gene expression. Inactivation of Shh signaling in NMS neurons phenocopied the effects of cilia ablation. Thus, cilia-Shh signaling in the SCN aids intercellular coupling.",

We report the oxidative addition of \u03b1-haloacetonitrile to ionic and neutral copper(I) complexes to form previously elusive but here fully characterized copper(III) complexes. The stability of these complexes stems from the strong Cu\u2212CF 3 bond and the high barrier for C( CF 3 )\u2212C( CH 2 CN ) bond-forming reductive elimination. The mechanistic studies we performed suggest that oxidative addition to ionic and neutral copper(I) complexes proceeds by means of two different pathways: an S N 2-type substitution to the ionic complex and a halogen-atom transfer to the neutral complex. We observed a pronounced ligand acceleration of the oxidative addition, which correlates with that observed in the copper-catalyzed couplings of azoles, amines, or alkynes with alkyl electrophiles.",

A search for plumes yielded no detection of water, carbon monoxide, methanol, ethane, or methane fluorescence emissions. Four spectral features of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) ice were detected; their spectral shapes and distribution across Europa\u2019s surface indicate that the CO 2 is mixed with other compounds and concentrated in Tara Regio.

In a maize germplasm collection, we identified two strigolactones, zealactol and zealactonoic acid, which stimulate less Striga germination than the major maize strigolactone, zealactone. We then showed that a single cytochrome P450, ZmCYP706C37, catalyzes a series of oxidative steps in the maize-strigolactone biosynthetic pathway. Reduction in activity of this enzyme and two others involved in the pathway, ZmMAX1b and ZmCLAMT1, can change strigolactone composition and reduce Striga germination and infection.

Here, we developed a workflow to profile posttranslational modifications involved in neoantigen formation. Using mass spectrometry, we identified a panel of cysteine residues differentially modified by carboxyethylation that required 3-hydroxypropionic acid to generate neoantigens in patients with AS. The lysosomal degradation of integrin \u03b1IIb [ITGA2B (CD41)] carboxyethylated at Cys96 (ITGA2B-ceC96) generated carboxyethylated peptides that were presented by HLA-DRB1*04 to stimulate CD4 + T cell responses and induce autoantibody production. Immunization of HLA-DR4 transgenic mice with the ITGA2B-ceC96 peptide promoted colitis and vertebral bone erosion. Thus, metabolite-induced cysteine carboxyethylation can give rise to pathogenic neoantigens that lead to autoreactive CD4 + T cell responses and autoantibody production in autoimmune diseases.",

The identity of the metabotropic receptor mediating slow neuromodulatory effects of glycine is unknown. We identified an orphan G protein\u2013coupled receptor, GPR158, as a metabotropic glycine receptor (mGlyR). Glycine and a related modulator, taurine, directly bind to a Cache domain of GPR158, and this event inhibits the activity of the intracellular signaling complex regulator of G protein signaling 7\u2013G protein \u03b25 (RGS7-G\u03b25), which is associated with the receptor. Glycine signals through mGlyR to inhibit production of the second messenger adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate. We further show that glycine, but not taurine, acts through mGlyR to regulate neuronal excitability in cortical neurons. These results identify a major neuromodulatory system involved in mediating metabotropic effects of glycine, with implications for understanding cognition and affective states.",

This idea can explain how quantum systems become classical and acquire a finite temperature, or how in black holes the information about the matter falling in is seemingly erased. We probe the exponential scrambling of a multiparticle system near a bistable point in phase space and utilize it for entanglement-enhanced metrology. A time-reversal protocol is used to observe a simultaneous exponential growth of both the metrological gain and the out-of-time-order correlator, thereby experimentally verifying the relation between quantum metrology and quantum information scrambling. Our results show that rapid scrambling dynamics capable of exponentially fast entanglement generation are useful for practical metrology, resulting in a 6.8(4)-decibel gain beyond the standard quantum limit.",

Destruction was more likely in forest fires, but they burned less WUI. The number of houses within wildfire perimeters has doubled since the 1990s because of both housing growth (47% of additionally exposed houses) and more burned area (53%). Most exposed houses were in the WUI, which grew substantially during the 2010s (2.6 million new WUI houses), albeit not as rapidly as before. Any WUI growth increases wildfire risk to houses though, and more fires increase the risk to existing WUI houses.",

    "abstract": "Replication fork reversal safeguards genome integrity as a replication stress response. DNA translocases and the RAD51 recombinase catalyze reversal. However, it remains unknown why RAD51 is required and what happens to the replication machinery during reversal. We find that RAD51 uses its strand exchange activity to circumvent the replicative helicase, which remains bound to the stalled fork. RAD51 is not required for fork reversal if the helicase is unloaded. Thus, we propose that RAD51 creates a parental DNA duplex behind the helicase that is used as a substrate by the DNA translocases for branch migration to create a reversed fork structure. Our data explain how fork reversal happens while maintaining the helicase in a position poised to restart DNA synthesis and complete genome duplication.",

However, integrated MLLs that drive ultrafast nanophotonic circuits have remained elusive because of their typically low peak powers, lack of controllability, and challenges when integrating with nanophotonic platforms. In this work, we demonstrate an electrically pumped actively MLL in nanophotonic lithium niobate based on its hybrid integration with a III-V semiconductor optical amplifier. Our MLL generates \u223c 4.8-ps optical pulses around 1065 nm at a repetition rate of \u223c10 GHz, with energies exceeding 2.6 pJ and peak powers beyond 0.5 W. The repetition rate and the carrier-envelope offset frequency of the output can be controlled in a wide range by using the driving frequency and the pump current, providing a route for fully stabilized on-chip frequency combs.",

However, in marine species that spend months or entire lifetimes at sea, the location, timing, and duration of sleep may be constrained. To understand how marine mammals satisfy their daily sleep requirements while at sea, we monitored electroencephalographic activity in wild northern elephant seals ( Mirounga angustirostris ) diving in Monterey Bay, California. Brain-wave patterns showed that seals took short (less than 20 minutes) naps while diving (maximum depth 377 meters; 104 sleeping dives). Linking these patterns to accelerometry and the time-depth profiles of 334 free-ranging seals (514,406 sleeping dives) revealed a North Pacific sleepscape in which seals averaged only 2 hours of sleep per day for 7 months, rivaling the record for the least sleep among all mammals, which is currently held by the African elephant (about 2 hours per day).",

We applied deep-learning models to 31,221 x-rays from the UK Biobank to extract a comprehensive set of SPs, which were associated with 145 independent loci genome-wide. Structural equation modeling suggested that limb proportions exhibited strong genetic sharing but were independent of width and torso proportions. Polygenic score analysis identified specific associations between osteoarthritis and hip and knee SPs. In contrast to other traits, SP loci were enriched in human accelerated regions and in regulatory elements of genes that are differentially expressed between humans and great apes. Combined, our work identifies specific genetic variants that affect the skeletal form and ties a major evolutionary facet of human anatomical change to pathogenesis.",

Thus, a mechanism of gating transmission for multiple biosignals in such devices is needed to match and modulate complex aqueous-phase biological systems. Here we report the use of cascade-heterogated biphasic gel iontronics to achieve diverse electronic-to-multi-ionic signal transmission. The cascade-heterogated property determined the transfer free energy barriers experienced by ions and ionic hydration-dehydration states under an electric potential field, fundamentally enhancing the distinction of cross-interface transmission between different ions by several orders of magnitude. Such heterogated or chemical-heterogated iontronics with programmable features can be coupled with multi-ion cross-interface mobilities for hierarchical and selective cross-stage signal transmission. We expect that such iontronics would be ideal candidates for a variety of biotechnology applications.",

However, progress has generally been limited by slow response times and low tunability in thermal conductance. In this work, we demonstrate an electronically gated solid-state thermal switch using self-assembled molecular junctions to achieve excellent performance at room temperature. In this three-terminal device, heat flow is continuously and reversibly modulated by an electric field through carefully controlled chemical bonding and charge distributions within the molecular interface. The devices have ultrahigh switching speeds above 1 megahertz, have on/off ratios in thermal conductance greater than 1300%, and can be switched more than 1 million times. We anticipate that these advances will generate opportunities in molecular engineering for thermal management systems and thermal circuit design.",

Broadly conserved receptors embedded in the spore membrane detect nutrients, but how spores transduce these signals remains unclear. Here, we found that these receptors form oligomeric membrane channels. Mutations predicted to widen the channel initiated germination in the absence of nutrients, whereas those that narrow it prevented ion release and germination in response to nutrients. Expressing receptors with widened channels during vegetative growth caused loss of membrane potential and cell death, whereas the addition of germinants to cells expressing wild-type receptors triggered membrane depolarization. Therefore, germinant receptors act as nutrient-gated ion channels such that ion release initiates exit from dormancy.",

In contrast to achievements in electrical conduction, active control of heat transfer is much more challenging. Ferroelectrics are promising candidates for thermal switching as a result of their tunable domain structures. However, switching ratios in ferroelectrics are low (<1.2). We report that high-quality antiferroelectric PbZrO 3 epitaxial thin films exhibit high-contrast (>2.2), fast-speed (<150 nanoseconds), and long-lifetime (>10 7 ) thermal switching under a small voltage (<10 V). In situ reciprocal space mapping and atomistic modelings reveal that the field-driven antiferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transition induces a substantial change of primitive cell size, which modulates phonon-phonon scattering phase space drastically and results in high switching ratio. These results advance the concept of thermal transport control in ferroic materials.",

Mass spectrometry\u2013based proteomics revealed an antithrombotic signature in platelets of hibernating brown bears with heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) as the most substantially reduced protein. HSP47 down-regulation or ablation attenuated immune cell activation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, contributing to thromboprotection in bears, SCI patients, and mice.

The similarity between photons and phonons points to the interesting potential for linear mechanical quantum computing using phonons in place of photons. Although single-phonon sources and detectors have been demonstrated, a phononic beam splitter element remains an outstanding requirement. Here we demonstrate such an element, using two superconducting qubits to fully characterize a beam splitter with single phonons. We further use the beam splitter to demonstrate two-phonon interference, a requirement for two-qubit gates in linear computing. This advances a new solid-state system for implementing linear quantum computing, further providing straightforward conversion between itinerant phonons and superconducting qubits.",

However, the underlying mechanisms of transfer and their impact on genome evolution are still poorly understood. While studying the evolutionary origin of a selfish element in the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae , we discovered that Mavericks , ancient virus-like transposons related to giant viruses and virophages, are one of the long-sought vectors of horizontal gene transfer. We found that Mavericks gained a novel herpesvirus-like fusogen in nematodes, leading to the widespread exchange of cargo genes between extremely divergent species, bypassing sexual and genetic barriers spanning hundreds of millions of years. Our results show how the union between viruses and transposons causes horizontal gene transfer and ultimately genetic incompatibilities in natural populations.",

Immunostaining of sympathetic axons in optically cleared pineal glands from humans and mice with cardiac disease revealed their substantial denervation compared with controls. Spatial, single-cell, nuclear, and bulk RNA sequencing traced this defect back to the superior cervical ganglia (SCG), which responded to cardiac disease with accumulation of inflammatory macrophages, fibrosis, and the selective loss of pineal gland\u2013innervating neurons. Depletion of macrophages in the SCG prevented disease-associated denervation of the pineal gland and restored physiological melatonin secretion.

    "abstract": "Piezo channels are critical cellular sensors of mechanical forces. Despite their large size, ubiquitous expression, and irreplaceable roles in an ever-growing list of physiological processes, few Piezo channel\u2013binding proteins have emerged. In this work, we found that MyoD (myoblast determination)\u2013family inhibitor proteins (MDFIC and MDFI) are PIEZO1/2 interacting partners. These transcriptional regulators bind to PIEZO1/2 channels, regulating channel inactivation. Using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy, we mapped the interaction site in MDFIC to a lipidated, C-terminal helix that inserts laterally into the PIEZO1 pore module. These Piezo-interacting proteins fit all the criteria for auxiliary subunits, contribute to explaining the vastly different gating kinetics of endogenous Piezo channels observed in many cell types, and elucidate mechanisms potentially involved in human lymphatic vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "After heart injury, dead heart muscle is replaced by scar tissue. Fibroblasts can electrically couple with myocytes, and changes in fibroblast membrane potential can lead to myocyte excitability, which suggests that fibroblast-myocyte coupling in scar tissue may be responsible for arrhythmogenesis. However, the physiologic relevance of electrical coupling of myocytes and fibroblasts and its impact on cardiac excitability in vivo have never been demonstrated. We genetically engineered a mouse that expresses the optogenetic cationic channel ChR2 (H134R) exclusively in cardiac fibroblasts. After myocardial infarction, optical stimulation of scar tissue elicited organ-wide cardiac excitation and induced arrhythmias in these animals. Complementing computational modeling with experimental approaches, we showed that gap junctional and ephaptic coupling, in a synergistic yet functionally redundant manner, excited myocytes coupled to fibroblasts.",

    "abstract": "During pregnancy, physiological adaptations prepare the female body for the challenges of motherhood. Becoming a parent also requires behavioral adaptations. Such adaptations can occur as early as during pregnancy, but how pregnancy hormones remodel parenting circuits to instruct preparatory behavioral changes remains unknown. We found that action of estradiol and progesterone on galanin (Gal)\u2013expressing neurons in the mouse medial preoptic area (MPOA) is critical for pregnancy-induced parental behavior. Whereas estradiol silences MPOA Gal neurons and paradoxically increases their excitability, progesterone permanently rewires this circuit node by promoting dendritic spine formation and recruitment of excitatory synaptic inputs. This MPOA Gal -specific neural remodeling sparsens population activity in vivo and results in persistently stronger, more selective responses to pup stimuli. Pregnancy hormones thus remodel parenting circuits in anticipation of future behavioral need.",

We characterized the structure and composition of the byssus biointerface using histology, confocal Raman mapping, phase contrast\u2013enhanced microcomputed tomography, and advanced electron microscopy, revealing a sophisticated junction consisting of abiotic biopolymer sheets interdigitated between living extracellular matrix. The sheet surfaces are in intimate adhesive contact with billions of motile epithelial cilia that control biointerface strength and stem release through their collective movement, which is regulated neurochemically. We posit that this may involve a complex sensory pathway by which sessile mussels respond to environmental stresses to release and relocate.",

    "abstract": "Tasmanian devils have spawned two transmissible cancer lineages, named devil facial tumor 1 (DFT1) and devil facial tumor 2 (DFT2). We investigated the genetic diversity and evolution of these clones by analyzing 78 DFT1 and 41 DFT2 genomes relative to a newly assembled, chromosome-level reference. Time-resolved phylogenetic trees reveal that DFT1 first emerged in 1986 (1982 to 1989) and DFT2 in 2011 (2009 to 2012). Subclone analysis documents transmission of heterogeneous cell populations. DFT2 has faster mutation rates than DFT1 across all variant classes, including substitutions, indels, rearrangements, transposable element insertions, and copy number alterations, and we identify a hypermutated DFT1 lineage with defective DNA mismatch repair. Several loci show plausible evidence of positive selection in DFT1 or DFT2, including loss of chromosome Y and inactivation of MGA , but none are common to both cancers. This study reveals the parallel long-term evolution of two transmissible cancers inhabiting a common niche in Tasmanian devils.",

These short (average 2.56 base pairs) deletions are enriched for human brain functions across genetic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic datasets. Using massively parallel reporter assays in six cell types, we discovered 800 hCONDELs conferring significant differences in regulatory activity, half of which enhance rather than disrupt regulatory function. We highlight several hCONDELs with putative human-specific effects on brain development, including HDAC5 , CPEB4 , and PPP2CA . Reverting an hCONDEL to the ancestral sequence alters the expression of LOXL2 and developmental genes involved in myelination and synaptic function. Our data provide a rich resource to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms driving new traits in humans and other species.",

In this work, we investigate the frequencies and determinants of ILS in 29 major ancestral nodes across the entire primate phylogeny. We find up to 64% of the genome affected by ILS at individual nodes. We exploit ILS to reconstruct speciation times and ancestral population sizes. Estimated speciation times are much more recent than genomic divergence times and are in good agreement with the fossil record. We show extensive variation of ILS along the genome, mainly driven by recombination but also by the distance to genes, highlighting a major impact of selection on variation along the genome. In many nodes, ILS is reduced more on the X chromosome compared with autosomes than expected under neutrality, which suggests higher impacts of natural selection on the X chromosome. Finally, we show an excess of ILS in genes with immune functions and a deficit of ILS in housekeeping genes. The extensive ILS in primates discovered in this study provides insights into the speciation times, ancestral population sizes, and patterns of natural selection that shape primate evolution.",

Through a large-scale phylodynamic analysis of 115,622 Omicron BA.1 genomes, we identified >6,000 introductions of the antigenically distinct VOC into England and analyzed their local transmission and dispersal history. We find that six of the eight largest English Omicron lineages were already transmitting when Omicron was first reported in southern Africa (22 November 2021). Multiple datasets show that importation of Omicron continued despite subsequent restrictions on travel from southern Africa as a result of export from well-connected secondary locations. Initiation and dispersal of Omicron transmission lineages in England was a two-stage process that can be explained by models of the country\u2019s human geography and hierarchical travel network. Our results enable a comparison of the processes that drive the invasion of Omicron and other VOCs across multiple spatial scales.",

In flowering plants, starch-accumulating plastids, known as amyloplasts, act as statoliths to facilitate downstream gravitropism. The gravity-sensing mechanism has long been considered a mechanosensing process by which amyloplasts transmit forces to intracellular structures, but the molecular mechanism underlying this has not been elucidated. We show here that LAZY1-LIKE (LZY) family proteins involved in statocyte gravity signaling associate with amyloplasts and the proximal plasma membrane. This results in polar localization according to the direction of gravity. We propose a gravity-sensing mechanism by which LZY translocation to the plasma membrane signals the direction of gravity by transmitting information on the position of amyloplasts.",

We mapped the distribution of CO 2 on Europa using observations obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We found a concentration of CO 2 within Tara Regio, a recently resurfaced terrain. This indicates that the CO 2 is derived from an internal carbon source. We propose that the CO 2 formed in the internal ocean, although we cannot rule out formation on the surface through radiolytic conversion of ocean-derived organics or carbonates.",

    "abstract": "Functionally similar to the tight junctions present in animal guts, plant roots have evolved a lignified Casparian strip as an extracellular diffusion barrier in the endodermis to seal the root apoplast and maintain nutrient homeostasis. How this diffusion barrier is structured has been partially defined, but its lignin polymerization and assembly steps remain elusive. Here, we characterize a family of dirigent proteins (DPs) essential for both the localized polymerization of lignin required for Casparian strip biogenesis in the cell wall and for attachment of the strip to the plasma membrane to seal the apoplast. We reveal a Casparian strip lignification mechanism that requires cooperation between DPs and the Schengen pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DPs directly mediate lignin polymerization as part of this mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The electrocaloric effect demands the maximized degree of freedom (DOF) of polar domains and the lowest energy barrier to facilitate the transition of polarization. However, optimization of the DOF and energy barrier\u2014including domain size, crystallinity, multiconformation coexistence, polar correlation, and other factors in bulk ferroelectrics\u2014has reached a limit. We used organic crystal dimethylhexynediol (DMHD) as a three-dimensional sacrificial master to assemble polar conformations at the heterogeneous interface in poly(vinylidene fluoride)\u2013based terpolymer. DMHD was evaporated, and the epitaxy-like process induced an ultrafinely distributed, multiconformation-coexisting polar interface exhibiting a giant conformational entropy. Under a low electric field, the interface-augmented terpolymer had a high entropy change of 100 J/(kg\u00b7K). This interface polarization strategy is generally applicable to dielectric capacitors, supercapacitors, and other related applications.",

Existing synthetic methods use stepwise extension of sequences immobilized on solid supports and are limited by their scalability and sustainability. We report a biocatalytic approach to efficiently produce oligonucleotides in a single operation where polymerases and endonucleases work in synergy to amplify complementary sequences embedded within catalytic self-priming templates. This approach uses unprotected building blocks and aqueous conditions. We demonstrate the versatility of this methodology through the synthesis of clinically relevant oligonucleotide sequences containing diverse modifications.",

    "abstract": "A global survey of coral reefs reveals that overfishing is driving resident shark species toward extinction, causing diversity deficits in reef elasmobranch (shark and ray) assemblages. Our species-level analysis revealed global declines of 60 to 73% for five common resident reef shark species and that individual shark species were not detected at 34 to 47% of surveyed reefs. As reefs become more shark-depleted, rays begin to dominate assemblages. Shark-dominated assemblages persist in wealthy nations with strong governance and in highly protected areas, whereas poverty, weak governance, and a lack of shark management are associated with depauperate assemblages mainly composed of rays. Without action to address these diversity deficits, loss of ecological function and ecosystem services will increasingly affect human communities.",

However, whether these populations use common mechanisms to establish tissue residence is unknown. In this work, we show that T RM 1 and T RM 17 cells navigate divergent trajectories to acquire tissue residency in the skin. T RM 1 cells depend on a T-bet\u2013Hobit\u2013IL-15 axis, whereas T RM 17 cells develop independently of these factors. Instead, c-Maf commands a tissue-resident program in T RM 17 cells parallel to that induced by Hobit in T RM 1 cells, with an ICOS\u2013c-Maf\u2013IL-7 axis pivotal to T RM 17 cell commitment. Accordingly, by targeting this pathway, skin T RM 17 cells can be ablated without compromising their T RM 1 counterparts. Thus, skin-resident T cells rely on distinct molecular circuitries, which can be exploited to strategically modulate local immunity.",

We present a multidecadal record of phytoplankton photophysiology between 1996 and 2022 from historical in situ datasets collected by Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) floats and ship-based platforms. We find a significant multidecadal trend in irradiance-normalized nonphotochemical quenching due to increasing iron stress, with concomitant declines in regional net primary production. The observed trend of increasing iron stress results from changing Southern Ocean mixed-layer physics as well as complex biological and chemical feedback that is indicative of important ongoing changes to the Southern Ocean carbon cycle.",

This conservation strategy should be especially effective in highly threatened regions that are poorly protected by public lands, such as the Brazilian Cerrado. Brazil\u2019s Native Vegetation Protection Law has included set-aside areas within private properties, but their relevance to conservation has not been evaluated. We assess whether private lands are contributing to biodiversity in the Cerrado, a global biodiversity conservation priority and major region for food production, where land use conflicts are often at odds with conservation objectives. We determined that private protected areas accommodate up to 14.5% of threatened vertebrate species ranges, which increases to 25% when considering the distribution of remaining native habitat. Moreover, the spatial spread of private protected areas benefits a large number of species. Ecological restoration of private protected lands would improve the benefits of this protection system, especially in the Southeastern Cerrado, where a large economic hub meets a threat hotspot.",

Instead, these materials are often used in composite films that are challenging to recycle. We report a Cu-catalyzed amination of polyethylenes to form mono- and bifunctional materials containing a series of polar groups and substituents. Designed catalysts with hydrophobic moieties enable the amination of linear and branched polyethylenes without chain scission or cross-linking, leading to polyethylenes with otherwise inaccessible combinations of functional groups and architectures. The resulting materials possess tunable bulk and surface properties, including toughness, adhesion to metal, paintability, and water solubility, which could unlock applications for functional polyethylenes and reduce the need for complex composites.",

    "abstract": "Photolyases, a ubiquitous class of flavoproteins, use blue light to repair DNA photolesions. In this work, we determined the structural mechanism of the photolyase-catalyzed repair of a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) lesion using time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX). We obtained 18 snapshots that show time-dependent changes in four reaction loci. We used these results to create a movie that depicts the repair of CPD lesions in the picosecond-to-nanosecond range, followed by the recovery of the enzymatic moieties involved in catalysis, completing the formation of the fully reduced enzyme-product complex at 500 nanoseconds. Finally, back-flip intermediates of the thymine bases to reanneal the DNA were captured at 25 to 200 microseconds. Our data cover the complete molecular mechanism of a photolyase and, importantly, its chemistry and enzymatic catalysis at work across a wide timescale and at atomic resolution.",

We report a platform for their preparation through the enantioconvergent, nickel-catalyzed addition of organoboronates to racemic, nonactivated ketones. We prepared several important classes of \u03b1,\u03b2-chiral tertiary alcohols in a single step with high levels of diastereo- and enantioselectivity through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric addition of aryl and alkenyl nucleophiles. We applied this protocol to modify several profen drugs and to rapidly synthesize biologically relevant molecules. We expect this nickel-catalyzed, base-free ketone racemization process to be a widely applicable strategy for the development of dynamic kinetic processes.",

We reappraise the role played by surface processes in controlling sediment delivery to the oceans and find stable sedimentation rates throughout the Cenozoic with distinct phases of sediment transfer from terrestrial to marine basins. Our simulation provides a tool for identifying inconsistencies in previous interpretations of the geological record as preserved in sedimentary strata, and in available paleoelevation and paleoclimatic reconstructions.",

Tau can be targeted by using passively transferred antibodies (Abs), but the mechanisms of Ab protection are incompletely understood. In this work, we used a variety of cell and animal model systems and showed that the cytosolic Ab receptor and E3 ligase TRIM21 (T21) could play a role in Ab protection against tau pathology. Tau-Ab complexes were internalized to the cytosol of neurons, which enabled T21 engagement and protection against seeded aggregation. Ab-mediated protection against tau pathology was lost in mice that lacked T21. Thus, the cytosolic compartment provides a site of immunotherapeutic protection, which may help in the design of Ab-based therapies in neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Protein-coding differences between species often fail to explain phenotypic diversity, suggesting the involvement of genomic elements that regulate gene expression such as enhancers. Identifying associations between enhancers and phenotypes is challenging because enhancer activity can be tissue-dependent and functionally conserved despite low sequence conservation. We developed the Tissue-Aware Conservation Inference Toolkit (TACIT) to associate candidate enhancers with species\u2019 phenotypes using predictions from machine learning models trained on specific tissues. Applying TACIT to associate motor cortex and parvalbumin-positive interneuron enhancers with neurological phenotypes revealed dozens of enhancer\u2013phenotype associations, including brain size\u2013associated enhancers that interact with genes implicated in microcephaly or macrocephaly. TACIT provides a foundation for identifying enhancers associated with the evolution of any convergently evolved phenotype in any large group of species with aligned genomes.",

Here, we report a metal\u2013organic framework featuring iron(II) sites with a local structure similar to that in \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. The framework reacts with O 2 at low temperatures to form high-spin iron(IV)=O species that are characterized using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform, in situ and variable-field M\u00f6ssbauer, Fe K\u03b2 x-ray emission, and nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopies.

LRRK2 is recruited to membrane organelles and activated by Rab29, a Rab guanosine triphosphatase encoded in the PARK16 locus. We present cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of Rab29\u2013LRRK2 complexes in three oligomeric states, providing key snapshots during LRRK2 recruitment and activation. Rab29 induces an unexpected tetrameric assembly of LRRK2, formed by two kinase-active central protomers and two kinase-inactive peripheral protomers. The central protomers resemble the active-like state trapped by the type I kinase inhibitor DNL201, a compound that underwent a phase 1 clinical trial. Our work reveals the structural mechanism of LRRK2 spatial regulation and provides insights into LRRK2 inhibitor design for Parkinson\u2019s disease treatment.",

However, how this histone mark is translated into downstream effects remains poorly understood owing to a lack of knowledge about its readers. We developed a nucleosome-based photoaffinity probe to capture proteins that recognize H3K79 dimethylation (H3K79me2) in a nucleosomal context. In combination with a quantitative proteomics approach, this probe identified menin as a H3K79me2 reader. A cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of menin bound to an H3K79me2 nucleosome revealed that menin engages with the nucleosome using its fingers and palm domains and recognizes the methylation mark through a \u03c0-cation interaction. In cells, menin is selectively associated with H3K79me2 on chromatin, particularly in gene bodies.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes critically rely on bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) to stimulate lipid catabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and lysosomal function. Alterations in BMP levels in monogenic and complex neurodegeneration suggest an essential function in human health. However, the site and mechanism responsible for BMP synthesis have been subject to debate for decades. Here, we report that the Batten disease gene product CLN5 is the elusive BMP synthase (BMPS). BMPS-deficient cells exhibited a massive accumulation of the BMP synthesis precursor lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG), depletion of BMP species, and dysfunctional lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, we found that BMPS mediated synthesis through an energy-independent base exchange reaction between two LPG molecules with increased activity on BMP-laden vesicles. Our study elucidates BMP biosynthesis and reveals an anabolic function of late endosomes/lysosomes.",

Current analytical strategies for these glycan-decorated biomolecules, termed glycoconjugates, rely on ensemble-averaged methods that do not provide a full view of positions and structures of glycans attached at individual sites in a given molecule, especially for glycoproteins. We show single-molecule analysis of glycoconjugates by direct imaging of individual glycoconjugate molecules using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Intact glycoconjugate ions from electrospray are soft-landed on a surface for their direct single-molecule imaging. The submolecular imaging resolution corroborated by quantum mechanical modeling unveils whole structures and attachment sites of glycans in glycopeptides, glycolipids, N-glycoproteins, and O-glycoproteins densely decorated with glycans.",

Using high-pressure 11 B nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on the quantum magnet SrCu 2 (BO 3 ) 2 , we here demonstrate a magnetic field\u2013induced plaquette singlet to antiferromagnetic transition above 1.8 gigapascals at a notably low temperature, T c \u2243 0.07 kelvin. First-order signatures of the transition weaken with increasing pressure, and we observe quantum critical scaling at the highest pressure, 2.4 gigapascals. Supported by model calculations, we suggest that these observations can be explained by a proximate DQCP inducing critical quantum fluctuations and emergent O(3) symmetry of the order parameters. Our findings offer a concrete experimental platform for investigation of the DQCP.",

Consequently, an individual at the phenotypic extreme and at the greatest risk for severe, early-onset disease is better identified by a few rare penetrant variants than by the collective action of many common variants with weak effects. By combining rare variants across phenotype-associated genes into a unified genetic risk model, we demonstrate superior portability across diverse global populations compared with common-variant polygenic risk scores, greatly improving the clinical utility of genetic-based risk prediction.",

In this work, we present a 3.3-\u212b-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of PRC2 bound to a G-quadruplex RNA. Notably, RNA mediates the dimerization of PRC2 by binding both protomers and inducing a protein interface composed of two copies of the catalytic subunit EZH2, thereby blocking nucleosome DNA interaction and histone H3 tail accessibility. Furthermore, an RNA-binding loop of EZH2 facilitates the handoff between RNA and DNA, another activity implicated in PRC2 regulation by RNA. We identified a gain-of-function mutation in this loop that activates PRC2 in zebrafish. Our results reveal mechanisms for RNA-mediated regulation of a chromatin-modifying enzyme.",

On the ResNet50 benchmark image classification network, relative to a graphics processing unit (GPU) that uses a comparable 12-nanometer technology process, NorthPole achieves a 25 times higher energy metric of frames per second (FPS) per watt, a 5 times higher space metric of FPS per transistor, and a 22 times lower time metric of latency. Similar results are reported for the Yolo-v4 detection network. NorthPole outperforms all prevalent architectures, even those that use more-advanced technology processes.",

We show that correct waggle dancing requires social learning. Bees without the opportunity to follow any dances before they first danced produced significantly more disordered dances with larger waggle angle divergence errors and encoded distance incorrectly. The former deficit improved with experience, but distance encoding was set for life. The first dances of bees that could follow other dancers showed neither impairment. Social learning, therefore, shapes honey bee signaling, as it does communication in human infants, birds, and multiple other vertebrate species.",

Coordination may be mediated by molecular signaling and/or mechanical connectivity between cells, but how genes modify mechanical interactions between layers is unknown. Here we show that genes driving brassinosteroid synthesis promote growth of internal tissue, at least in part, by reducing mechanical epidermal constraint. We identified a brassinosteroid-deficient dwarf mutant in the aquatic plant Utricularia gibba with twisted internal tissue, likely caused by mechanical constraint from a slow-growing epidermis. We tested this hypothesis by showing that a brassinosteroid mutant in Arabidopsis enhances epidermal crack formation, indicative of increased tissue stress. We propose that by remodeling cell walls, brassinosteroids reduce epidermal constraint, showing how genes can control growth coordination between layers by means of mechanics.",

We conducted a global search for short-term precursory slip in GPS data. We summed the displacements measured by 3026 high-rate GPS time series\u2014projected onto the directions expected from precursory slip at the hypocenter\u2014during 48 hours before 90 (moment magnitude \u22657) earthquakes. Our approach reveals a \u22482-hour-long exponential acceleration of slip before the ruptures, suggesting that large earthquakes start with a precursory phase of slip, which improvements in measurement precision and density could more effectively detect and possibly monitor.",

    "abstract": "The hinge of bivalve shells can sustain hundreds of thousands of repeating opening-and-closing valve motions throughout their lifetime. We studied the hierarchical design of the mineralized tissue in the hinge of the bivalve Cristaria plicata , which endows the tissue with deformability and fatigue resistance and consequently underlies the repeating motion capability. This folding fan\u2013shaped tissue consists of radially aligned, brittle aragonite nanowires embedded in a resilient matrix and can translate external radial loads to circumferential deformation. The hard-soft complex microstructure can suppress stress concentration within the tissue. Coherent nanotwin boundaries along the longitudinal direction of the nanowires increase their resistance to bending fracture. The unusual biomineral, which exploits the inherent properties of each component through multiscale structural design, provides insights into the evolution of antifatigue structural materials.",

    "abstract": "The development of voltage-sensitive fluorescent probes suggests fluorescence lifetime as a promising readout for electrical activity in biological systems. Existing approaches fail to achieve the speed and sensitivity required for voltage imaging in neuroscience applications. We demonstrated that wide-field electro-optic fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (EO-FLIM) allows lifetime imaging at kilohertz frame-acquisition rates, spatially resolving action potential propagation and subthreshold neural activity in live adult Drosophila . Lifetime resolutions of <5 picoseconds at 1 kilohertz were achieved for single-cell voltage recordings. Lifetime readout is limited by photon shot noise, and the method provides strong rejection of motion artifacts and technical noise sources. Recordings revealed local transmembrane depolarizations, two types of spikes with distinct fluorescence lifetimes, and phase locking of spikes to an external mechanical stimulus.",

However, no field study has documented what happens when large volumes of erupted volcanic material are instead delivered directly into the ocean. We show how the rapid emplacement of large volumes of erupted material onto steep submerged slopes triggered extremely fast (122 kilometers per hour) and long-runout (>100 kilometers) seafloor currents. These density currents were faster than those triggered by earthquakes, floods, or storms, and they broke seafloor cables, cutting off a nation from the rest of the world. The deep scours excavated by these currents are similar to those around many submerged volcanoes, providing evidence of large eruptions at other sites worldwide.",

In this work, we show how formaldehyde (FA), a one-carbon unit derived from both endogenous sources and environmental exposure, regulates one-carbon metabolism by inhibiting the biosynthesis of S -adenosylmethionine (SAM), the major methyl donor in cells. FA reacts with privileged, hyperreactive cysteine sites in the proteome, including Cys120 in S-adenosylmethionine synthase isoform type-1 (MAT1A). FA exposure inhibited MAT1A activity and decreased SAM production with MAT-isoform specificity. A genetic mouse model of chronic FA overload showed a decrease n SAM and in methylation on selected histones and genes. Epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of Mat1a and related genes function as compensatory mechanisms for FA-dependent SAM depletion, revealing a biochemical feedback cycle between FA and SAM one-carbon units.",

With our estimated global solid waste generation of 2.56 to 3.33 billion tonnes by 2050, implementing abrupt technical and behavioral changes could result in a net-zero warming solid waste system relative to 2020, leading to 11 to 27 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide warming\u2013equivalent emissions under the temperature limits. These changes, however, require accelerated adoption within 9 to 17 years (by 2033 to 2041) to align with the Global Methane Pledge. Rapidly reducing methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide emissions is necessary to maximize the short-term climate benefits and stop the ongoing temperature rise.",

Here, we report the cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of the Bombyx mori R2 non-LTR retrotransposon initiating TPRT at its ribosomal DNA target. The target DNA sequence is unwound at the insertion site and recognized by an upstream motif. An extension of the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain recognizes the retrotransposon RNA and guides the 3\u2032 end into the RT active site to template reverse transcription. We used Cas9 to retarget R2 in vitro to non-native sequences, suggesting future use as a reprogrammable RNA-based gene-insertion tool.",

We found that neuronal activity induces widespread transcriptional up-regulation and down-regulation in astrocytes, highlighted by the identification of Slc22a3 as an activity-inducible astrocyte gene that encodes neuromodulator transporter Slc22a3 and regulates sensory processing in the mouse olfactory bulb. Loss of astrocytic Slc22a3 reduced serotonin levels in astrocytes, leading to alterations in histone serotonylation. Inhibition of histone serotonylation in astrocytes reduced the expression of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) biosynthetic genes and GABA release, culminating in olfactory deficits. Our study reveals that neuronal activity orchestrates transcriptional and epigenomic responses in astrocytes while illustrating new mechanisms for how astrocytes process neuromodulatory input to gate neurotransmitter release for sensory processing.",

In mammals, deterministic expression of the same Pcdh isoform promotes minimal overlap of tiled projections of serotonergic neuron axons throughout the brain, while stochastic expression of Pcdh genes allows for convergence of tightly packed, overlapping olfactory sensory neuron axons into targeted structures. How can the same gene locus generate opposite transcriptional programs that orchestrate distinct spatial arrangements of axonal patterns? Here, we reveal that cell type\u2013specific Pcdh expression and axonal behavior depend on the activity of cohesin and its unloader, WAPL (wings apart\u2013like protein homolog). While cohesin erases genomic-distance biases in Pcdh choice, WAPL functions as a rheostat of cohesin processivity that determines Pcdh isoform diversity.",

Underlying current theories of cerebellar function is the notion that this highly conserved one-to-one relationship renders Purkinje dendrites into a single computational compartment. However, we discovered that multiple primary dendrites are a near-universal morphological feature in humans. Using tract tracing, immunolabeling, and in vitro electrophysiology, we found that in mice ~25% of mature multibranched cells receive more than one CF input. Two-photon calcium imaging in vivo revealed that separate dendrites can exhibit distinct response properties to sensory stimulation, indicating that some multibranched cells integrate functionally independent CF-receptive fields. These findings indicate that PCs are morphologically and functionally more diverse than previously thought.",

The radical catalysts can be generated from easily prepared NHC-borane complexes, and the broad availability of the chiral NHC component provides substantial benefits for stereochemical control. Mechanistic studies support a catalytic cycle comprising a sequence of boryl radical addition, hydrogen atom transfer, cyclization, and elimination of the boryl radical catalyst, wherein the chiral NHC subunit determines the enantioselectivity of the radical cyclization. This catalysis allows asymmetric construction of valuable chiral heterocyclic products from simple starting materials.",

    "abstract": "The main nucleating vapor in the atmosphere is thought to be sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), stabilized by ammonia (NH 3 ). However, in marine and polar regions, NH 3 is generally low, and H 2 SO 4 is frequently found together with iodine oxoacids [HIO x , i.e., iodic acid (HIO 3 ) and iodous acid (HIO 2 )]. In experiments performed with the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) chamber, we investigated the interplay of H 2 SO 4 and HIO x during atmospheric particle nucleation. We found that HIO x greatly enhances H 2 SO 4 (-NH 3 ) nucleation through two different interactions. First, HIO 3 strongly binds with H 2 SO 4 in charged clusters so they drive particle nucleation synergistically. Second, HIO 2 substitutes for NH 3 , forming strongly bound H 2 SO 4 -HIO 2 acid-base pairs in molecular clusters. Global observations imply that HIO x is enhancing H 2 SO 4 (-NH 3 ) nucleation rates 10- to 10,000-fold in marine and polar regions.",

    "abstract": "Distal arthrogryposis (DA) is a collection of rare disorders that are characterized by congenital joint contractures. Most DA mutations are in muscle- and joint-related genes, and the anatomical defects originate cell-autonomously within the musculoskeletal system. However, gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO2, a principal mechanosensor in somatosensation, cause DA subtype 5 (DA5) through unknown mechanisms. We show that expression of a gain-of-function PIEZO2 mutation in proprioceptive sensory neurons that mainly innervate muscle spindles and tendons is sufficient to induce DA5-like phenotypes in mice. Overactive PIEZO2 causes anatomical defects through increased activity within the peripheral nervous system during postnatal development. Furthermore, botulinum toxin (Botox) and a dietary fatty acid that modulates PIEZO2 activity reduce DA5-like deficits. This reveals a role for somatosensory neurons: Excessive mechanosensation within these neurons disrupts musculoskeletal development.",

The extent and speed of farming expansion across the South American plains over the past four decades provide an unprecedented case of the effects of rainfed farming on hydrology. Remote sensing analysis shows that as annual crops replaced native vegetation and pastures, floods gradually doubled their coverage, increasing their sensitivity to precipitation. Groundwater shifted from deep (12 to 6 meters) to shallow (4 to 0 meters) states, reducing drawdown levels. Field studies and simulations suggest that declining rooting depths and evapotranspiration in croplands are the causes of this hydrological transformation. These findings show the escalating flooding risks associated with rainfed agriculture expansion at subcontinental and decadal scales.",

The initially ballistic quantum walk does not dissipate into low supermode states of the synthetic lattice; instead, the state stabilizes in a broad frequency comb, unlocking the full potential of the synthetic frequency lattice. Our device produces a low-noise, nearly flat broadband comb (reaching 100 per centimeter bandwidth) and offers a promising platform to generate broadband, tunable, and stable frequency combs.",

To help solve this problem, breeders have been attempting to develop maize cultivars with high yields and high Fe concentrations in the kernels. We conducted a genome-wide association study and identified a gene, ZmNAC78 ( NAM/ATAF/CUC DOMAIN TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 78 ), that regulates Fe concentrations in maize kernels. We cultivated maize varieties with both high yield and high Fe concentrations in their kernels by using a molecular marker developed from a 42\u2013base pair insertion or deletion (indel) in the promoter of ZmNAC78 . ZmNAC78 expression is enriched in the basal endosperm transfer layer of kernels, and the ZmNAC78 protein directly regulates messenger RNA abundance of Fe transporters. Our results thus provide an approach to develop maize varieties with Fe-enriched kernels.",

We directly observe the nonlocal nature of fermion pairing in a Hubbard lattice gas, using spin- and density-resolved imaging of \u223c 1000 fermionic potassium-40 atoms under a bilayer microscope. Complete fermion pairing is revealed by the vanishing of global spin fluctuations with increasing attraction. In the strongly correlated regime, the fermion pair size is found to be on the order of the average interparticle spacing.

To enable the coherent control of \u201cremote\u201d qubits that are outside of the tunnel junction, we complemented each electron spin with a local magnetic field gradient from a nearby single-atom magnet. Readout was achieved by using a sensor qubit in the tunnel junction and implementing pulsed double electron spin resonance.

Our angstrom-scale qubit platform may enable quantum functionalities using electron spin arrays built atom by atom on a surface.",

We show that light versus dark seasonal pelage in white-tailed jackrabbits ( Lepus townsendii ) tracks snow cover and is primarily determined by genetic variation at endothelin receptor type B ( EDNRB ), corin serine peptidase ( CORIN ), and agouti signaling protein ( ASIP ). Winter color variation was associated with deeply divergent alleles at these genes, reflecting selection on both ancestral and introgressed variation. Forecasted reductions in snow cover are likely to induce widespread camouflage mismatch. However, simulated populations with variation for darker winter pelage are predicted to adapt rapidly, providing a trait-based genetic framework to facilitate evolutionary rescue. These discoveries demonstrate how the genetic basis of climate change adaptation can inform conservation.",

C 4 grasses are thought to have become ecologically dominant in Africa only after 10 million years ago (Ma). However, paleobotanical records older than 10 Ma are sparse, limiting assessment of the timing and nature of C 4 biomass expansion. This study uses a multiproxy design to document vegetation structure from nine Early Miocene mammal site complexes across eastern Africa. Results demonstrate that between ~21 and 16 Ma, C 4 grasses were locally abundant, contributing to heterogeneous habitats ranging from forests to wooded grasslands. These data push back the oldest evidence of C 4 grass\u2013dominated habitats in Africa\u2014and globally\u2014by more than 10 million years, calling for revised paleoecological interpretations of mammalian evolution.",

We studied California blackworms ( Lumbriculus variegatus ), which slowly form tangles in minutes but can untangle in milliseconds. Combining ultrasound imaging, theoretical analysis, and simulations, we developed and validated a mechanistic model that explains how the kinematics of individual active filaments determines their emergent collective topological dynamics. The model reveals that resonantly alternating helical waves enable both tangle formation and ultrafast untangling. By identifying generic dynamical principles of topological self-transformations, our results can provide guidance for designing classes of topologically tunable active materials.",

Luminescence dating shows that sediment just beneath the ice sheet was deposited by flowing water in an ice-free environment 416 \u00b1 38 thousand years ago. Provenance analyses and cosmogenic nuclide data and calculations suggest the sediment was reworked from local materials and exposed at the surface <16 thousand years before deposition.

However, the signals that regulate eosinophil activity in the SI at steady state remain poorly understood. Through transcriptome profiling of eosinophils from various mouse tissues, we found that a subset of SI eosinophils expressed neuromedin U (NMU) receptor 1 (NMUR1). Fate-mapping analyses showed that NMUR1 expression in SI eosinophils was programmed by the local microenvironment and further enhanced by inflammation. Genetic perturbation and eosinophil-organoid coculture experiments revealed that NMU-mediated eosinophil activation promotes goblet cell differentiation. Thus, NMU regulates epithelial cell differentiation and barrier immunity by stimulating NMUR1-expressing eosinophils in the SI, which highlights the importance of neuroimmune-epithelial cross-talk in maintaining tissue homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The thalamus plays a central coordinating role in the brain. Thalamic neurons are organized into spatially distinct nuclei, but the molecular architecture of thalamic development is poorly understood, especially in humans. To begin to delineate the molecular trajectories of cell fate specification and organization in the developing human thalamus, we used single-cell and multiplexed spatial transcriptomics. We show that molecularly defined thalamic neurons differentiate in the second trimester of human development and that these neurons organize into spatially and molecularly distinct nuclei. We identified major subtypes of glutamatergic neuron subtypes that are differentially enriched in anatomically distinct nuclei and six subtypes of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid\u2013mediated (GABAergic) neurons that are shared and distinct across thalamic nuclei.",

    "abstract": "Many animals engage in cannibalism to supplement their diets. Among dense populations of migratory locusts, cannibalism is prevalent. We show that under crowded conditions, locusts produce an anticannibalistic pheromone called phenylacetonitrile. Both the degree of cannibalism and the production of phenylacetonitrile are density dependent and covary. We identified the olfactory receptor that detects phenylacetonitrile and used genome editing to make this receptor nonfunctional, thereby abolishing the negative behavioral response. We also inactivated the gene underlying phenylacetonitrile production and show that locusts that lack this compound lose its protection and are more frequently exposed to intraspecific predation. Thus, we reveal an anticannibalistic feature built on a specifically produced odor. The system is very likely to be of major importance in locust population ecology, and our results might therefore provide opportunities in locust management.",

How CTLs terminate signaling and disengage to allow serial killing has remained a mystery. TCR activation triggers membrane specialization within the immune synapse, including the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), a lipid that can induce negative membrane curvature. We found that activated TCRs were shed into DAG-enriched ectosomes at the immune synapse rather than internalized through endocytosis, suggesting that DAG may contribute to the outward budding required for ectocytosis. Budding ectosomes were endocytosed directly by target cells, thereby terminating TCR signaling and simultaneously disengaging the CTL from the target cell to allow serial killing. Thus, ectocytosis renders TCR signaling self-limiting.",

As examples, we demonstrate real-time tracking of position and attitude of a flying bee, navigation of a biopsy needle, tracking of a free-flowing marker, and sensing of pressure and temperature, all in unshielded environments. The achieved sensor size, measurement accuracy, and workspace of ~25 centimeters show the potential for a low-cost wireless tracking and sensing platform for medical and nonmedical applications.",

Such lexical creativity is manifested at different timescales, ranging from language development in children to the evolution of word meanings over history. We explored whether different manifestations of lexical creativity build on a common foundation. Using computational models, we show that a parsimonious set of semantic knowledge types characterize developmental data as well as evolutionary products of meaning extension spanning over 1400 languages. Models for evolutionary data account very well for developmental data, and vice versa. These findings suggest a unified foundation for human lexical creativity underlying both the fleeting products of individual ontogeny and the evolutionary products of phylogeny across languages.",

How their supposedly air-driven sound source can produce biosonar clicks at depths of >1000 meters, while also producing rich vocal repertoires to mediate complex social communication, remains unknown. We show that odontocetes possess a sound production system based on air driven through nasal passages that is functionally analogous to laryngeal and syringeal sound production. Tissue vibration in different registers produces distinct echolocation and communication signals across all major odontocete clades, and thus provides a physiological basis for classifying their vocal repertoires. The vocal fry register is used by species from porpoises to sperm whales for generating powerful, highly air-efficient echolocation clicks.",

One possibility is that permanent aposematism first evolved through species using hidden warning signals, which are only exposed to would-be predators on encounter. Here, we present a large-scale analysis of evolutionary transitions in amphibian antipredation coloration and demonstrate that the evolutionary transition from camouflage to aposematism is rarely direct but tends to involve an intermediary stage, namely cryptic species that facultatively reveal conspicuous coloration. Accounting for this intermediate step can resolve the paradox and thereby advance our understanding of the evolution of aposematism.",

Limitation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) or activation of hunger-promoting neurons induced a hunger state that extended life span despite increased feeding. Alteration of the neuronal histone acetylome was associated with BCAA limitation, and preventing these alterations abrogated the effect of BCAA limitation to increase feeding and extend life span. Hunger acutely increased feeding through usage of the histone variant H3.3, whereas prolonged hunger seemed to decrease a hunger set point, resulting in beneficial consequences for aging. Demonstration of the sufficiency of hunger to extend life span reveals that motivational states alone can be deterministic drivers of aging.",

Studies of carbohydrate functions would be advanced if glycosylation methods were as reliable and modular as palladium (Pd)-catalyzed cross-coupling. However, Pd-catalysis excels in forming sp 2 -hybridized carbon centers whereas glycosylation mostly builds sp 3 -hybridized C\u2013O linkages. We report a glycosylation platform through Pd-catalyzed S N 2 displacement from phenols toward bench-stable, aryl-iodide\u2013containing glycosyl sulfides. The key Pd(II) oxidative addition intermediate diverges from an arylating agent (Csp 2 electrophile) to a glycosylating agent (Csp 3 electrophile). This method inherits many merits of cross-coupling reactions, including operational simplicity and functional group tolerance. It preserves the S N 2 mechanism for various substrates and is amenable to late-stage glycosylation of commercial drugs and natural products.",

We report a concise total synthesis of the manzamine alkaloid lissodendoric acid A, which hinges on the development of a regioselective, diastereoselective, and stereospecific trapping of a fleeting cyclic allene intermediate. This key step swiftly assembles the azadecalin framework of the natural product, allows for a succinct synthetic endgame, and enables a 12-step total synthesis (longest linear sequence; 0.8% overall yield).

Using the device, the subjects could successfully exploit the thermal phantom hand maps to detect and discriminate different thermal stimuli. The use of a wearable device that provides thermal sensation can increase the sense of embodiment and improve life quality in hand amputees.",

    "abstract": "Cyclopropanes are key features in many preclinical, clinical, and commercial drugs, as well as natural products. The most prolific technique for their synthesis is the metal-catalyzed reaction of an alkene with a diazoalkane, a highly energetic reagent requiring stringent safety precautions. Discovery of alternative innocuous reagents remains an ongoing challenge. Herein, we report a simple photoredox-catalyzed intermolecular cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes with active methylene compounds. The reaction proceeds in neutral solvent under air or dioxygen (O 2 ) with a photoredox catalyst excited by blue light-emitting diode light and an iodine co-catalyst that is either added as molecular iodine or generated in situ from alkyl iodides. Mechanistic investigations indicate that photosensitized O 2 plays a vital role in the generation of carbon-centered radicals for both the addition of active methylene compounds to alkenes and the ring closure.",

Fluorinated gases represent intuitive building blocks for the late-stage installation of fluorinated groups, but they are generally overlooked because they require the use of specialized equipment. We report a general strategy for handling fluorinated gases as benchtop-stable solid reagents using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Gas-MOF reagents are prepared on gram-scale and used to facilitate fluorovinylation and fluoroalkylation reactions. Encapsulation of gas-MOF reagents within wax enables stable storage on the benchtop and controlled release into solution upon sonication, which represents a safer alternative to handling the gas directly. Furthermore, our approach enables high-throughput reaction development with these gases.",

Nearly all nuclei map to one of 125 robust cell types identified in the middle temporal gyrus. However, we found interindividual variance in abundances and gene expression signatures, particularly in deep-layer glutamatergic neurons and microglia. A minority of donor variance is explainable by age, sex, ancestry, disease state, and cell state. Genomic variation was associated with expression of 150 to 250 genes for most cell types. This characterization of cellular variation provides a baseline for cell typing in health and disease.",

The enhanced stratospheric humidity, radiative cooling, and expanded aerosol surface area in the volcanic plume created the ideal conditions for swift ozone depletion of 5% in the tropical stratosphere in just 1 week. The decrease in hydrogen chloride by 0.4 parts per million by volume (ppbv) and the increase in chlorine monoxide by 0.4 ppbv provided compelling evidence for chlorine activation within the volcanic plume. This study enhances our understanding of the effect of this unusual volcanic eruption on stratospheric chemistry and provides insights into possible chemistry changes that may occur in a changing climate.",

Post-reproductive representation was 0.195, indicating that a female who reached adulthood could expect to live about one-fifth of her adult life in a post-reproductive state, around half as long as human hunter-gatherers. Post-reproductive females exhibited hormonal signatures of menopause, including sharply increasing gonadotropins after age 50. We discuss whether post-reproductive life spans in wild chimpanzees occur only rarely, as a short-term response to favorable ecological conditions, or instead are an evolved species-typical trait as well as the implications of these alternatives for our understanding of the evolution of post-reproductive life spans.",

This mechanistic scenario is inapplicable to the synthesis of ketones from the 1,1-disubstituted alkenes. Current approaches based on semi -pinacol rearrangement of Pd II intermediates are limited to the ring expansion of highly strained methylene cyclobutane derivatives. Herein, we report a solution to this synthetic challenge by designing a Pd II /Pd IV catalytic cycle incorporating a 1,2-alkyl/Pd IV dyotropic rearrangement as a key step. This reaction, compatible with a broad range of functional groups, is applicable to both linear olefins and methylene cycloalkanes, including macrocycles. Regioselectivity favors the migration of the more substituted carbon, and a strong directing effect of the \u03b2-carboxyl group was also observed.",

Dominance is well documented in plant and animal breeding. Outside of rare monogenic traits, however, evidence in humans is limited. We systematically examined common genetic variation across 1060 traits in a large population cohort (UK Biobank, N = 361,194 samples analyzed) for evidence of dominance effects. We then developed a computationally efficient method to rapidly assess the aggregate contribution of dominance deviations to heritability. Lastly, observing that dominance associations are inherently less correlated between sites at a genomic locus than their additive counterparts, we explored whether they may be leveraged to identify causal variants more confidently.",

Compared with deep (>2000 meter) hydrothermal activity at mid-ocean ridges that provide iron to the ocean\u2019s interior, shallow (<500 meter) hydrothermal fluids are likely to influence the surface\u2019s ecosystem. However, their effect is unknown. In this work, we show that fluids emitted along the Tonga volcanic arc (South Pacific) have a substantial impact on iron concentrations in the photic layer through vertical diffusion. This enrichment stimulates biological activity, resulting in an extensive patch of chlorophyll (360,000 square kilometers). Diazotroph activity is two to eight times higher and carbon export fluxes are two to three times higher in iron-enriched waters than in adjacent unfertilized waters. Such findings reveal a previously undescribed mechanism of natural iron fertilization in the ocean that fuels regional hotspot sinks for atmospheric CO 2 .",

We show how INO80 recognizes noncanonical DNA and histone features of hexasomes that emerge from the loss of H2A\u2013H2B. A large structural rearrangement switches the catalytic core of INO80 into a distinct, spin-rotated mode of remodeling while its nuclear actin module remains tethered to long stretches of unwrapped linker DNA. Direct sensing of an exposed H3\u2013H4 histone interface activates INO80, independently of the H2A\u2013H2B acidic patch. Our findings reveal how the loss of H2A\u2013H2B grants remodelers access to a different, yet unexplored layer of energy-driven chromatin regulation.",

We deciphered the molecular programs of the early organizing centers and their cross-talk with NSCs, revealing primate-biased galanin-like peptide ( GALP ) signaling in the anteroventral telencephalon. Regional transcriptomic variations were observed along the frontotemporal axis during early stages of neocortical NSC progression and in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, we found that genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and brain cancer risk might play critical roles in the early telencephalic organizers and during NSC progression.",

We show that Aster-B and Aster-C are critical for nonvesicular cholesterol movement in enterocytes. Loss of NPC1L1 diminishes accessible plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol and abolishes Aster recruitment to the intestinal brush border. Enterocytes lacking Asters accumulate PM cholesterol and show endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol depletion. Aster-deficient mice have impaired cholesterol absorption and are protected against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Finally, the Aster pathway can be targeted with a small-molecule inhibitor to manipulate cholesterol uptake. These findings identify the Aster pathway as a physiologically important and pharmacologically tractable node in dietary lipid absorption.",

In this work, we investigated such behavior by using scanning tunneling potentiometry to probe the nanometer-scale flow of electron fluids in graphene as they pass through channels defined by smooth and tunable in-plane p-n junction barriers. We observed that as the sample temperature and channel widths are increased, the electron fluid flow undergoes a Knudsen-to-Gurzhi transition from the ballistic to the viscous regime characterized by a channel conductance that exceeds the ballistic limit, as well as suppressed charge accumulation against the barriers. Our results are well modeled by finite element simulations of two-dimensional viscous current flow, and they illustrate how Fermi liquid flow evolves with carrier density, channel width, and temperature.",

We found that the ejaculation experience selectively activated estrogen receptor 2 ( Esr2 )\u2013expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)\u2014BNST Esr2 \u2014and led to persistent decreases in firing threshold for days, during which time the mice displayed sexual satiety. Inhibition of hyperexcited BNST Esr2 elicited fast mating recovery in satiated mice of both sexes. In males, such hyperexcitability reduced mating motivation and was partially mediated by larger HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) currents. Thus, BNST Esr2 not only encode a specific mating action but also represent a persistent state of sexual satiety, and alterations in a neuronal ion channel contribute to sexual experience\u2013dependent long-term changes to mating drive.",

By characterizing chromatin accessibility and gene expression in developing wing tissues, we compared the regulatory architecture of convergence between a pair of mimetic butterfly species. Although a handful of color pattern genes are known to be involved in their convergence, our data suggest that different mutational paths underlie the integration of these genes into wing pattern development. This is supported by a large fraction of accessible chromatin being exclusive to each species, including the de novo lineage-specific evolution of a modular optix enhancer. These findings may be explained by a high level of developmental drift and evolutionary contingency that occurs during the independent evolution of mimicry.",

Here, using super-resolution microscopy, we found that the two essential subcomplexes of the proteasome, the regulatory (19 S ) and catalytic (20 S ) particles, are differentially distributed within individual rat cortical neurons. We discovered an unexpected abundance of free 19 S particles near synapses. The free neuronal 19 S particles bind and deubiquitylate lysine 63\u2013ubiquitin (Lys 63 -ub), a non\u2013proteasome-targeting ubiquitin linkage. Pull-down assays revealed a significant overrepresentation of synaptic molecules as Lys 63 -ub interactors. Inhibition of the 19 S deubiquitylase activity significantly altered excitatory synaptic transmission and reduced the synaptic availability of AMPA receptors at multiple trafficking points in a proteasome-independent manner. Together, these results reveal a moonlighting function of the regulatory proteasomal subcomplex near synapses.",

Cross-presentation relies on the unusual \u201cleakiness\u201d of endocytic compartments in DCs, whereby internalized proteins escape into the cytosol for proteasome-mediated generation of MHC I\u2013binding peptides. Given that type 1 conventional DCs excel at cross-presentation, we searched for cell type\u2013specific effectors of endocytic escape. We devised an assay suitable for genetic screening and identified a pore-forming protein, perforin-2 ( Mpeg1 ), as a dedicated effector exclusive to cross-presenting cells. Perforin-2 was recruited to antigen-containing compartments, where it underwent maturation, releasing its pore-forming domain. Mpeg1 \u2212/\u2212 mice failed to efficiently prime CD8 + T cells to cell-associated antigens, revealing an important role for perforin-2 in cytosolic entry of antigens during cross-presentation.",

We show that cross-couplings catalyzed by some of the most active catalysts occur by a mechanism not previously considered. Copper(II) [Cu(II)] complexes of oxalamide ligands catalyze Ullmann coupling to form the C\u2013O bond in aryl ethers by concerted oxidative addition of an aryl halide to Cu(II) to form a high-valent species that is stabilized by radical character on the oxalamide ligand. This mechanism diverges from those involving Cu(I) and Cu(III) intermediates that have been posited for other Ullmann-type couplings. The stability of the Cu(II) state leads to high turnover numbers, >1000 for the coupling of phenoxide with aryl chloride electrophiles, as well as an ability to run the reactions in air.",

This \u201cepimutation clock\u201d is orders of magnitude faster than DNA-based clocks and enables phylogenetic explorations on a scale of years to centuries. We show experimentally that epimutation clocks recapitulate known topologies and branching times of intraspecies phylogenetic trees in the self-fertilizing plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the clonal seagrass Zostera marina , which represent two major modes of plant reproduction. This discovery will open new possibilities for high-resolution temporal studies of plant biodiversity.",

By contrast, the microbial sulfur isotope fractionation remains large and relatively uniform. Over Earth history, the effect of increasing seawater sulfate and oxygen concentrations on sulfate and sulfide transport and reaction may explain the corresponding increase observed in the \u03b4 34 S offset between sulfate and pyrite. More subtle variations may be related to changes in depositional environments associated with sea level fluctuations and supercontinent cycles.",

We determined the isotope composition of the moderately volatile element zinc in 18 bulk meteorites and identified nucleosynthetic zinc isotope anomalies. Using a mass-balance model, we find that carbonaceous bodies, which likely formed beyond the orbit of Jupiter, delivered about half of Earth\u2019s zinc inventory.

    "abstract": "Methylations on nucleosomal histones play fundamental roles in regulating eukaryotic transcription. Jumonji C domain\u2013containing histone demethylases (JMJs) dynamically control the level of histone methylations. However, how JMJ activity is generally regulated is unknown. We found that the tricarboxylic acid cycle\u2013associated enzyme \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) dehydrogenase (KGDH) entered the nucleus, where it interacted with various JMJs to regulate \u03b1-KG\u2013dependent histone demethylations by JMJs, and thus controlled genome-wide gene expression in plants. We show that nuclear targeting is regulated by environmental signals and that KGDH is enriched at thousands of loci in Arabidopsis thaliana . Chromatin-bound KGDH catalyzes \u03b1-KG decarboxylation and thus may limit its local availability to KGDH-coupled JMJs, inhibiting histone demethylation. Thus, our results uncover a regulatory mechanism for histone demethylations by JMJs.",

    "abstract": "During the consumption of alkanes, Alcanivorax borkumensis will form a biofilm around an oil droplet, but the role this plays during degradation remains unclear. We identified a shift in biofilm morphology that depends on adaptation to oil consumption: Longer exposure leads to the appearance of dendritic biofilms optimized for oil consumption effected through tubulation of the interface. In situ microfluidic tracking enabled us to correlate tubulation to localized defects in the interfacial cell ordering. We demonstrate control over droplet deformation by using confinement to position defects, inducing dimpling in the droplets. We developed a model that elucidates biofilm morphology, linking tubulation to decreased interfacial tension and increased cell hydrophobicity.",

To determine whether this biology is conserved in humans, we characterized the colonic \u03b3\u03b4 T cell compartment, identifying a diverse repertoire that includes a phenotypically distinct subset coexpressing T cell receptor V\u03b34 and the epithelium-binding integrin CD103. This subset was disproportionately diminished and dysregulated in inflammatory bowel disease, whereas on-treatment CD103 + \u03b3\u03b4 T cell restoration was associated with sustained inflammatory bowel disease remission. Moreover, CD103 + V\u03b34 + cell dysregulation and loss were also displayed by humans with germline BTNL3/BTNL8 hypomorphism, which we identified as a risk factor for penetrating Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). Thus, BTNL-dependent selection and/or maintenance of distinct tissue-intrinsic \u03b3\u03b4 T cells appears to be an evolutionarily conserved axis limiting the progression of a complex, multifactorial, tissue-damaging disease of increasing global incidence.",

Using whole-genome data of 3955 of Darwin\u2019s finches on the Gal\u00e1pagos Island of Daphne Major, we identified six loci of large effect that explain 45% of the variation in the highly heritable beak size of Geospiza fortis, a key ecological trait. The major locus is a supergene comprising four genes. Abrupt changes in allele frequencies at the loci accompanied a strong change in beak size caused by natural selection during a drought. A gradual change in Geospiza scandens occurred across 30 years as a result of introgressive hybridization with G. fortis . This study shows how a few loci with large effect on a fitness-related trait contribute to the genetic potential for rapid adaptive radiation.",

To address this, we examined grooming, coalition, and food-sharing patterns in bonobos ( Pan paniscus ), one of our closest living relatives whose rare out-group tolerance facilitates interaction opportunities between groups. We show that, as in humans, positive assortment supports bonobo cooperation across borders. Bonobo cooperative attitudes toward in-group members informed their cooperative relationships with out-groups, in particular, forming connections with out-group individuals who also exhibited high cooperation tendencies. Our findings show that cooperation between unrelated individuals across groups without immediate payoff is not exclusive to humans and suggest that such cooperation can emerge in the absence of social norms or strong cultural dispositions.",

In the adult mouse ventricular-subventricular zone, NSCs are heterogeneous and, depending on their location in the niche, give rise to different subtypes of olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons. Here, we show that multiple regionally distinct NSCs, including domains that are usually quiescent, are recruited on different gestation days during pregnancy. Synchronized activation of these adult NSC pools generates transient waves of short-lived OB interneurons, especially in layers with less neurogenesis under homeostasis. Using spatial transcriptomics, we identified molecular markers of pregnancy-associated interneurons and showed that some subsets are temporarily needed for own pup recognition. Thus, pregnancy triggers transient yet behaviorally relevant neurogenesis, highlighting the physiological relevance of adult stem cell heterogeneity.",

In this work, we studied how morphogens influence self-organizing processes at the collective or \u201csupra\u201d-cellular scale in avian skin. We made physical measurements across length scales, which revealed morphogen-enabled material property differences that were amplified at supracellular scales in comparison to cellular scales. At the supracellular scale, we found that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) promoted \u201csolidification\u201d of tissues, whereas bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) promoted fluidity and enhanced mechanical activity. Together, these effects created basement membrane\u2013less compartments within mesenchymal tissue that were mechanically primed to drive avian skin tissue budding. Understanding this multiscale process requires the ability to distinguish between proximal effects of morphogens that occur at the cellular scale and their functional effects, which emerge at the supracellular scale.",

We probed excitonic emission from GNRs synthesized on a metal surface with atomic-scale spatial resolution. A scanning tunneling microscope (STM)\u2013based method to transfer the GNRs to a partially insulating surface was used to prevent luminescence quenching of the ribbons. STM-induced fluorescence spectra reveal emission from localized dark excitons that are associated with the topological end states of the GNRs. A low-frequency vibronic emission comb is observed and attributed to longitudinal acoustic modes that are confined to a finite box. Our study provides a path to investigate the interplay between excitons, vibrons, and topology in graphene nanostructures.",

We conducted an interdisciplinary study of an assemblage of historic archaeological horse remains, integrating genomic, isotopic, radiocarbon, and paleopathological evidence. Archaeological and modern North American horses show strong Iberian genetic affinities, with later influx from British sources, but no Viking proximity. Horses rapidly spread from the south into the northern Rockies and central plains by the first half of the 17th century CE, likely through Indigenous exchange networks. They were deeply integrated into Indigenous societies before the arrival of 18th-century European observers, as reflected in herd management, ceremonial practices, and culture.",

Cyclin-dependent kinase 13 ( CDK13 ) is mutated in melanoma, and patient-mutated CDK13 accelerates zebrafish melanoma. CDK13 mutation causes aberrant RNA stabilization. CDK13 is required for ZC3H14 phosphorylation, which is necessary and sufficient to promote nuclear RNA degradation. Mutant CDK13 fails to activate nuclear RNA surveillance, causing aberrant protein-coding transcripts to be stabilized and translated. Forced aberrant RNA expression accelerates melanoma in zebrafish. We found recurrent mutations in genes encoding nuclear RNA surveillance components in many malignancies, establishing nuclear RNA surveillance as a tumor-suppressive pathway. Activating nuclear RNA surveillance is crucial to avoid accumulation of aberrant RNAs and their ensuing consequences in development and disease.",

We performed a time-resolved study of ultrafast molecular symmetry breaking through geometric relaxation (Jahn-Teller distortion) on the methane cation. Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with soft x-rays at the carbon K-edge revealed that the distortion occurred within 10 \u00b1 2 femtoseconds after few-femtosecond strong-field ionization of methane. The distortion activated coherent oscillations in the asymmetric scissoring vibrational mode of the symmetry-broken cation, which were detected in the x-ray signal. These oscillations were damped within 58 \u00b1 13 femtoseconds because vibrational coherence was lost with the energy redistributing into lower-frequency vibrational modes. This study completely reconstructs the molecular relaxation dynamics of this prototypical example and opens avenues for exploring complex systems.",

Mesopredators shifted their movements toward areas with twofold-greater human influence in regions occupied by large carnivores, indicating that they perceived humans to be less of a threat. However, rather than shielding mesopredators, human-caused mortality was more than three times higher than large carnivore\u2013caused mortality. Mesopredator suppression by apex predators may thus be amplified, rather than dampened, outside protected areas, because fear of large carnivores drives mesopredators into areas of even greater risk from human super predators.",

Using diamond-based magnetic imaging, we observed hybridized spin-wave\u2013Meissner-current transport modes with strongly altered, temperature-tunable wavelengths and then demonstrated local control of spin-wave refraction using a focused laser.

    "abstract": "On a flat map of the Earth, continents are inevitably distorted. Reciprocally, curving a plate simultaneously in two directions requires a modification of in-plane distances, as Gauss stated in his seminal theorem. Although emerging architectured materials with programmed in-plane distortions are capable of such shape morphing, an additional control of local bending is required to precisely set the final shape of the resulting three-dimensional surface. Inspired by bulliform cells in leaves of monocotyledon plants, we show how the internal structure of flat panels can be designed to program bending and in-plane distortions simultaneously when pressurized, leading to a targeted shell shape. These surfaces with controlled stiffness and fast actuation are manufactured using consumer-grade materials and open a route to large-scale shape-morphing robotics applications.",

    "abstract": "Dietary fiber improves metabolic health, but host-encoded mechanisms for digesting fibrous polysaccharides are unclear. In this work, we describe a mammalian adaptation to dietary chitin that is coordinated by gastric innate immune activation and acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase). Chitin consumption causes gastric distension and cytokine production by stomach tuft cells and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in mice, which drives the expansion of AMCase-expressing zymogenic chief cells that facilitate chitin digestion. Although chitin influences gut microbial composition, ILC2-mediated tissue adaptation and gastrointestinal responses are preserved in germ-free mice. In the absence of AMCase, sustained chitin intake leads to heightened basal type 2 immunity, reduced adiposity, and resistance to obesity. These data define an endogenous metabolic circuit that enables nutrient extraction from an insoluble dietary constituent by enhancing digestive function.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is affecting a wide range of global systems, with polar ecosystems experiencing the most rapid change. Although climate impacts affect lower-trophic-level and short-lived species most directly, it is less clear how long-lived and mobile species will respond to rapid polar warming because they may have the short-term ability to accommodate ecological disruptions while adapting to new conditions. We found that the population dynamics of an iconic and highly mobile polar-associated species are tightly coupled to Arctic prey availability and access to feeding areas. When low prey biomass coincided with high ice cover, gray whales experienced major mortality events, each reducing the population by 15 to 25%. This suggests that even mobile, long-lived species are sensitive to dynamic and changing conditions as the Arctic warms.",

The production of low-volatility dimeric compounds through accretion reactions is a key aspect of SOA formation. However, despite extensive study, the structures and thus the formation mechanisms of dimers in SOA remain largely uncharacterized. In this work, we elucidate the structures of several major dimer esters in SOA from ozonolysis of \u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-pinene\u2014substantial global SOA sources\u2014through independent synthesis of authentic standards. We show that these dimer esters are formed in the particle phase and propose a mechanism of nucleophilic addition of alcohols to a cyclic acylperoxyhemiacetal.

Knowledge of ice loss during similarly warm past climates could resolve this uncertainty, including the Last Interglacial when global sea levels were 5 to 10 meters higher than today and global average temperatures were 0.5\u00b0 to 1.5\u00b0C warmer than preindustrial levels. Using a panel of genome-wide, single-nucleotide polymorphisms of a circum-Antarctic octopus, we show persistent, historic signals of gene flow only possible with complete WAIS collapse. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that the tipping point of WAIS loss could be reached even under stringent climate mitigation scenarios.",

Mechanistically, TFMT impairs the association of host cap RNAs with the viral polymerase basic protein 2 subunit in human lung explants and in vivo in mice. TFMT acts synergistically with approved anti-influenza drugs.",

However, how METAPs interact with ribosomes and how their cleavage specificity is ensured is unknown. We discovered that in eukaryotes the nascent polypeptide\u2013associated complex (NAC) controls ribosome binding of METAP1. NAC recruits METAP1 using a long, flexible tail and provides a platform for the formation of an active methionine excision complex at the ribosomal tunnel exit. This mode of interaction ensures the efficient excision of methionine from cytosolic proteins, whereas proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum are spared. Our results suggest a broader mechanism for how access of protein biogenesis factors to translating ribosomes is controlled.",

Seven species of extinct megafauna disappeared by 12.9 ka, before the onset of the Younger Dryas. Comparison with high-resolution regional datasets revealed that these disappearances coincided with an ecological state shift that followed aridification and vegetation changes during the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d (14.69 to 12.89 ka). Time-series modeling implicates large-scale fires as the primary cause of the extirpations, and the catalyst of this state shift may have been mounting human impacts in a drying, warming, and increasingly fire-prone ecosystem.",

We explored how mechanosensation affords exquisite awareness of the genitals and controls reproduction in mice and humans. Using genetic strategies and in vivo functional imaging, we demonstrated that the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO2 (piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2) is necessary for behavioral sensitivity to perineal touch. PIEZO2 function is needed for triggering a touch-evoked erection reflex and successful mating in both male and female mice. Humans with complete loss of PIEZO2 function have genital hyposensitivity and experience no direct pleasure from gentle touch or vibration. Together, our results help explain how perineal mechanoreceptors detect the gentlest of stimuli and trigger physiologically important sexual responses, thus providing a platform for exploring the sensory basis of sexual pleasure and its relationship to affective touch.",

The Dome1\u2013JAK\u2013STAT pathway, which exists in most Ixodid tick genomes, regulates the regeneration and proliferation of gut cells\u2014including stem cells\u2014and dictates metamorphosis through the Hedgehog and Notch\u2013Delta networks, ultimately affecting Ixodes vectorial competence.

However, experimental limitations in preparing aligned molecules efficiently have hindered the investigation of steric effects in bimolecular reactions involving hydrogen. Here, we report a high-resolution crossed-beam study of the reaction H + HD( v = 1, j = 2) \u2192 H 2 ( v \u2032, j \u2032) + D at collision energies of 0.50, 1.20, and 2.07 electron volts in which the vibrationally excited hydrogen deuteride (HD) molecules were prepared in two collision configurations, with their bond preferentially aligned parallel and perpendicular to the relative velocity of collision partners. Notable stereodynamical effects in differential cross sections were observed. Quantum dynamics calculations revealed that strong constructive interference in the perpendicular configuration plays an important role in the stereodynamical effects observed.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the composition and activation of multicomponent receptor complexes is a challenge in biology. To address this, we developed a synthetic approach based on nanobodies to drive assembly and activation of cell surface receptors and apply the concept by manipulating receptors that govern plant symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. We show that the Lotus japonicus Nod factor receptors NFR1 and NFR5 constitute the core receptor complex initiating the cortical root nodule organogenesis program as well as the epidermal program controlling infection. We find that organogenesis signaling is mediated by the intracellular kinase domains whereas infection requires functional ectodomains. Finally, we identify evolutionarily distant barley receptors that activate root nodule organogenesis, which could enable engineering of biological nitrogen-fixation into cereals.",

Although the Y-linked testis-determining gene Sry has been identified, the ovarian-determining factor remains unknown. In this study, we identified \u2212KTS, a major, alternatively spliced isoform of the Wilms tumor suppressor WT1, as a key determinant of female sex determination. Loss of \u2212 KTS variants blocked gonadal differentiation in mice, whereas increased expression, as found in Frasier syndrome, induced precocious differentiation of ovaries independently of their genetic sex. In XY embryos, this antagonized Sry expression, resulting in male-to-female sex reversal. Our results identify \u2212KTS as an ovarian-determining factor and demonstrate that its time of activation is critical in gonadal sex differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between plants and herbivores are central in most ecosystems, but their strength is highly variable. The amount of variability within a system is thought to influence most aspects of plant-herbivore biology, from ecological stability to plant defense evolution. Our understanding of what influences variability, however, is limited by sparse data. We collected standardized surveys of herbivory for 503 plant species at 790 sites across 116\u00b0 of latitude. With these data, we show that within-population variability in herbivory increases with latitude, decreases with plant size, and is phylogenetically structured. Differences in the magnitude of variability are thus central to how plant-herbivore biology varies across macroscale gradients. We argue that increased focus on interaction variability will advance understanding of patterns of life on Earth.",

This is particularly true of the sulfur isotopic composition of sedimentary pyrite (\u03b4 34 S pyr ), which is used to reconstruct ocean-atmosphere oxidation state and track the evolution of several microbial metabolic pathways. We present a microanalytical approach to deconvolving the multiple signals that influence \u03b4 34 S pyr , yielding both the unambiguous determination of microbial isotopic fractionation (\u03b5 mic ) and new information about depositional conditions. We applied this approach to recent glacial-interglacial sediments, which feature over 70\u2030 variations in bulk \u03b4 34 S pyr across these environmental transitions. Despite profound environmental change, \u03b5 mic remained essentially invariant throughout this interval and the observed range in \u03b4 34 S pyr was instead driven by climate-induced variations in sedimentation.",

Chemical communication through volatile pheromones is common among insects; however, it remains unknown if and how such chemical communication occurs in tsetse flies. We identified methyl palmitoleate (MPO), methyl oleate, and methyl palmitate as compounds that are produced by the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans and elicit strong behavioral responses. MPO evoked a behavioral response in male\u2014but not virgin female\u2014 G. morsitans . G. morsitans males mounted females of another species, Glossina fuscipes , when they were treated with MPO. We further identified a subpopulation of olfactory neurons in G. morsitans that increase their firing rate in response to MPO and showed that infecting flies with African trypanosomes alters the flies\u2019 chemical profile and mating behavior. The identification of volatile attractants in tsetse flies may be useful for reducing disease spread.",

Freshwater biodiversity is high not only in tectonically active settings but also in tectonically quiescent montane regions such as the Appalachian Mountains. We show that erosion through different rock types drove allopatric divergence between lineages of the Greenfin Darter ( Nothonotus chlorobranchius ), a fish species endemic to rivers draining metamorphic rocks in the Tennessee River basin in the United States. In the past, metamorphic rock preferred by N. chlorobranchius was more widespread, but as erosion exposed other rock types, lineages of this species were progressively isolated in tributaries farther upstream, where metamorphic rock remained. Our results suggest a geologic mechanism for initiating allopatric diversification in mountains long after tectonic activity ceases.",

Supershear cracks smoothly accelerate beyond c R , to speeds that could approach dilatation wave speeds. Supershear dynamics are governed by different principles than those guiding \u201cclassical\u201d cracks; this fracture mode is excited at critical (material dependent) applied strains.

We describe the properties of a naturally occurring, non\u2013genetically modified symbiotic bacterium, Delftia tsuruhatensis TC1, which was isolated from mosquitoes incapable of sustaining the development of Plasmodium falciparum parasites. D. tsuruhatensis TC1 inhibits early stages of Plasmodium development and subsequent transmission by the Anopheles mosquito through secretion of a small-molecule inhibitor. We have identified this inhibitor to be the hydrophobic molecule harmane. We also found that, on mosquito contact, harmane penetrates the cuticle, inhibiting Plasmodium development. D. tsuruhatensis TC1 stably populates the mosquito gut, does not impose a fitness cost on the mosquito, and inhibits Plasmodium development for the mosquito\u2019s life. Contained field studies in Burkina Faso and modeling showed that D. tsuruhatensis TC1 has the potential to complement mosquito-targeted malaria transmission control.",

We identified 169 functionally diverse genes that converge on melanosome biogenesis, endosomal transport, and gene regulation, of which 135 represented previously unknown associations with pigmentation. In agreement with their melanin-promoting function, the majority of screen hits were up-regulated in melanocytes from darkly pigmented individuals. We further unraveled functions of KLF6 as a transcription factor that regulates melanosome maturation and pigmentation in vivo, and of the endosomal trafficking protein COMMD3 in modulating melanosomal pH. Our study reveals a plethora of melanin-promoting genes, with broad implications for human variation, cell biology, and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein B (apoB)\u2013lipoproteins initiate and promote atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Plasma tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity is negatively associated with atherogenic apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels in humans, but the mechanisms are unknown. We found that tPA, partially through the lysine-binding site on its Kringle 2 domain, binds to the N terminus of apoB, blocking the interaction between apoB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in hepatocytes, thereby reducing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and plasma apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) sequesters tPA away from apoB and increases VLDL assembly. Humans with PAI-1 deficiency have smaller VLDL particles and lower plasma levels of apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol. These results suggest a mechanism that fine-tunes VLDL assembly by intracellular interactions among tPA, PAI-1, and apoB in hepatocytes.",

One common assumption is that such complex pattern formation requires spatial isolation or long evolutionary timescales. We show that multiscale network structure can evolve rapidly under simple ecological conditions without spatial structure. In just 21 days of laboratory coevolution, Escherichia coli and bacteriophage \u03a621 coevolve and diversify to form elaborate cross-infection networks. By measuring ~10,000 phage-bacteria infections and testing the genetic basis of interactions, we identify the mechanisms that create each component of the multiscale pattern. Our results demonstrate how multiscale networks evolve in parasite-host systems, illustrating Darwin\u2019s idea that simple adaptive processes can generate entangled banks of ecological interactions.",

A long-standing hypothesis is that cortical feedback projections carry top-down signals to influence sensory coding. However, this hypothesis has never been tested to establish causal links. We used viral tools to label feedback connections from cortical area V4 targeting early visual cortex (area V1). While monkeys performed a visual\u2013spatial attention task, inactivating feedback axonal terminals in V1 without altering local intracortical and feedforward inputs reduced the response gain of single cells and impaired the accuracy of neural populations for encoding external stimuli. These effects are primarily manifested in the superficial layers of V1 and propagate to downstream area V4. Attention enhances sensory coding across visual cortex by specifically altering the strength of corticocortical feedback in a layer-dependent manner.",

Although the steps leading up to the proliferation of surviving cardiomyocytes have been extensively studied, little is known about the mechanisms that control proliferation and redifferentiation to a mature state. We found that the cardiac dyad, a structure that regulates calcium handling and excitation-contraction coupling, played a key role in the redifferentiation process. A component of the cardiac dyad called leucine-rich repeat\u2013containing 10 (Lrrc10) acted as a negative regulator of proliferation, prevented cardiomegaly, and induced redifferentiation. We found that its function was conserved in mammalian cardiomyocytes. This study highlights the importance of the underlying mechanisms required for heart regeneration and their application to the generation of fully functional cardiomyocytes.",

Both receptor families have coevolved at an accelerated rate, but the evolution and diversification of PRRs is poorly understood. We have isolated potato surface receptor Pep-13 receptor unit (PERU) that senses Pep-13, a conserved immunogenic peptide pattern from plant pathogenic Phytophthora species. PERU, a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, is a bona fide PRR that binds Pep-13 and enhances immunity to Phytophthora infestans infection. Diversification in ligand binding specificities of PERU can be traced to sympatric wild tuber-bearing Solanum populations in the Central Andes.

Precursor vesicles are distinct from conventional secretory organelles, endosomes, and degradative lysosomes and are transported by coincident detection of PI(3,5)P 2 and active ARL8 via kinesin KIF1A to the presynaptic compartment.

We examined element abundances in a sample of stars that are enhanced in r -process elements. The abundances of elements ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and silver (atomic numbers Z = 44 to 47; mass numbers A = 99 to 110) correlate with those of heavier elements (63 \u2264 Z \u2264 78, A > 150). There is no correlation for neighboring elements (34 \u2264 Z \u2264 42 and 48 \u2264 Z \u2264 62). We interpret this as evidence that fission fragments of transuranic nuclei contribute to the abundances.

However, the frictional properties and conditions that sustain these diverse slip behaviors remain enigmatic. Frictional healing is one such property, which describes the degree of fault restrengthening between earthquakes. We show that the frictional healing rate of materials entrained along the megathrust at the northern Hikurangi margin, which hosts well-characterized recurring shallow slow slip events (SSEs), is nearly zero (<0.0001 per decade). These low healing rates provide a mechanism for the low stress drops (<50 kilopascals) and short recurrence times (1 to 2 years) characteristic of shallow SSEs at Hikurangi and other subduction margins. We suggest that near-zero frictional healing rates, associated with weak phyllosilicates that are common in subduction zones, may promote frequent, small-stress-drop, slow ruptures near the trench.",

The chemical stability of the peptide-based tag allows the use of palladium-mediated reactions to efficiently synthesize peptide-encoded libraries (PELs) with broad chemical diversity and high purity. We demonstrate the successful de novo discovery of small-molecule protein ligands from PELs by affinity selection against carbonic anhydrase IX and the oncogenic protein targets BRD4(1) and MDM2.

Aggregates often form upon exposure to stress and have ecological and biophysical characteristics that differ from those of single filaments. Here, we report that Trichodesmium aggregates can rapidly modulate their shape, responding within minutes to changes in environmental conditions. Combining video microscopy and mathematical modeling, we discovered that this reorganization is mediated by \u201csmart reversals\u201d wherein gliding filaments reverse when their overlap with other filaments diminishes. By regulating smart reversals, filaments control aggregate architecture without central coordination. We propose that the modulation of gliding motility at the single-filament level is a determinant of Trichodesmium \u2019s aggregation behavior and ultimately of its biogeochemical role in the ocean.",

We report analyses of marine and terrestrial proxies from a deep-sea core on the Portugese margin that show the presence of pronounced millennial-scale climate variability during a glacial period ~1.154 to ~1.123 Ma, culminating in a terminal stadial cooling comparable to the most extreme events of the last 400,000 years.

    "abstract": "Epistasis between genes is traditionally studied with mutations that eliminate protein activity, but most natural genetic variation is in cis-regulatory DNA and influences gene expression and function quantitatively. In this study, we used natural and engineered cis-regulatory alleles in a plant stem-cell circuit to systematically evaluate epistatic relationships controlling tomato fruit size. Combining a promoter allelic series with two other loci, we collected over 30,000 phenotypic data points from 46 genotypes to quantify how allele strength transforms epistasis. We revealed a saturating dose-dependent relationship but also allele-specific idiosyncratic interactions, including between alleles driving a step change in fruit size during domestication. Our approach and findings expose an underexplored dimension of epistasis, in which cis-regulatory allelic diversity within gene regulatory networks elicits nonlinear, unpredictable interactions that shape phenotypes.",

By contrast, all-metal counterparts have been elusive: Fullerene-like clusters composed of noncarbon elements typically suffer from instability, resulting in more compact geometries that require multiple embedded atoms or external ligands for stabilization. In this work, we present the synthesis of an all-metal fullerene cluster, [K@Au 12 Sb 20 ] 5\u2212 , using a wet-chemistry method. The cluster's structure was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction, which revealed a fullerene framework consisting of 20 antimony atoms.

We report that meiotic break repair is eightfold more mutagenic for single-base substitutions than was previously understood, leading to de novo mutation in one in four sperm and one in 12 eggs. Its impact on indels and structural variants is even higher, with 100- to 1300-fold increases in rates per break. We uncovered new mutational signatures and footprints relative to break sites, which implicate unexpected biochemical processes and error-prone DNA repair mechanisms, including translesion synthesis and end joining in meiotic break repair. We provide evidence that these mechanisms drive mutagenesis in human germ lines and lead to disruption of hundreds of genes genome wide.",

We addressed this topic using the light-gated channelrhodopsin Hc KCR2 from the pseudofungus Hyphochytrium catenoides , which operates as a H + conductive, Ca 2+ impermeable ion channel on the plasma membrane of plant cells. Light activation of Hc KCR2 in Arabidopsis guard cells evokes a transient cytoplasmic acidification that sparks Ca 2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. A H + -induced cytosolic Ca 2+ signal results in membrane depolarization through the activation of Ca 2+ -dependent SLAC1/SLAH3 anion channels, which enabled us to remotely control stomatal movement. Our study suggests a H + -induced Ca 2+ release mechanism in plant cells and establishes Hc KCR2 as a tool to dissect the molecular basis of plant intracellular pH and Ca 2+ signaling.",

Sarcomas are rare malignancies predominantly derived from embryonic mesoderm. To identify pathways specific to mesenchymal cancers, we performed whole-genome germline sequencing on 1644 sporadic cases and 3205 matched healthy elderly controls. Using an extreme phenotype design, a combined rare-variant burden and ontologic analysis identified two sarcoma-specific pathways involved in mitotic and telomere functions. Variants in centrosome genes are linked to malignant peripheral nerve sheath and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, whereas heritable defects in the shelterin complex link susceptibility to sarcoma, melanoma, and thyroid cancers. These studies indicate a specific role for heritable defects in mitotic and telomere biology in risk of sarcomas.",

Our theory is valid in the low-density regime, and it makes different predictions about situations in which lanes may form that are not parallel with the direction of flow. We report on experiments with human crowds that verify two notable consequences of this phenomenon: tilting lanes under broken chiral symmetry and lane nucleation along elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic curves in the presence of sources or sinks.",

In this work, we show that Caenorhabditis elegans DNSN-1, the ortholog of human DONSON, functions during helicase assembly in a complex with MUS-101/TOPBP1. DNSN-1 is required to recruit the GINS complex to chromatin, and a cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure indicates that DNSN-1 positions GINS on the MCM-2-7 helicase motor (comprising the six MCM-2 to MCM-7 proteins), by direct binding of DNSN-1 to GINS and MCM-3, using interfaces that we show are important for initiation and essential for viability. These findings identify DNSN-1 as a missing link in our understanding of DNA replication initiation, suggesting that initiation defects underlie the human disease syndrome that results from DONSON mutations.",

We applied a multidisciplinary approach to generate a structural model of p38\u03b1 in complex with its MAP2K, MKK6, and to understand the activation mechanism. Integrating cryo\u2013electron microscopy with molecular dynamics simulations, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and experiments in cells, we demonstrate a dynamic, multistep phosphorylation mechanism, identify catalytically relevant interactions, and show that MAP2K-disordered amino termini determine pathway specificity.

In this work, we report a CRISPR knockout screen of the entire repertoire of transcription factors (TFs) in adult human SI organoids to identify dominant TFs controlling EEC differentiation. We discovered ZNF800 as a master repressor for endocrine lineage commitment, which particularly restricts enterochromaffin cell differentiation by directly controlling an endocrine TF network centered on PAX4.

We developed a brain\u2013machine interface to test whether rats can do so by controlling their hippocampal activity in a flexible, goal-directed, and model-based manner. We found that rats can efficiently navigate or direct objects to arbitrary goal locations within a virtual reality arena solely by activating and sustaining appropriate hippocampal representations of remote places.

In conventional metals, current is carried by quasiparticles; although it has been suggested that quasiparticles are absent in strange metals, direct experimental evidence is lacking. We measured shot noise to probe the granularity of the current-carrying excitations in nanowires of the heavy fermion strange metal YbRh 2 Si 2 . When compared with conventional metals, shot noise in these nanowires is strongly suppressed. This suppression cannot be attributed to either electron-phonon or electron-electron interactions in a Fermi liquid, which suggests that the current is not carried by well-defined quasiparticles in the strange-metal regime that we probed. Our work sets the stage for similar studies of other strange metals.",

This enables kilometer-length-scale transmission of a record ~50 low-loss modes with cross-talk as low as \u221245 decibels/kilometer and mode areas of ~800 square micrometers over a 130-nanometer telecommunications spectral window.

Garnet crystallization could explain these observations if garnet removes substantial amounts of Fe 2+ , but not Fe 3+ , from magma, yet this model for continental crust generation has never been tested experimentally. Analysis of garnets and melts in laboratory experiments show that the compatibilities of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ in garnet are of similar magnitudes. Our results indicate that fractional crystallization of garnet-bearing cumulates will remove 22\t% of total Fe from primary arc basalts but negligibly alter the Fe 3+ /\u2211Fe ratio and f O 2 of the melt.

    "abstract": "Unlike other chromatin remodelers, INO80 preferentially mobilizes hexasomes, which can form during transcription. Why INO80 prefers hexasomes over nucleosomes remains unclear. Here, we report structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae INO80 bound to a hexasome or a nucleosome. INO80 binds the two substrates in substantially different orientations. On a hexasome, INO80 places its ATPase subunit, Ino80, at superhelical location \u20132 (SHL \u20132), in contrast to SHL \u20136 and SHL \u20137, as previously seen on nucleosomes. Our results suggest that INO80 action on hexasomes resembles action by other remodelers on nucleosomes such that Ino80 is maximally active near SHL \u20132. The SHL \u20132 position also plays a critical role for nucleosome remodeling by INO80. Overall, the mechanistic adaptations used by INO80 for preferential hexasome sliding imply that subnucleosomal particles play considerable regulatory roles.",

    "abstract": "Quantum field theory suggests that electromagnetic fields naturally fluctuate, and these fluctuations can be harnessed as a source of perfect randomness. Many potential applications of randomness rely on controllable probability distributions. We show that vacuum-level bias fields injected into multistable optical systems enable a controllable source of quantum randomness, and we demonstrated this concept in an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). By injecting bias pulses with less than one photon on average, we controlled the probabilities of the two possible OPO output states. The potential of our approach for sensing sub\u2013photon-level fields was demonstrated by reconstructing the temporal shape of fields below the single-photon level. Our results provide a platform to study quantum dynamics in nonlinear driven-dissipative systems and point toward applications in probabilistic computing and weak field sensing.",

    "abstract": "Protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) is the 3\u2032 single-stranded overhang-binding telomeric protein that prevents an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3\u2013related (ATR) DNA damage response (DDR) at chromosome ends. What precludes the DDR machinery from accessing the telomeric double-stranded\u2013single-stranded junction is unknown. We demonstrate that human POT1 binds this junction by recognizing the phosphorylated 5\u2032 end of the chromosome. High-resolution crystallographic structures reveal that the junction is capped by POT1 through a \u201cPOT-hole\u201d surface, the mutation of which compromises junction protection in vitro and telomeric 5\u2032-end definition and DDR suppression in human cells. Whereas both mouse POT1 paralogs bind the single-stranded overhang, POT1a, not POT1b, contains a POT-hole and binds the junction, which explains POT1a\u2019s sufficiency for end protection. Our study shifts the paradigm for DDR suppression at telomeres by highlighting the importance of protecting the double-stranded\u2013single-stranded junction.",

    "abstract": "The motion of line defects (dislocations) has been studied for more than 60 years, but the maximum speed at which they can move is unresolved. Recent models and atomistic simulations predict the existence of a limiting velocity of dislocation motion between the transonic and subsonic ranges at which the self-energy of dislocation diverges, though they do not deny the possibility of the transonic dislocations. We used femtosecond x-ray radiography to track ultrafast dislocation motion in shock-compressed single-crystal diamond. By visualizing stacking faults extending faster than the slowest sound wave speed of diamond, we show the evidence of partial dislocations at their leading edge moving transonically. Understanding the upper limit of dislocation mobility in crystals is essential to accurately model, predict, and control the mechanical properties of materials under extreme conditions.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of cellular activities by pathogen virulence factors can trigger innate immune responses. Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)\u2013inducible antimicrobial factors, such as the guanylate binding proteins (GBPs), promote cell-intrinsic defense by attacking intracellular pathogens and by inducing programmed cell death. Working in human macrophages, we discovered that GBP1 expression in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 killed the cells and induced Golgi fragmentation. IFN-\u03b3 exposure improved macrophage survival through the activity of the kinase PIM1. PIM1 phosphorylated GBP1, leading to its sequestration by 14-3-3\u03c3, which thereby prevented GBP1 membrane association. During Toxoplasma gondii infection, the virulence protein TgIST interfered with IFN-\u03b3 signaling and depleted PIM1, thereby increasing GBP1 activity. Although infected cells can restrain pathogens in a GBP1-dependent manner, this mechanism can protect uninfected bystander cells. Thus, PIM1 can provide a bait for pathogen virulence factors, guarding the integrity of IFN-\u03b3 signaling.",

However, the ultrashort time and length scales associated with the behavior of these highly out-of-equilibrium carriers have impaired experimental verification of ab initio quantum theories. Here, we present an approach to studying plasmonic hot-carrier dynamics that analyzes the temporal waveform of coherent terahertz bursts radiated by photo-ejected hot carriers from designer nano-antennas with a broken symmetry. For ballistic carriers ejected from gold antennas, we find an ~11-femtosecond timescale composed of the plasmon lifetime and ballistic transport time. Polarization- and phase-sensitive detection of terahertz fields further grant direct access to their ballistic transport trajectory. Our approach opens explorations of ultrafast carrier dynamics in optically excited nanostructures.",

In this work, we established coherent control of individual quantum states in calcium monohydroxide (CaOH) and demonstrated a method for searching for the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). Optically trapped, ultracold CaOH molecules were prepared in a single quantum state, polarized in an electric field, and coherently transferred into an eEDM-sensitive state where an electron spin precession measurement was performed. To extend the coherence time, we used eEDM-sensitive states with tunable, near-zero magnetic field sensitivity. Our results establish a path for eEDM searches with trapped polyatomic molecules.",

Understanding such an effect in interacting systems represents a fundamental challenge, even for small magnetic fields. In this work, we used an atomic quantum simulator in which we tracked the motion of ultracold fermions in two-leg ribbons threaded by artificial magnetic fields. Through controllable quench dynamics, we measured the Hall response for a range of synthetic tunneling and atomic interaction strengths. We unveil a universal interaction-independent behavior above an interaction threshold, in agreement with theoretical analyses.

Caspase activation is central to apoptosis, and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are the principal actors that restrain caspase activity and are therefore attractive therapeutic targets. IAPs, in turn, are regulated by mitochondria-derived proapoptotic factors such as SMAC and HTRA2. Through a series of cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of full-length human baculoviral IAP repeat\u2013containing protein 6 (BIRC6) bound to SMAC, caspases, and HTRA2, we provide a molecular understanding for BIRC6-mediated caspase inhibition and its release by SMAC. The architecture of BIRC6, together with near-irreversible binding of SMAC, elucidates how the IAP inhibitor SMAC can effectively control a processive ubiquitin ligase to respond to apoptotic stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The Australian continent contributes substantially to the year-to-year variability of the global terrestrial carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sink. However, the scarcity of in situ observations in remote areas prevents the deciphering of processes that force the CO 2 flux variability. In this study, by examining atmospheric CO 2 measurements from satellites in the period 2009\u20132018, we find recurrent end-of-dry-season CO 2 pulses over the Australian continent. These pulses largely control the year-to-year variability of Australia\u2019s CO 2 balance. They cause two to three times larger seasonal variations compared with previous top-down inversions and bottom-up estimates. The pulses occur shortly after the onset of rainfall and are driven by enhanced soil respiration preceding photosynthetic uptake in Australia\u2019s semiarid regions. The suggested continental-scale relevance of soil-rewetting processes has substantial implications for our understanding and modeling of global climate\u2013carbon cycle feedbacks.",

To study the origins and functional consequences of PZMs, we generated a multitissue atlas of PZMs spanning 54 tissue and cell types from 948 donors. Nearly half the variation in mutation burden among tissue samples can be explained by measured technical and biological effects, and 9% can be attributed to donor-specific effects. Through phylogenetic reconstruction of PZMs, we found that their type and predicted functional impact vary during prenatal development, across tissues, and through the germ cell life cycle.

Changes in oxidation state as well as valence-orbital energies and character emerge in the data on a femtosecond to nanosecond timescale.

Whereas NIMA-specific tolerance is functionally erased by pregnancy, partner-specific resiliency against pregnancy complications persists in mothers despite paternity changes in intervening pregnancy. Persistent fetal tolerance reflects FOXP3 expression plasticity, which allows mothers to more durably remember their babies, whereas daughters forget their mothers with new pregnancy-imprinted immunological memories.",

    "abstract": "The hydrogen-rich outer layers of massive stars can be removed by interactions with a binary companion. Theoretical models predict that this stripping produces a population of hot helium stars of ~2 to 8 solar masses ( M \u2609 ), however, only one such system has been identified thus far. We used ultraviolet photometry to identify potential stripped helium stars then investigated 25 of them using optical spectroscopy. We identified stars with high temperatures (~60,000 to 100,000 kelvin), high surface gravities, and hydrogen-depleted surfaces; 16 stars also showed binary motion. These properties match expectations for stars with initial masses of 8 to 25 M \u2609 that were stripped by binary interaction. Their masses fall in the gap between subdwarf helium stars and Wolf-Rayet stars. We propose that these stars could be progenitors of stripped-envelope supernovae.",

However, the master TF-governed pluripotency regulatory circuitry was largely inferred from cultured cells. In this work, we investigated SOX2 binding from embryonic day 3.5 (E3.5) to E7.5 in the mouse. In E3.5 inner cell mass (ICM), SOX2 regulates the ICM-trophectoderm program but is dispensable for opening global enhancers. Instead, SOX2 occupies preaccessible enhancers in part opened by early-stage expressing TFs TFAP2C and NR5A2. SOX2 then widely redistributes when cells adopt naive and formative pluripotency by opening enhancers or poising them for rapid future activation. Hence, multifaceted pioneer TF\u2013enhancer interaction underpins pluripotency progression in embryos, including a distinctive state in E3.5 ICM that bridges totipotency and pluripotency.",

We determined the structures of de novo transcribing complexes TC2 to TC17 with RNA polymerase II halted on G-less promoters when nascent RNAs reach 2 to 17 nucleotides in length, respectively. Connecting these structures generated a movie and a working model. As initially synthesized RNA grows, general transcription factors (GTFs) remain bound to the promoter and the transcription bubble expands. Nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)\u2013driven RNA-DNA translocation and template-strand accumulation in a nearly sealed channel may promote the transition from initially transcribing complexes (ITCs) (TC2 to TC9) to early elongation complexes (EECs) (TC10 to TC17). Our study shows dynamic processes of transcription initiation and reveals why ITCs require GTFs and bubble expansion for initial RNA synthesis, whereas EECs need GTF dissociation from the promoter and bubble collapse for promoter escape.",

Here, we generated a chromosome-level genome assembly of the long-tailed hermit and screened for genes that have been specifically inactivated in the ancestral hummingbird lineage. We discovered that FBP2 (fructose-bisphosphatase 2), which encodes a gluconeogenic muscle enzyme, was lost during a time period when hovering flight evolved. We show that FBP2 knockdown in an avian muscle cell line up-regulates glycolysis and enhances mitochondrial respiration, coincident with an increased mitochondria number. Furthermore, genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and organization have up-regulated expression in hummingbird flight muscle. Together, these results suggest that FBP2 loss was likely a key step in the evolution of metabolic muscle adaptations required for true hovering flight.",

Antagonists, including second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC), regulate IAPs and drive cell death. Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 6 (BIRC6), a giant IAP with dual E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, regulates programmed cell death through unknown mechanisms. We show that BIRC6 directly restricts executioner caspase-3 and -7 and ubiquitinates caspase-3, -7, and -9, working exclusively with noncanonical E1, UBA6. Notably, we show that SMAC suppresses both mechanisms. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of BIRC6 alone and in complex with SMAC reveal that BIRC6 is an antiparallel dimer juxtaposing the substrate-binding module against the catalytic domain. Furthermore, we discover that SMAC multisite binding to BIRC6 results in a subnanomolar affinity interaction, enabling SMAC to competitively displace caspases, thus antagonizing BIRC6 anticaspase function.",

At energies below the ~100-centimeter \u22121 well depth of the interaction potential, we observed backward glories originating from peculiar U-turn trajectories. At energies below 0.2 centimeter \u22121 , we observed a breakdown of the Langevin capture model, which we interpreted in terms of a suppressed mutual polarization during the collision, effectively switching off the molecular dipole moments. Scattering calculations based on an ab initio NO-ND 3 potential energy surface revealed the crucial role of near-degenerate rotational levels with opposite parity in low-energy dipolar collisions.",

In this work, we use global satellite ocean color products to demonstrate widespread responses to atmospheric dust deposition across a diverse continuum of phytoplankton nutritional conditions. The observed responses vary regionally, with some areas exhibiting substantial changes in phytoplankton biomass, whereas in other areas, the response reflects a change in physiological status or health. Climate-driven changes in atmospheric aerosols will alter the relative importance of this nutrient source.",

Their distribution differs in plants and animals, with phytosterols commonly found in plants whereas most animals are dominated by cholesterol. We show that sitosterol, a common sterol of plants, is the most abundant sterol in gutless marine annelids. Using multiomics, metabolite imaging, heterologous gene expression, and enzyme assays, we show that these animals synthesize sitosterol de novo using a noncanonical C-24 sterol methyltransferase (C 24 -SMT). This enzyme is essential for sitosterol synthesis in plants, but not known from most bilaterian animals. Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that C 24 -SMTs are present in representatives of at least five animal phyla, indicating that the synthesis of sterols common to plants is more widespread in animals than currently known.",

By analyzing the African energy systems\u2019 development from 2020 to 2050 for different scenarios of energy demand, land-use change, and climate impacts on water availability, we find that wind and solar outcompete hydropower by 2030.

    "abstract": "Indigenous societies are known to have occupied the Amazon basin for more than 12,000 years, but the scale of their influence on Amazonian forests remains uncertain. We report the discovery, using LIDAR (light detection and ranging) information from across the basin, of 24 previously undetected pre-Columbian earthworks beneath the forest canopy. Modeled distribution and abundance of large-scale archaeological sites across Amazonia suggest that between 10,272 and 23,648 sites remain to be discovered and that most will be found in the southwest. We also identified 53 domesticated tree species significantly associated with earthwork occurrence probability, likely suggesting past management practices. Closed-canopy forests across Amazonia are likely to contain thousands of undiscovered archaeological sites around which pre-Columbian societies actively modified forests, a discovery that opens opportunities for better understanding the magnitude of ancient human influence on Amazonia and its current state.",

However, the GluD1 receptor, an iGluR family member, is present at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Whether and how GluD1 activation may affect inhibitory neurotransmission is unknown. In this work, by using a combination of biochemical, structural, and functional analyses, we demonstrate that GluD1 binds GABA, a previously unknown feature of iGluRs. GluD1 activation produces long-lasting enhancement of GABAergic synaptic currents in the adult mouse hippocampus through a non-ionotropic mechanism that is dependent on trans-synaptic anchoring. The identification of GluD1 as a GABA receptor that controls inhibitory synaptic plasticity challenges the classical dichotomy between glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors.",

    "abstract": "Multicellular life requires altruistic cooperation between cells. The adaptive immune system is a notable exception, wherein germinal center B cells compete vigorously for limiting positive selection signals. Studying primary human lymphomas and developing new mouse models, we found that mutations affecting BTG1 disrupt a critical immune gatekeeper mechanism that strictly limits B cell fitness during antibody affinity maturation. This mechanism converted germinal center B cells into supercompetitors that rapidly outstrip their normal counterparts. This effect was conferred by a small shift in MYC protein induction kinetics but resulted in aggressive invasive lymphomas, which in humans are linked to dire clinical outcomes. Our findings reveal a delicate evolutionary trade-off between natural selection of B cells to provide immunity and potentially dangerous features that recall the more competitive nature of unicellular organisms.",

We reconstruct ancestral states of growth rate and body mass in a taxonomically rich dataset, finding that contrary to expectations, changes in the rate and duration of growth played nearly equal roles in the evolution of the vast body size disparity present in non-avialan theropods\u2014and perhaps that of amniotes in general.",

Although USB1 is known to regulate U6 small nuclear RNA maturation, the molecular mechanism underlying PN remains undetermined, as pre-mRNA splicing is unaffected in patients. We generated human embryonic stem cells harboring the PN-associated mutation c.531_delA in USB1 and show that this mutation impairs human hematopoiesis. Dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) levels in USB1 mutants during blood development contribute to hematopoietic failure, because of a failure to remove 3\u2032-end adenylated tails added by PAPD5/7. Modulation of miRNA 3\u2032-end adenylation through genetic or chemical inhibition of PAPD5/7 rescues hematopoiesis in USB1 mutants. This work shows that USB1 acts as a miRNA deadenylase and suggests PAPD5/7 inhibition as a potential therapy for PN.",

Lately, the rise of two-dimensional moir\u00e9 superlattices with highly tunable periodic potentials provides a possible pathway. Here, we experimentally demonstrate this capability through the spectroscopic evidence of Rydberg moir\u00e9 excitons (X RM ), which are moir\u00e9-trapped Rydberg excitons in monolayer semiconductor tungsten diselenide adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene. In the strong coupling regime, the X RM manifest as multiple energy splittings, pronounced red shift, and narrowed linewidth in the reflectance spectra, highlighting their charge-transfer character wherein electron\u2013hole separation is enforced by strongly asymmetric interlayer Coulomb interactions. Our findings establish the excitonic Rydberg states as candidates for exploitation in quantum technologies.",

Here, analysis of more than 20,000 vertebrate species with a model of geoclimate and biological diversification shows that broad precipitation tolerance and dispersal ability were key for exchange across the deep-time precipitation gradient spanning the region. Sundanian (Southeast Asian) lineages evolved in a climate similar to the humid \u201cstepping stones\u201d of Wallacea, facilitating colonization of the Sahulian (Australian) continental shelf. By contrast, Sahulian lineages predominantly evolved in drier conditions, hampering establishment in Sunda and shaping faunal distinctiveness. We demonstrate how the history of adaptation to past environmental conditions shapes asymmetrical colonization and global biogeographic structure.",

A potentially general, though challenging, approach toward their selective creation would be asymmetric unimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S N 1) reactions that proceed through highly reactive benzylic cations. We now report a broadly applicable solution to this problem by identifying chiral counteranions that pair with secondary benzylic cations to engage in catalytic asymmetric C\u2212C, C\u2212O, and C\u2212N bond-forming reactions with excellent enantioselectivity. The critical cationic intermediate can be accessed from different precursors via Lewis- or Br\u00f8nsted acid catalysis. Key to our strategy is the use of only weakly basic, confined counteranions that are posited to prolong the lifetime of the carbocation, thereby avoiding nonproductive deprotonation pathways to the corresponding styrene.",

We used time-resolved, live-cell fluorescence spectroscopy to show that the ligand-free EphA2 assembles into multimers driven by two types of intermolecular interactions in the ectodomain. The first type entails extended symmetric interactions required for ligand-induced receptor clustering and tumor-suppressive signaling that inhibits activity of the oncogenic extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT) protein kinases and suppresses cell migration. The second type is an asymmetric interaction between the amino terminus and the membrane proximal domain of the neighboring receptors, which supports oncogenic signaling and promotes migration in vitro and tumor invasiveness in vivo. Our results identify the molecular interactions that drive the formation of the EphA2 multimeric signaling clusters and reveal the pivotal role of EphA2 assembly in dictating its opposing functions in oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Bottom-up quantum simulators have been developed to quantify the role of various interactions, dimensionality, and structure in creating electronic states of matter. Here, we demonstrated a solid-state quantum simulator emulating molecular orbitals, based solely on positioning individual cesium atoms on an indium antimonide surface. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, combined with ab initio calculations, we showed that artificial atoms could be made from localized states created from patterned cesium rings. These artificial atoms served as building blocks to realize artificial molecular structures with different orbital symmetries. These corresponding molecular orbitals allowed us to simulate two-dimensional structures reminiscent of well-known organic molecules. This platform could further be used to monitor the interplay between atomic structures and the resulting molecular orbital landscape with submolecular precision.",

    "abstract": "Faces and voices are the dominant social signals used to recognize individuals among primates. Yet, it is not known how these signals are integrated into a cross-modal representation of individual identity in the primate brain. We discovered that, although single neurons in the marmoset hippocampus exhibited selective responses when presented with the face or voice of a specific individual, a parallel mechanism for representing the cross-modal identities for multiple individuals was evident within single neurons and at the population level. Manifold projections likewise showed the separability of individuals as well as clustering for others\u2019 families, which suggests that multiple learned social categories are encoded as related dimensions of identity in the hippocampus. Neural representations of identity in the hippocampus are thus both modality independent and reflect the primate social network.",

Magnetic fields can play a role in transporting angular momentum and chemical elements, but the origin of magnetism in radiative stellar layers is unclear. Using global numerical simulations, we identify a subcritical transition from laminar flow to turbulence caused by the generation of a magnetic dynamo. Our results have many properties of the theoretically proposed Tayler-Spruit dynamo mechanism, which strongly enhances transport of angular momentum in radiative zones. The dynamo generates deep toroidal fields that are screened by the stellar outer layers. This mechanism could produce strong magnetic fields inside radiative stars without an observable field on their surface.",

    "abstract": "Living hominoids are distinguished by upright torsos and versatile locomotion. It is hypothesized that these features evolved for feeding on fruit from terminal branches in forests. To investigate the evolutionary context of hominoid adaptive origins, we analyzed multiple paleoenvironmental proxies in conjunction with hominoid fossils from the Moroto II site in Uganda. The data indicate seasonally dry woodlands with the earliest evidence of abundant C 4 grasses in Africa based on a confirmed age of 21 million years ago (Ma). We demonstrate that the leaf-eating hominoid Morotopithecus consumed water-stressed vegetation, and postcrania from the site indicate ape-like locomotor adaptations. These findings suggest that the origin of hominoid locomotor versatility is associated with foraging on leaves in heterogeneous, open woodlands rather than forests.",

We report a strategy of preventing convective heat loss at the gills during excursions into deep, cold water by the tropical scalloped hammerhead shark ( Sphryna lewini ). Adult scalloped hammerhead sharks dive rapidly and repeatedly from warm (~26\u00b0C) surface waters to depths exceeding 800 meters with temperatures as low as 5\u00b0C. Biologgers attached to adult sharks show that warm muscle temperatures were maintained throughout the deepest portion of each dive. Substantive cooling only occurred during the latter stages of the ascent phase and, once initiated, was rapid. Heat transfer coefficient modeling indicated that convective heat transfer was suspended, probably by suppressing gill function during deep dives. This previously unobserved strategy has broad similarities to marine mammal \u201cbreath hold\u201d diving.",

Asian colobines display a range of social organizations, which makes them good models for investigating social evolution. By integrating ecological, geological, fossil, behavioral, and genomic analyses, we found that colobine primates that inhabit colder environments tend to live in larger, more complex groups. Specifically, glacial periods during the past 6 million years promoted the selection of genes involved in cold-related energy metabolism and neurohormonal regulation. More-efficient dopamine and oxytocin pathways developed in odd-nosed monkeys, which may have favored the prolongation of maternal care and lactation, increasing infant survival in cold environments. These adaptive changes appear to have strengthened interindividual affiliation, increased male-male tolerance, and facilitated the stepwise aggregation from independent one-male groups to large multilevel societies.",

In metazoans, preferential inheritance of fate determinants into one daughter cell frequently depends on polarity-cytoskeleton interactions. Despite the prevalence of asymmetric divisions throughout plant development, evidence for analogous mechanisms that segregate fate determinants remains elusive. Here, we describe a mechanism in the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis that ensures unequal inheritance of a fate-enforcing polarity domain. By defining a cortical region depleted of stable microtubules, the polarity domain limits possible division orientations. Accordingly, uncoupling the polarity domain from microtubule organization during mitosis leads to aberrant division planes and accompanying cell identity defects. Our data highlight how a common biological module, coupling polarity to fate segregation through the cytoskeleton, can be reconfigured to accommodate unique features of plant development.",

We model recruitment, state incapacitation, conflict, and saturation as sources of cartel size variation. Results show that by 2022, cartels counted 160,000 to 185,000 units, becoming one of the country\u2019s top employers. Recruiting between 350 and 370 people per week is essential to avoid their collapse because of aggregate losses.

This effect was achieved by integrating a tungsten disulfide monolayer into a photonic cavity that supports two orthogonal spin modes with high quality factors. The spin-pumped lasing effectively broke the population symmetry of valley excitons, resulting in highly coherent emission with valley-switchable radiation modes due to distinct laser thresholds. Our scheme provides a nanophotonic platform to develop versatile coherent spin-light sources operating at room temperature by actively manipulating spin-valley coupling in light-matter interactions.",

We investigated electroencephalographically defined sleep in wild chinstrap penguins, at sea and while nesting in Antarctica, constantly exposed to an egg predator and aggression from other penguins. The penguins nodded off >10,000 times per day, engaging in bouts of bihemispheric and unihemispheric slow-wave sleep lasting on average only 4 seconds, but resulting in the accumulation of >11 hours of sleep for each hemisphere. The investment in microsleeps by successfully breeding penguins suggests that the benefits of sleep can accrue incrementally.",

Soil freeze has been delayed and, in response, arctic ground squirrels have delayed when they up-regulate heat production during torpor to prevent freezing. Further, the termination of hibernation in spring has advanced 4 days per decade in females but not males. Continued warming and phenological shifts will alter hibernation energetics, change the seasonal availability of this important prey species, and potentially disrupt intraspecific interactions.",

The radio and optical fluxes were delayed compared with the x-ray flux by about 8 and 17 days, respectively. We interpret this as evidence for the formation of a MAD.

We further identified the domain of Ube3a that is required for its interaction with the kinesin motor. Angelman syndrome\u2013associated missense mutations in the interaction domain attenuate presynaptic targeting of Ube3a and prevent synapse elimination.

    "abstract": "The submarine volcanic emplacement of the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) is the suggested cause of Ocean Anoxic Event 1a (OAE 1a). However, no precise timing and duration exists for the formation of OJP, and its connection to OAE1a relies mainly on proxies in the sedimentary record. We provide high-precision 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data from OJP drill and dredge sites that considerably improve OJP\u2019s eruptive history. The ages determined from this work are as much as 10 million years younger than previous dates and indicate a protracted formation over at least 6 million years. OJP now appears too young to have caused OAE1a, but we suggest that it may have had a role in the later OAE1b. The protracted eruptive sequence has implications for the emplacement dynamics of OJP and other large igneous provinces.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity is declining globally in response to multiple human stressors, including climate forcing. Nonetheless, local diversity trends are inconsistent in some taxa, obscuring contributions of local processes to global patterns. Arctic tundra diversity, including plants, fungi, and lichens, declined during a 15-year experiment that combined warming with exclusion of large herbivores known to influence tundra vegetation composition. Tundra diversity declined regardless of experimental treatment, as background growing season temperatures rose with sea ice loss. However, diversity declined slower with large herbivores than without them. This difference was associated with an increase in effective diversity of large herbivores as formerly abundant caribou declined and muskoxen increased. Efforts that promote herbivore diversity, such as rewilding, may help mitigate impacts of warming on tundra diversity.",

However, we report that, in mice, CD8 T cell tolerance instead results from premature thymic eviction of immature autoreactive CD8 thymocytes into the periphery, where they differentiate into self-tolerant mature CD8 T cells. Premature thymic eviction is triggered by T cell receptor (TCR)\u2013driven down-regulation of the transcriptional repressor Gfi1, which induces expression of sphingosine-1\u2013phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1) on negatively selected immature CD8 thymocytes. Thus, premature thymic eviction is the basis for CD8 T cell tolerance and is the mechanism responsible for the appearance in the periphery of mature CD8 T cells bearing autoreactive TCRs that are absent from the thymus.",

Using it, we found that ipRGCs of the macaque monkey are highly specialized to encode irradiance (the overall intensity of illumination) by blurring spatial, temporal, and chromatic features of the visual scene. We describe mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, and population scales that support irradiance encoding across orders-of-magnitude changes in light intensity. These mechanisms are conserved quantitatively across the ~70 million years of evolution that separate macaques from mice.",

Inspired by the principles of information transmission, which allow signals to be reliably transmitted over \u201cnoisy\u201d channels, we developed a \u201cmatter-transport\u201d framework that demonstrates that noninertial locomotion can be provably generated over noisy rugose landscapes (heterogeneities on the scale of locomotor dimensions). Experiments confirm that sufficient spatial redundancy in the form of serially connected legged robots leads to reliable transport on such terrain without requiring sensing and control. Further analogies from communication theory coupled with advances in gaits (coding) and sensor-based feedback control (error detection and correction) can lead to agile locomotion in complex terradynamic regimes.",

In this study, we used gene editing and ribosomal profiling in combination with cryo\u2013electron microscopy to establish that mitochondrial release factor 1 (mtRF1) detects noncanonical stop codons in human mitochondria by a previously unknown mechanism of codon recognition. We discovered that binding of mtRF1 to the decoding center of the ribosome stabilizes a highly unusual conformation in the messenger RNA in which the ribosomal RNA participates in specific recognition of the noncanonical stop codons.",

At weak coupling, we observe the predicted universal quadratic scaling with temperature and voltage. At strong coupling, we demonstrate perfect Andreev reflection of fractionalized quasiparticles at the point contact. We use the strong coupling physics to realize a nearly dissipationless direct current voltage step-up transformer, whose gain arises directly from topological fractionalization of electrical charge.",

A conserved tyrosine residue of NRPE2 stacks with a double-stranded DNA branch of the transcription bubble to potentially attenuate elongation by inducing transcription stalling. The nontemplate DNA strand is captured by NRPE2 to enhance backtracking, thereby increasing 3\u2032-5\u2032 cleavage, which likely underpins Pol V\u2019s high fidelity. The structures also illuminate the mechanism of Pol V transcription stalling and enhanced backtracking, which may be important for Pol V\u2019s retention on chromatin to serve its function in tethering downstream factors for RNA-directed DNA methylation.",

Using a novel phytoclimatic transform, which estimates the ability of climate to support different types of plants, we show that climatic suitability for evergreen trees and C4 grasses are sufficient to discriminate between forest and savanna in Africa. Our findings reassert the dominant influence of climate on ecosystems and suggest that the role of feedbacks causing alternative ecosystem states is less prevalent than has been suggested.",

Although evidence for such conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) exists in forests, the within-species spatial repulsion it should produce has rarely been demonstrated in adults. In this study, we show that in comparison to a null model of stochastic birth, death, and limited dispersal, the adults of dozens of tropical forest tree species show strong spatial repulsion, some to surprising distances of approximately 100 meters. We used simulations to show that such strong repulsion can only occur if CNDD considerably exceeds heterospecific negative density dependence\u2014an even stronger condition required for coexistence\u2014and that large-scale repulsion can indeed result from small-scale CNDD. These results demonstrate substantial niche differences between species that may stabilize species diversity.",

However, several recent experiments have detected signatures of bulk metallicity within this Kondo insulating phase. In this study, we visualized the real-space charge landscape within a Kondo lattice with atomic resolution using a scanning tunneling microscope. We discovered nanometer-scale puddles of metallic conduction electrons centered around uranium-site substitutions in the heavy-fermion compound uranium ruthenium silicide (URu 2 Si 2 ) and around samarium-site defects in the topological Kondo insulator samarium hexaboride (SmB 6 ). These defects disturbed the Kondo screening cloud, leaving behind a fingerprint of the metallic parent state. Our results suggest that the three-dimensional quantum oscillations measured in SmB 6 arise from Kondo-lattice defects, although we cannot exclude other explanations. Our imaging technique could enable the development of atomic-scale charge sensors using heavy-fermion probes.",

    "abstract": "Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems use RNA-guided ribonuclease (RNase) Cas13 to defend bacteria against viruses, and some of these systems encode putative membrane proteins that have unclear roles in Cas13-mediated defense. We show that Csx28, of type VI-B2 systems, is a transmembrane protein that assists to slow cellular metabolism upon viral infection, increasing antiviral defense. High-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy reveals that Csx28 forms an octameric pore-like structure. These Csx28 pores localize to the inner membrane in vivo. Csx28\u2019s antiviral activity in vivo requires sequence-specific cleavage of viral messenger RNAs by Cas13b, which subsequently results in membrane depolarization, slowed metabolism, and inhibition of sustained viral infection. Our work suggests a mechanism by which Csx28 acts as a downstream, Cas13b-dependent effector protein that uses membrane perturbation as an antiviral defense strategy.",

Hot helium-rich stars with spectra dominated by emission lines are known as Wolf-Rayet stars.

We found that the system contains a Wolf-Rayet star with a mass of 2 solar masses and a magnetic field of 43 kilogauss. Stellar evolution calculations indicate that this component will explode as a supernova, and that its magnetic field is strong enough for the supernova to leave a magnetar remnant.

However, homologation of carboxylic acid derivatives, particularly amides, remains challenging. Here we report a hook-and-slide strategy for homologation of tertiary amides with tunable lengths of the inserted carbon chain. Alkylation at the \u03b1-position of the amide (hook) is followed by highly selective branched-to-linear isomerization (slide) to effect amide migration to the end of the newly introduced alkyl chain; thus, the choice of alkylation reagent sets the homologation length. The key step involves a carbon-carbon bond activation process by a carbene-coordinated rhodium complex with assistance from a removable directing group. The approach is demonstrated for introduction of chains as long as 16 carbons and is applicable to derivatized carboxylic acids in complex bioactive molecules.",

For example, Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV), which causes lymphoid tumors in chickens, has experienced a marked increase in virulence over the past century. Today, MDV infections kill >90% of unvaccinated birds, and controlling it costs more than US$1 billion annually. By sequencing MDV genomes derived from archeological chickens, we demonstrate that it has been circulating for at least 1000 years. We functionally tested the Meq oncogene, one of 49 viral genes positively selected in modern strains, demonstrating that ancient MDV was likely incapable of driving tumor formation. Our results demonstrate the power of ancient DNA approaches to trace the molecular basis of virulence in economically relevant pathogens.",

Mothers that mistakenly increased reproductive effort when signals of an upcoming food pulse were absent were more likely to correctly increase effort when a food pulse did occur. However, mothers that failed to increase effort when cues of an upcoming food pulse were present suffered lifetime fitness costs that could only be offset through food supplementation. In fluctuating environments, such phenotype \u2013 environment mismatches may therefore reflect a bias to overestimate environmental cues and avoid making the costliest error, ultimately enhancing lifetime fitness.",

Using Re 6 Se 8 Cl 2 , a van der Waals (vdW) superatomic semiconductor, we demonstrate the formation of acoustic exciton-polarons, an electronic quasiparticle shielded from phonon scattering. We directly imaged polaron transport in Re 6 Se 8 Cl 2 at room temperature, revealing quasi-ballistic, wavelike propagation sustained for a nanosecond and several micrometers. Shielded polaron transport leads to electronic energy propagation lengths orders of magnitude greater than in other vdW semiconductors, exceeding even silicon over a nanosecond. We propose that, counterintuitively, quasi-flat electronic bands and strong exciton\u2013acoustic phonon coupling are together responsible for the transport properties of Re 6 Se 8 Cl 2 , establishing a path to ballistic room-temperature semiconductors.",

We found that trees growing in wetter portions of their range exhibit the greatest drought sensitivity. To test how these patterns of drought sensitivity influence vulnerability to climate change, we predicted tree growth through 2100.

We report that aversive information is transmitted by ensheathing glia (EG) that surround the MBs. Shock induces vesicular exocytosis of glutamate from EG. Blocking exocytosis impairs aversive learning, whereas activation of EG can replace aversive stimuli during conditioning. Glutamate released from EG binds to N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors in the MBs, but because of Mg 2+ block, Ca 2+ influx occurs only when flies are simultaneously exposed to an odor. Vesicular exocytosis from EG also induces shock-associated dopamine release, which plays a role in preventing formation of inappropriate associations. These results demonstrate that vesicular glutamate released from EG transmits negative valence information required for associative learning.",

In this study, we present shotgun genome-wide data from 12 individuals and 27 mitochondrial genomes from eight pre-Hispanic archaeological sites across Mexico, including two at the shifting border of Aridoamerica and Mesoamerica. We find population continuity that spans the climate change episode and a broad preservation of the genetic structure across present-day Mexico for the past 2300 years.

In this work, we describe the cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of the budding yeast outer kinetochore Ndc80 and Dam1 ring complexes assembled onto microtubules. Complex assembly occurs through multiple interfaces, and a staple within Dam1 aids ring assembly. Perturbation of key interfaces suppresses yeast viability. Force-rupture assays indicated that this is a consequence of impaired kinetochore-microtubule attachment. The presence of error correction phosphorylation sites at Ndc80-Dam1 ring complex interfaces and the Dam1 staple explains how kinetochore-microtubule attachments are destabilized and reset.",

In this work, we engineered on-demand injection of a single electronic flying qubit state and its manipulation over the Bloch sphere. The flying qubit is a Leviton propagating in quantum Hall edge channels of a high-mobility graphene monolayer. Although single-shot qubit readout and two-qubit operations are still needed for a viable manipulation of flying qubits, the coherent manipulation of an itinerant electronic state at the single-electron level presents a highly promising alternative to conventional qubits.",

    "abstract": "Gullies on Mars resemble water-carved channels on Earth, but they are mostly at elevations where liquid water is not expected under current climate conditions. It has been suggested that sublimation of carbon dioxide ice alone could have formed Martian gullies. We used a general circulation model to show that the highest-elevation Martian gullies coincide with the boundary of terrain that experienced pressures above the triple point of water when Mars\u2019 rotational axis tilt reached 35\u00b0. Those conditions have occurred repeatedly over the past several million years, most recently ~630,000 years ago. Surface water ice, if present at these locations, could have melted when temperatures rose >273 kelvin. We propose a dual gully formation scenario that is driven by melting of water ice followed by carbon dioxide ice sublimation.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is controlled by the precise activation and repression of transcription. Repression is mediated by specialized transcription factors (TFs) that recruit co-repressors (CoRs) to silence transcription, even in the presence of activating cues. However, whether CoRs can dominantly silence all enhancers or display distinct specificities is unclear. In this work, we report that most enhancers in Drosophila can be repressed by only a subset of CoRs, and enhancers classified by CoR sensitivity show distinct chromatin features, function, TF motifs, and binding. Distinct TF motifs render enhancers more resistant or sensitive to specific CoRs, as we demonstrate by motif mutagenesis and addition. These CoR-enhancer compatibilities constitute an additional layer of regulatory specificity that allows differential regulation at close genomic distances and is indicative of distinct mechanisms of transcriptional repression.",

All-optical generation of photonic vortices\u2014phase singularities of the electromagnetic field\u2014requires sufficiently strong nonlinearity that is typically achieved in the classical optics regime. We report on the realization of quantum vortices of photons that result from a strong photon-photon interaction in a quantum nonlinear optical medium. The interaction causes faster phase accumulation for copropagating photons, producing a quantum vortex-antivortex pair within the two-photon wave function. For three photons, the formation of vortex lines and a central vortex ring confirms the existence of a genuine three-photon interaction. The wave function topology, governed by two- and three-photon bound states, imposes a conditional phase shift of \u03c0 per photon, a potential resource for deterministic quantum logic operations.",

We present a high-resolution room temperature structure of the class Ie R2 protein radical captured by x-ray free electron laser serial femtosecond crystallography. The structure reveals conformational reorganization to shield the radical and connect it to the translocation path, with structural changes propagating to the surface where the protein interacts with the catalytic R1 subunit. Restructuring of the hydrogen bond network, including a notably short O\u2013O interaction of 2.41 angstroms, likely tunes and gates the radical during PCET. These structural results help explain radical handling and mobilization in RNR and have general implications for radical transfer in proteins.",

We estimated \u03bc directly from pedigrees in four baleen whale species for both the mitochondrial control region and nuclear genome. The results suggest values higher than those obtained through phylogeny-based estimates and similar to pedigree-based values for primates and toothed whales. Applying our estimate of \u03bc reduces previous genetic-based estimates of preexploitation whale abundance by 86% and suggests that \u03bc cannot explain low cancer rates in gigantic mammals.

We show that in the Drosophila paternal effect mutant paternal loss ( pal ), sperm chromatin retains germline histones H3 and H4 genome wide without impairing sperm viability. However, after fertilization, pal sperm chromosomes are targeted by the egg chromosomal passenger complex and engage into a catastrophic premature division in synchrony with female meiosis II. We show that pal encodes a rapidly evolving transition protein specifically required for the eviction of (H3-H4) 2 tetramers from spermatid DNA after the removal of H2A-H2B dimers. Our study thus reveals an unsuspected role of histone eviction from insect sperm chromatin: safeguarding the integrity of the male pronucleus during female meiosis.",

By combining contiguous US datasets on sediment loads and tidal wetland areas for 4972 rivers and their estuaries, we calculated that river sediment accretion will be insufficient to match sea level rise in 72% of cases because most watersheds are too small (median 21 square kilometers) to generate adequate sediment. Nearly half the tidal wetlands would require 10 times more river sediment to match sea level, a magnitude not generally achievable by dam removal in some regions. The realization that watershed sediment has little effect on most tidal wetland elevations shifts research priorities toward biological processes and coastal sediment dynamics that most influence elevation change.",

Above 45 kilograms, abundance decreases exponentially with mass, with slopes close to \u22120.75, as predicted by metabolic scaling. Furthermore, communities before ~4 million years ago had considerably more large-sized individuals, with a greater proportion of total biomass allocated in larger size categories, than did later communities. Over time, individuals and biomass were redistributed into smaller size categories, reflecting a gradual loss of large-sized individuals from the fossil record paralleling the long-term decline of Plio-Pleistocene large mammal diversity.",

With cryo\u2013electron microscopy and functional studies, we have captured gRNA-stabilizing RESC-A and gRNA-mRNA\u2013binding RESC-B and RESC-C particles. RESC-A sequesters gRNA termini, thus promoting hairpin formation and blocking mRNA access. The conversion of RESC-A into RESC-B or -C unfolds gRNA and allows mRNA selection. The ensuing gRNA-mRNA duplex protrudes from RESC-B, likely exposing editing sites to RECC-catalyzed cleavage, uridine insertion or deletion, and ligation.

We used a continental-scale, decades-long database of more than 150,000 bird nesting attempts to explore how extreme heat affects avian reproduction in forests, grasslands, and agricultural and developed areas across the US. We found that in forests, extreme heat increased nest success, but birds nesting in agricultural settings were less likely to successfully fledge young when temperatures reached anomalously high levels. Species that build exposed cup nests and species of higher conservation concern were particularly vulnerable to maximum temperature anomalies in agricultural settings. Finally, future projections suggested that ongoing climate change may exacerbate the negative effects of habitat conversion on avian nesting success, thereby compromising conservation efforts in human-dominated landscapes.",

Our observations also reveal a dense gas disk surrounding the inflow that is gravitationally unstable, which drives the accretion into about the central 1 parsec.",

In this system, magnetic excitations connect into thermally active one-dimensional strings whose motion can be imaged in real time. At high temperatures, our data showed the merging, breaking, and reconnecting of strings, resulting in the system transitioning between topologically distinct configurations. Below a crossover temperature, the string motion is dominated by simple changes in length and shape. In this low-temperature regime, the system is energetically stable because of its inability to explore all possible topological configurations. This kinetic crossover suggests a generalizable conception of topologically broken ergodicity and limited equilibration.",

We show experimentally that honeyguides in Tanzania and Mozambique discriminate among honey hunters\u2019 calls, responding more readily to local than to foreign calls. This was not explained by variation in sound transmission and instead suggests that honeyguides learn local human signals.

    "abstract": "Ergodicity, the central tenet of statistical mechanics, requires an isolated system to explore all available phase space constrained by energy and symmetry. Mechanisms for violating ergodicity are of interest for probing nonequilibrium matter and protecting quantum coherence in complex systems. Polyatomic molecules have long served as a platform for probing ergodicity breaking in vibrational energy transport. Here, we report the observation of rotational ergodicity breaking in an unprecedentedly large molecule, 12 C 60 , determined from its icosahedral rovibrational fine structure. The ergodicity breaking occurs well below the vibrational ergodicity threshold and exhibits multiple transitions between ergodic and nonergodic regimes with increasing angular momentum. These peculiar dynamics result from the molecule\u2019s distinctive combination of symmetry, size, and rigidity, highlighting its relevance to emergent phenomena in mesoscopic quantum systems.",

To understand the mechanism of extinction, we must disentangle the timing, duration, and intensity of volcanic and meteoritic environmental forcings. In this study, we used a parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to invert for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions, export productivity, and remineralization from 67 to 65 million years ago using the LOSCAR (Long-term Ocean-atmosphere-Sediment CArbon cycle Reservoir) model. Our results closely match observed and proxy data and suggest decoupled CO 2 and SO 2 emissions, a two-step decline in export productivity with a protracted recovery, and no clear volatile impulse at the boundary. More broadly, our methods provide a potential path forward for efficient parallel inversion of complex Earth system models.",

Here, we use numerical methods to calculate thermal and charge transport in the doped Hubbard model and observe a crossover separating high- and low-temperature behaviors. Distinct from the behavior at high temperatures, the Lorenz number L becomes weakly doping dependent and less sensitive to parameters at low temperatures. At the lowest numerically accessible temperatures, L roughly approaches the Wiedemann-Franz constant L 0 , even in a doped Mott insulator that lacks well-defined quasiparticles. Decomposing the energy current operator indicates a compensation between kinetic and potential contributions, which may help to clarify the interpretation of transport experiments beyond Boltzmann theory in strongly correlated metals.",

The functions of vaccine-induced HIV-specific CD8 + T cells were investigated here in detail. Cytotoxic capacity was significantly lower than in HIV controllers and was not a consequence of low frequency or unaccumulated functional cytotoxic proteins. Low cytotoxic capacity was attributable to impaired degranulation in response to the low antigen levels present on HIV-infected targets. The vaccine-induced T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire was polyclonal and transduction of these TCRs conferred the same reduced functions. These results define a mechanism accounting for poor antiviral activity induced by these vaccines and suggest that an effective CD8 + T cell response may require a vaccination strategy that drives further TCR clonal selection.",

We tested this hypothesis using a multiproxy approach. Regressions of skull length and tooth size for a range of theropods and extant varanid lizards confirm that complete coverage of theropod dinosaur teeth with extraoral tissues (gingiva and labial scales) is both plausible and consistent with patterns observed in living ziphodont amniotes. Analyses of dental histology from crocodylians and theropod dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus rex , further indicate that the most likely condition was complete coverage of the marginal dentition with extraoral tissue when the mouth was closed. This changes our perceptions about the appearance and oral configuration of these iconic predators and has broad implications for our interpretations of other terrestrial animals with large teeth.",

Plant mitochondrial messenger RNAs (mRNAs) lack Shine-Dalgarno-like ribosome-binding sites, so it is unknown how plant mitoribosomes recognize mRNA. We show that \u201cmitochondrial translation factors\u201d mTRAN1 and mTRAN2 are land plant\u2013specific proteins, required for normal mitochondrial respiration chain biogenesis. Our studies suggest that mTRANs are noncanonical pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR)\u2013like RNA binding proteins of the mitoribosomal \u201csmall\u201d subunit. We identified conserved Adenosine (A)/Uridine (U)-rich motifs in the 5\u2032 regions of plant mitochondrial mRNAs. mTRAN1 binds this motif, suggesting that it is a mitoribosome homing factor to identify mRNAs. We demonstrate that mTRANs are likely required for translation of all plant mitochondrial mRNAs. Plant mitochondrial translation initiation thus appears to use a protein-mRNA interaction that is divergent from bacteria or mammalian mitochondria.",

We tracked 465 mature Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ) during their winter spawning season and show that large females (up to 114 centimeters in length), which are still found in mid-Norway, were characterized by more complex movement networks compared with smaller females. Large males were sparse but displayed similar movement patterns.

We constrain oxygen fugacity, chlorine content, and temperature, which allow us to model the solubility and transport of metals that are hypothesized to be crucial for the origin of life. We show that these fluids were more oxidized than the terrestrial mantle during this time and that they were interacting with near-surface aqueous systems, possibly subaerial hydrothermal pools, amplifying redox gradients in a location attractive for prebiotic molecular synthesis or sustained microbial activity.",

Chimerism occurs when parental nuclei bypass syngamy and divide separately within the same egg.

Which disparity is more likely to spark reduction efforts? We find that highlighting disparities in health-related (versus economic) outcomes spurs greater social media engagement and support for disparity-mitigating policy. Further, reading about racial health disparities elicits greater support for action (e.g., protesting) compared with economic- or belonging-based disparities. This occurs in part because people view health disparities as violating morally sacred values, which enhances perceived injustice. This work elucidates which manifestations of racial inequality are most likely to prompt Americans to action.",

We found that the usual single absorption peak in the Fermi-liquid regime splits into two peaks upon entering the critical regime. We interpret this spectrum as a single nuclear transition, modulated by nearby electronic valence fluctuations whose long time scales are further enhanced by the formation of charged polarons. These critical charge fluctuations may prove to be a distinct signature of strange metals.",

Balto shares just part of his diverse ancestry with the eponymous Siberian husky breed. Balto\u2019s genotype predicts a combination of coat features atypical for modern sled dog breeds, and a slightly smaller stature. He had enhanced starch digestion compared with Greenland sled dogs and a compendium of derived homozygous coding variants at constrained positions in genes connected to bone and skin development. We propose that Balto\u2019s population of origin, which was less inbred and genetically healthier than that of modern breeds, was adapted to the extreme environment of 1920s Alaska.",

Part of the stellar material falls toward the black hole, forming an accretion disk that in some cases launches a relativistic jet. We performed optical polarimetry observations of a TDE, AT 2020mot. We find a peak linear polarization degree of 25 \u00b1 4%, consistent with highly polarized synchrotron radiation, as is typically observed from relativistic jets. However, our radio observations, taken up to 8 months after the optical peak, do not detect the corresponding radio emission expected from a relativistic jet. We suggest that the linearly polarized optical emission instead arises from shocks that occur during accretion disk formation, as the stream of stellar material collides with itself.",

However, the origin of these signals remains poorly constrained. We studied seismic tremor signals in Wellington Field, Kansas, using a seismic array during a carbon dioxide injection program. We show that these signals are generated below the surface during the time of carbon dioxide injection. They have a distinct spectral signature, similar to those observed in glacial and volcanic environments. The tremor sources are located near the injection site and aligned with preexisting faults. Modeling results imply that such tremors are generated by frictional slip on fault. These observations may reveal an important deformation mode, which is useful for studying associated stress, seismicity, and triggering, as well as for tracking fault activities during injection operations of all fluids, including supercritical carbon dioxide.",

The formation of a phototropin activation gradient across a photosensitive organ initiates this response. However, the optical tissue properties that functionally contribute to phototropism remain unclear. In this work, we show that intercellular air channels limit light transmittance through various organs in several species. Air channels enhance light scattering in Arabidopsis hypocotyls, thereby steepening the light gradient. This is required for an efficient phototropic response in Arabidopsis and Brassica. We identified an embryonically expressed ABC transporter required for the presence of air channels in seedlings and a structure surrounding them. Our work provides insights into intercellular air space development or maintenance and identifies a mechanism of directional light sensing in plants.",

However, this template-directed phosphoryl transfer activity remains orders of magnitude slower than native phosphodiester synthesis. Here, we used time-resolved x-ray crystallography to show that NP-DNA synthesis proceeds with a single detectable calcium ion in the active site. Using insights from isotopic and elemental effects, we propose that one-metal-ion electrophilic substrate activation is inferior to the native two-metal-ion mechanism. We found that this deficiency in divalent activation could be ameliorated by trivalent rare earth and post\u2013transition metal cations, substantially enhancing NP-DNA synthesis. Scandium(III), in particular, confers highly specific NP activity with kinetics enhanced by more than 100-fold over calcium(II), yielding NP-DNA strands up to 100 nucleotides in length.",

In this work, we show how an unusually isotropic magnetoresistance in the highly anisotropic, one-dimensional conductor Li 0.9 Mo 6 O 17 and its temperature dependence can be interpreted as a renormalization group (RG) flow toward a so-called separatrix. This approach is equivalent to an emergent symmetry in the system. The existence of two distinct ground states, Mott insulator and superconductor, can then be traced back to two opposing RG trajectories. By establishing a direct link between quantum field theory and an experimentally measurable quantity, we uncover a path through which emergent symmetry might be identified in other candidate materials.",

These orbital magnetism effects led to substantial deviations from the standard Onsager relation, which manifested as a breakdown in scaling of Landau-level orbits. These substantial magnetic responses emerged from the nontrivial quantum geometry of the electronic structure and the large length scale of the moir\u00e9 lattice potential. Going beyond traditional measurements, Landau-level spectroscopy performed with a scanning tunneling microscope offers a complete quantum ruler that resolves the full energy dependence of orbital magnetic properties in moir\u00e9 quantum matter.",

Further, we question whether there indeed is any evidence for a mineralized chambered heart in these placoderms.",

    "abstract": "We offer our thanks to the authors for their thoughtful comments. Cui, Gong, Hannig, and Hoffman propose a valuable improvement to our method of estimating lost entitlements due to data error. Because we don\u2019t have access to the unknown, \u201ctrue\u201d number of children in poverty, our paper simulates data error by drawing counterfactual estimates from a normal distribution around the official, published poverty estimates, which we use to calculate lost entitlements relative to the official allocation of funds. But, if we make the more realistic assumption that the published estimates are themselves normally distributed around the \u201ctrue\u201d number of children in poverty, Cui et al .\u2019s proposed framework allows us to reliably estimate lost entitlements relative to the unknown, ideal allocation of funds\u2014what districts would have received if we knew the \u201ctrue\u201d number of children in poverty.",

( 1 ) as an additional sensitivity to illustrate a more extreme distribution of regional contributions to climate mitigation investments that supports our main conclusion regarding the North\u2010South divide in mitigation investment capabilities. In response to Semieniuk et al . we would like to first point out that, in defining the required global mitigation investments for the 2020 to 2030 period, our study relies on the estimates in the sixth assessment report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) WGIII ( 2 ). These are based on diverse sources and underlying models that to varying degrees reflect regional differences in technology costs and consider both purchasing power parity (PPP) and market exchange rates (MERs). We use these IPCC estimates as a starting point and focus entirely on the question of how much of the needed regional investments, given different fairness considerations, should be financed from sources within a region.",

( 1 ) illustrates the crucial impact that the quality of official statistical data products may exert on the accuracy, stability, and equity of policy decisions on which they are based. The authors remind us that data, however responsibly curated, can be fallible. With this comment, we underscore the importance of conducting principled quality assessment of official statistical data products. We observe that the quality assessment procedure employed by Steed et al . needs improvement, due to (i) the inadmissibility of the estimator used, and (ii) the inconsistent probability model it induces on the joint space of the estimator and the observed data. We discuss the design of alternative statistical methods to conduct principled quality assessments for official statistical data products, showcasing two simulation-based methods for admissible minimax shrinkage estimation via multilevel empirical Bayesian modeling. For policymakers and stakeholders to accurately gauge the context-specific usability of data, the assessment should take into account both uncertainty sources inherent to the data and the downstream use cases, such as policy decisions based on those data products.",
