    "abstract": "It is for the first time that Quantum Simulation for High Energy Physics (HEP) is studied in the U.S. decadal particle-physics community planning, and in fact until recently, this was not considered a mainstream topic in the community. This fact speaks of a remarkable rate of growth of this subfield over the past few years, stimulated by the impressive advancements in Quantum Information Sciences (QIS) and associated technologies over the past decade, and the significant investment in this area by the government and private sectors in the U.S. and other countries. High-energy physicists have quickly identified problems of importance to our understanding of nature at the most fundamental level, from tiniest distances to cosmological extents, that are intractable with classical computers but may benefit from quantum advantage. They have initiated, and continue to carry out, a vigorous program in theory, algorithm, and hardware co-design for simulations of relevance to the HEP mission. This community whitepaper is an attempt to bring this exciting and yet challenging area of research to the spotlight, and to elaborate on what the promises, requirements, challenges, and potential solutions are over the next decade and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Variational quantum machine learning is an extensively studied application of near-term quantum computers. The success of variational quantum learning models crucially depends on finding a suitable parametrization of the model that encodes an inductive bias relevant to the learning task. However, precious little is known about guiding principles for the construction of suitable parametrizations. In this work, we holistically explore when and how symmetries of the learning problem can be exploited to construct quantum learning models with outcomes invariant under the symmetry of the learning task. Building on tools from representation theory, we show how a standard gateset can be transformed into an equivariant gateset that respects the symmetries of the problem at hand through a process of gate symmetrization. We benchmark the proposed methods on two toy problems that feature a non-trivial symmetry and observe a substantial increase in generalization performance. As our tools can also be applied in a straightforward way to other variational problems with symmetric structure, we show how equivariant gatesets can be used in variational quantum eigensolvers.",

    "abstract": "Long-range entanglement--the backbone of topologically ordered states--cannot be created in finite time using local unitary circuits, or equivalently, adiabatic state preparation. Recently it has come to light that single-site measurements provide a loophole, allowing for finite-time state preparation in certain cases. Here we show how this observation imposes a complexity hierarchy on long-range entangled states based on the minimal number of measurement layers required to create the state, which we call\"shots\". First, similar to Abelian stabilizer states, we construct single-shot protocols for creating any non-Abelian quantum double of a group with nilpotency class two (such as $D_4$ or $Q_8$). We show that after the measurement, the wavefunction always collapses into the desired non-Abelian topological order, conditional on recording the measurement outcome. Moreover, the clean quantum double ground state can be deterministically prepared via feedforward--gates which depend on the measurement outcomes. Second, we provide the first constructive proof that a finite number of shots can implement the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation (i.e., the gauging map) for any solvable symmetry group. As a special case, this gives an explicit protocol to prepare twisted quantum double for all solvable groups. Third, we argue that certain topological orders, such as non-solvable quantum doubles or Fibonacci anyons, define non-trivial phases of matter under the equivalence class of finite-depth unitaries and measurement, which cannot be prepared by any finite number of shots. Moreover, we explore the consequences of allowing gates to have exponentially small tails, which enables, for example, the preparation of any Abelian anyon theory, including chiral ones. This hierarchy paints a new picture of the landscape of long-range entangled states, with practical implications for quantum simulators.",

    "abstract": "Decoherence inevitably happens when a quantum state is exposed to its environment, which can affect quantum critical points (QCP) in a nontrivial way. As was pointed out in recent literature on $(1+1)d$ conformal field theory (CFT), the effect of weak measurement can be mathematically mapped to the problem of boundary CFT. In this work, we focus on the $(2+1)d$ QCPs, whose boundary and defect effects have attracted enormous theoretical and numerical interests very recently. We focus on decoherence caused by weak measurements with and without post-selecting the measurement outcomes. Our main results are: (1) for an O(N) Wilson-Fisher QCP under weak measurement with post-selection, an observer would in general observe two different types of boundary/defect criticality with very different behaviors from the well-known Wilson-Fisher fixed points; in particular, it is possible to observe the recently proposed exotic\"extraordinary-log\"correlation. (2) An extra quantum phase transition can be driven by decoherence, if we consider quantities nonlinear with the decohered density matrix, such as the Renyi entropy. We demonstrate the connection between this transition to the information-theoretic transition driven by an error in the toric code model. (3) When there is no post-selection, though correlation functions between local operators remain the same as the undecohered pure state, nonlocal operators such as the\"disorder operator\"would have qualitatively distinct behaviors; and we also show that the decoherence can lead to confinement.",

In particular, the maximum independent set problem on so-called unit-disk graphs, was shown to be efficiently encodable in such a quantum system. Here, we extend the classes of problems that can be efficiently encoded in Rydberg arrays by constructing explicit mappings from a wide class of problems to maximum weighted independent set problems on unit-disk graphs, with at most a quadratic overhead in the number of qubits. We analyze several examples, including: maximum weighted independent set on graphs with arbitrary connectivity, quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems with arbitrary or restricted connectivity, and integer factorization. Numerical simulations on small system sizes indicate that the adiabatic time scale for solving the mapped problems is strongly correlated with that of the original problems. Our work provides a blueprint for using Rydberg atom arrays to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems with arbitrary connectivity, beyond the restrictions imposed by the hardware geometry.",

    "abstract": "Thermodynamics connects our knowledge of the world to our capability to manipulate and thus to control it. This crucial role of control is exemplified by the third law of thermodynamics, Nernst's unattainability principle, which states that infinite resources are required to cool a system to absolute zero temperature. But what are these resources and how should they be utilized? And how does this relate to Landauer's principle that famously connects information and thermodynamics? We answer these questions by providing a framework for identifying the resources that enable the creation of pure quantum states. We show that perfect cooling is possible with Landauer energy cost given infinite time or control complexity. However, such optimal protocols require complex unitaries generated by an external work source. Restricting to unitaries that can be run solely via a heat engine, we derive a novel Carnot-Landauer limit, along with protocols for its saturation. This generalizes Landauer's principle to a fully thermodynamic setting, leading to a unification with the third law and emphasizes the importance of control in quantum thermodynamics.",

    "abstract": "We present a systematic recipe for generating and classifying duality transformations in one-dimensional quantum lattice systems. Our construction emphasizes the role of global symmetries, including those described by (non)-abelian groups but also more general categorical symmetries. These symmetries can be realized as matrix product operators which allow the extraction of a fusion category that characterizes the algebra of all symmetric operators commuting with the symmetry. Known as the bond algebra, its explicit realizations are classified by module categories over the fusion category. A duality is then defined by a pair of distinct module categories giving rise to dual realizations of the bond algebra, as well as dual Hamiltonians. Symmetries of dual models are in general distinct but satisfy a categorical Morita equivalence. A key novelty of our categorical approach is the explicit construction of matrix product operators that intertwine dual bond algebra realizations at the level of the Hilbert space, and in general map local order operators to non-local string-order operators. We illustrate this approach for known dualities such as Kramers-Wannier, Jordan-Wigner, Kennedy-Tasaki and the IRF-vertex correspondence, a new duality of the $t$-$J_z$ chain model, and dualities in models with the exotic Haagerup symmetry. Finally, we comment on generalizations to higher dimensions.",

It is a crucial resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. However, quantifying magic resource beyond a few qubits has been a major challenge. Here, we introduce efficient measures of magic resource for pure quantum states with a sampling cost that is independent of the number of qubits. Our method uses Bell measurements over two copies of a state, which we implement in experiment together with a cost-free error mitigation scheme. We show the transition of classically simulable stabilizer states into intractable quantum states on the IonQ quantum computer. For applications, we efficiently distinguish stabilizer and non-stabilizer states with low measurement cost even in the presence of experimental noise. Further, we propose a variational quantum algorithm to maximize our measure via the shift-rule. Our algorithm can be free of barren plateaus even for highly expressible variational circuits. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate a Bell measurement protocol for the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy as well as the Wallach-Meyer entanglement measure.

    "abstract": "Quantum chaos in many-body systems provides a bridge between statistical and quantum physics with strong predictive power. This framework is valuable for analyzing properties of complex quantum systems such as energy spectra and the dynamics of thermalization. While contemporary methods in quantum chaos often rely on random ensembles of quantum states and Hamiltonians, this is not reflective of most real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective: across a wide range of examples, a single non-random quantum state is shown to encode universal and highly random quantum state ensembles. We characterize these ensembles using the notion of quantum state $k$-designs from quantum information theory and investigate their universality using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques. In particular, we establish that $k$-designs arise naturally from generic states as well as individual states associated with strongly interacting, time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics. Our results offer a new approach for studying quantum chaos and provide a practical method for sampling approximately uniformly random states; the latter has wide-ranging applications in quantum information science from tomography to benchmarking.",

    "abstract": "The impressive progress in quantum hardware in the last years has raised the interest of the quantum computing community in harvesting the computational power of such devices. However, in the absence of error correction, these devices can only reliably implement very shallow circuits or comparatively deeper circuits at the expense of a nontrivial density of errors. In this work, we obtain extremely tight limitation bounds for standard NISQ proposals in both the noisy and noiseless regimes, with or without error-mitigation tools. The bounds limit the performance of both circuit model algorithms, such as QAOA, and also continuous-time algorithms, such as quantum annealing. In the noisy regime with local depolarizing noise $p$, we prove that at depths $L=\\mathcal{O}(p^{-1})$ it is exponentially unlikely that the outcome of a noisy quantum circuit outperforms efficient classical algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems like Max-Cut. Although previous results already showed that classical algorithms outperform noisy quantum circuits at constant depth, these results only held for the expectation value of the output. Our results are based on newly developed quantum entropic and concentration inequalities, which constitute a homogeneous toolkit of theoretical methods from the quantum theory of optimal mass transport whose potential usefulness goes beyond the study of variational quantum algorithms.",

The total cost of the algorithm satisfies the Heisenberg-limited scaling $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-1})$. As a result, our algorithm may significantly reduce the circuit depth for performing phase estimation tasks on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. The key technique is a simple subroutine called quantum complex exponential least squares (QCELS). Our algorithm can be readily applied to reduce the circuit depth for estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian, when the overlap between the initial state and the ground state is large. If this initial overlap is small, we can combine our method with the Fourier filtering method developed in [Lin, Tong, PRX Quantum 3, 010318, 2022], and the resulting algorithm provably reduces the circuit depth in the presence of a large relative overlap compared to $\\epsilon$. The relative overlap condition is similar to a spectral gap assumption, but it is aware of the information in the initial state and is therefore applicable to certain Hamiltonians with small spectral gaps. We observe that the circuit depth can be reduced by around two orders of magnitude in numerical experiments under various settings.",

    "abstract": "The operator entanglement (OE) is a key quantifier of the complexity of a reduced density matrix. In out-of-equilibrium situations, e.g. after a quantum quench of a product state, it is expected to exhibit an entanglement barrier. The OE of a reduced density matrix initially grows linearly as entanglement builds up between the local degrees of freedom, it then reaches a maximum, and ultimately decays to a small finite value as the reduced density matrix converges to a simple stationary state through standard thermalization mechanisms. Here, by performing a new data analysis of the published experimental results of [Brydges et al., Science 364, 260 (2019)], we obtain the first experimental measurement of the OE of a subsystem reduced density matrix in a quantum many-body system. We employ the randomized measurements toolbox and we introduce and develop a new efficient method to post-process experimental data in order to extract higher-order density matrix functionals and access the OE. The OE thus obtained displays the expected barrier as long as the experimental system is large enough. For smaller systems, we observe a barrier with a double-peak structure, whose origin can be interpreted in terms of pairs of quasi-particles being reflected at the boundary of the qubit chain. As $U(1)$ symmetry plays a key role in our analysis, we introduce the notion of symmetry resolved operator entanglement (SROE), in addition to the total OE. To gain further insights into the SROE, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of this new quantity in chains of non-interacting fermions, which, in spite of their simplicity, capture most of the main features of OE and SROE. In particular, we uncover three main physical effects: the presence of a barrier in any charge sector, a time delay for the onset of the growth of SROE, and an effective equipartition between charge sectors.",

Specifically, this collection of pure quantum states -- called the projected ensemble -- can under certain conditions mimic the behavior of a maximally entropic, uniformly random ensemble, i.e., form a {\\it quantum state-design}, representing a ``deeper'' form of quantum thermalization. In this work, we investigate the dynamical process underlying this novel emergent universality. Leveraging a space-time duality mapping for one-dimensional quantum circuits, we argue that the physics of dynamical purification, which arises in the context of monitored quantum systems, constrains the the projected ensemble's approach towards the uniform distribution. We prove that absence of dynamical purification in the space-time dual dynamics (a condition realized in dual-unitary quantum circuits with appropriate initial states and final measurement bases) generically yields exact state-designs for all moments $k$ at the same time, extending previous rigorous results [Ho and Choi, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 128}, 060601 (2022)]. Conversely, we show that, departing from these conditions, dynamical purification can lead to a separation of timescales between the formation of a quantum state-design for moment $k=1$ (regular thermalization) and for high moments $k\\gg 1$ (deep thermalization). Our results suggest that the projected ensemble can probe nuanced features of quantum dynamics inaccessible to regular thermalization, such as quantum information scrambling.",

Using the operator-state mapping, we characterize symmetry of Liouvillian superoperators for the open quantum dynamics by symmetry of operators in the double Hilbert space and apply the 38-fold internal-symmetry classification of non-Hermitian operators. We find rich symmetry classification due to the interplay between symmetry in the corresponding closed quantum systems and symmetry inherent in the construction of the Liouvillian superoperators. As an illustrative example of open quantum bosonic systems, we study symmetry classes of dissipative quantum spin models.

We establish the periodic tables of the SYK Lindbladians and elucidate the difference from the SYK Hamiltonians.

They have been widely used for fundamental studies in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and they are at the core of attosecond physics and ultrafast opto-electronics. Although the majority of these studies have been successfully described using classical electromagnetic fields, recent investigations based on fully quantized approaches have shown that intense laser-atom interactions can be used for the generation of controllable high-photon-number entangled coherent states and coherent state superpositions. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive fully quantized description of intense laser-atom interactions. We elaborate on the processes of high harmonic generation, above-threshold-ionization, and we discuss new phenomena that cannot be revealed within the context of semi-classical theories. We provide the description for conditioning the light field on different electronic processes, and their consequences for quantum state engineering of light. Finally, we discuss the extension of the approach to more complex materials, and the impact to quantum technologies for a new photonic platform composed by the symbiosis of attosecond physics and quantum information science.",

This relationship improves upon a qualitative\"mean-field\"statistical mechanics of the volume-law-entangled phase [1, 2]. For the Clifford circuit in various geometries, we obtain agreement between the subleading entanglement entropies and error correcting properties of the volume-law phase (which quantify its stability to projective measurements) with predictions of the DPRE. We further demonstrate that depolarizing noise in the hybrid dynamics near the final circuit time can drive a continuous phase transition to a non-error correcting volume law phase that is not immune to the disentangling action of projective measurements. We observe this transition in hybrid Clifford dynamics, and obtain quantitative agreement with critical exponents for a\"pinning\"phase transition of the DPRE in the presence of an attractive interface.",

    "abstract": "Transmon qubits are ubiquitously used in superconducting quantum information processor architectures. Strong drives are required to realize fast, high-fidelity, gates and measurements, including parametrically activated processes. Here, we show that even off-resonant drives, in regimes routinely used in experiments, can cause strong modifications to the structure of the transmon spectrum rendering a large part of it chaotic. Accounting for the full nonlinear dynamics of the transmon in a Floquet-Markov formalism, we find that these chaotic states, often neglected through the hypothesis that the anharmonicity is weak, strongly impact the lifetime of the transmon's computational states. In particular, we observe that chaos-assisted quantum phase slips greatly enhance band dispersions. In the presence of a measurement resonator, we find that approaching chaotic behavior correlates with strong transmon-resonator hybridization, and an average resonator response centered on the bare resonator frequency. These results lead to a photon number threshold characterizing the appearance of chaos-induced quantum demolition effects during strong-drive operations such as dispersive qubit readout. The phenomena described here are expected to be present in all circuits based on low-impedance Josephson-junctions.",

    "abstract": "Current implementations of quantum bits (qubits) continue to undergo too many errors to be scaled into useful quantum machines. An emerging strategy is to encode quantum information in the two meta-stable pointer states of an oscillator exchanging pairs of photons with its environment, a mechanism shown to provide stability without inducing decoherence. Adding photons in these states increases their separation, and macroscopic bit-flip times are expected even for a handful of photons, a range suitable to implement a qubit. However, previous experimental realizations have saturated in the millisecond range. In this work, we aim for the maximum bit-flip time we could achieve in a two-photon dissipative oscillator. To this end, we design a Josephson circuit in a regime that circumvents all suspected dynamical instabilities, and employ a minimally invasive fluorescence detection tool, at the cost of a two-photon exchange rate dominated by single-photon loss. We attain bit-flip times of the order of 100 seconds for states pinned by two-photon dissipation and containing about 40 photons. This experiment lays a solid foundation from which the two-photon exchange rate can be gradually increased, thus gaining access to the preparation and measurement of quantum superposition states, and pursuing the route towards a logical qubit with built-in bit-flip protection.",

Quantum random number generation (QRNG) allows for the creation of truly unpredictable numbers thanks to the inherent randomness available in quantum mechanics. A popular approach is using the quantum vacuum state to generate random numbers. While convenient, this approach was generally limited in speed compared to other schemes. Here, through custom co-design of opto-electronic integrated circuits and side-information reduction by digital filtering, we experimentally demonstrated an ultrafast generation rate of 100 Gbps, setting a new record for vacuum-based quantum random number generation by one order of magnitude. Furthermore, our experimental demonstrations are well supported by an upgraded device-dependent framework that is secure against both classical and quantum side-information and that also properly considers the non-linearity in the digitization process. This ultrafast secure random number generator in the chip-scale platform holds promise for next generation communication and cryptography applications.",

    "abstract": "The ground state of the spin-1 Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Tasaki (AKLT) model is a paradigmatic example of both a matrix product state and a symmetry-protected topological phase, and additionally holds promise as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation. Having a nonzero correlation length, the AKLT state cannot be exactly prepared by a constant-depth unitary circuit composed of local gates. In this work, we demonstrate that this no-go limit can be evaded by augmenting a constant-depth circuit with fusion measurements, such that the total preparation time is independent of system size and entirely deterministic. We elucidate our preparation scheme using the language of tensor networks, and furthermore show that the $\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the AKLT state directly affords this speed-up over previously known preparation methods. To demonstrate the practical advantage of measurement-assisted preparation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we carry out our protocol on an IBM Quantum processor. We measure both the string order and entanglement spectrum of prepared AKLT chains and, employing these as metrics, find improved results over the known (purely unitary) sequential preparation approach. We conclude with a demonstration of quantum teleportation using the AKLT state prepared by our measurement-assisted scheme. This work thus serves to provide an efficient strategy to prepare a specific resource in the form of the AKLT state and, more broadly, experimentally demonstrates the possibility for realizable improvement in state preparation afforded by measurement-based circuit depth reduction strategies on NISQ-era devices.",

The two-dimensional code, which we call the CSS honeycomb code, is geometrically similar to that of the honeycomb code by Hastings and Haah, and also dynamically embeds an instantaneous toric code. However, unlike the honeycomb code it possesses an explicit CSS structure and its gauge checks do not form a subsystem code. Nevertheless, we show that our dynamic protocol conserves logical information and possesses a threshold for error correction. We generalize this construction to three dimensions and obtain a code that fault-tolerantly alternates between realizing two type-I fracton models, the checkerboard and the X-cube model. Finally, we show the compatibility of our CSS honeycomb code protocol and the honeycomb code by showing the possibility of randomly switching between the two protocols without information loss while still measuring error syndromes. We call this more general aperiodic structure `dynamic tree codes', which we also generalize to three dimensions. We construct a probabilistic finite automaton prescription that generates dynamic tree codes correcting any single-qubit Pauli errors and can be viewed as a step towards the development of practical fault-tolerant random codes.",

The problem of speeding up these processes has garnered a large amount of interest, resulting in a menagerie of approaches, most notably quantum optimal control and shortcuts to adiabaticity. The two approaches are complementary: optimal control manipulates control fields to steer the dynamics in the minimum allowed time while shortcuts to adiabaticity aim to retain the adiabatic condition upon speed-up. We outline a new method which combines the two methodologies and takes advantage of the strengths of each. The new technique improves upon approximate local counterdiabatic driving with the addition of time-dependent control fields. We refer to this new method as counterdiabatic optimised local driving (COLD) and we show that it can result in a substantial improvement when applied to annealing protocols, state preparation schemes, entanglement generation and population transfer on a lattice. We also demonstrate a new approach to the optimisation of control fields which does not require access to the wavefunction or the computation of system dynamics. COLD can be enhanced with existing advanced optimal control methods and we explore this using the chopped randomised basis method and gradient ascent pulse engineering.",

    "abstract": "With the long-term goal of studying quantum gravity in the lab, we propose holographic teleportation protocols that can be readily executed in table-top experiments. These protocols exhibit similar behavior to that seen in recent traversable wormhole constructions: information that is scrambled into one half of an entangled system will, following a weak coupling between the two halves, unscramble into the other half. We introduce the concept of \"teleportation by size\" to capture how the physics of operator-size growth naturally leads to information transmission. The transmission of a signal through a semi-classical holographic wormhole corresponds to a rather special property of the operator-size distribution we call \"size winding\". For more general setups (which may not have a clean emergent geometry), we argue that imperfect size winding is a generalization of the traversable wormhole phenomenon. For example, a form of signalling continues to function at high temperature and at large times for generic chaotic systems, even though it does not correspond to a signal going through a geometrical wormhole, but rather to an interference effect involving macroscopically different emergent geometries. Finally, we outline implementations feasible with current technology in two experimental platforms: Rydberg atom arrays and trapped ions.",

This algorithm can be seen as the extension of the time-dependent DMRG from the usual situation of Hermitian Hamiltonian matrices to quantum circuits deﬁned by unitary matrices. For small circuit depths, the technique is exact and equivalent to other matrix product state–based techniques. For larger depths, it becomes approximate in exchange for an exponential speed up in computational time. Like an actual quantum computer, the quality of the DMRG results is characterized by a ﬁnite ﬁdelity. However, unlike a quantum computer, the ﬁdelity depends strongly on the quantum circuit considered. For the most diﬃcult possible circuit for this technique, the so-called “quantum supremacy” benchmark of Google LLC [Arute et al. , Nature 574, 505 (2019)], we ﬁnd that the DMRG algorithm can generate bit strings of the same quality as the seminal Google experiment on a single computing core. For a more structured circuit used for combinatorial optimization (quantum approximate optimization algorithm), we ﬁnd a drastic improvement of the DMRG results with error rates dropping by a factor of 100 compared with random quantum circuits.

    "abstract": "Silicon spin qubits stand out due to their very long coherence times, compatibility with industrial fabrication, and prospect to integrate classical control electronics. To achieve a truly scalable architecture, a coherent mid-range link that moves the electrons between qubit registers has been suggested to solve the signal fan-out problem. Here, we present a blueprint of such a $\\approx 10\\,\\mu$m long link, called a spin qubit shuttle, which is based on connecting an array of gates into a small number of sets. To control these sets, only a few voltage control lines are needed and the number of these sets and thus the number of required control signals is independent of the length of this link. We discuss two different operation modes for the spin qubit shuttle: A qubit conveyor, i.e. a potential minimum that smoothly moves laterally, and a bucket brigade, in which the electron is transported through a series of tunnel-coupled quantum dots by adiabatic passage. We find the former approach more promising considering a realistic Si/SiGe device including potential disorder from the charged defects at the Si/SiO$_2$ layer, as well as typical charge noise. Focusing on the qubit transfer fidelity in the conveyor shuttling mode, we discuss in detail motional narrowing, the interplay between orbital and valley excitation and relaxation in presence of $g$-factors that depend on orbital and valley state of the electron, and effects from spin-hotspots. We find that a transfer fidelity of 99.9 \\% is feasible in Si/SiGe at a speed of $\\sim$10 m/s, if the average valley splitting and its inhomogeneity stay within realistic bounds. Operation at low global magnetic field $\\approx 20$ mT and material engineering towards high valley splitting is favourable for reaching high fidelities of transfer.",

For a wide range of distributions D on arbitrary n-qubit states, we show that this ML algorithm can learn to predict any local property of the output from the unknown process E, with a small average error over input states drawn from D. The ML algorithm is computationally efficient even when the unknown process is a quantum circuit with exponentially many gates. Our algorithm combines efficient procedures for learning properties of an unknown state and for learning a low-degree approximation to an unknown observable. The analysis hinges on proving new norm inequalities, including a quantum analogue of the classical Bohnenblust-Hille inequality, which we derive by giving an improved algorithm for optimizing local Hamiltonians. Numerical experiments on predicting quantum dynamics with evolution time up to 106 and system size up to 50 qubits corroborate our proof. Overall, our results highlight the potential for ML models to predict the output of complex quantum dynamics much faster than the time needed to run the process itself.Received 14 April 2023Revised 11 November 2023Accepted 15 November 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.040337Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Strongly-coupled gauge theories far from equilibrium may exhibit unique features that could illuminate the physics of the early universe and of hadron and ion colliders. Studying real-time phenomena has proven challenging with classical-simulation methods, but is a natural application of quantum simulation. To demonstrate this prospect, we quantum compute non-equal time correlation functions and perform entanglement tomography of non-equilibrium states of a simple lattice gauge theory, the Schwinger model, using a trapped-ion quantum computer by IonQ Inc. As an ideal target for near-term devices, a recently-predicted [Zache et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 050403 (2019)] dynamical quantum phase transition in this model is studied by preparing, quenching, and tracking the subsequent non-equilibrium dynamics in three ways: i) overlap echos signaling dynamical transitions, ii) non-equal time correlation functions with an underlying topological nature, and iii) the entanglement structure of non-equilibrium states, including entanglement Hamiltonians. These results constitute the first observation of a dynamical quantum phase transition in a lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer, and are a first step toward investigating topological phenomena in nuclear and high-energy physics using quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Mitigating errors in quantum information processing devices is especially important in the absence of fault tolerance. An effective method in suppressing state-preparation errors is using multiple copies to distill the ideal component from a noisy quantum state. Here, we use classical shadows and randomized measurements to circumvent the need for coherent access to multiple copies at an exponential cost. We study the scaling of resources using numerical simulations and find that the overhead is still favorable compared to full state tomography. We optimize measurement resources under realistic experimental constraints and apply our method to an experiment preparing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with trapped ions. In addition to improving stabilizer measurements, the analysis of the improved results reveals the nature of errors affecting the experiment. Hence, our results provide a directly applicable method for mitigating errors in near-term quantum computers.",

    "abstract": "Logical gates constitute the building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computation. While quantum error-corrected memories have been extensively studied in the literature, explicit constructions and detailed analyses of thresholds and resource overheads of universal logical gate sets have so far been limited. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for universal fault-tolerant logic motivated by the combined need for platform-independent logical gate definitions, flexible and scalable tools for numerical analysis, and exploration of novel schemes for universal logic that improve resource overheads. Central to our framework is the description of logical gates holistically in a way which treats space and time on a similar footing. Focusing on schemes based on surface codes, we introduce explicit, but platform-independent representations of topological logic gates -- called logical blocks -- and generate new, overhead-efficient methods for universal quantum computation. As a specific example, we propose fault-tolerant schemes based on surface codes concatenated with more general low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The logical blocks framework enables a convenient mapping from an abstract description of the logical gate to a precise set of physical instructions for both circuit-based and fusion-based quantum computation (FBQC). Using this, we numerically simulate a surface-code-based universal gate set implemented with FBQC, and verify that their thresholds are consistent with the bulk memory threshold. We find that boundaries, defects, and twists can significantly impact the logical error rate scaling, with periodic boundary conditions potentially halving the resource requirements. Motivated by the favorable logical error rates for boundaryless computation, we introduce a novel computational scheme based on the teleportation of twists that may offer further resource reductions.",

We demonstrate that sampling such Pauli-Markov chains gives ample flexibility in terms of partitions where to sample from: in particular, it enables to efficiently extract the magic contained in the correlations between widely-separated subsystems, which characterizes the nonlocality of magic. Our method can be implemented in a variety of situations. We describe an efficient sampling procedure using Tree Tensor Networks, that exploits their hierarchical structure leading to a modest $O(\\log N)$ computational scaling with system size. To showcase the applicability and efficiency of our method, we demonstrate the importance of magic in many-body systems via the following discoveries: (a) for one dimensional systems, we show that long-range magic displays strong signatures of conformal quantum criticality (Ising, Potts, and Gaussian), overcoming the limitations of full state magic; (b) in two-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, we provide conclusive evidence that magic is able to identify the confinement-deconfinement transition, and displays critical scaling behavior even at relatively modest volumes. Finally, we discuss an experimental implementation of the method, which only relies on measurements of Pauli observables.",

We address the challenge of probing the physics of Majorana fermions, while having only access to the original composite spin degrees of freedom. Specifically, we propose to detect the properties of the chiral spin liquid phase using gap spectroscopy and edge quenches in the presence of the Floquet drive. The resulting chiral edge signal, which relates to the thermal Hall effect associated with neutral Majorana currents, is found to be robust for realistically-prepared states. By combining strong interactions with Floquet engineering, our work paves the way for future studies of non-Abelian excitations and quantized thermal transport using quantum simulators.",

Perfect size-winding is a remarkable, fine-grained property of the size wavefunction of an operator; we show from a bulk calculation that this property must hold for quantum systems with a nearly-AdS_2 bulk. We then examine in detail teleportation by size in three systems: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, random matrices, and spin chains, and discuss prospects for realizing these phenomena in near-term quantum devices.",

We suggest an erasure-conversion scheme for metastable trapped-ion qubits and develop a detailed model of various types of errors.

As an illustration, symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases can be universally converted into mixed-states with long-range entanglement, which can undergo phase transitions with quantum critical correlations of local operators and a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement negativity, despite coexisting with volume-law entropy. Within the same framework, we present two applications using fermion occupation number measurement to convert (i) spinful free fermions in one dimension into a quantum-critical mixed state with enhanced algebraic correlations between spins and (ii) Chern insulators into a mixed state with critical quantum correlations in the bulk. The latter is an example where mixed-state quantum criticality can emerge from a gapped state of matter in constant depth using local quantum operations and non-local classical communication.",

    "abstract": "Tunable coupling of superconducting qubits has been widely studied due to its importance for isolated gate operations in scalable quantum processor architectures. Here, we demonstrate a tunable qubit-qubit coupler based on a floating transmon device which allows us to place qubits at least 2 mm apart from each other while maintaining over 50 MHz coupling between the coupler and the qubits. In the introduced tunable-coupler design, both the qubit-qubit and the qubit-coupler couplings are mediated by two waveguides instead of relying on direct capacitive couplings between the components, reducing the impact of the qubit-qubit distance on the couplings. This leaves space for each qubit to have an individual readout resonator and a Purcell filter needed for fast high-fidelity readout. In addition, the large qubit-qubit distance reduces unwanted non-nearest neighbor coupling and allows multiple control lines to cross over the structure with minimal crosstalk. Using the proposed flexible and scalable architecture, we demonstrate a controlled-$Z$ gate with $(99.81 \\pm 0.02)\\%$ fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting qubit lifetimes must be both long and stable to provide an adequate foundation for quantum computing. This stability is imperiled by two-level systems (TLSs), currently a dominant loss mechanism, which exhibit slow spectral dynamics that destabilize qubit lifetimes on hour timescales. Stability is also threatened at millisecond timescales, where ionizing radiation has recently been found to cause bursts of correlated multi-qubit decays, complicating quantum error correction. Here we study both ionizing radiation and TLS dynamics on a 27-qubit processor, repurposing the standard transmon qubits as sensors of both radiation impacts and TLS dynamics. Unlike prior literature, we observe resilience of the qubit lifetimes to the transient quasiparticles generated by the impact of radiation. However, we also observe a new interaction between these two processes,\"TLS scrambling,\"in which a radiation impact causes multiple TLSs to jump in frequency, which we suggest is due to the same charge rearrangement sensed by qubits near a radiation impact. As TLS scrambling brings TLSs out of or in to resonance with the qubit, the lifetime of the qubit increases or decreases. Our findings thus identify radiation as a new contribution to fluctuations in qubit lifetimes, with implications for efforts to characterize and improve device stability",

    "abstract": "Dissipative collective effects are ubiquitous in quantum physics, and their relevance ranges from the study of entanglement in biological systems to noise mitigation in quantum computers. Here, we put forward the first fully quantum simulation of dissipative collective phenomena on a real quantum computer, based on the recently introduced multipartite collision model. First, we theoretically study the accuracy of this algorithm on near-term quantum computers with noisy gates, and we derive some rigorous error bounds that depend on the timestep of the collision model and on the gate errors. These bounds can be employed to estimate the necessary resources for the efficient quantum simulation of the collective dynamics. Then, we implement the algorithm on some IBM quantum computers to simulate superradiance and subradiance between a pair of qubits. Our experimental results successfully display the emergence of collective effects in the quantum simulation. In addition, we analyze the noise properties of the gates that we employ in the algorithm by means of full process tomography, with the aim of improving our understanding of the errors in the near-term devices that are currently accessible to worldwide researchers. We obtain the values of the average gate fidelity, unitarity, incoherence and diamond error, and we establish a connection between them and the accuracy of the experimentally simulated state. Moreover, we build a noise model based on the results of the process tomography for two-qubit gates and show that its performance is comparable with the noise model provided by IBM. Finally, we observe that the scaling of the error as a function of the number of gates is favorable, but at the same time reaching the threshold of the diamond errors for quantum fault tolerant computation may still be orders of magnitude away in the devices that we employ.",

However, linear ion strings have drawbacks, such as the difficulty to scale beyond $\\sim 50$ particles as well as the inability to naturally implement spin models with more than one spatial dimension. Here, we present experiments with planar Coulomb crystals of about 100 $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions in a novel monolithic rf trap, laying the groundwork for quantum simulations of two-dimensional spin models with single-particle control. We characterize the trapping potential by analysis of crystal images and compare the observed crystal configurations with numerical simulations. We further demonstrate stable confinement of large crystals, free of structural configuration changes, and find that rf heating of the crystal is not an obstacle for future quantum simulation experiments. Finally, we prepare the out-of-plane motional modes of planar crystals consisting of up to 105 ions close to their ground state by electromagnetically-induced transparency cooling, an important prerequisite for implementing long-range entangling interactions.",

    "abstract": "Encoding quantum information onto bosonic systems is a promising route to quantum error correction. In a cat code, this encoding relies on the confinement of the system's dynamics onto the two-dimensional manifold spanned by Schr\\\"odinger cats of opposite parity. In dissipative cat qubits, an engineered dissipation scheme combining two-photon drive and loss has been used to autonomously stabilize this manifold, ensuring passive protection against bit-flip errors, regardless of their origin. In Kerr cat qubits, where highly-performing gates can be engineered, two-photon drive and Kerr nonlinearity cooperate to confine the system to a two-fold degenerate ground state manifold spanned by cats of opposite parity. Dissipative, Hamiltonian, and hybrid confinements have been investigated at resonance. Here, we propose a critical cat code, where both two-photon loss and Kerr nonlinearity are present, and the two-photon drive is allowed to be out of resonance. The performance of this code is assessed via the spectral theory of Liouvillians in all configurations, from the purely dissipative to the Kerr limit. We show that large detunings and small, but non-negligible, two-photon loss rates are fundamental to achieve optimal performance. We demonstrate that the competition between nonlinearity and detuning results in a first-order dissipative phase transition, leading to a squeezed vacuum steady state. To achieve the maximal suppression of the logical bit-flip rate requires initializing the system in the metastable state emerging from the first-order transition, and we detail a protocol to do so. Efficiently operating over a broad range of detuning values, the critical cat code is particularly resistant to random frequency shifts characterizing multiple-qubit operations, opening venues for the realization of reliable protocols for scalable and concatenated bosonic qubit architectures.",

    "abstract": "Gate-based quantum computers typically encode and process information in two-dimensional units called qubits. Using $d$-dimensional qudits instead may offer intrinsic advantages, including more efficient circuit synthesis, problem-tailored encodings and embedded error correction. In this work, we design a superconducting qudit-based quantum processor wherein the logical space of transmon qubits is extended to higher-excited levels. We propose a universal gate set featuring a two-qudit cross-resonance entangling gate, for which we predict fidelities beyond $99\\%$ in the $d=4$ case of ququarts with realistic experimental parameters. Furthermore, we present a decomposition routine that compiles general qudit unitaries into these elementary gates, requiring fewer entangling gates than qubit alternatives. As proof-of-concept applications, we numerically demonstrate the synthesis of ${\\rm SU}(16)$ gates for noisy quantum hardware and an embedded error correction sequence that encodes a qubit memory in a transmon ququart to protect against pure dephasing noise. We conclude that universal qudit control -- a valuable extension to the operational toolbox of superconducting quantum information processing -- is within reach of current transmon-based architectures and has applications to near-term and long-term hardware.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction is crucial for any quantum computing platform to achieve truly scalable quantum computation. The surface code and its variants have been considered the most promising quantum error correction scheme due to their high threshold, low overhead, and relatively simple structure that can naturally be implemented in many existing qubit architectures, such as superconducting qubits. The recent development of Floquet codes offers another promising approach. By going beyond the usual paradigm of stabilizer codes, Floquet codes achieve similar performance while being constructed entirely from two-qubit measurements. This makes them particularly suitable for platforms where two-qubit measurements can be implemented directly, such as measurement-only topological qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here, we explain how two variants of Floquet codes can be implemented on MZM-based architectures without any auxiliary qubits for syndrome measurement and with shallow syndrome extraction sequences. We then numerically demonstrate their favorable performance. In particular, we show that they improve the threshold for scalable quantum computation in MZM-based systems by an order of magnitude, and significantly reduce space and time overheads below threshold.",

Keeping current experimental platforms in mind, we present sensors that have limited entanglement capabilities, and yet, significantly outperform sensors that operate without entanglement and approach the optimal quantum sensor in terms of performance. Furthermore, we show how these sensors can be implemented on current programmable quantum sensors with variational quantum circuits by minimizing a metrological cost function.

These links create space for classical on-chip control electronics between qubit arrays, which can help to alleviate the so-called wiring bottleneck. A promising method of achieving coherent links between distant spin qubits consists of shuttling the spin through an array of quantum dots. Here, we use a linear array of four tunnel-coupled quantum dots in a 28Si/SiGe heterostructure to create a short quantum link. We move an electron spin through the quantum dot array by adjusting the electrochemical potential for each quantum dot sequentially. By pulsing the gates repeatedly, we shuttle an electron forward and backward through the array up to 250 times, which corresponds to a total distance of approximately 80 {\\mu}m. We make an estimate of the spin-flip probability per hop in these experiments and conclude that this is well below 0.01% per hop.",

This phenomenon has been observed in bio-molecular systems, where noise enables novel functionalities, making the simulation of their dynamics a crucial target for digital and analog quantum simulation. Nevertheless, the computational capabilities of current quantum devices are often limited due to their inherent noise. In this work, we present a novel approach that capitalizes on the intrinsic noise of quantum devices to reduce the computational resources required for simulating open quantum systems. Our approach combines quantum noise characterization methods with quantum error mitigation techniques, enabling us to manipulate and control the intrinsic noise in a quantum circuit. Specifically, we selectively enhance or reduce decoherence rates in the quantum circuit to achieve the desired simulation of open system dynamics. We provide a detailed description of our methods and report on the results of noise characterization and quantum error mitigation experiments conducted on both real and emulated IBM Quantum computers. Additionally, we estimate the experimental resource requirements for our techniques. Our approach holds the potential to unlock new simulation techniques in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, harnessing their intrinsic noise to enhance quantum computations.",

Typically, the optimization minimizes the average gate error, however, recent work in quantum error correction has demonstrated that the performance of encoded logical qubits is sensitive to not only the average error rate, but also the type of errors that occur. Here, we present a family of Rydberg blockade gates for neutral atom qubits that are robust against two common, major imperfections: intensity inhomogeneity and Doppler shifts. These gates outperform existing gates for moderate or large imperfections. We also consider the logical performance of these gates in the context of an erasure-biased qubit based on metastable $~^{171}$Yb. In this case, we observe that the robust gates outperform existing gates for even very small values of the imperfections, because they maintain the native large bias towards erasure errors for these qubits. These results significantly reduce the laser stability and atomic temperature requirements to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms. The approach of optimizing gates for logical qubit performance may be applied to other qubit platforms.",

    "abstract": "The single flux quantum (SFQ) digital superconducting logic family has been proposed for the scalable control of next-generation superconducting qubit arrays. In the initial implementation, SFQ-based gate fidelity was limited by quasiparticle (QP) poisoning induced by the dissipative on-chip SFQ driver circuit. In this work, we introduce a multi-chip module architecture to suppress phonon-mediated QP poisoning. Here, the SFQ elements and qubits are fabricated on separate chips that are joined with In bump bonds. We use interleaved randomized benchmarking to characterize the fidelity of SFQ-based gates, and we demonstrate an error per Clifford gate of 1.2(1)%, an order-of-magnitude reduction over the gate error achieved in the initial realization of SFQ-based qubit control. We use purity benchmarking to quantify the contribution of incoherent error at 0.96(2)%; we attribute this error to photon-mediated QP poisoning mediated by the resonant mm-wave antenna modes of the qubit and SFQ-qubit coupler. We anticipate that a straightforward redesign of the SFQ driver circuit to limit the bandwidth of the SFQ pulses will eliminate this source of infidelity, allowing SFQ-based gates with fidelity approaching theoretical limits, namely 99.9% for resonant sequences and 99.99% for more complex pulse sequences involving variable pulse-to-pulse separation.",

    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian band theory distinguishes between line gaps and point gaps. While point gaps can give rise to intrinsic non-Hermitian band topology without Hermitian counterparts, line-gapped systems can always be adiabatically deformed to a Hermitian limit. Here we show that line-gap topology and point-gap topology can be intricately connected: topological line-gapped systems in $d$ dimensions induce nontrivial point-gap topology on their $(d-1)$-dimensional boundaries when suitable internal and spatial symmetries are present. Since line-gapped systems essentially realize Hermitian topological phases, this establishes a correspondence between Hermitian bulk topology and intrinsic non-Hermitian boundary topology. For the correspondence to hold, no non-Hermitian perturbations are required in the bulk itself, so that the bulk can be purely Hermitian. Concomitantly, the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations in the bulk does not affect any results as long as they do not close the bulk line gap. On the other hand, non-Hermitian perturbations are essential on the boundary to open a point gap. The non-Hermitian boundary topology then further leads to higher-order skin modes, as well as chiral and helical hinge modes, that are protected by point gaps and hence unique to non-Hermitian systems. We identify all the internal symmetry classes where bulk line-gap topology induces boundary point-gap topology as long as an additional spatial symmetry is present, and establish the correspondence between their topological invariants. There also exist some symmetry classes where the Hermitian edge states remain stable, in the sense that even a point gap cannot open on the boundary.",

    "abstract": "The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a key component of many important quantum algorithms, most famously as being the essential ingredient in Shor's algorithm for factoring products of primes. Given its remarkable capability, one would think it can introduce large entanglement to qubit systems and would be difficult to simulate classically. While early results showed QFT indeed has maximal operator entanglement, we show that this is entirely due to the bit reversal in the QFT. The core part of the QFT has Schmidt coefficients decaying exponentially quickly, and thus it can only generate a constant amount of entanglement regardless of the number of qubits. In addition, we show the entangling power of the QFT is the same as the time evolution of a Hamiltonian with exponentially decaying interactions, and thus a variant of the area law for dynamics can be used to understand the low entanglement intuitively. Using the low entanglement property of the QFT, we show that classical simulations of the QFT on a matrix product state with low bond dimension only take time linear in the number of qubits, providing a potential speedup over the classical fast Fourier transform (FFT) on many classes of functions. We demonstrate this speedup in test calculations on some simple functions. For data vectors of length $10^6$ to $10^8$, the speedup can be a few orders of magnitude.",

Our main insight is that for sufficiently large systems we do not need to prepare the $n$-qubit mixed Gibbs state explicitly but, instead, we can evolve a random $n$-qubit pure state in imaginary time.

We propose a quantum circuit that implements this algorithm by using quantum signal processing for the imaginary time evolution.

The best-performing such amplifiers are often based on Josephson junctions, which however are sensitive to magnetic fields. Therefore, they require magnetic shields and are not easily integratable with other quantum systems that operates within magnetic fields, such as spin ensemble quantum memories. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a kinetic inductance-based parametric amplifier featuring a NbN nanobridge instead of Josephson Junctions, which provides the desired nonlinearity for a strong parametric gain up to 42 dB. The added noise of this nanobridge kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier (hereby referred as NKPA) is calibrated and found to be $0.59\\pm 0.03$ quanta for phase-preserving amplification, approaching the quantum limit of 0.5 quanta. Most importantly, we show that such excellent noise performance is preserved in an in-plane magnetic field up to 427 mT, the maximum field available in our experiment. This magnetic field-resilient parametric amplifier presents an opportunity towards addressing single electron-spin resonance and more efficient search for Axions as well as Majorana Fermions.",

Often, the global energy and particle number are conserved, and the system is prepared with a well-defined particle number - in a microcanonical subspace. However, quantum evolution can also conserve quantities, or charges, that fail to commute with each other. Noncommuting charges have recently emerged as a subfield at the intersection of quantum thermodynamics and quantum information. Until now, this subfield has remained theoretical. We initiate the experimental testing of its predictions, with a trapped-ion simulator. We prepare 6-21 spins in an approximate microcanonical subspace, a generalization of the microcanonical subspace for accommodating noncommuting charges, which cannot necessarily have well-defined nontrivial values simultaneously. We simulate a Heisenberg evolution using laser-induced entangling interactions and collective spin rotations. The noncommuting charges are the three spin components. We find that small subsystems equilibrate to near a recently predicted non-Abelian thermal state. This work bridges quantum many-body simulators to the quantum thermodynamics of noncommuting charges, whose predictions can now be tested.",

Many attempts have been made to extend this rule to quantum systems, the significance of which we are only beginning to understand. In this work, we develop a systematic framework for defining Bayes' rule in the quantum setting, and we show that a vast majority of the proposed quantum Bayes' rules appearing in the literature are all instances of our definition.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in the development of quantum technologies has enabled the direct investigation of dynamics of increasingly complex quantum many-body systems. This motivates the study of the complexity of classical algorithms for this problem in order to benchmark quantum simulators and to delineate the regime of quantum advantage. Here we present classical algorithms for approximating the dynamics of local observables and nonlocal quantities such as the Loschmidt echo, where the evolution is governed by a local Hamiltonian. For short times, their computational cost scales polynomially with the system size and the inverse of the approximation error. In the case of local observables, the proposed algorithm has a better dependence on the approximation error than algorithms based on the Lieb-Robinson bound. Our results use cluster expansion techniques adapted to the dynamical setting, for which we give a novel proof of their convergence. This has important physical consequences besides our efficient algorithms. In particular, we establish a novel quantum speed limit, a bound on dynamical phase transitions, and a concentration bound for product states evolved for short times.",

We develop a unitary representation of measurements based on the Stinespring Theorem, which we crucially identify with the time evolution of the system and measurement apparatus, affording significant technical advantages and conceptual insight into hybrid dynamics. We diagnose spectral properties in the presence of measurements for the first time, along with standard, experimentally tractable probes of phase structure, finding no nontrivial effects due to measurements in the absence of feedback. We also establish that nonlinearity in the density matrix is neither sufficient nor necessary to see a transition, and instead identify utilization of the measurement outcomes (i.e., ``feedback'') as the crucial ingredient. After reviewing the definition of a phase of matter, we identify nontrivial orders in adaptive hybrid dynamics -- in which measurement outcomes determine future unitary gates -- finding a genuine measurement-induced absorbing-state phase transition in an adaptive quantum East model. In general, we find that only deterministic and constrained Haar-random dynamics with active feedback and without continuous symmetries can realize genuine, measurement-induced phases of matter.",

Using an independent standard algorithmic test suite we show that it is possible to recover on average nearly 40% of missing fidelity using better qubit selection via efficient to compute cost functions. We demonstrate additional performance gains by considering qubit placement over multiple quantum processors.

We show that the qubit state can be measured with a fidelity of 0.995(4) under a condition that leaves it in the state corresponding to the measurement outcome with a probability of 0.993(6) for a single tweezer and 0.981(4) averaged over the array. This is accomplished by near-perfect cyclicity of one of the nuclear spin qubit states with an optically excited state under a magnetic field of $B=58$ G, resulting in a bright/dark contrast of $\\approx10^5$ during fluorescence readout. The performance improves further as $\\sim1/B^2$. The state-averaged readout survival of 0.98(1) is limited by off-resonant scattering to dark states and can be addressed via post-selection by measuring the atom number at the end of the circuit, or during the circuit by performing a measurement of both qubit states. We combine projective measurements with high-fidelity rotations of the nuclear spin qubit via an AC magnetic field to explore several paradigmatic scenarios, including the non-commutivity of measurements in orthogonal bases, and the quantum Zeno mechanism in which measurements\"freeze\"coherent evolution. Finally, we employ real-time feedforward to repetitively deterministically prepare the qubit in the $+z$ or $-z$ direction after initializing it in an orthogonal basis and performing a projective measurement in the $z$-basis. These capabilities constitute an important step towards adaptive quantum circuits with atom arrays, such as in measurement-based quantum computation, fast many-body state preparation, holographic dynamics simulations, and quantum error correction.",

The cost of DMRG scales with system size $N$ as $O(ND^3)$, where the so-called bond dimension $D$ regulates how expressive the underlying matrix product state (MPS) variational ansatz is.

In this work, we propose and analyze a nonlinear-optical route to PNR QND using quadratic (i.e., $\\chi^{(2)}$) nonlinear interactions. We show that the coherent pump field driving a phase-mismatched optical parametric amplifier (OPA) experiences displacements conditioned on the number of signal Bogoliubov excitations. A measurement of the pump displacement thus provides a QND measurement of the signal Bogoliubov excitations, projecting the signal mode to a squeezed photon-number state. We then show how our nonlinear OPA dynamics can be utilized for deterministically generating Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states only with additional Gaussian resources, offering an all-optical route for fault-tolerant QIP in continuous-variable systems. Finally, we place these QND schemes into a more traditional context by highlighting analogies between the phase-mismatched optical parametric oscillator and multilevel atom-cavity QED systems, by showing how continuous monitoring of the outcoupled pump quadrature induces conditional localization of the intracavity signal mode onto squeezed photon-number states. Our analysis suggests that our proposal may be viable in near-term $\\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear nanophotonics, highlighting the rich potential of OPA as a universal tool for ultrafast non-Gaussian quantum state engineering and quantum computation.",

In particular, a linear ion chain naturally hosts long-range Ising interactions under the laser driving, which has been used for various phenomena such as quantum phase transition, localization, thermalization and information propagation. For near-term practical usage, a central task is to find more quantitative applications of the noisy quantum simulators that are robust to small errors in the parameters. Here we report the quantum simulation of a long-range transverse-field Ising model using up to 61 ions and probe the critical behavior of its quantum phase transition through the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By calibrating and verifying the coupling coefficients, we realize the same model for increasing ion numbers, so as to extract a critical exponent free of the finite size effect. For ferromagnetic interaction, our experimental result agrees well with the previous numerical predictions. As for the anti-ferromagnetic case, signals are too weak to fit a critical exponent due to the frustration in the interaction, but still consistent with the theory.",

    "abstract": "Simulation of continuous time evolution requires time discretization on both classical and quantum computers. A finer time step improves simulation precision, but it inevitably leads to increased computational efforts. This is particularly costly for today's noisy intermediate scale quantum computers, where notable gate imperfections limit the circuit depth that can be executed at a given accuracy. Classical adaptive solvers are well-developed to save numerical computation times. However, it remains an outstanding challenge to make optimal usage of the available quantum resources by means of adaptive time steps. Here, we introduce a quantum algorithm to solve this problem, providing a controlled solution of the quantum many-body dynamics of local observables. The key conceptual element of our algorithm is a feedback loop which self-corrects the simulation errors by adapting time steps, thereby significantly outperforming conventional Trotter schemes on a fundamental level and reducing the circuit depth. It even allows for a controlled asymptotic long-time error, where usual Trotterized dynamics is facing difficulties. Another key advantage of our quantum algorithm is that any desired conservation law can be included in the self-correcting feedback loop, which has potentially a wide range of applicability. We demonstrate the capabilities by enforcing gauge invariance which is crucial for a faithful and long-sought quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories. Our algorithm can be potentially useful on a more general level whenever time discretization is involved concerning, for instance, also numerical approaches based on time-evolving block decimation methods.",

We present a composable finite-size security proof against independently and identically distributed collective attacks for a general DM CV-QKD protocol. We introduce a new energy testing theorem to bound the effective dimension of Bob's system and rigorously prove security within Renner's epsilon-security framework and address the issue of acceptance sets in protocols and their security proof.

    "abstract": "Monitored many-body systems fall broadly into two dynamical phases, ``entangling'' or ``disentangling'', separated by a transition as a function of the rate at which measurements are made on the system. Producing an analytical theory of this measurement-induced transition is an outstanding challenge. Recent work made progress in the context of tree tensor networks, which can be related to all-to-all quantum circuit dynamics with forced (postselected) measurement outcomes. So far, however, there are no exact solutions for dynamics of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom (qubits) with ``real'' measurements, whose outcome probabilities are sampled according to the Born rule. Here we define dynamical processes for qubits, with real measurements, that have a tree-like spacetime interaction graph, either collapsing or expanding the system as a function of time. The former case yields an exactly solvable measurement transition. We explore these processes analytically and numerically, exploiting the recursive structure of the tree. We compare the case of ``real'' measurements with the case of ``forced'' measurements. Both cases show a transition at a nontrivial value of the measurement strength, with the real measurement case exhibiting a smaller entangling phase. Both exhibit exponential scaling of the entanglement near the transition, but they differ in the value of a critical exponent. An intriguing difference between the two cases is that the real measurement case lies at the boundary between two distinct types of critical scaling. On the basis of our results we propose a protocol for realizing a measurement phase transition experimentally via an expansion process.",

[1], whose gauge constraints project onto the subspace of the toric code with emergent fermions. Starting from the exact bosonization and applying Clifford finite-depth generalized local unitary (gLU) transformation, we can achieve all possible fermion-to-qubit mappings (up to the re-pairing of Majorana fermions). In particular, we discover a new super-compact encoding using 1.25 qubits per fermion on the square lattice, which is lower than any method in the literature. We prove the existence of fermion-to-qubit mappings with qubit-fermion ratios $r=1+ \\frac{1}{2k}$ for positive integers $k$, where the proof utilizes the trivialness of quantum cellular automata (QCA) in two spatial dimensions. When the ratio approaches 1, the fermion-to-qubit mapping reduces to the 1d Jordan-Wigner transformation along a certain path in the two-dimensional lattice. Finally, we explicitly demonstrate that the Bravyi-Kitaev superfast simulation, the Verstraete-Cirac auxiliary method, Kitaev's exactly solved model, the Majorana loop stabilizer codes, and the compact fermion-to-qubit mapping can all be obtained from the exact bosonization.",

While native interactions between trapped-ion spins are typically pairwise, many quantum algorithms and quantum spin models naturally feature couplings between triplets, quartets, or higher orders of spins. Here, we formulate and analyze a mechanism that extends the standard Mølmer-Sørensen pairwise entangling gate and generates a controllable and programmable coupling between N spins of trapped ions. We show that spin-dependent optical parametric drives applied at twice the motional frequency generate a coordinate transformation of the collective ion motion in phase space, rendering displacement forces that are nonlinear in the spin operators. We formulate a simple framework that enables a systematic and faithful construction of high-order spin Hamiltonians and gates, including the effect of multiple modes of motion, and characterize the performance of such operations under realistic conditions.1 MoreReceived 21 July 2022Accepted 8 June 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030311Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "The simulation of chemistry is among the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, most prior work exploring algorithms for block-encoding, time-evolving, and sampling in the eigenbasis of electronic structure Hamiltonians has either focused on modeling finite-sized systems, or has required a large number of plane wave basis functions. In this work, we extend methods for quantum simulation with Bloch orbitals constructed from symmetry-adapted atom-centered orbitals so that one can model periodic \\textit{ab initio} Hamiltonians using only a modest number of basis functions. We focus on adapting existing algorithms based on combining qubitization with tensor factorizations of the Coulomb operator. Significant modifications of those algorithms are required to obtain an asymptotic speedup leveraging translational (or, more broadly, Abelian) symmetries. We implement block encodings using known tensor factorizations and a new Bloch orbital form of tensor hypercontraction. Finally, we estimate the resources required to deploy our algorithms to classically challenging model materials relevant to the chemistry of Lithium Nickel Oxide battery cathodes within the surface code.",

By means of Hermitization, we reveal the unique characteristics of the singular-value statistics that distinguish them from the complex-eigenvalue statistics, and establish the comprehensive classification of the singular-value statistics for all the 38-fold symmetry classes of non-Hermitian random matrices. We also analytically derive the singular-value statistics of small random matrices, which well describe those of large random matrices in the similar spirit to the Wigner surmise. Furthermore, we demonstrate that singular values of open quantum many-body systems follow the random-matrix statistics, thereby identifying chaos and nonintegrability in open quantum systems.

    "abstract": "One of the most formidable challenges of scaling up quantum computers is that of control signal delivery. Today's small-scale quantum computers typically connect each qubit to one or more separate external signal sources. This approach is not scalable due to the I/O limitations of the qubit chip, necessitating the integration of control electronics. However, it is no small feat to shrink control electronics into a small package that is compatible with qubit chip fabrication and operation constraints without sacrificing performance. This so-called\"wiring challenge\"is likely to impact the development of more powerful quantum computers even in the near term. In this paper, we address the wiring challenge of trapped-ion quantum computers. We describe a control architecture called WISE (Wiring using Integrated Switching Electronics), which significantly reduces the I/O requirements of ion trap quantum computing chips without compromising performance. Our method relies on judiciously integrating simple switching electronics into the ion trap chip - in a way that is compatible with its fabrication and operation constraints - while complex electronics remain external. To demonstrate its power, we describe how the WISE architecture can be used to operate a fully connected 1000-qubit trapped ion quantum computer using ~ 200 signal sources at a speed of ~ 40 - 2600 quantum gate layers per second.",

    "abstract": "The challenge of preparing a system in a designated state spans diverse facets of quantum mechanics. To complete this task of steering quantum states, one can employ quantum control through a sequence of generalized measurements which direct the system towards the target state. In an active version of this protocol, the obtained measurement readouts are used to adjust the protocol on-the-go. This enables a sped-up performance relative to the passive version of the protocol, where no active adjustments are included. In this work, we consider such active measurement-driven steering as applied to the challenging case of many-body quantum systems. For helpful decision-making strategies, we offer Hilbert-space-orientation techniques, comparable to those used in navigation. The first one is to tie the active-decision protocol to the greedy accumulation of the cost function, such as the target state fidelity. We show the potential of a significant speedup, employing this greedy approach to a broad family of Matrix Product State targets. For system sizes considered here, an average value of the speedup factor $f$ across this family settles about $20$, for some targets even reaching a few thousands. We also identify a subclass of Matrix Product State targets, for which the value of $f$ increases with system size. In addition to the greedy approach, the second wayfinding technique is to map out the available measurement actions onto a Quantum State Machine. A decision-making protocol can be based on such a representation, using semiclassical heuristics. This State Machine-based approach can be applied to a more restricted set of targets, sometimes offering advantages over the cost function-based method. We give an example of a W-state preparation which is accelerated with this method by $f\\simeq3.5$, outperforming the greedy protocol for this target.",

In solid-state systems, its most common use is as an indicator of single-photon emission, a key property for quantum technology. Beyond an emitter's single-photon purity, however, photon correlation measurements can provide a wealth of information that can reveal details about its electronic structure and optical dynamics that are hidden by other spectroscopy techniques. This tutorial presents a standardized framework for using photon emission correlation spectroscopy to study quantum emitters, including discussion of theoretical background, considerations for data acquisition and statistical analysis, and interpretation. We highlight important nuances and best practices regarding the commonly-used $g^{(2)}(\\tau=0)<0.5$ test for single-photon emission. Finally, we illustrate how this experimental technique can be paired with optical dynamics simulations to formulate an electronic model for unknown quantum emitters, enabling the design of quantum control protocols and assessment of their suitability for quantum information science applications.",

The QDSRG is a classical polynomially-scaling downfolding method that avoids the evaluation of costly three- and higher-body reduced density matrices while retaining the accuracy of classical multireference many-body theories. We calibrate and test the QDSRG on several challenging chemical problems and propose a strategy for avoiding classical exponential-scaling steps in the QDSRG scheme. We report QDSRG computations of two chemical systems using the variational quantum eigensolver on IBM quantum devices: i) the dissociation curve of H$_2$ using a quintuple-$\\zeta$ basis and ii) the bicyclobutane isomerization reaction to $trans$-butadiene, demonstrating the reduction of problems that require several hundred qubits to a single qubit. Our work shows that the QDSRG is a viable approach to leverage near-term quantum devices for the accurate estimation of molecular properties.",

We show how this framework allows for quantitative predictions of the timescales required to prepare various metrologically useful states, and that these predictions remain accurate even for moderate system sizes, surprisingly far from the classical limit. Furthermore, this framework allows us to build a geometric picture that relates optimal (exponentially fast) entangled probe preparation to the existence of separatrices connecting saddle points in phase space. We illustrate our results with the paradigmatic examples of the two-axis counter-twisting and twisting-and-turning Hamiltonians, where we provide analytical expressions for all the relevant optimal time scales. Finally, we propose a generalization of these models to include $p$-body collective interaction (or $p$-order twisting), beyond the usual case of $p=2$. Using our geometric framework, we prove a no-go theorem for the local optimality of these models for $p>2$.",

With this parallelism, our scheme can solve the decoding throughput problem as the code scales up, even if the inner decoder is slow. When using min-weight perfect matching and union-find as the inner decoders, we observe circuit-level thresholds of $0.68\\%$ and $0.55\\%$, respectively, which are almost identical to $0.70\\%$ and $0.55\\%$ for the batch decoding.",

If the mechanical element contains isotopes that undergo nuclear decay, measuring the recoil of the sensor following the decay allows reconstruction of the total momentum of all emitted particles, including any neutral particles that may escape detection in traditional detectors. As an example, for weak nuclear decays the momentum of the emitted neutrino can be reconstructed on an event-by-event basis. We present the concept that a single nanometer-scale, optically levitated sensor operated with sensitivity near the standard quantum limit can search for heavy sterile neutrinos in the keV-MeV mass range with sensitivity significantly beyond existing constraints. We also comment on the possibility that mechanical sensors operated well into the quantum regime might ultimately reach the sensitivities required to provide an absolute measurement of the mass of the light neutrino states.",

Here, we quantitatively analyze the feasibility of high fidelity and high purity quantum state heralding using a free electron and a photonic integrated circuit with parametric coupling, and propose schemes to shape useful electron and photonic states in different application scenarios. Adopting a dissipative quantum electrodynamics treatment, we formulate a framework for the coupling of free electrons to waveguide spatial-temporal modes. To avoid multimode-coupling induced state decoherence, we show that with proper waveguide design, the interaction can be reduced to a single-mode coupling to a quasi-TM00 mode. In the single-mode coupling limit, we go beyond the conventional state ladder treatment, and show that the electron-photon energy correlations within the ladder subspace can still lead to a fundamental purity and fidelity limit on complex optical and electron state preparations through heralding schemes. We propose applications that use this underlying correlation to their advantage, but also show that the imposed limitations for general applications can be overcome by using photonic integrated circuits with an experimentally feasible interaction length, showing its promise as a platform for free-electron quantum optics.",

Open-loop control tasks have been successfully solved using optimization techniques, including methods like gradient-ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), relying on a differentiable model of the quantum dynamics. For feedback tasks, such methods are not directly applicable, since the aim is to discover strategies conditioned on measurement outcomes. In this work, we introduce feedback-GRAPE, which borrows some concepts from model-free reinforcement learning to incorporate the response to strong stochastic (discrete or continuous) measurements, while still performing direct gradient ascent through the quantum dynamics. We illustrate its power considering various scenarios based on cavity QED setups. Our method yields interpretable feedback strategies for state preparation and stabilization in the presence of noise. Our approach could be employed for discovering strategies in a wide range of feedback tasks, from calibration of multi-qubit devices to linear-optics quantum computation strategies, quantum-enhanced sensing with adaptive measurements, and quantum error correction.",

While the Er$^{3+}$ electron spin provides a spin-photon interface, ancilla nuclear spins could enable multi-qubit registers with longer storage times. In this work, we demonstrate coherent coupling between the electron spin of a single Er$^{3+}$ ion and a single $I=1/2$ nuclear spin in the solid-state host crystal, which is a fortuitously located proton ($^1$H). We control the nuclear spin using dynamical decoupling sequences applied to the electron spin, implementing one- and two-qubit gate operations. Crucially, the nuclear spin coherence time exceeds the electron coherence time by several orders of magnitude, because of its smaller magnetic moment. These results provide a path towards combining long-lived nuclear spin quantum registers with telecom-wavelength emitters for long-distance quantum repeaters.",

First, exploiting the recently derived covariance matrix criterion for the entanglement dimensionality [S. Liu et al., arXiv:2208.04909], we derive an inequality that resembles well-known entanglement criteria, but contains different bounds for the different dimensionalities of entanglement. This criterion is invariant under local changes of $su(d)$ bases and can be used to find regions in the space of moments of randomized correlations, generalizing the results of [S. Imai et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 150501 (2021)] to the case of entanglement-dimensionality detection. In particular, we find analytical boundary curves for the different entanglement dimensionalities in the space of second- and fourth-order moments of randomized correlations for all dimensions $d_a = d_b = d$ of a bipartite system. We then show how our method works in practice, also considering a finite statistical sample of correlations, and we also show that it can detect more states than other entanglement-dimensionality criteria available in the literature, thus providing a method that is both very powerful and potentially simpler in practical scenarios. We conclude by discussing the partly open problem of the implementation of our method in the multipartite scenario.",

    "abstract": "Random quantum circuits continue to inspire a wide range of applications in quantum information science and many-body quantum physics, while remaining analytically tractable through probabilistic methods. Motivated by an interest in deterministic circuits with similar applications, we construct classes of \\textit{nonrandom} unitary Clifford circuits by imposing translation invariance in both time and space. Further imposing dual-unitarity, our circuits effectively become crystalline spacetime lattices whose vertices are SWAP or iSWAP two-qubit gates and whose edges may contain one-qubit gates. One can then require invariance under (subgroups of) the crystal's point group. Working on the square and kagome lattices, we use the formalism of Clifford quantum cellular automata to describe operator spreading, entanglement generation, and recurrence times of these circuits. A full classification on the square lattice reveals, of particular interest, a\"nonfractal good scrambling class\"with dense operator spreading that generates codes with linear contiguous code distance and high performance under erasure errors at the end of the circuit. We also break unitarity by adding spacetime-translation-invariant measurements and find a class of such circuits with fractal dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Building error-corrected quantum computers relies crucially on measuring and modeling noise on candidate devices. In particular, optimal error correction requires knowing the noise that occurs in the device as it executes the circuits required for error correction. As devices increase in size we will become more reliant on efficient models of this noise. However, such models must still retain the information required to optimize the algorithms used for error correction. Here we propose a method of extracting detailed information of the noise in a device running syndrome extraction circuits. We introduce and execute an experiment on a superconducting device using 39 of its qubits in a surface code doing repeated rounds of syndrome extraction, but omitting the mid-circuit measurement and reset. We show how to extract from the 20 data qubits the information needed to build noise models of various sophistication in the form of graphical models. These models give efficient descriptions of noise in large-scale devices and are designed to illuminate the effectiveness of error correction against correlated noise. Our estimates are furthermore precise: we learn a consistent global distribution where all one- and two-qubit error rates are known to a relative error of 0.1%. By extrapolating our experimentally learned noise models towards lower error rates, we demonstrate that accurate correlated noise models are increasingly important for successfully predicting sub-threshold behavior in quantum error correction experiments.",

We first generalize the second law and identify the associated work and heat exchanges. After recovering known results from ideal work and heat sources, we analyze some consequences of hybrid work and heat sources. We illustrate our general laws with microscopic machines realizing thermodynamic tasks in which the roles of heat and work sources are simultaneously played by elementary quantum systems.

    "abstract": "The study of quantum many-body physics in Liouvillian open quantum systems becomes increasingly important with the recent progress in experimental control on dissipative systems and their technological exploitation . A central question in open quantum systems concerns the fate of quantum correlations, and the possibility of controlling them by engineering the competition between the Hamiltonian dynamics and the coupling to a bath. Such a question is challenging from a theoretical point of view, as numerical methods faithfully accounting for quantum correlations are either relying on exact diagonalization, limiting drastically the sizes that can be treated; or on approximations on the range or strength of quantum correlations, associated to the choice of a specific Ansatz for the density matrix. In this work we propose a new method to treat open quantum-spin lattices, based on stochastic quantum trajectories for the solution of the open-system dynamics. Along each trajectory, the hierarchy of equations of motion for many-point spin-spin correlators is truncated to a given finite order, assuming that multivariate $k$-th order cumulants vanish for $k$ exceeding a cutoff $k_c$. This allows tracking the evolution of quantum spin-spin correlations up to order $k_c$ for all length scales. We validate this approach in the paradigmatic case of the phase transitions of the dissipative 2D XYZ lattice, subject to spontaneous decay. We convincingly assess the existence of steady-state phase transitions from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic, and back to paramagnetic, upon increasing one of the Hamiltonian couplings; as well as their classical Ising nature. Moreover, the approach allows us to show the presence of significant quantum correlations in the vicinity of the dissipative critical point, and to unveil the presence of spin squeezing, a tight lower bound to the quantum Fisher information.",

While some entanglement criteria based on the singular values exist, a complete understanding of the geometry of admissible correlation matrices is lacking. We provide a deeper insight into the geometry of the singular values of the correlation matrices of limited Schmidt number. First, we provide a link to the framework of randomized measurements and show how to obtain knowledge about the singular values in this framework by constructing observables that yield the same moments as one obtains from orthogonal averages over the Bloch sphere. We then focus on the case of separable states and characterize the boundary of the set of the first two non-vanishing moments by giving explicit constructions for some of the faces and extremal points. These constructions yield a connection between the geometry of the correlation matrices and the existence problems of maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, as well as SIC-POVMs.",

    "abstract": "Quantum dynamics can be simulated on a quantum computer by exponentiating elementary terms from the Hamiltonian in a sequential manner. However, such an implementation of Trotter steps has gate complexity depending on the total Hamiltonian term number, comparing unfavorably to algorithms using more advanced techniques. We develop methods to perform faster Trotter steps with complexity sublinear in the number of terms. We achieve this for a class of Hamiltonians whose interaction strength decays with distance according to power law. Our methods include one based on a recursive block encoding and one based on an average-cost simulation, overcoming the normalization-factor barrier of these advanced quantum simulation techniques. We also realize faster Trotter steps when certain blocks of Hamiltonian coefficients have low rank. Combining with a tighter error analysis, we show that it suffices to use $\\left(\\eta^{1/3}n^{1/3}+\\frac{n^{2/3}}{\\eta^{2/3}}\\right)n^{1+o(1)}$ gates to simulate uniform electron gas with $n$ spin orbitals and $\\eta$ electrons in second quantization in real space, asymptotically improving over the best previous work. We obtain an analogous result when the external potential of nuclei is introduced under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We prove a circuit lower bound when the Hamiltonian coefficients take a continuum range of values, showing that generic $n$-qubit $2$-local Hamiltonians with commuting terms require at least $\\Omega(n^2)$ gates to evolve with accuracy $\\epsilon=\\Omega(1/poly(n))$ for time $t=\\Omega(\\epsilon)$. Our proof is based on a gate-efficient reduction from the approximate synthesis of diagonal unitaries within the Hamming weight-$2$ subspace, which may be of independent interest. Our result thus suggests the use of Hamiltonian structural properties as both necessary and sufficient to implement Trotter steps with lower gate complexity.",

However, analytic results to date rely on assumptions and arguments from complexity theory. Due to this, there is little intuition as to the source of the expressive power of quantum neural networks or for which classes of classical data any advantage can be reasonably expected to hold. Here, we study the relative expressive power between a broad class of neural network sequence models and a class of recurrent models based on Gaussian operations with non-Gaussian measurements. We explicitly show that quantum contextuality is the source of an unconditional memory separation in the expressivity of the two model classes. Additionally, as we are able to pinpoint quantum contextuality as the source of this separation, we use this intuition to study the relative performance of our introduced model on a standard translation data set exhibiting linguistic contextuality. In doing so, we demonstrate that our introduced quantum models are able to outperform state of the art classical models even in practice.",

In this configuration, chiral waveguide modes appear in the bulk region of the lattice, in direct analogy to transverse Hall currents in electronic systems. By evaluating the non-Markovian dynamics of emitters that are coupled to those modes, we identify critical coupling conditions, under which the shape of the spontaneously emitted photons becomes almost fully symmetric. Combined with a directional, dispersionless propagation, this property enables a complete reabsorption of the photon by another distant emitter, without relying on any time-dependent control. We show that this mechanism can be generalized to arbitrary in-plane synthetic potentials, thereby enabling flexible realizations of re-configurable networks of quantum emitters with arbitrary chiral connectivity.",

Moreover, we introduce a recipe that guarantees Fock basis states are mapped to computational basis states in qubit space, a desirable property for many applications in quantum computing. Based on this formalism, we introduce the Bonsai algorithm, which takes as input the potentially limited topology of the qubit connectivity of a quantum device and returns a tailored fermion-to-qubit mapping that reduces the SWAP overhead with respect to other paradigmatic mappings. We illustrate the algorithm by producing mappings for the heavy-hexagon topology widely used in IBM quantum computers. The resulting mappings have a favourable Pauli weight scaling $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ on this connectivity, while ensuring that no SWAP gates are necessary for single excitation operations.",

    "abstract": "Flexible characterization techniques that identify and quantify experimental imperfections under realistic assumptions are crucial for the development of quantum computers. Gate set tomography is a characterization approach that simultaneously and self-consistently extracts a tomographic description of the implementation of an entire set of quantum gates, as well as the initial state and measurement, from experimental data. Obtaining such a detailed picture of the experimental implementation is associated with high requirements on the number of sequences and their design, making gate set tomography a challenging task even for only two qubits. In this work, we show that low-rank approximations of gate sets can be obtained from significantly fewer gate sequences and that it is sufficient to draw them randomly. Such tomographic information is needed for the crucial task of dealing with coherent noise. To this end, we formulate the data processing problem of gate set tomography as a rank-constrained tensor completion problem. We provide an algorithm to solve this problem while respecting the usual positivity and normalization constraints of quantum mechanics by using second-order geometrical optimization methods on the complex Stiefel manifold. Besides the reduction in sequences, we demonstrate numerically that the algorithm does not rely on structured gate sets or an elaborate circuit design to robustly perform gate set tomography. Therefore, it is more flexible than traditional approaches. We also demonstrate how coherent errors in shadow estimation protocols can be mitigated using estimates from gate set tomography.",

We implement a cross-cavity pair-photon driven dissipation process, which conserves the photon number difference between cavities and stabilizes the state to a specific complex amplitude. We further introduce a technique of quantum subspace tomography, which enables direct measurements of individual coherence elements of a high-dimensional quantum state without global tomographic reconstruction. We characterize our two-mode quantum state with up to 4 photons in each cavity using this subspace tomography together with direct measurements of the photon number difference and the joint Wigner function. We identify the spurious cross-Kerr interaction between the cavities and our dissipative reservoir mode as a prominent dephasing channel that limits the steady-state coherence in our current scheme.

Group-IV color centers in diamond (SiV, GeV, and SnV) are promising candidates for this application, comprising an electronic spin with optical transitions coupled to a nuclear spin as the quantum register. However, the creation of a quantum register for these color centers with deterministic and strong coupling to the spin-photon interface remains challenging. Here, we make first-principles predictions of the hyperfine parameters of the group-IV color centers, which we verify experimentally with a comprehensive comparison between the spectra of spin active and spin neutral intrinsic dopant nuclei in single GeV and SnV emitters. In line with the theoretical predictions, detailed spectroscopy on large sample sizes reveals that hyperfine coupling causes a splitting of the optical transition of SnV an order of magnitude larger than the optical linewidth and provides a magnetic-field insensitive transition. This strong coupling provides access to a new regime for quantum registers in diamond color centers, opening avenues for novel spin-photon entanglement and quantum sensing schemes for these well-studied emitters.",

Through violation of an Einstein-Podolski-Rosen criterion by $988$ sigma, we show the presence of entanglement after the medium. Furthermore, we certify an entanglement dimensionality of $17$. This work paves the way towards manipulation and transport of entanglement through scattering media, with potential applications in quantum microscopy and quantum key distribution.",

    "abstract": "One-way nonreciprocal interactions between two quantum systems are typically described by a cascaded quantum master equation, and rely on an effective breaking of time-reversal symmetry as well as the balancing of coherent and dissipative interactions. Here, we present a new approach for obtaining nonreciprocal quantum interactions that is completely distinct from cascaded quantum systems, and that does not in general require broken TRS. Our method relies on a local gauge symmetry present in any Markovian Lindblad master equation. This new kind of quantum nonreciprocity has many implications, including a new mechanism for performing dissipatively-stabilized gate operations on a target quantum system. We also introduce a new, extremely general quantum-information based metric for quantifying quantum nonreciprocity.",

Genuinely quantum operations could outperform Swap for the task of permuting qubits within an architecture, which we call routing. We consider quantum routing in two models: (1) allowing arbitrary two-qubit unitaries, or (2) allowing Hamiltonians with norm-bounded interactions. We lower bound the circuit depth or time of quantum routing in terms of spectral properties of graphs representing the architecture interaction constraints, and give a generalized upper bound for all simple connected $n$-vertex graphs. In particular, we give conditions for a superpolynomial classical-quantum routing separation, which exclude graphs with a small spectral gap and graphs of bounded degree. Finally, we provide examples of a quadratic separation between gate-based and Hamiltonian routing models with a constant number of local ancillas per qubit and of an $\\Omega(n)$ speedup if we also allow fast local interactions.",

We demonstrate that if the intra- and inter-modular qubit connectivity can be viewed as corresponding to some classical or quantum LDPC codes, then their hypergraph product code fully respects the architectural connectivity constraints. Finally, we show that relaxed connectivity constraints that allow twists of connections between modules pave a way to construct codes with better parameters.",

Using circuits derived from the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), we accurately prepare the ground state of an $L=32$ critical, non-integrable perturbed Ising model and measure long-range correlations on the 10 qubit Quantinuum trapped ion computer. We introduce generalized MERA (gMERA) networks that interpolate between MERA and matrix product state networks and demonstrate that gMERA can capture far longer correlations than a MERA with the same number of qubits, at the expense of greater circuit depth.

    "abstract": "Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a key quantum algorithm, which has been widely studied as a method to perform chemistry and solid-state calculations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. Recently, several authors have proposed statistical alternatives to QPE that have benefits on early fault-tolerant devices, including shorter circuits and better suitability for error mitigation techniques. However, practical implementations of the algorithm on real quantum processors are lacking. In this paper we practically implement statistical phase estimation on Rigetti's superconducting processors. We specifically use the method of Lin and Tong [PRX Quantum 3, 010318 (2022)] using the improved Fourier approximation of Wan et al. [PRL 129, 030503 (2022)], and applying a variational compilation technique to reduce circuit depth. We then incorporate error mitigation strategies including zero-noise extrapolation and readout error mitigation with bit-flip averaging. We propose a simple method to estimate energies from the statistical phase estimation data, which is found to improve the accuracy in final energy estimates by one to two orders of magnitude with respect to prior theoretical bounds, reducing the cost to perform accurate phase estimation calculations. We apply these methods to chemistry problems for active spaces up to 4 electrons in 4 orbitals, including the application of a quantum embedding method, and use them to correctly estimate energies within chemical precision. Our work demonstrates that statistical phase estimation has a natural resilience to noise, particularly after mitigating coherent errors, and can achieve far higher accuracy than suggested by previous analysis, demonstrating its potential as a valuable quantum algorithm for early fault-tolerant devices.",

Some of the searches are approaching fundamental quantum limits on their sensitivity. This Perspective describes several approaches that use quantum engineering to circumvent these limits. Squeezing and single-photon counting can enhance searches for the axion-photon interaction. Optimization of quantum spin ensemble properties is needed to realize the full potential of spin-based searches for the electric-dipole-moment and the gradient interactions of axion dark matter.

By showing that the formalism of measurement frames offers a natural framework for shadow tomography -- in which ``classical shadows'' correspond to unbiased estimators derived from a suitable dual frame associated with the given measurement -- we highlight the intrinsic connection between standard state tomography and shadow tomography. Such perspective allows us to examine the interplay between measurements, reconstructed observables, and the estimators used to process measurement outcomes, while paving the way to assess the influence of the input state and the dimension of the underlying space on estimation errors. Our approach generalizes the method described in [H.-Y. Huang {\\it et al.}, Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)], whose results are recovered in the special case of covariant measurement frames. As an application, we demonstrate that a sought-after target of shadow tomography can be achieved for the entire class of tight rank-1 measurement frames -- namely, that it is possible to accurately estimate a finite set of generic rank-1 bounded observables while avoiding the growth of the number of the required samples with the state dimension.",

    "abstract": "Many quantum computing platforms are based on a two-dimensional physical layout. Here we explore a concept called looped pipelines which permits one to obtain many of the advantages of a 3D lattice while operating a strictly 2D device. The concept leverages qubit shuttling, a well-established feature in platforms like semiconductor spin qubits and trapped-ion qubits. The looped pipeline architecture has similar hardware requirements to other shuttling approaches, but can process a stack of qubit arrays instead of just one. Even a stack of limited height is enabling for diverse schemes ranging from NISQ-era error mitigation through to fault-tolerant codes. For the former, protocols involving multiple states can be implemented with a space-time resource cost comparable to preparing one noisy copy. For the latter, one can realise a far broader variety of code structures; as an example we consider layered 2D codes within which transversal CNOTs are available. Under reasonable assumptions this approach can reduce the space-time cost of magic state distillation by two orders of magnitude. Numerical modelling using experimentally-motivated noise models verifies that the architecture provides this benefit without significant reduction to the code's threshold.",

    "abstract": "Cavity QED with cooperativity far greater than unity enables high-fidelity quantum sensing and information processing. The high-cooperativity regime is often reached through the use of short, single-mode resonators. More complicated multimode resonators, such as the near-confocal optical Fabry-P\\'{e}rot cavity, can provide intracavity atomic imaging in addition to high cooperativity. This capability has recently proved important for exploring quantum many-body physics in the driven-dissipative setting. In this work, we show that a confocal cavity QED microscope can realize cooperativity in excess of 110. This cooperativity is on par with the very best single-mode cavities (which are far shorter) and 21$\\times$ greater than single-mode resonators of similar length and mirror radii. The 1.7-$\\mu$m imaging resolution is naturally identical to the photon-mediated interaction range. We measure these quantities by determining the threshold of cavity superradiance when small, optically tweezed Bose-Einstein condensates are pumped at various intracavity locations. Transmission measurements of an ex situ cavity corroborate these results. We provide a theoretical description that shows how cooperativity enhancement arises from the dispersive coupling to the atoms of many near-degenerate modes.",

Implementable with atomic and solid-state systems, these couplings lead to a plethora of phenomena that have been characterized in the context of cavity QED, where quantum emitters interact with localized bosonic modes. Here, we explore quadratic interactions in a waveguide QED setting, where quantum emitters interact with propagating fields confined in a one-dimensional environment. We develop a general scattering theory under the Markov approximation and discuss paradigmatic examples for spontaneous emission and scattering of biphoton states. Our analytical and semi-analytical results unveil fundamental differences with respect to conventional waveguide QED systems, such as the spontaneous emission of frequency-entangled photon pairs or the full transparency of the emitter to single-photon inputs. This unlocks new opportunities in quantum information processing with propagating photons. As a striking example, we show that a single quadratically-coupled emitter can implement a two-photon logic gate with unit fidelity, circumventing a no-go theorem derived for conventional waveguide-QED interactions.",

    "abstract": "The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is suggested as a promising application on early quantum computers. Here, a quantum-inspired classical algorithm, the mean-field Approximate Optimization Algorithm (mean-field AOA), is developed by replacing the quantum evolution of the QAOA with classical spin dynamics through the mean-field approximation. Due to the alternating structure of the QAOA, this classical dynamics can be found exactly for any number of QAOA layers. We benchmark its performance against the QAOA on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and the partition problem, and find that the mean-field AOA outperforms the QAOA in both cases for most instances. Our algorithm can thus serve as a tool to delineate optimization problems that can be solved classically from those that cannot, i.e. we believe that it will help to identify instances where a true quantum advantage can be expected from the QAOA. To quantify quantum fluctuations around the mean-field trajectories, we solve an effective scattering problem in time, which is characterized by a spectrum of time-dependent Lyapunov exponents. These provide an indicator for the hardness of a given optimization problem relative to the mean-field AOA.",

Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes can allow for several advantages including a transversal implementation of non-Clifford logical gates, single-shot decoding strategies, parallelized decoding in the case of fracton codes as well as construction of fractal lattice codes. Motivated by this, we tailor 3D topological codes for enhanced storage performance under biased Pauli noise. We present Clifford deformations of various 3D topological codes, such that they exhibit a threshold error rate of $50\\%$ under infinitely biased Pauli noise. Our examples include the 3D surface code on the cubic lattice, the 3D surface code on a checkerboard lattice that lends itself to a subsystem code with a single-shot decoder, the 3D color code, as well as fracton models such as the X-cube model, the Sierpinski model and the Haah code. We use the belief propagation with ordered statistics decoder (BP-OSD) to study threshold error rates at finite bias. We also present a rotated layout for the 3D surface code, which uses roughly half the number of physical qubits for the same code distance under appropriate boundary conditions. Imposing coprime periodic dimensions on this rotated layout leads to logical operators of weight $O(n)$ at infinite bias and a corresponding $\\exp[-O(n)]$ subthreshold scaling of the logical failure rate, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits in the code. Even though this scaling is unstable due to the existence of logical representations with $O(1)$ low-rate Pauli errors, the number of such representations scales only polynomially for the Clifford-deformed code, leading to an enhanced effective distance.",

We define the quantum preprocessing-optimized Fisher information, which determines the ultimate precision limit for quantum sensors under measurement noise, and conduct a thorough investigation into optimal preprocessing protocols. First, we formulate the preprocessing optimization problem as a biconvex optimization using the error observable formalism, based on which we prove that unitary controls are optimal for pure states and derive analytical solutions of the optimal controls in several practically relevant cases. Then we prove that for classically mixed states (whose eigenvalues encode the unknown parameter) under commuting-operator measurements, coarse-graining controls are optimal, while unitary controls are suboptimal in certain cases. Finally, we demonstrate that in multi-probe systems where noisy measurements act independently on each probe, the noiseless precision limit can be asymptotically recovered using global controls for a wide range of quantum states and measurements. Applications to noisy Ramsey interferometry and thermometry are presented, as well as explicit circuit constructions of optimal controls.",

    "abstract": "Proposals for large-scale semiconductor spin-based quantum computers require high-fidelity single-shot qubit readout to perform error correction and read out qubit registers at the end of a computation. However, as devices scale to larger qubit numbers integrating readout sensors into densely packed qubit chips is a critical challenge. Two promising approaches are minimising the footprint of the sensors, and extending the range of each sensor to read more qubits. Here we show high-fidelity single-shot electron spin readout using a nanoscale single-lead quantum dot (SLQD) sensor that is both compact and capable of reading multiple qubits. Our gate-based SLQD sensor is deployed in an all-epitaxial silicon donor spin qubit device, and we demonstrate single-shot readout of three $^{31}$P donor quantum dot electron spins with a maximum fidelity of 95%. Importantly in our device the quantum dot confinement potentials are provided inherently by the donors, removing the need for additional metallic confinement gates and resulting in strong capacitive interactions between sensor and donor quantum dots. We observe a $1/d^{1.4}$ scaling of the capacitive coupling between sensor and $^{31}$P dots (where $d$ is the sensor-dot distance), compared to $1/d^{2.5-3.0}$ in gate-defined quantum dot devices. Due to the small qubit size and strong capacitive interactions in all-epitaxial donor devices, we estimate a single sensor can achieve single-shot readout of approximately 15 qubits in a linear array, compared to 3-4 qubits for a similar sensor in a gate-defined quantum dot device. Our results highlight the potential for spin qubit devices with significantly reduced sensor densities.",

    "abstract": "The T center, a silicon-native spin-photon interface with telecommunication-band optical transitions and long-lived microwave qubits, offers an appealing new platform for both optical quantum memory and microwave-to-optical telecommunication-band transduction. A wide range of quantum memory and transduction schemes could be implemented withT center ensembles with sufficient optical depth, with advantages and disadvantages that depend sensitively on the ensemble properties. In this work we characterize T center spin ensembles to inform device design. We perform the first T ensemble optical depth measurement and calculate the improvement in center density or resonant optical enhancement required for efficient optical quantum memory. We further demonstrate a coherent microwave interface by coherent population trapping and Autler-Townes splitting. We then determine the most promising microwave and optical quantum memory protocol for such ensembles. By estimating the memory efficiency both in free space and in the presence of a cavity, we show that efficient optical memory is possible with reasonable optical density forecasts. Finally, we formulate a transduction proposal and discuss the achievable efficiency and fidelity.Received 13 September 2022Accepted 13 March 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.020308Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Strong ranged interactions can be generated via Rydberg dressing, which opens the path to explore the physics of few interacting particles. Rather than the unit cells of a crystal, the sites of the optical lattice can now be interpreted as discretized space. This allows studying completely new types of problems in a familiar architecture. We investigate the possibility of realizing problems akin to those found in quantum chemistry, although with a different scaling law in the interactions. Through numerical simulation, we show that simple pseudo-atoms and -molecules could be prepared with high fidelity in state-of-the-art experiments.",

In an experiment designed to mimic a real axion search, we employ a quantum-enhanced sensing technique to detect a synthetic axion-like microwave tone at an unknown frequency weakly coupled to a resonator, demonstrating a factor of 5.6 acceleration relative to a quantum-limited search for the same tone. The acceleration comes from increases to both the visibility bandwidth and the peak visibility of a detector. This speedup is achieved by dynamically coupling the resonator mode to a second (readout) mode with balanced swapping and two-mode squeezing interactions. A small fractional imbalance between the two interaction rates yields further scan rate enhancement and we demonstrate that an 8-fold acceleration can be achieved.",

Starting from an $ab\\,initio$ modelling of the experimental setting, we systematically carry out a derivation of the target U$(1)$ gauge theory. This approach allows us to identify and address conceptual and practical challenges for the implementation of lattice gauge theories that - while pivotal for a successful implementation - have never been rigorously addressed in the literature: those include the specific engineering of lattice potentials to achieve the desired structure of Wannier functions, and the subtleties involved in realizing the proper separation of energy scales to enable gauge-invariant dynamics. We discuss realistic experiments that can be carried out within such a platform using the fermionic isotope $^{173}$Yb, addressing via simulations all key sources of imperfections, and provide concrete parameter estimates for relevant energy scales in both one- and two-dimensional settings.",

To that end, we present a family of error-detectable two-qubit gates for a variety of bosonic encodings. From a new geometric framework based on a\"Bloch sphere\"of bosonic operators, we construct $ZZ_L(\\theta)$ and $\\text{eSWAP}(\\theta)$ gates for the binomial, 4-legged cat, dual-rail and several other bosonic codes. The gate Hamiltonian is simple to engineer, requiring only a programmable beamsplitter between two bosonic qubits and an ancilla dispersively coupled to one qubit. This Hamiltonian can be realized in circuit QED hardware with ancilla transmons and microwave cavities. The proposed theoretical framework was developed for circuit QED but is generalizable to any platform that can effectively generate this Hamiltonian. Crucially, one can also detect first-order errors in the ancilla and the bosonic qubits during the gates. We show that this allows one to reach error-detected gate fidelities at the $10^{-4}$ level with today's hardware, limited only by second-order hardware errors.",

    "abstract": "Quantum simulation is one of the most promising scientific applications of quantum computers. Due to decoherence and noise in current devices, it is however challenging to perform digital quantum simulation in a regime that is intractable with classical computers. In this work, we propose an experimental protocol for probing dynamics and equilibrium properties on near-term digital quantum computers. As a key ingredient of our work, we show that it is possible to study thermalization even with a relatively coarse Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution of interest. Even though the step size is too large to permit a rigorous bound on the Trotter error, we observe that the system prethermalizes in accordance with previous results for Floquet systems. The dynamics closely resemble the thermalization of the model underlying the Trotterization up to long times. We extend the reach of our approach by developing an error mitigation scheme based on measurement and rescaling of survival probabilities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the entire protocol, we apply it to the two-dimensional XY model and numerically verify its performance with realistic noise parameters for superconducting quantum devices. Our proposal thus provides a route to achieving quantum advantage for relevant problems in condensed matter physics.",

We introduce a quantum repeater protocol to efficiently distribute three-qubit W states over arbitrary distances in a two-dimensional triangular quantum network with polylogarithmic overhead, thereby enabling these applications between remote parties. The repeater protocol combines two ingredients that we establish: probabilistic entanglement swapping with three copies of three-qubit W states to a single long-distance three-qubit W state, and an improved entanglement purification protocol. The latter not only shows a better performance, but also an enlarged purification regime as compared to previous approaches. We show that the repeater protocol allows one to deal with errors resulting from imperfect channels or state preparation, and noisy operations, and we analyze error thresholds, achievable fidelities, and overheads.Received 2 May 2023Revised 8 September 2023Accepted 4 October 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.040323Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The Andreev bound states of high transparency Josephson junctions can act as low-energy traps for QPs, providing a mechanism for studying the dynamics and properties of both the QPs and the junction. We study the trapping and clearing of QPs from the Andreev bound states of epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions incorporated in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) galvanically shorting a superconducting resonator to ground. We use a neighboring voltage-biased Josephson junction to inject QPs into the circuit. Upon the injection of QPs, we show that we can trap and clear QPs when the SQUID is flux-biased. We examine effects of the microwave loss associated with bulk QP transport in the resonator, QP-related dissipation in the junction, and QP poisoning events. By monitoring the QP trapping and clearing in time, we study the dynamics of these processes and find a time-scale of few microseconds that is consistent with electron-phonon relaxation in our system and correlated QP trapping and clearing mechanisms. Our results highlight the QP trapping and clearing dynamics as well as the associated time-scales in high transparency Josephson junctions based fabricated on Al-InAs heterostructures.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the Hamiltonian of a quantum system is an essential task for characterizing and certifying quantum processors and simulators. Existing techniques either rely on projective measurements of the system before and after coherent time evolution and do not explicitly reconstruct the full time-dependent Hamiltonian or interrupt evolution for tomography. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that an a priori unknown, time-dependent Hamiltonian can be reconstructed from continuous weak measurements concurrent with coherent time evolution in a system of two superconducting transmons coupled by a flux-tunable coupler. In contrast to previous work, our technique does not require interruptions, which would distort the recovered Hamiltonian. We introduce an algorithm which recovers the Hamiltonian and density matrix from an incomplete set of continuous measurements and demonstrate that it reliably extracts amplitudes of a variety of single qubit and entangling two qubit Hamiltonians. We further demonstrate how this technique reveals deviations from a theoretical control Hamiltonian which would otherwise be missed by conventional techniques. Our work opens up novel applications for continuous weak measurements, such as studying non-idealities in gates, certifying analog quantum simulators, and performing quantum metrology.",

In this work, we analyze such effects in many-body systems by studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of weakly monitored quantum circuits, focusing on entanglement generation and information spreading. We find that, due to measurements, the entanglement dynamics in monitored circuits is indeed\"faster\"than that of unitary ones in several ways. Specifically, we find that a pair of well-separated regions can become entangled in a time scale $\\ell^{2/3}$, sub-linear in their distance $\\ell$. For the case of Clifford monitored circuits, this originates from super-ballistically growing stabilizer generators of the evolving state. In addition, we find initially local information can spread super-ballistically as $t^{3/2}$. Furthermore, by viewing the dynamics as a dynamical encoding process, we show that the super-ballistic growing length scale relates to an encoding time that is sublinear in system size. To quantify the information dynamics, we develop a formalism generalizing operator spreading to non-unitary dynamics, which is of independent interest.",

TDNs were introduced recently for the purpose of describing fracton topological phases of matter using the framework of defect TQFT. Their effectiveness has been demonstrated through numerous examples, yet a systematic construction was lacking. Here we solve this problem by formulating a method to construct TDNs for a wide range of lattice Hamiltonians. Our method takes a lattice Hamiltonian as input, applies an ungauging procedure, then creates a refined lattice within each unit cell, followed by regauging the system to produce a TDN as output. For topological Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) Pauli stabilizer models, this procedure is guaranteed to produce a phase equivalent TDN. This provides TDN representations of canonical fracton models for which no such construction was previously known, including Haah's cubic code and Yoshida's infinite family of fractal spin liquid models. We demonstrate the applicability of our method beyond CSS stabilizer models by constructing TDNs for non-CSS models including Chamon's model and the semionic X-cube model.",

    "abstract": "Bosonic cat qubits stabilized with a driven two-photon dissipation are systems with exponentially biased noise, opening the door to low-overhead, fault-tolerant and universal quantum computing. However, current gate proposals for such qubits induce substantial noise of the unprotected type, whose poor scaling with the relevant experimental parameters limits their practical use. In this work, we provide a new perspective on dissipative cat qubits by reconsidering the reservoir mode used to engineer the tailored two-photon dissipation, and show how it can be leveraged to mitigate gate-induced errors. Doing so, we introduce four new designs of high-fidelity and bias-preserving cat qubit gates, and compare them to the prevalent gate methods. These four designs should give a broad overview of gate engineering for dissipative systems with different and complementary ideas. In particular, we propose both already achievable low-error gate designs and longer-term implementations.",

XOR oblivious transfer (XOT) is a variant where the sender Alice has two bits, and a receiver Bob obtains either the first bit, the second bit, or their XOR. Bob should not learn anything more than this, and Alice should not learn what Bob has learnt. Perfect quantum OT with information-theoretic security is known to be impossible. We determine the smallest possible cheating probabilities for unrestricted dishonest parties in non-interactive quantum XOT protocols using symmetric pure states, and present an optimal protocol, which outperforms classical protocols. We also\"reverse\"this protocol, so that Bob becomes sender of a quantum state and Alice the receiver who measures it, while still implementing oblivious transfer from Alice to Bob. Cheating probabilities for both parties stay the same as for the unreversed protocol. We optically implemented both the unreversed and the reversed protocols, and cheating strategies, noting that the reversed protocol is easier to implement.",

We develop efficient maximum-likelihood decoders for and analyze the performance of three different concatenations of codes taken from the following set: qubit stabilizer codes, analog/Gaussian stabilizer codes, GKP codes, and GKP-stabilizer codes. We benchmark decoder performance against additive Gaussian white noise, corroborating our numerics with analytical calculations. We observe that the concatenation involving GKP-stabilizer codes outperforms the more conventional concatenation of a qubit stabilizer code with a GKP code in some cases. We also propose a GKP-stabilizer code that suppresses fluctuations in both conjugate variables without extra quadrature squeezing, and formulate qudit versions of GKP-stabilizer codes.",

In several control schemes, the excited level serves as an auxiliary state for implementing gate operations between the lower qubit states. However, extra excited levels give rise to unwanted transitions that cause leakage and other errors, degrading the gate fidelity. We focus on a coherent-population-trapping scheme for gates and design protocols that reduce the effects of the unwanted off-resonant couplings and improve the gate performance up to several orders of magnitude. For a particular setup of unwanted couplings, we find an exact solution, which leads to error-free gate operations via only a static detuning modification. In the general case, we improve gate operations by adding corrective modulations to the pulses, thereby generalizing the DRAG protocol to Lambda systems. Our techniques enable fast and high-fidelity gates and apply to a wide range of optically driven platforms, such as quantum dots, color centers, and trapped ions.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of quantum many-body systems is manifested in the vast diversity of their correlations, making it challenging to distinguish the generic from the atypical features. This can be addressed by analyzing correlations through ensembles of random states, chosen to faithfully embody the relevant physical properties. Here, we focus on spins with local interactions, whose correlations are extremely well captured by tensor network states. Adopting an operational perspective, we define ensembles of random tensor network states in one and two spatial dimensions that admit a sequential generation. As such, they directly correspond to outputs of quantum circuits with a sequential architecture and random gates. In one spatial dimension, the ensemble explores the entire family of matrix product states, while in two spatial dimensions, it corresponds to random isometric tensor network states. We extract the scaling behavior of the average correlations between two subsystems as a function of their distance. Using elementary concentration results, we then deduce the typical case for measures of correlation such as the von Neumann mutual information and a measure arising from the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We find for all considered cases that the typical behavior is an exponential decay (for both one and two spatial dimensions). We observe the consistent emergence of a correlation length that depends only on the underlying spatial dimension and not the considered measure. Remarkably, increasing the bond dimension leads to a higher correlation length in one spatial dimension but has the opposite effect in two spatial dimensions.",

    "abstract": "This work explores the possibility of creating and controlling unconventional nonlinearities by periodic driving, in a broad class of systems described by the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE). By means of a parent quantum many-body description, we demonstrate that such driven systems are well captured by an effective NLSE with emergent nonlinearities, which can be finely controlled by tuning the driving sequence. We first consider a general class of two-mode nonlinear systems - relevant to optical Kerr cavities, waveguides and Bose-Einstein condensates - where we find an emergent four-wave mixing nonlinearity, which originates from pair-hopping processes in the parent quantum picture. Tuning this drive-induced nonlinearity is shown to modify the phase-space topology, which can be detected through relative population and phase measurements. We then couple individual (two-mode) dimers in view of designing extended lattice models with unconventional nonlinearities and controllable pair-hopping processes. Following this general dimerization construction, we obtain an effective lattice model with drive-induced interactions, whose ground-state exhibits orbital order, chiral currents and emergent magnetic fluxes through the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry. We analyze these intriguing properties both in the weakly-interacting (mean-field) regime, captured by the effective NLSE, and in the strongly-correlated quantum regime. Our general approach opens a route for the engineering of unconventional optical nonlinearities in photonic devices and controllable drive-induced interactions in ultracold quantum matter.",

    "abstract": "We study the generation of two-qudit entangling quantum logic gates using two techniques in quantum optimal control. We take advantage of both continuous, Lie-algebraic control and digital, Lie-group control. In both cases, the key is access to a time-dependent Hamiltonian which can generate an arbitrary unitary matrix in the group SU($d^2$). We find efficient protocols for creating high-fidelity entangling gates. As a test of our theory, we study the case of qudits robustly encoded in nuclear spins of alkaline earth atoms and manipulated with magnetic and optical fields, with entangling interactions arising from the well-known Rydberg blockade. We applied this in a case study based on a $d=10$ dimensional qudit encoded in the $I=9/2$ nuclear spin in $^{87}$Sr, controlled through a combination of nuclear spin-resonance, a tensor AC-Stark shift, and Rydberg dressing, which allows us to generate an arbitrary symmetric entangling two-qudit gate such as CPhase. Our techniques can be used to implement qudit entangling gates for any $2\\le d \\le10$ encoded in the nuclear spin. We also studied how decoherence due to the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states affects the creation of the CPhase gate and found, through numerical optimization, a fidelity of $0.9985$, $0.9980$, $0.9942$, and $0.9800$ for $d=2$, $d=3$, $d=5$, and $d=7$ respectively. This provides a powerful platform to explore the various applications of quantum information processing of qudits including metrological enhancement with qudits, quantum simulation, universal quantum computation, and quantum error correction.",

In contrast, the one-dimensional model displays a strong form of localization characterized by the emergence of left and right-blocking walls in random locations. We provide additional insights by complementing our analytical results with numerical simulations of operator spreading and entanglement growth, which show the absence (presence) of localization in two-dimension (one-dimension). Furthermore, we unveil that the spectral form factor of the Floquet unitary in two-dimensional circuits behaves like that of quasi-free fermions with chaotic single particle dynamics, with an exponential ramp that persists till times scaling linearly with the size of the system. Our work sheds light on the nature of disordered, Floquet Clifford dynamics and its relationship to fully chaotic quantum dynamics.",

Our approach is built on the notion of memory-assisted Markovian thermal processes, where memoryless thermodynamic processes are promoted to non-Markovianity by explicitly modelling ancillary memory systems initialised in thermal equilibrium states. Within this setting, we propose a family of protocols composed of sequences of elementary two-level thermalisations that approximate all transitions between energy-incoherent states accessible via thermal operations. We prove that, as the size of the memory increases, these approximations become arbitrarily good for all transitions in the infinite temperature limit, and for a subset of transitions in the finite temperature regime. Furthermore, we present solid numerical evidence for the convergence of our protocol to any transition at finite temperatures. We also explain how our framework can be used to quantify the role played by memory effects in thermodynamic protocols such as work extraction. Finally, our results show that elementary control over two energy levels at a given time is sufficient to generate all energy-incoherent transitions accessible via thermal operations if one allows for ancillary thermal systems.",

These variational quantum circuits can suffer from the well-known curse of barren plateaus, which is characterized by an exponential vanishing of the cost-function gradient with the system size, making training unfeasible for practical applications. Since a generic quantum circuit cannot be simulated efficiently, the determination of its trainability is an important problem. Here we find an efficient method to compute the gradient of the cost function and its variance for a wide class of variational quantum circuits. Our scheme relies on our proof of an exact mapping from randomly initialized circuits to a set of Clifford circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer by virtue of the celebrated Gottesmann-Knill theorem. This method is scalable and can be used to certify trainability for variational quantum circuits and explore design strategies that can overcome the barren plateau problem.

In this paper, we give complexity-theoretic evidence that the central task of TDA -- estimating Betti numbers -- is intractable even for quantum computers. Specifically, we prove that the problem of computing Betti numbers exactly is #P-hard, while the problem of approximating Betti numbers up to multiplicative error is NP-hard. Moreover, both problems retain their hardness if restricted to the regime where quantum algorithms for TDA perform best. Because quantum computers are not expected to solve #P-hard or NP-hard problems in subexponential time, our results imply that quantum algorithms for TDA offer only a polynomial advantage in the worst case. We support our claim by showing that the seminal quantum algorithm for TDA developed by Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi achieves a quadratic speedup over the best known classical approach in asymptotically almost all cases. Finally, we argue that an exponential quantum advantage can be recovered if the input data is given as a specification of simplices rather than as a list of vertices and edges.",

    "abstract": "Open quantum systems are ubiquitous in the physical sciences, with widespread applications in the areas of chemistry, condensed matter physics, material science, optics, and many more. Not surprisingly, there is significant interest in their efficient simulation. However, direct classical simulation quickly becomes intractable with coupling to an environment whose effective dimension grows exponentially. This raises the question: can quantum computers help model these complex dynamics? A first step in answering this question requires understanding the computational complexity of this task. Here, we map the temporal complexity of a process to the spatial complexity of a many-body state using a computational model known as the process tensor framework. With this, we are able to explore the simulation complexity of an open quantum system as a dynamic sampling problem: a system coupled to an environment can be probed at successive points in time -- accessing multi-time correlations. The complexity of multi-time sampling, which is an important and interesting problem in its own right, contains the complexity of master equations and stochastic maps as a special case. Our results show how the complexity of the underlying quantum stochastic process corresponds to the complexity of the associated family of master equations for the dynamics. We present both analytical and numerical examples whose multi-time sampling is as complex as sampling from a many-body state that is classically hard. This also implies that the corresponding family of master equations are classically hard. Our results pave the way for studying open quantum systems from a complexity-theoretic perspective, highlighting the role quantum computers will play in our understanding of quantum dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Tunable couplers have recently become one of the most powerful tools for implementing two-qubit gates between superconducting qubits. A tunable coupler typically includes a nonlinear element, such as a SQUID, which is used to tune the resonance frequency of an LC circuit connecting two qubits. Here we propose a complimentary approach where instead of tuning the resonance frequency of the tunable coupler by applying a quasistatic control signal, we excite by microwave the degree of freedom associated with the coupler itself. Due to strong effective longitudinal coupling between the coupler and the qubits, the frequency of this transition strongly depends on the computational state, leading to different phase accumulations in different states. Using this method, we experimentally demonstrate a CZ gate of 44 ns duration on a fluxonium-based quantum processor, obtaining a fidelity of $97.6\\pm 0.4 \\%$ characterized by cross-entropy benchmarking.",

To determine the size of these parameters, we perform numerical simulations of small PO instances, which lead to concrete resource estimates for the PO use case. Our numerical results do not probe large enough instance sizes to make conclusive statements about the asymptotic scaling of the algorithm.

The algorithm builds on the recently-proposed\"space-evolving block decimation\"(SEBD) and extends it to the case of noisy circuits. SEBD is based on a mapping of 2D unitary circuits to 1D {\\it monitored} ones, which feature measurements alongside unitary gates; it exploits the presence of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition to achieve efficient (approximate) sampling below a finite critical depth $T_c$. Our noisy-SEBD algorithm unravels the action of noise into measurements, further lowering entanglement and enabling efficient classical sampling up to larger circuit depths. We analyze a class of physically-relevant noise models (unital qubit channels) within a two-replica statistical mechanics treatment, finding weak measurements to be the optimal (i.e. most disentangling) unraveling. We then locate the noisy-SEBD complexity transition as a function of circuit depth and noise strength in realistic circuit models. As an illustrative example, we show that circuits on heavy-hexagon qubit arrays with noise rates of $\\approx 2\\%$ per CNOT, based on IBM Quantum processors, can be efficiently sampled up to a depth of 5 iSWAP (or 10 CNOT) gate layers. Our results help sharpen the requirements for practical hardness of simulation of noisy hardware.",

    "abstract": "Achievability in information theory refers to demonstrating a coding strategy that accomplishes a prescribed performance benchmark for the underlying task. In quantum information theory, the crafted Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality is an essential technique in proving a wealth of one-shot achievability bounds since it effectively resembles a union bound in various problems. In this work, we show that the pretty-good measurement naturally plays a role as the union bound as well. A judicious application of it considerably simplifies the derivation of one-shot achievability for classical-quantum (c-q) channel coding via an elegant three-line proof. The proposed analysis enjoys the following favorable features. (i) The established one-shot bound admits a closed-form expression as in the celebrated Holevo-Helstrom Theorem. Namely, the error probability of sending $M$ messages through a c-q channel is upper bounded by the minimum error of distinguishing the joint channel input-output state against $(M-1)$ decoupled products states. (ii) Our bound directly yields asymptotic results in the large deviation, small deviation, and moderate deviation regimes in a unified manner. (iii) The coefficients incurred in applying the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality are no longer needed. Hence, the derived one-shot bound sharpens existing results relying on the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality. In particular, we obtain the tightest achievable $\\epsilon$-one-shot capacity for c-q channel coding heretofore, improving the third-order coding rate in the asymptotic scenario. (iv) Our result holds for infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. (v) The proposed method applies to deriving one-shot achievability for classical data compression with quantum side information, entanglement-assisted classical communication over quantum channels, and various quantum network information-processing protocols.",

We have also found a complete and unique construction method of symmetric Clifford groups with simple quantum gates for Pauli symmetries. For the overall understanding, we have also considered physically relevant U(1) and SU(2) symmetry constraints, which cannot be described by a Pauli subgroup, and have proven that the symmetric Clifford group is a symmetric unitary 1-design but not a 2-design under those symmetries. Our findings are numerically verified by computing the frame potentials, which measure the difference in randomness between the uniform ensemble on the symmetric group of interest and the symmetric unitary group.

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction (QEC) plays an essential role in fault-tolerantly realizing quantum algorithms of practical interest. Among different approaches to QEC, encoding logical quantum information in harmonic oscillator modes has been shown to be promising and hardware efficient. In this work, we study multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, encoding a qubit in many oscillators, through a lattice perspective. In particular, we implement a closest point decoding strategy for correcting random Gaussian shift errors. For decoding a generic multimode GKP code, we first identify its corresponding lattice followed by finding the closest lattice point in its symplectic dual lattice to a candidate shift error compatible with the error syndrome. We use this method to characterize the error correction capabilities of several known multimode GKP codes, including their code distances and fidelities. We also perform numerical optimization of multimode GKP codes up to ten modes and find three instances (with three, seven and nine modes) with better code distances and fidelities compared to the known GKP codes with the same number of modes. While exact closest point decoding incurs exponential time cost in the number of modes for general unstructured GKP codes, we give several examples of structured GKP codes (i.e., of the repetition-rectangular GKP code types) where the closest point decoding can be performed exactly in linear time. For the surface-GKP code, we show that the closest point decoding can be performed exactly in polynomial time with the help of a minimum-weight-perfect-matching algorithm (MWPM). We show that this MWPM closest point decoder improves both the fidelity and the noise threshold of the surface-GKP code to 0.602 compared to the previously studied MWPM decoder assisted by log-likelihood analog information which yields a noise threshold of 0.599.",

    "abstract": "The security of prepare-and-measure satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD), under restricted eavesdropping scenarios, is addressed. We particularly consider cases where the eavesdropper, Eve, has limited access to the transmitted signal by Alice, and/or Bob's receiver station. This restriction is modeled by lossy channels between Alice/Bob and Eve, where the transmissivity of such channels can, in principle, be bounded by monitoring techniques. An artefact of such lossy channels is the possibility of having {\\it bypass} channels, those which are not accessible to Eve, but may not necessarily be characterized by the users either. This creates interesting, unexplored, scenarios for analyzing QKD security. In this paper, we obtain generic bounds on the key rate in the presence of bypass channels and apply them to continuous-variable QKD protocols with Gaussian encoding with direct and reverse reconciliation. We find regimes of operation in which the above restrictions on Eve can considerably improve system performance. We also develop customised bounds for several protocols in the BB84 family and show that, in certain regimes, even the simple protocol of BB84 with weak coherent pulses is able to offer positive key rates at high channel losses, which would otherwise be impossible under an unrestricted Eve. In this case the limitation on Eve would allow Alice to send signals with larger intensities than the optimal value under an ideal Eve, which effectively reduces the effective channel loss. In all these cases, the part of the transmitted signal that does not reach Eve can play a non-trivial role in specifying the achievable key rate. Our work opens up new security frameworks for spaceborne quantum communications systems.",

We find that some families of scars are completely insensitive to certain perturbations. In some other cases they are stable to the first order in perturbation theory. Our analytical results apply to a large class of Hamiltonians that are known [arXiv:2106.10300] to support exact many-body scars. For the numerical calculations we choose the deformed $t-J-U$ model that includes both Heisenberg and Hubbard interactions. We propose two new stability measures that are based on physical observables rather than the fidelity to the exact initial wavefunction. They enable the experimental detection of scars and are more reliable from the theoretical and numerical perspectives. One of these measures may potentially find applications in other systems where the exact many-body scars are equally spaced in energy. In small systems and at small perturbations, a regime particularly relevant for quantum simulators, we identify and describe an additional stability exhibited by the many-body scars. For larger perturbation strengths we observe a distinct mode of ergodicity breaking that is consistent with many-body localization.",

By utilising a cold-engineered reservoir we break the symmetry of reciprocity in a standard two-mode squeezing interaction between a low- and a high-frequency mode, and show that the rerouting of thermal fluctuations allows the generation of flying entangled states with high purity.

It is thus natural to move beyond Bell's paradigmatic scenario and consider different causal structures. For the specific case of three observable variables, it is known that there are three non-trivial causal networks. Two of those, are known to give rise to quantum non-classicality: the instrumental and the triangle scenarios. Here we analyze the third and remaining one, which we name the Evans scenario, akin to the causal structure underlying the entanglement-swapping experiment. We prove a number of results about this elusive scenario and introduce new and efficient computational tools for its analysis that also can be adapted to deal with more general causal structures. We do not solve its main open problem -- whether quantum non-classical correlations can arise from it -- but give a significant step in this direction by proving that post-quantum correlations, analogous to the paradigmatic Popescu-Rohrlich box, do violate the constraints imposed by a classical description of Evans causal structure.",

All the same, our result for the dynamical exponent is tight, in that we prove by counterexample that there cannot exist any Lieb-Robinson bound with a smaller exponent.

    "abstract": "As previously demonstrated, the entropy production -- a key quantity characterizing the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes -- is related to generation of correlations between degrees of freedom of the system and its thermal environment. This raises the question of whether such correlations are of a classical or quantum nature, namely, whether they are accessible through local measurements on the correlated degrees of freedom. We address this problem by considering fermionic and bosonic Gaussian systems. We show that for fermions the entropy production is mostly quantum due to the parity superselection rule which restricts the set of physically allowed measurements to projections on the Fock states, thus significantly limiting the amount of classically accessible correlations. In contrast, in bosonic systems a much larger amount of correlations can be accessed through Gaussian measurements. Specifically, while the quantum contribution may be important at low temperatures, in the high temperature limit the entropy production corresponds to purely classical position-momentum correlations. Our results demonstrate an important difference between fermionic and bosonic systems regarding the existence of a quantum-to-classical transition in the microscopic formulation of the entropy production. They also show that entropy production can be mainly caused by quantum correlations even in the weak coupling limit, which admits a description in terms of classical rate equations for state populations, as well as in the low particle density limit, where the transport properties of both bosons and fermions converge to those of classical particles.",

In this work, we widen the choice of ancilla codes by unifying Shor and Steane measurements into a single framework, called homomorphic measurements. For any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code with the appropriate ancilla code, one can avoid repetitive measurements or complicated ancilla state preparation procedures such as distillation, which overcomes the difficulties of both Shor and Steane methods.

This is of fundamental interest in understanding the dynamics of many-body systems, as well as in efficiently producing entangled resource states and error-correcting codes. In this work, we identify a dynamical transition marking the onset of scrambling in quantum circuits with different levels of long-range connectivity. In particular, we show that as a function of the interaction range for circuits of different structures, the tripartite mutual information exhibits a scaling collapse around a critical point between two clearly defined regimes of different dynamical behaviour. We study this transition analytically in a related long-range Brownian circuit model and show how the transition can be mapped onto the statistical mechanics of a long-range Ising model in a particular region of parameter space. This mapping predicts mean-field critical exponents $\\nu = -1/(1+s_c)$, which are consistent with the critical exponents extracted from Clifford circuit numerics. In addition to systems with conventional power-law interactions, we identify the same phenomenon in deterministic, sparse circuits that can be realised in experiments with neutral atom arrays.",

In particular, engineering entanglement within a dense spin ensemble can turn it into a robust quantum memory or a computational platform. Recent experimental progress in dense central spin systems motivates the design of algorithms that use a central-spin qubit as a convenient proxy for the ensemble. Here we propose a protocol that uses a central spin to initialize two dense spin ensembles into a pure anti-polarized state and from there creates a many-body entangled state -- a singlet -- from the combined ensemble. We quantify the protocol performance for multiple material platforms and show that it can be implemented even in the presence of realistic levels of decoherence. Our protocol introduces an algorithmic approach to preparation of a known many-body state and to entanglement engineering in a dense spin ensemble, which can be extended towards a broad class of collective quantum states.",

    "abstract": "Coulomb crystals of cold trapped ions are a leading platform for the realisation of quantum processors and quantum simulations and, in quantum metrology, for the construction of optical atomic clocks and for fundamental tests of the Standard Model. For these applications, it is not only essential to cool the ion crystal in all its degrees of freedom down to the quantum ground state, but also to be able to determine its temperature with a high accuracy. However, when a large ground-state cooled crystal is interrogated for thermometry, complex many-body interactions take place, making it challenging to accurately estimate the temperature with established techniques. In this work we present a new thermometry method tailored for ion crystals. The method is applicable to all normal modes of motion and does not suffer from a computational bottleneck when applied to large ion crystals. We test the temperature estimate with two experiments, namely with a 1D linear chain of 4 ions and a 2D crystal of 19 ions and verify the results, where possible, using other methods. The results show that the new method is an accurate and efficient tool for thermometry of ion crystals.",

    "abstract": "In the race to build scalable quantum computers, minimizing the resource consumption of their full stack to achieve a target performance becomes crucial. It mandates a synergy of fundamental physics and engineering: the former for the microscopic aspects of computing performance, and the latter for the macroscopic resource consumption. For this we propose a holistic methodology dubbed Metric-Noise-Resource (MNR) able to quantify and optimize all aspects of the full-stack quantum computer, bringing together concepts from quantum physics (e.g., noise on the qubits), quantum information (e.g., computing architecture and type of error correction), and enabling technologies (e.g., cryogenics, control electronics, and wiring). This holistic approach allows us to define and study resource efficiencies as ratios between performance and resource cost. As a proof of concept, we use MNR to minimize the power consumption of a full-stack quantum computer, performing noisy or fault-tolerant computing with a target performance for the task of interest. Comparing this with a classical processor performing the same task, we identify a quantum energy advantage in regimes of parameters distinct from the commonly considered quantum computational advantage. This provides a previously overlooked practical argument for building quantum computers. While our illustration uses highly idealized parameters inspired by superconducting qubits with concatenated error correction, the methodology is universal -- it applies to other qubits and error-correcting codes -- and provides experimenters with guidelines to build energy-efficient quantum processors. In some regimes of high energy consumption, it can reduce this consumption by orders of magnitudes. Overall, our methodology lays the theoretical foundation for resource-efficient quantum technologies.",

By using the same mathematical syntax of (quasi-)stochastic matrices acting on (quasi-)stochastic vectors, the core difference in logical inference between classical and quantum theory is found in the manipulation of the reference prior rather than in the representation of the channel.",

To understand how this can be done, we study a precessional reorientation of the sublattice magnetization in an (an)isotropic quantum antiferromagnet induced by an applied magnetic field. We use a description including the leading quantum and thermal fluctuations, namely Schwinger boson mean-field theory, because this theory allows us to describe both ordered phases and the phases in between them, as is crucial for switching. An activation energy has to be overcome requiring a minimum applied field $h_\\text{t}$ which is given essentially by the spin gap. It can be reduced significantly for temperatures approaching the N\\'eel temperature facilitating switching. The time required for switching diverges when the field approaches $h_\\text{t}$ which is the signature of an inertia in the magnetization dynamics. The temporal evolution of the magnetization and of the energy reveals signs of dephasing. The switched state has lost a part of its coherence because the magnetic modes do not evolve in phase.",

For one, we find a necessary graph theoretic criterion--the\"siblings-on-cycles\"property--for a causal structure to be admissible: Only such causal structures admit a realization consistent with local quantum theory. We conjecture that this property is moreover sufficient. This conjecture is motivated by an explicit construction of quantum causal models, and supported by numerical calculations. We show that these causal models, in a restricted setting, are indeed consistent. For another, we identify two sets of causal structures that, in the classical-deterministic case, give rise to causal and non-causal correlations respectively.",

However, for sufficiently large coupling, the sensing protocol itself perturbs the bath, which is predicted to result in a characteristic response in the sensing measurements. Here, we observe this bath perturbation, also known as a quantum quench, by preparing the nuclear spin bath of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in polarized initial states and performing phase-resolved spin echo measurements on the NV electron spin. These measurements reveal a time-dependent phase determined by the initial state of the bath. We derive the relationship between sensor phase and Gaussian spin bath polarization, and apply it to reconstruct both the axial and transverse polarization components. Using this insight, we optimize the transfer efficiency of our dynamic nuclear polarization sequence. This technique for directly measuring bath polarization may assist in preparing high-fidelity quantum memory states, improving nanoscale NMR methods, and investigating non-Gaussian quantum baths.",

However, this topological information might not be known a priori, or it may need to be verified. In this paper, we propose an efficient protocol for distinguishing and inferring the topology of a quantum network. We leverage entropic quantities -- namely, the von Neumann entropy and the measured mutual information -- as well as measurement covariance to uniquely characterize the topology. We show that the entropic quantities are sufficient to distinguish two networks that prepare GHZ states. Moreover, if qubit measurements are available, both entropic quantities and covariance can be used to infer the network topology without state-preparation assumptions. We show that the protocol can be entirely robust to noise and can be implemented via quantum variational optimization. Numerical experiments on both classical simulators and quantum hardware show that covariance is generally more reliable for accurately and efficiently inferring the topology, whereas entropy-based methods are often better at identifying the absence of entanglement in the low-shot regime.",

To see beyond this apparent lack of structure during the transient regime, we use a refined notion of thermality, which we call g-local. A system is g-locally thermal if the states of all its small subsystems are marginals of global thermal states. We numerically demonstrate for two harmonic lattices that whenever the total system equilibrates in the long run, each lattice remains g-locally thermal at all times, including the transient regime. This is true even when the lattices have long-range interactions within them. In all cases, we find that the equilibrium is described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble, with three-dimensional lattices requiring special treatment due to their extended set of conserved charges. We compare our findings with the well-known two-temperature model. While its standard form is not valid beyond weak coupling, we show that at strong coupling it can be partially salvaged by adopting the concept of a g-local temperature.",

Here, we present a portable nanothermometer based on a molecular two-level quantum system that operates in the (3-20)-K temperature range, with temperatures and spatial resolutions on the order of millikelvins and micrometers, respectively. We validate the performance of this molecular thermometer by estimating the thermal conductivity of a nanopatterned silicon membrane, where we find a quadratic temperature dependence. In addition, we demonstrate two-dimensional temperature mapping via the simultaneous spectroscopy of multiple probes deposited onto such a suspended membrane.

    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement has been identified as a crucial concept underlying many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter systems, such as topological phases or many-body localization. Recently, instead of considering mere quantifiers of entanglement like entanglement entropy, the study of entanglement structure in terms of the entanglement spectrum has shifted into the focus, leading to new insights into fractional quantum Hall states and topological insulators, among others. What remains a challenge is the experimental detection of such fine-grained properties of quantum systems. The development of protocols for detecting features of the entanglement spectrum in cold-atom systems, which are one of the leading platforms for quantum simulation, is thus highly desirable and will open up new avenues for experimentally exploring quantum many-body physics. Here, we present a method to bound the width of the entanglement spectrum, or entanglement dimension, of cold atoms in lattice geometries, requiring only measurements in two experimentally accessible bases and utilizing ballistic time-of-flight (TOF) expansion. Building on previous proposals for entanglement certification for photon pairs, we first consider entanglement between two atoms of different atomic species and later generalize to higher numbers of atoms per species and multispecies configurations showing multipartite high-dimensional entanglement. Through numerical simulations, we show that our method is robust against typical experimental noise effects and thus will enable high-dimensional entanglement certification in systems of up to eight atoms using currently available experimental techniques.",

However, in systems with power-law ($1/r^\\alpha$) decaying interactions, no analogous statement has been shown, and there are serious mathematical obstacles to proving it with existing methods. In this paper we prove that when $\\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $D$, the effect of local perturbations on local properties a distance $r$ away is upper bounded by a power law $1/r^{\\alpha_1}$ in gapped ground states, provided that the perturbations do not close the spectral gap. The power-law exponent $\\alpha_1$ is tight if $\\alpha>2D$ and interactions are two-body, where we have $\\alpha_1=\\alpha$. The proof is enabled by a method that avoids the use of quasiadiabatic continuation and incorporates techniques of complex analysis. This method also improves bounds on ground state correlation decay, even in short-range interacting systems. Our work generalizes the fundamental notion that local perturbations have local effects to power-law interacting systems, with broad implications for numerical simulations and experiments.",

As an illustrative example, we focus on divalent nickel ions in magnesium oxide. We perform electron spin resonance spectroscopy and polarization-sensitive magneto-optical fluorescence spectroscopy of a dense ensemble of these ions and find that (i) the ground-state electron spin stays coherent at liquid-helium temperatures for several microseconds, and (ii) there exists energetically well-isolated excited states which can couple to two ground state spin sub-levels via optical transitions of orthogonal polarizations. The latter implies that fast, coherent optical control over the electron spin is possible. We then propose schemes for optical initialization and control of the ground-state electron spin using polarized optical pulses, as well as two schemes for implementing a noise-free, broadband quantum-optical memory at near-telecom wavelengths in this material system.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that a self-correcting memory can exist in 3 spatial dimensions, provided it is protected by a 1-form symmetry. Requiring that a system's dynamics obey this type of symmetry is equivalent to enforcing a macroscopic number of symmetry terms throughout the bulk. In this paper, we show how to replace the explicit 1-form symmetry in the bulk with an emergent 1-form symmetry. Although the symmetry still has to be explicitly enforced on the boundary, this only requires O(L^2) terms instead of O(L^3) terms. We then reinterpret this boundary as a symmetry-protected topological defect in a bulk topological order. Defects can have interesting memory properties even in the absence of symmetry.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that high-threshold quantum error correction is possible for biased-noise qubits, provided that one can implement a controlled-sc not (CX) gate that preserves the bias. Bias-preserving CX gates have been proposed for several biased-noise qubit platforms, most notably Kerr cats. However, experimentally measuring the noise bias is challenging, as it requires accurately estimating certain low-probability Pauli errors in the presence of much larger state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors. In this paper, we introduce bias-randomized benchmarking (BRB) as a technique for measuring bias in quantum gates. BRB, like all RB protocols, is highly accurate and immune to SPAM errors. Our first protocol, CX-dihedral BRB, is a straightforward method to measure the bias of the entire CX-dihedral group. Our second protocol, interleaved-bias randomized benchmarking (IBRB), is a generalization of interleaved RB tailored to the experimental constraints of biased-noise qubits; this is a more involved procedure that directly targets the bias of the CX gate alone. Our BRB procedures occupy a middle ground between classic RB protocols that only estimate the average fidelity and tomographic RB protocols that provide more detailed characterization of noise but require more measurements as well as experimental capabilities that are not necessarily available in biased-noise qubits.Received 29 July 2022Accepted 26 October 2022DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.010307Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Magic states are fundamental building blocks on the road to fault-tolerant quantum computing. CSS codes play a crucial role in the construction of magic distillation protocols. Previous work has cast quantum computing with magic states for odd dimension $d$ within a phase space setting in which universal quantum computing is described by the statistical mechanics of quasiprobability distributions. Here we extend this framework to the important $d=2$ qubit case and show that we can exploit common structures in CSS circuits to obtain distillation bounds capable of out-performing previous monotone bounds in regimes of practical interest. Moreover, in the case of CSS code projections, we arrive at a novel cut-off result on the code length $n$ of the CSS code in terms of parameters characterising a desired distillation, which implies that for fixed target error rate and acceptance probability, one needs only consider CSS codes below a threshold number of qubits. These entropic constraints are not due simply to the data-processing inequality but rely explicitly on the stochastic representation of such protocols.",

    "abstract": "We use the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) to charge floating metallic gates defined on the surface of a Si/SiGe heterostructure. The AFM tip serves as an ideal and movable cryogenic switch, allowing us to bias a floating gate to a specific voltage and then lock the charge on the gate by withdrawing the tip. Biasing with an AFM tip allows us to reduce the size of a quantum dot floating gate electrode down to $\\sim100~\\mathrm{nm}$. Measurements of the conductance through a quantum dot formed beneath the floating gate indicate that its charge changes in discrete steps. From the statistics of the single-electron leakage events, we determine the floating gate leakage resistance $R \\sim 10^{19}~ \\mathrm{Ohm}$ - a value immeasurable by conventional means.",

    "abstract": "State smoothing is a technique to estimate a state at a particular time, conditioned on information obtained both before (past) and after (future) that time. For a classical system, the smoothed state is a normalized product of the $\\textit{filtered state}$ (a state conditioned only on the past measurement information and the initial preparation) and the $\\textit{retrofiltered effect}$ (depending only on the future measurement information). For the quantum case, whilst there are well-established analogues of the filtered state ($\\rho_{\\rm F}$) and retrofiltered effect ($\\hat E_{\\rm R}$), their product does not, in general, provide a valid quantum state for smoothing. However, this procedure does seem to work when $\\rho_{\\rm F}$ and $\\hat E_{\\rm R}$ are mutually diagonalizable. This fact has been used to obtain smoothed quantum states -- more pure than the filtered states -- in a number of experiments on continuously monitored quantum systems, in cavity QED and atomic systems. In this paper we show that there is an implicit assumption underlying this technique: that if all the information were known to the observer, the true system state would be one of the diagonal basis states. This assumption does not necessarily hold, as the missing information is quantum information. It could be known to the observer only if it were turned into a classical measurement record, but then its nature depends on the choice of measurement. We show by a simple model that, depending on that measurement choice, the smoothed quantum state can: agree with that from the classical method; disagree with it but still be co-diagonal with it; or not even be co-diagonal with it. That is, just because filtering and retrofiltering appear classical does not mean classical smoothing theory is applicable in quantum experiments.",

    "abstract": "Detection of weak forces and precise measurement of time are two of the many applications of quantum metrology to science and technology. We consider a quantum system initialized in a pure state and whose evolution is governed by a Hamiltonian $H$; a measurement can later estimate the time $t$ for which the system has evolved. In this work, we introduce and study a fundamental trade-off which relates the amount by which noise reduces the accuracy of a quantum clock to the amount of information about the energy of the clock that leaks to the environment. Specifically, we consider an idealized scenario in which Alice prepares an initial pure state of the clock, allows the clock to evolve for a time $t$ that is not precisely known, and then transmits the clock through a noisy channel to Bob. The environment (Eve) receives any information that is lost. We prove that Bob's loss of quantum Fisher information (QFI) about $t$ is equal to Eve's gain of QFI about a complementary energy parameter. We also prove a more general trade-off that applies when Bob and Eve wish to estimate the values of parameters associated with two noncommuting observables. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the accuracy of the clock to be unaffected by the noise. These are a subset of the Knill-Laflamme error-correction conditions; states satisfying these conditions are said to form a metrological code. We provide a scheme to construct metrological codes in the stabilizer formalism. We show that there are metrological codes that cannot be written as a quantum error-correcting code with similar distance in which the Hamiltonian acts as a logical operator, potentially offering new schemes for constructing states that do not lose any sensitivity upon application of a noisy channel. We discuss applications of our results to sensing using a many-body state subject to erasure or amplitude-damping noise.",
