    "abstract": "Serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; i.e., citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (i.e., desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, and venlafaxine), and serotonin modulators with SSRI‐like properties (i.e., vilazodone and vortioxetine) are primary pharmacologic treatments for major depressive and anxiety disorders. Genetic variation in CYP2D6 , CYP2C19 , and CYP2B6 influences the metabolism of many of these antidepressants, which may potentially affect dosing, efficacy, and tolerability. In addition, the pharmacodynamic genes SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter) and HTR2A (serotonin‐2A receptor) have been examined in relation to efficacy and side effect profiles of these drugs. This guideline updates and expands the 2015 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes and SSRI dosing and summarizes the impact of CYP2D6 , CYP2C19 , CYP2B6 , SLC6A4 , and HTR2A genotypes on antidepressant dosing, efficacy, and tolerability. We provide recommendations for using CYP2D6 , CYP2C19 , and CYP2B6 genotype results to help inform prescribing these antidepressants and describe the existing data for SLC6A4 and HTR2A , which do not support their clinical use in antidepressant prescribing.",

    "abstract": "Donanemab is an amyloid‐targeting therapy that resulted in robust amyloid plaque reduction and slowed Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression compared with placebo in the phase II TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ study (NCT03367403). The objectives of the current analyses are to characterize (i) the population pharmacokinetics of donanemab, (ii) the relationship between donanemab exposure and amyloid plaque reduction (response), and (iii) the relationship between donanemab exposure and amyloid‐related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions (ARIA‐E). Model development included data from participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild to moderate dementia due to AD from the phase Ib study on donanemab (NCT02624778) and participants with early symptomatic AD from the TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ study. The analysis showed donanemab has a terminal elimination half‐life of 11.8 days. Body weight and antidrug antibody titer impact donanemab exposure but not the pharmacodynamic response. Maintaining a donanemab serum concentration above 4.43 μg/mL (95% confidence interval: 0.956, 10.4) is associated with amyloid plaque reduction. The time to achieve amyloid plaque clearance (amyloid plaque level < 24.1 Centiloids) varied depending on the baseline amyloid level, where higher baseline levels were associated with fewer participants achieving amyloid clearance. The majority of participants achieved amyloid clearance by 52 weeks on treatment. Apolipoprotein ε4 carriers, irrespective of donanemab serum exposure, were 4 times more likely than noncarriers to have an ARIA‐E event by 24 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have ushered in a new era of possibilities across various scientific domains. One area where these advancements hold significant promise is model‐informed drug discovery and development (MID3). To foster a wider adoption and acceptance of these advanced algorithms, the Innovation and Quality (IQ) Consortium initiated the AI/ML working group in 2021 with the aim of promoting their acceptance among the broader scientific community as well as by regulatory agencies. By drawing insights from workshops organized by the working group and attended by key stakeholders across the biopharma industry, academia, and regulatory agencies, this white paper provides a perspective from the IQ Consortium. The range of applications covered in this white paper encompass the following thematic topics: (i) AI/ML‐enabled Analytics for Pharmacometrics and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) Workflows; (ii) Explainable Artificial Intelligence and its Applications in Disease Progression Modeling; (iii) Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Quantitative Pharmacology Modeling; and (iv) AI/ML Utilization in Drug Discovery. Additionally, the paper offers a set of best practices to ensure an effective and responsible use of AI, including considering the context of use, explainability and generalizability of models, and having human‐in‐the‐loop. We believe that embracing the transformative power of AI in quantitative modeling while adopting a set of good practices can unlock new opportunities for innovation, increase efficiency, and ultimately bring benefits to patients.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery and development is a notoriously risky process with high failure rates at every stage, including disease modeling, target discovery, hit discovery, lead optimization, preclinical development, human safety, and efficacy studies. Accurate prediction of clinical trial outcomes may help significantly improve the efficiency of this process by prioritizing therapeutic programs that are more likely to succeed in clinical trials and ultimately benefit patients. Here, we describe inClinico, a transformer‐based artificial intelligence software platform designed to predict the outcome of phase II clinical trials. The platform combines an ensemble of clinical trial outcome prediction engines that leverage generative artificial intelligence and multimodal data, including omics, text, clinical trial design, and small molecule properties. inClinico was validated in retrospective, quasi‐prospective, and prospective validation studies internally and with pharmaceutical companies and financial institutions. The platform achieved 0.88 receiver operating characteristic area under the curve in predicting the phase II to phase III transition on a quasi‐prospective validation dataset. The first prospective predictions were made and placed on date‐stamped preprint servers in 2016. To validate our model in a real‐world setting, we published forecasted outcomes for several phase II clinical trials achieving 79% accuracy for the trials that have read out. We also present an investment application of inClinico using date stamped virtual trading portfolio demonstrating 35% 9‐month return on investment.",

    "abstract": "Women and people from most racial and ethnic groups in the United States have historically been under‐represented in clinical trials of investigational medical products. Inadequate representation of these groups may lead to an incomplete understanding of the safety and efficacy of new drugs, devices, biologics, and vaccines, and limit the generalizability of trial findings. As a result, new medical products may not be beneficial to all people who need them, and existing inequities in outcomes among various population groups may remain unchanged or worsen, or new disparities may arise. Although much work has focused on study‐level strategies, research organizations must make systemic changes to how clinical trials are envisioned and implemented to achieve sustainable support for diversity and inclusion in clinical trials. The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) conducted interviews with leaders at institutions that conduct clinical trials to explore perspectives on organizational‐level practices that promote diversity and inclusion in clinical trials. Leaders described motivations, such as an ethical and moral imperative; organizational practices, such as staff investment and resource allocation; perceived return on investments, such as better science; and deterrents, such as cost and time. The CTTI also convened an expert meeting to discuss the interview findings and provide guidance. We present the interview findings and expert guidance in a framework that describes four key areas—commitment, partnerships, accountability, and resources—on sustaining organizational‐level approaches for improving diversity and inclusion in clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of advancing health equity. Institutions who conduct and support clinical trials should implement organizational‐level approaches to improve equitable access and diverse patient participation in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Understanding cannabis‐drug interactions is critical given regulatory changes that have increased access to and use of cannabis. Cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9‐THC), the most abundant phytocannabinoids, are in vitro reversible and time‐dependent (CBD only) inhibitors of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Cannabis extracts were used to evaluate quantitatively potential pharmacokinetic cannabinoid‐drug interactions in 18 healthy adults. Participant received, in a randomized cross‐over manner (separated by ≥ 1 week), a brownie containing (i) no cannabis extract (ethanol/placebo), (ii) CBD‐dominant cannabis extract (640 mg CBD + 20 mg Δ9‐THC), or (iii) Δ9‐THC‐dominant cannabis extract (20 mg Δ9‐THC and no CBD). After 30 minutes, participants consumed a cytochrome P450 (CYP) drug cocktail consisting of caffeine (CYP1A2), losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A). Plasma and urine samples were collected (0–24 hours). The CBD + Δ9‐THC brownie inhibited CYP2C19 > CYP2C9 > CYP3A > CYP1A2 (but not CYP2D6) activity, as evidenced by an increase in the geometric mean ratio of probe drug area under the plasma concentration‐time curve (AUC) relative to placebo (AUC GMR ) of omeprazole, losartan, midazolam, and caffeine by 207%, 77%, 56%, and 39%, respectively. In contrast, the Δ9‐THC brownie did not inhibit any of the CYPs. The CBD + Δ9‐THC brownie increased Δ9‐THC AUC GMR by 161%, consistent with CBD inhibiting CYP2C9‐mediated oral Δ9‐THC clearance. Except for caffeine, these interactions were well‐predicted by our physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic model (within 26% of observed interactions). Results can be used to help guide dose adjustment of drugs co‐consumed with cannabis products and the dose of CBD in cannabis products to reduce interaction risk with Δ9‐THC.",

Integration of advanced data analytics in Quantitative Pharmacology is crucial for drug‐disease knowledge management, enabling precise, efficient and inclusive drug development and utilization – an application we refer to as model‐informed precision medicine. AI/ML enables characterization of the molecular and clinical sources of heterogeneity in disease trajectory, advancing end point qualification and biomarker discovery, and informing patient enrichment for proof‐of‐concept studies as well as trial designs for efficient evidence generation incorporating digital twins and virtual control arms. Explainable ML methods are valuable in elucidating predictors of efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments, thereby informing response monitoring and risk mitigation strategies. In oncology, emerging opportunities exist for development of the next generation of disease models via ML‐assisted joint longitudinal modeling of high‐dimensional biomarker data such as circulating tumor DNA and radiomics profiles as predictors of survival outcomes. Finally, mining real‐world data leveraging ML algorithms enables understanding of the impact of exclusion criteria on clinical outcomes, thereby informing rational design of appropriately inclusive clinical trials through data‐driven broadening of eligibility criteria. Herein, we provide an overview of the aforementioned contexts of use of ML in drug‐disease modeling based on examples across multiple therapeutic areas including neurology, rare diseases, autoimmune diseases, oncology and immuno‐oncology.",

    "abstract": "Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can reduce treatment burden for patients and healthcare systems compared with intravenous (i.v.) infusion through shorter administration times, made possible by convenient, patient‐centric devices. A deeper understanding of clinical pharmacology principles related to efficacy and safety of s.c.‐administered mAbs over the past decade has streamlined s.c. product development. This review presents learnings from key constituents of the s.c. mAb development pathway, including pharmacology, administration variables, immunogenicity, and delivery devices. Restricted mAb transportation through the hypodermis explains their incomplete absorption at a relatively slow rate (pharmacokinetic (PK)) and may impact mAb‐cellular interactions and/or onset and magnitude of physiological responses (pharmacodynamic). Injection volumes, formulation, rate and site of injection, and needle attributes may affect PKs and the occurrence/severity of adverse events like injection‐site reactions or pain, with important consequences for treatment adherence. A review of immunogenicity data for numerous compounds reveals that incidence of anti‐drug antibodies (ADAs) is generally comparable across i.v. and s.c. routes, and complementary factors including response magnitude (ADA titer), persistence over time, and neutralizing antibody presence are needed to assess clinical impact. Finally, four case studies showcase how s.c. biologics have been clinically developed: (i) by implementation of i.v./s.c. bridging strategies to streamline PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitor development, (ii) through co‐development with i.v. presentations for anti‐severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 antibodies to support rapid deployment of both formulations, (iii) as the lead route for bispecific T cell engagers (BTCEs) to mitigate BTCE‐mediated cytokine release syndrome, and (iv) for pediatric patients in the case of dupilumab.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a potentially transformational therapeutic modality with considerable promise. Molecular glue degraders remodel the surface of E3 ligases inducing interactions with neosubstrates resulting in their polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Molecular glues are clinically precedented and have demonstrated the ability to degrade proteins‐of‐interest (POIs) previously deemed undruggable due to the absence of a traditional small molecule binding pocket. Heterobifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) possess ligands for an E3 complex and the POIs, which are chemically linked together, and similarly hijack the ubiquitin machinery to deplete the target. There has been a recent surge in the number of degraders entering clinical trials, particularly directed toward cancer. Nearly all utilize CRL4 CRBN as the E3 ligase, and a relatively limited diversity of POIs are currently targeted. In this review, we provide an overview of the degraders in clinical trials and provide a perspective on the lessons learned from their development and emerging human data that will be broadly useful to those working in the TPD field.",

    "abstract": "Drug–drug interactions (DDIs) involving hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1/1B3 (OATP1B) can be substantial, however, challenges remain for predicting interaction risk. Emerging evidence suggests that endogenous biomarkers, particularly coproporphyrin‐I (CP‐I), can be used to assess in vivo OATP1B activity. The present work under the International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development was aimed primarily at assessing CP‐I as a biomarker for informing OATP1B DDI risk. Literature and unpublished CP‐I data along with pertinent in vitro and clinical DDI information were collected to identify DDIs primarily involving OATP1B inhibition and assess the relationship between OATP1B substrate drug and CP‐I exposure changes. Static models to predict changes in exposure of CP‐I, as a selective OATP1B substrate, were also evaluated. Significant correlations were observed between CP‐I area under the curve ratio (AUCR) or maximum concentration ratio ( C max R) and AUCR of substrate drugs. In general, the CP‐I C max R was equal to or greater than the CP‐I AUCR. CP‐I C max R < 1.25 was associated with absence of OATP1B‐mediated DDIs (AUCR < 1.25) with no false negative predictions. CP‐I C max R < 2 was associated with weak OATP1B‐mediated DDIs (AUCR < 2). A correlation was identified between CP‐I exposure changes and OATP1B1 static DDI predictions. Recommendations for collecting and interpreting CP‐I data are discussed, including a decision tree for guiding DDI risk assessment. In conclusion, measurement of CP‐I is recommended to inform OATP1B inhibition potential. The current analysis identified changes in CP‐I exposure that may be used to prioritize, delay, or replace clinical DDI studies.",

    "abstract": "Personalized medicine is currently hampered by the lack of flexible drug formulations. Especially for pediatric patients, manual compounding of personalized drug formulations by pharmacists is required. Three‐Dimensional (3D) printing of medicines, which enables small‐scale manufacturing at the point‐of‐care, can fulfill this unmet clinical need. This study investigates the feasibility of developing a 3D‐printed tablet formulation at the point‐of‐care which complies to quality requirements for clinical practice, including bioequivalence. Development, manufacturing, and quality control of the 3D‐printed tablets was performed at the manufacturing facility and laboratory of the department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology at Leiden University Medical Center. Sildenafil was used as a model drug for the tablet formulation. Along with the 3D‐printed tablets a randomized, an open‐label, 2‐period, crossover, single‐dose clinical trial to assess bioequivalence was performed in healthy adults. Bioequivalence was established if areas under the plasma concentration curve from administration to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC 0‐t ) and maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) ratios were within the limits of 80.00–125.00%. The manufacturing process provided reproducible 3D‐printed tablets that adhered to quality control requirements and were consequently used in the clinical trial. The clinical trial was conducted in 12 healthy volunteers. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of both AUC 0‐t and C max ratios were within bioequivalence limits (AUC 0‐t 90% CI: 87.28–104.14; C max 90% CI: 80.23–109.58). For the first time, we demonstrate the development of a 3D‐printed tablet formulation at the point‐of‐care that is bioequivalent to its marketed originator. The 3D printing of personalized formulations is a disruptive technology for compounding, bridging the gap toward personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Fluoropyrimidine (FP) chemotherapy is associated with severe, life‐threatening toxicities, particularly among patients who carry deleterious germline variants in the DPYD gene. Pretreatment DPYD testing is standard of care throughout most of Europe; however, it has not been recommended in clinical practice guidelines in the United States. Due to increased risk of severe toxicity, a Citizen's Petition asked the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to update language in FP drug labels to recommend DPYD testing as part of a boxed warning and recommend FP dose reduction in patients carrying deleterious germline variants. In response, the FDA updated the capecitabine package insert to inform patients about the toxicity risk and test availability and consider DPYD testing. However, the FDA did not include a testing recommendation or requirement, or a boxed warning. Additionally, the FDA did not recommend FP dose adjustment in DPYD variant carriers. This review provides a critical assessment of the DPYD ‐FP pharmacogenetic association using the FDA's previously published Pharmacogenetic Pyramid, demonstrating that the evidence is compelling for recommending DPYD testing prior to FP treatment. Additionally, the FDA's stated concerns about recommending DPYD testing and DPYD ‐guided FP dose adjustment are addressed and discussed in the context of the FDA's other genetic testing and dose adjustment recommendations. We call on the FDA to follow our European counterparts in recommending DPYD testing and genotype‐based dose adjustment to ensure patients with cancer receive safe and effective FP chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Technological innovations, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), have the potential to expedite the goal of precision medicine, especially when combined with increased capacity for voluminous data from multiple sources and expanded therapeutic modalities; however, they also present several challenges. In this communication, we first discuss the goals of precision medicine, and contextualize the use of AI in precision medicine by showcasing innovative applications (e.g., prediction of tumor growth and overall survival, biomarker identification using biomedical images, and identification of patient population for clinical practice) which were presented during the February 2023 virtual public workshop entitled “Application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,” hosted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and University of Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M‐CERSI). Next, we put forward challenges brought about by the multidisciplinary nature of AI, particularly highlighting the need for AI to be trustworthy. To address such challenges, we subsequently note practical approaches, viz., differential privacy, synthetic data generation, and federated learning. The proposed strategies – some of which are highlighted presentations from the workshop – are for the protection of personal information and intellectual property. In addition, methods such as the risk‐based management approach and the need for an agile regulatory ecosystem are discussed. Finally, we lay out a call for action that includes sharing of data and algorithms, development of regulatory guidance documents, and pooling of expertise from a broad‐spectrum of stakeholders to enhance the application of AI in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Tozorakimab is a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin (IL)‐33. IL‐33 is a broad‐acting epithelial “alarmin” cytokine upregulated in lung tissue of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This first‐in‐human, phase I, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study (NCT03096795) evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PKs), immunogenicity, target engagement, and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of tozorakimab. This was a 3‐part study. In part 1, 56 healthy participants with a history of mild atopy received single escalating doses of either intravenous or subcutaneous tozorakimab or placebo. In part 2, 24 patients with mild COPD received multiple ascending doses of subcutaneous tozorakimab or placebo. In part 3, 8 healthy Japanese participants received a single intravenous dose of tozorakimab or placebo. The safety data collected included treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, and clinical laboratory parameters. Biological samples for PKs, immunogenicity, target engagement, and PD biomarker analyses were collected. No meaningful differences in the frequencies of TEAEs were observed between the tozorakimab and placebo arms. Three tozorakimab‐treated participants with COPD experienced treatment‐emergent serious adverse events. Subcutaneous or intravenous tozorakimab demonstrated linear, time‐independent PKs with a mean half‐life of 11.7–17.3 days. Treatment‐emergent anti‐drug antibody frequency was low. Engagement of tozorakimab with endogenous IL‐33 in serum and nasal airways was demonstrated. Tozorakimab significantly reduced serum IL‐5 and IL‐13 levels in patients with COPD compared with placebo. Overall, tozorakimab was well tolerated, with a linear, time‐independent serum PK profile. Additionally, biomarker studies demonstrated proof of mechanism. Overall, these data support the further clinical development of tozorakimab in COPD and other inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Oral formulations prepared from the leaves of the kratom ( Mitragyna speciosa ) plant are increasingly used for their opioid‐like effects to self‐manage opioid withdrawal and pain. Calls to US poison centers involving kratom exposures increased >50‐fold from 2011–2017, one‐third of which reported concomitant use of kratom with drugs of abuse. Many of these drugs are eliminated primarily via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and CYP2D6, raising concerns for potential adverse pharmacokinetic kratom‐drug interactions. The impact of a single low dose of kratom tea (2 g) on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A probe midazolam (2.5 mg) and CYP2D6 probe dextromethorphan (30 mg) were assessed in 12 healthy adult participants after oral administration. Kratom showed no effect on dextromethorphan area under the plasma concentration time‐curve (AUC) and maximum concentration ( C max ; geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) 0.99 (0.83–1.19) and 0.96 (0.78–1.19), respectively) but a modest increase in midazolam AUC and C max (1.39 (1.23–1.57) and 1.50 (1.32–1.70), respectively). Lack of change in midazolam half‐life (1.07 (0.98–1.17)) suggested that kratom primarily inhibited intestinal CYP3A. This inference was further supported by a physiologically based pharmacokinetic drug interaction model using the abundant alkaloid mitragynine, a relatively potent CYP3A time‐dependent inhibitor in vitro ( K I , ~4 μM; k inact , ~0.07 min −1 ). This work is the first to clinically evaluate the pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential of kratom. Co‐consuming kratom with certain drugs extensively metabolized by CYP3A may precipitate serious interactions. These data fill critical knowledge gaps about the safe use of this increasingly popular natural product, thereby addressing ongoing public health concerns.",

    "abstract": "Real‐world data (RWD)‐derived external controls can be used to contextualize efficacy findings for investigational therapies evaluated in uncontrolled trials. As the number of submissions to regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies using external controls rises, and in light of recent regulatory and HTA guidance on the appropriate use of RWD, there is a need to address the operational and methodological challenges impeding the quality of real‐world evidence (RWE) generation and the consistency in evaluation of RWE across agencies. This systematic review summarizes publicly available information on the use of external controls to contextualize outcomes from uncontrolled trials for all indications from January 1, 2015, through August 20, 2021, that were submitted to the European Medicines Agency, the US Food and Drug Administration, and/or select major HTA bodies (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen (IQWiG), and Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss (G‐BA)). By systematically reviewing submissions to regulatory and HTA bodies in the context of recent guidance, this study provides quantitative and qualitative insights into how external control design and analytic choices may be viewed by different agencies in practice. The primary operational and methodological aspects identified for discussion include, but are not limited to, engagement of regulators and HTA bodies, approaches to handling missing data (a component of data quality), and selection of real‐world endpoints. Continued collaboration and guidance to address these and other aspects will inform and assist stakeholders attempting to generate evidence using external controls.",

Observational and preclinical data have suggested it to be capable of producing both subjective and emotional effects on par with other classical psychedelics and entactogens. Whereas it is the most prevalently used novel serotonergic hallucinogen to date, it's acute effects and distinctions from classical progenitors have yet to be characterized in a controlled study. We assessed for the first time the immediate acute subjective, cognitive, and cardiovascular effects of 2C‐B (20 mg) in comparison to psilocybin (15 mg) and placebo in a within‐subjects, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of 22 healthy psychedelic‐experienced participants. 2C‐B elicited alterations of waking consciousness of a psychedelic nature, with dysphoria, subjective impairment, auditory alterations, and affective elements of ego dissolution largest under psilocybin. Participants demonstrated equivalent psychomotor slowing and spatial memory impairments under either compound compared with placebo, as indexed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Tower of London, and Spatial Memory Task. Neither compound produced empathogenic effects on the Multifaceted Empathy Test. 2C‐B induced transient pressor effects to a similar degree as psilocybin. The duration of self‐reported effects of 2C‐B was shorter than that of psilocybin, largely resolving within 6 hours. Present findings support the categorization of 2C‐B as a psychedelic of moderate experiential depth at doses given. Tailored dose‐effect studies are needed to discern the pharmacokinetic dependency of 2C‐B's experiential overlaps.",

This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of CYP2D6 structural variation, terms, and definitions, a review of methods suitable for their detection and characterization, and practical examples to address the lack of standards to describe CYP2D6 structural variants or any other pharmacogene. This PharmVar tutorial offers practical guidance on how to detect the many, often complex, structural variants, as well as recommends terms and definitions for clinical and research reporting. Uniform reporting is not only essential for electronic health record‐keeping but also for accurate translation of a patient's genotype into phenotype which is typically utilized to guide drug therapy.",

    "abstract": "The application of machine learning (ML) has shown promising results in precision medicine due to its exceptional performance in dealing with complex multidimensional data. However, using ML for individualized dosing of medicines is still in its early stage, meriting further exploration. A systematic review of study designs and modeling details of using ML for individualized dosing of different drugs was performed. We have summarized the status of the study populations, predictive targets, and data sources for ML modeling, the selection of ML algorithms and features, and the evaluation and validation of their predictive performance. We also used the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) to assess the risk of bias of included studies. Currently, ML can be used for both a priori and a posteriori dose selection and optimization, and it can also assist the implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring. However, studies are mainly focused on drugs with narrow therapeutic windows, predominantly immunosuppressants ( N = 23, 35.9%) and anti‐infectives ( N = 21, 32.8%), and there is currently only very limited attention for special populations, such as children ( N = 22, 34.4%). Most studies showed poor methodological quality and a high risk of bias. The lack of external validation and clinical utility evaluation currently limits the further clinical implementation of ML for dose individualization. We therefore have proposed several ways to improve the clinical relevance of the studies and facilitate the translation of ML models into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) have been the gold standard in vitro model for the human liver and are crucial to predict hepatic drug–drug interactions. The aim of this work was to assess the utility of 3D spheroid PHHs to study induction of important cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and drug transporters. The 3D spheroid PHHs from three different donors were treated for 4 days with rifampicin, dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, efavirenz, omeprazole, or β‐naphthoflavone. Induction of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, and transporters P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp)/ ABCB1 , multidrug resistance‐associated protein 2 (MRP2)/ ABCC2 , ABCG2 , organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1)/ SLC22A1 , SLC22A7 , SLCO1B1 , and SLCO1B3 were evaluated at mRNA and protein levels. Enzyme activity of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 were also assessed. Induction of CYP3A4 protein and mRNA correlated well for all donors and compounds and had a maximal induction of five‐ to sixfold for rifampicin, which closely correlates to induction observed in clinical studies. Rifampicin induced the mRNA of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 by 9‐ and 12‐fold, whereas the protein levels of these CYPs reached 2‐ and 3‐fold induction, respectively. Rifampicin induced CYP2C9 protein by 1.4‐fold, whereas the induction of CYP2C9 mRNA was over 2‐fold in all donors. Rifampicin induced ABCB1 , ABCC2 , and ABCG2 by 2‐fold. In conclusion, 3D spheroid PHHs is a valid model to investigate mRNA and protein induction of hepatic drug‐metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and this model provides a solid basis to study induction of CYPs and transporters, which translates to clinical relevance.",

The potential and capability of RWD/RWE to inform regulatory decisions and clinical drug development have been extensively reviewed and discussed in the literature. However, a comprehensive review of current applications of RWD/RWE in clinical pharmacology, particularly from an industry perspective, is needed to inspire new insights and identify potential future opportunities for clinical pharmacologists to utilize RWD/RWE to address key drug development questions. In this paper, we review the RWD/RWE applications relevant to clinical pharmacology based on recent publications from member companies in the International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ) RWD Working Group, and discuss the future direction of RWE utilization from a clinical pharmacology perspective. A comprehensive review of RWD/RWE use cases is provided and discussed in the following categories of application: drug–drug interaction assessments, dose recommendation for patients with organ impairment, pediatric plan development and study design, model‐informed drug development (e.g., disease progression modeling), prognostic and predictive biomarkers/factors identification, regulatory decisions support (e.g., label expansion), and synthetic/external control generation for rare diseases. Additionally, we describe and discuss common sources of RWD to help guide appropriate data selection to address questions pertaining to clinical pharmacology in drug development and regulatory decision making.",

    "abstract": "Although some tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) cases have been reported with patients with multiple myeloma (MM) taking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the association between TLS and mAbs remains mostly unknown. We aim to investigate the association between TLS and mAbs and describe clinical features. We conducted a disproportionality analysis to investigate the link between mAbs and TLS by excluding known confounders and compared with other anticancer drugs. The association between mAbs and TLS was evaluated using information component (IC). Drug–drug interaction signals were calculated based on the Ω shrinkage measure. Parametric distribution with the goodness‐of‐fit test was used for the reported time‐to‐onset analysis. From 2016 Q1, to 2022 Q4, a total of 274 TLS with mAbs were reported in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. There were 27% of patients with TLS with mAbs who died and 20.1% occurred a life‐threatening situation. Daratumumab, elotuzumab, and belantamab mafodotin presented a robust disproportionate signal of TLS after excluding known confounders (IC 025 > 0). Daratumumab had the highest disproportionate signal of TLS among all anticancer drugs for MM. Reported time‐to‐onset analysis showed the median days for TLS with daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab, and belantamab mafodotin were 1.5, 14.5, 5.5, and 5.5 days, respectively. The drug–drug interaction analysis showed the co‐administration of drugs known to increase urate, induce hyperkalemia, or hypocalcemia elevated the reporting frequency for TLS with mAbs (Ω 025 > 0). Our postmarketing pharmacovigilance analysis detected the reporting association of TLS and mAbs in patients with MM. Additional studies with robust epidemiological study designs that can validate these findings are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical pharmacology and drug development is akin to the dawning of a new era. Previously dismissed as merely technological hype, these approaches have emerged as promising tools in different domains, including health care, demonstrating their potential to empower clinical pharmacology decision making, revolutionize the drug development landscape, and advance patient care. Although challenges remain, the remarkable progress already made signals that the leap from hype to reality is well underway, and AI promises to offer clinical pharmacology new tools and possibilities for optimizing patient care is gradually coming to fruition. This review dives into the burgeoning world of AI and machine learning (ML), showcasing different applications of AI in clinical pharmacology and the impact of successful AI/ML implementation on drug development and/or regulatory decisions. This review also highlights recommendations for areas of opportunity in clinical pharmacology, including data analysis (e.g., handling large data sets, screening to identify important covariates, and optimizing patient population) and efficiencies (e.g., automation, translation, literature curation, and training). Realizing the benefits of AI in drug development and understanding its value will lead to the successful integration of AI tools in our clinical pharmacology and pharmacometrics armamentarium.",

    "abstract": "Timely identification and discontinuation of culprit‐drug is the cornerstone of clinical management of drug‐induced acute pancreatitis (AP), but the comprehensive landscape of AP culprit‐drugs is still lacking. To provide the current overview of AP culprit‐drugs to guide clinical practice, we reviewed the adverse event (AE) reports associated with AP in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2022, and summarized a potential AP culprit‐drug list and its corresponding AE report quantity proportion. The disproportionality analysis was used to detect adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals for each drug in the drug list, and the ADR signal distribution was integrated to show the risk characteristic of drugs according to the ADR signal detection results. In the FAERS database, a total of 62,206 AE reports were AP‐related, in which 1,175 drugs were reported as culprit‐drug. On the whole, metformin was the drug with the greatest number of AE reports, followed by quetiapine, liraglutide, exenatide, and sitagliptin. Drugs used in diabetes was the drug class with the greatest number of AE reports, followed by immunosuppressants, psycholeptics, drugs for acid‐related disorders, and analgesics. In disproportionality analysis, 595 drugs showed potential AP risk, whereas 580 drugs did not show any positive ADR signal. According to the positive–negative distribution of the ADR signal for drug classes, the drug class with the greatest number of positive drugs was antineoplastic agents. In this study, we provided the current comprehensive landscape of AP culprit‐drugs from the pharmacovigilance perspective, which can provide reference information for clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are a known cause of idiosyncratic drug‐induced liver injury (DILI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the five most commonly prescribed antibiotics in the United States are azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, cephalexin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin‐clavulanate. We quantified the frequency of acute DILI for these common antibiotics in the All of Us Research Program, one of the largest electronic health record (EHR)‐linked research cohorts in the United States. Retrospective analyses were conducted applying a standardized phenotyping algorithm to de‐identified clinical data available in the All of Us database for 318,598 study participants. Between February 1984 and December 2022, more than 30% of All of Us participants ( n = 119,812 individuals) had been exposed to at least 1 of our 5 study drugs. Initial screening identified 591 potential case patients that met our preselected laboratory‐based phenotyping criteria. Because DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion, we then used phenome scanning to narrow the case counts by (i) scanning all EHRs to identify all alternative diagnostic explanations for the laboratory abnormalities, and (ii) leveraging International Classification of Disease 9th revision (ICD)‐9 and ICD 10th revision (ICD)‐10 codes as exclusion criteria to eliminate misclassification. Our final case counts were 30 DILI cases with amoxicillin‐clavulanate, 24 cases with azithromycin, 24 cases with ciprofloxacin, 22 cases with amoxicillin alone, and < 20 cases with cephalexin. These findings demonstrate that data from EHR‐linked research cohorts can be efficiently mined to identify DILI cases related to the use of common antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Drug–drug interaction (DDI) assessments are well defined in health authority guidelines for small molecule drugs, and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance is now available for therapeutic proteins. However, there are currently no regulatory guidelines outlining DDI assessments for therapeutic peptides, which poses significant uncertainty and challenges during drug development for this heterogenous class of molecules. A cross‐industry peptide DDI working group consisting of experts from 10 leading companies was formed under the sponsorship of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. We aimed to capture the range of DDI studies undertaken for peptide drugs by (i) anonymously surveying relevant companies involved in peptide drug development to better understand DDI study type/timing currently performed and (ii) compiling a database containing in vitro / clinical DDI data from submission packages for recently approved peptide drugs. Our analyses highlight significant gaps and uncertainty in the field. For example, the reported timing of in vitro peptide DDI studies, if performed, vary substantially across responding companies from early research to phase III. Nearly all in vitro cytochrome P450 / transporter inhibition studies reported in the survey were negative. For the few positive hits reported, no clinical follow‐up studies were performed, questioning the clinical relevance of these findings. Furthermore, available submission packages reveal DDI likelihood is low for peptides >2 kDa, making it reasonable to adopt a risk‐based approach during drug development for larger peptides. By benchmarking the landscape of peptide DDI activities across the industry, we set the stage for future discussions with health authorities on harmonizing peptide DDI approaches.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic efficacy of tamoxifen is predominantly mediated by its active metabolites 4‐hydroxy‐tamoxifen and endoxifen, whose formation is catalyzed by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Yet, known CYP2D6 polymorphisms only partially determine metabolite concentrations in vivo . We performed the first cross‐ancestry genome‐wide association study with well‐characterized patients of European, Middle‐Eastern, and Asian descent ( n = 497) to identify genetic factors impacting active and parent metabolite formation. Genome‐wide significant variants were functionally evaluated in an independent liver cohort ( n = 149) and in silico . Metabolite prediction models were validated in two independent European breast cancer cohorts ( n = 287, n = 189). Within a single 1‐megabase (Mb) region of chromosome 22q13 encompassing the CYP2D6 gene, 589 variants were significantly associated with tamoxifen metabolite concentrations, particularly endoxifen and metabolic ratio (MR) endoxifen/ N ‐desmethyltamoxifen (minimal P = 5.4E−35 and 2.5E−65, respectively). Previously suggested other loci were not confirmed. Functional analyses revealed 66% of associated, mostly intergenic variants to be significantly correlated with hepatic CYP2D6 activity or expression ( ρ = 0.35 to −0.52), and six hotspot regions in the extended 22q13 locus impacting gene regulatory function. Machine learning models based on hotspot variants ( n = 12) plus CYP2D6 activity score (AS) increased the explained variability (~ 9%) compared with AS alone, explaining up to 49% (median R 2 ) and 72% of the variability in endoxifen and MR endoxifen/ N ‐desmethyltamoxifen, respectively. Our findings suggest that the extended CYP2D6 locus at 22q13 is the principal genetic determinant of endoxifen plasma concentration. Long‐distance haplotypes connecting CYP2D6 with adjacent regulatory sites and nongenetic factors may account for the unexplained portion of variability.",

We analyzed NMN in plasma and urine samples of two clinical trials investigating a new probe drug cocktail (consisting of digoxin, metformin, furosemide, and rosuvastatin) dedicated to clinically relevant drug transporters. In trial 1, NMN was investigated after single‐dose treatment with individual cocktail components or after cocktail treatment. In trial 2, NMN was investigated after treatment with cocktail alone or with cocktail + inhibitor (cimetidine, a MATE inhibitor; or rifampin, verapamil, or probenecid, inhibitors of other transporters). In trial 1, NMN kinetics in plasma and urine were essentially not affected by individual cocktail components or after cocktail treatment. In trial 2, NMN renal clearance from 0 to 12 hours (CL R,0–12 ) geometric mean ratio (GMR) after cocktail + cimetidine vs. cocktail alone was 75% (90% confidence interval (CI): 65–87%). NMN CL R GMR after cocktail + verapamil, + rifampin, or + probenecid vs. cocktail alone was 99% (90% CI: 81–121%), 91% (90% CI: 75–111%), and 107% (90% CI: 91–126%), respectively. Compared with creatinine CL R and creatinine area under the plasma‐concentration time curve, NMN CL R was more specific and more sensitive for renal MATE inhibition. Absence of impact of the cocktail on NMN in trial 1 allows for utilization of NMN in studies using this transporter cocktail. Trial 2 data support that NMN CL R is a specific and sensitive marker for MATE‐mediated renal drug–drug interactions.",

In addition to validity, decision makers require transparency in the reasoning that underlies study design and data source decisions. The 2019 Structured Preapproval and Postapproval Comparative Study Design Framework to Generate Valid and Transparent Real‐World Evidence (SPACE) and the 2021 Structured Process to Identify Fit‐For‐Purpose Data (SPIFD)—intended to be used together—provide a step‐by‐step guide to identify decision grade, fit‐for‐purpose study design and data. In this update (referred to as “SPIFD2” to encompass both the design and data aspects) we provide an update to these frameworks that combines the templates into one, more explicitly calls for articulation of the hypothetical target trial and sources of bias that may arise in the real‐world emulation, and provides explicit references to the Structured Template and Reporting Tool for Real‐World Evidence (STaRT‐RWE) tables that we suggest using immediately after invoking the SPIFD2 framework. Following the steps recommended in the SPIFD2 process requires due diligence on the part of the researcher to ensure that every aspect of study design and data selection is rationalized and supported by evidence. The resulting stepwise documentation enables reproducibility and clear communication with decision makers, and it increases the likelihood that the evidence generated is valid, fit‐for‐purpose, and sufficient to support healthcare and regulatory decisions.",

    "abstract": "Over 20% of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved drugs in the United States are metabolized by the hepatic enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The gene encoding CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic and genetic variation has been shown to impact drug response for many commonly dispensed drugs including opioids and antidepressants. Thus, it is important to understand an individual's CYP2D6 metabolizer status to optimize treatment outcomes for patients taking medications that are metabolized by this enzyme. Consequently, clinical CYP2D6 pharmacogenetic testing is being implemented by a growing number of health centers. Furthermore, clinical guidelines currently recommend adapting therapeutic regimens based on CYP2D6 genotype‐informed phenotype. However, CYP2D6 genetic variation varies considerably across global populations and many allelic variants, or star alleles, are predominantly found in certain ancestral populations. Although CYP2D6 genetic variation has been extensively studied, there is still a paucity of information for many non‐European populations. As has been shown for other pharmacogenes in randomized controlled trials, results from European populations cannot simply be extrapolated to other groups and, in some cases, even has the potential to cause harm. Therefore, enhanced inclusion in pharmacogenetic studies is urgently needed to increase ancestral representation, determine the extent of global CYP2D6 genetic variation (e.g., ancestry‐specific variants), and determine the clinical impact of this variation on clinical treatment outcome. This review highlights knowledge gaps, challenges, and future directions in CYP2D6 pharmacogenomics through a unique pharmacoequity lens to address health inequities that hamper our ability to optimize drug therapy for improved pharmacological outcomes in diverse populations globally.",

Whereas sensitivity of some endogenous biomarkers against at least one clinical transporter inhibitor has frequently been shown, intra‐study comparisons of the extent of effects of inhibitors on different biomarkers are frequently lacking. Moreover, in vivo specificity of such discussed biomarkers has frequently not been studied. We therefore investigated changes of 10 previously described putative biomarkers for inhibition of OCT2/MATEs, as well as 15 previously described putative biomarkers for OATs in human plasma and urine samples of healthy volunteers in response to treatment with 4 inhibitors of transport proteins [verapamil (P‐glycoprotein), rifampin (organic anion transporting polypeptides), cimetidine (OCT2/MATEs), and probenecid (OATs)]. Two of the putative biomarkers had been suggested for both OCT2/MATEs and OATs. All substances were unequivocally identified in an untargeted metabolomics assay. The OCT2/MATE biomarkers choline and trimethylamine N‐oxide were both sensitive and specific (median log2‐fold changes −1.18 in estimated renal elimination and −0.85 in urinary excretion, respectively). For renal OATs, indoleacetyl glutamine and indoleacetic acid (median log2‐fold changes −3.77 and −2.85 in estimated renal elimination, respectively) were the candidates for sensitive and specific biomarkers with the most extensive change, followed by taurine, indolelactic acid, and hypoxanthine. This comprehensive study adds further knowledge on sensitivity and specificity of 23 previously described biomarkers of renal OCT2/MATE‐ and OAT‐mediated DDIs.",

The gut microbiota gains growing interest but limited investigations have evaluated its contribution to TAC PKs. Here, we explore the associations between the gut microbiota composition and TAC PKs. In this pilot cross‐sectional study ( Clinicaltrial.gov NCT04360031 ), we recruited 93 CYP3A5 non‐expressers stabilized kidney transplant recipients. Gut microbiota composition was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, TAC PK parameters were computed, and additional demographic and medical covariates were collected. Associations between PK parameters or diabetic status and the gut microbiota composition, as reflected by α‐ and β‐diversity metrics, were evaluated. Patients with higher TAC area under the curve AUC/(dose/kg) had higher bacterial richness, and TAC PK parameters were associated with specific bacterial taxa (e.g., Bilophila ) and amplicon sequence variant (ASV; e.g., ASV 1508 and ASV 1982 ( Veillonella /unclassified Sporomusaceae ); ASV 664 (unclassified Oscillospiraceae )). Building a multiple linear regression model showed that ASV 1508 (co‐abundant with ASV 1982) and ASV 664 explained, respectively, 16.0% and 4.6% of the interindividual variability in TAC AUC/(dose/kg) in CYP3A5 non‐expresser patients, when adjusting for hematocrit and age. Anaerostipes relative abundance was decreased in patients with diabetes. Altogether, this pilot study revealed unprecedented links between the gut microbiota composition and diversity and TAC PKs in stable kidney transplant recipients. It supports the relevance of studying the gut microbiota as an important contributor to TAC PK variability. Elucidating the causal relationship will offer new perspectives to predict TAC inter‐ and intra‐PK variability.",

Patients with AF aged ≥ 20 years who used DOAC for ≥ 3 days were enrolled. Trough and peak DOAC concentrations were measured and compared with the expected range reported in clinical trials. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to investigate the association between concentration and outcomes. From January 2016 to July 2022, a total of 859 patients were enrolled. Among them, 22.5%, 24.7%, 36.4%, and 16.4% were on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, respectively. Compared with clinical trials, the proportion of DOAC concentrations higher or lower than the expected range were 9.0% and 14.6% for trough, respectively, and 20.9% and 12.1% for peak, respectively. The average follow‐up duration was 2.4 ± 1.6 years. The incidence of stroke and systemic thromboembolism (SSE) was 1.31 per 100‐person years, and low trough concentration predicted SSE (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.78 (1.20, 6.46)). The incidence of major bleeding was 1.64 per 100‐person years, and high trough was associated with major bleeding (HR = 2.63 (1.09, 6.39)). The association between peak concentration and SSE or major bleeding was nonsignificant. Off‐label underdosing (odds ratio (OR) = 2.69 (1.70, 4.26)), once daily DOAC dosing (OR = 3.22 (2.07, 5.01)), and high creatinine clearance (OR = 1.02 (1.01, 1.03)) caused low trough concentration. Contrarily, congestive heart failure was significantly associated with high trough concentration (OR = 1.71 (1.01, 2.92)). In conclusion, trough DOAC concentration measurements should be considered among patients at risk of out‐of‐expected range DOAC concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this analysis was to describe patterns of prescription medication use during pregnancy, including secular trends, with consideration of indication, and distributions of use within demographic subgroups. We conducted a descriptive secondary analysis using data from 9,755 women whose infants served as controls in two large United States case–control studies from 1997–2011 and 2014–2018. After excluding vitamin, herbal, mineral, vaccine, i.v. fluid, and topical products and over‐the‐counter medications, the proportion of women that reported taking at least one prescription medication in the first trimester increased over the study years, from 37% to 50% of women. The corresponding proportions increased with increasing maternal age and years of education, were highest for non‐Hispanic White women (47%) and lowest for Hispanic women (24%). The most common indication for first trimester use of a medication was infection (12–15%). Increases were observed across the years for medications used for indications related to nausea/vomiting, depression/anxiety, infertility, thyroid disease, diabetes, and epilepsy. The largest relative increase in use among women was observed for medications to treat nausea/vomiting, which increased from 3.8% in the earliest years of the study (1997–2001) to 14.8% in 2014–2018, driven in large part by ondansetron use. Prescription medication use in the first trimester of pregnancy is common and increasing. Many medical conditions require treatments among pregnant women, often involving pharmacotherapy, which necessitates consideration of the risk and safety profiles for both mother and fetus.",

    "abstract": "With the promise of a potentially “single dose curative” paradigm, CAR‐T cell therapies have brought a paradigm shift in the treatment and management of hematological malignancies. Both CAR‐T and TCR‐T cell therapies have also made great progress toward the successful treatment of solid tumor indications. The field is rapidly evolving with recent advancements including the clinical development of “off‐the‐shelf” allogeneic CAR‐T therapies that can overcome the long and difficult “vein‐to‐vein” wait time seen with autologous CAR‐T therapies. There are unique clinical pharmacology, pharmacometric, bioanalytical, and immunogenicity considerations and challenges in the development of these CAR‐T and TCR‐T cell therapies. Hence, to help accelerate the development of these life‐saving therapies for the patients with cancer, experts in this field came together under the umbrella of International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ) to form a joint working group between the Clinical Pharmacology Leadership Group (CPLG) and the Translational and ADME Sciences Leadership Group (TALG). In this white paper, we present the IQ consortium perspective on the best practices and considerations for clinical pharmacology and pharmacometric aspects toward the optimal development of CAR‐T and TCR‐T cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring endogenous biomarkers is increasingly used to evaluate transporter‐mediated drug–drug interactions (DDIs) in early drug development and may be applied to elucidate changes in transporter activity in disease. 4‐pyridoxic acid (PDA) has been identified as the most sensitive plasma endogenous biomarker of renal organic anion transporters (OAT1/3). Increase in PDA baseline concentrations was observed after administration of probenecid, a strong clinical inhibitor of OAT1/3 and also in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to develop and verify a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of PDA, to predict the magnitude of probenecid DDI and predict the CKD‐related changes in PDA baseline. The PBPK model for PDA was first developed in healthy population, building on from previous population pharmacokinetic modeling, and incorporating a mechanistic kidney model to consider OAT1/3‐mediated renal secretion. Probenecid PBPK model was adapted from the Simcyp database and re‐verified to capture its dose‐dependent pharmacokinetics ( n = 9 studies). The PBPK model successfully predicted the PDA plasma concentrations, area under the curve, and renal clearance in healthy subjects at baseline and after single/multiple probenecid doses. Prospective simulations in severe CKD predicted successfully the increase in PDA plasma concentration relative to healthy (within 2‐fold of observed data) after accounting for 60% increase in fraction unbound in plasma and additional 50% decline in OAT1/3 activity beyond the decrease in glomerular filtration rate. The verified PDA PBPK model supports future robust evaluation of OAT1/3 DDI in drug development and increases our confidence in predicting exposure and renal secretion in patients with CKD.",

    "abstract": "The use of data from randomized clinical trials to justify treatment decisions for real‐world patients is the current state of the art. It relies on the assumption that average treatment effects from the trial can be extrapolated to patients with personal and/or disease characteristics different from those treated in the trial. Yet, because of heterogeneity of treatment effects between patients and between the trial population and real‐world patients, this assumption may not be correct for many patients. Using machine learning to estimate the expected conditional average treatment effect (CATE) in individual patients from observational data offers the potential for more accurate estimation of the expected treatment effects in each patient based on their observed characteristics. In this review, we discuss some of the challenges and opportunities for machine learning to estimate CATE, including ensuring identification assumptions are met, managing covariate shift, and learning without access to the true label of interest. We also discuss the potential applications as well as future work and collaborations needed to further improve identification and utilization of CATE estimates to increase patient benefit.",

We investigated the association of measurements at 1 year and repeated measurements of real‐world Tac‐trough levels (C 0 ) and abbreviated area under the curve from zero to 12 hours (AUC 0‐12h ) of Tac and MPA with biopsy‐proven acute rejection (BPAR) between years 1 and 3 post‐transplant in 968 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Thirty‐five (3.6%) out of 968 KTRs experienced BPAR. Both Tac‐AUC 0‐12h (hazard ratio (HR): 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30–0.50, P < 0.001), Tac‐C 0 (HR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.38–0.57, P < 0.001) and MPA‐AUC 0‐12h at 1 year (HR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.68–0.94, P = 0.006), as well as repeated measurements of Tac‐C 0 (HR: 0.70, 95% credibility interval (CrI): 0.61–0.82, P < 0.001), and of MPA‐AUC 0‐12h (HR: 0.75, 95% CrI: 0.62–0.93, P < 0.001) were associated with BPAR. In our population, the recommended target range for Tac‐AUC 0‐12h at 1 year would be 75–95 ng*hour/mL and a Tac‐C 0 5–7 ng/mL. The Tac‐AUC 0‐12h predicted BPAR better than Tac‐C 0 and identified KTRs with over‐ or underexposure despite supposedly adequate Tac‐C 0 . We did not find evidence to recommend another target than the consensus range of 30–60 mg*hour/L for MPA‐AUC 0‐12h after the first year of transplantation. To our knowledge, this is a first study on the simultaneous exposure of Tac and MPA at year 1 and subsequent BPAR up to year 3, which may help define the therapeutic target window for the longer term.",

    "abstract": "Transient receptor potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is an ion channel expressed by sensory neurons, where it mediates pain signaling. Consequently, it has emerged as a promising target for novel analgesics, yet, to date, no TRPA1 antagonists have been approved for clinical use. In the present translational study, we utilized dermal blood flow changes evoked by TRPA1 agonist cinnamaldehyde as a target engagement biomarker to investigate the in vivo pharmacology of LY3526318, a novel TRPA1 antagonist. In rats, LY3526318 (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) dose‐dependently reduced the cutaneous vasodilation typically observed following topical application of 10% v/v cinnamaldehyde. The inhibition was significant at the site of cinnamaldehyde application and also when including an adjacent area of skin. Similarly, in a cohort of 16 healthy human volunteers, LY3526318 administration (10, 30, and 100 mg, p.o.) dose‐dependently reduced the elevated blood flow surrounding the site of 10% v/v cinnamaldehyde application, with a trend toward inhibition at the site of application. Comparisons between both species reveal that the effects of LY3526318 on the cinnamaldehyde‐induced dermal blood flow are greater in rats relative to humans, even when adjusting for cross‐species differences in potency of the compound at TRPA1. Exposure‐response relationships suggest that a greater magnitude response may be observed in humans if higher antagonist concentrations could be achieved. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cinnamaldehyde‐evoked changes in dermal blood flow can be utilized as a target engagement biomarker for TRPA1 activity and that LY3526318 antagonizes the ion channel both in rats and humans.",

PASS assessment reports finalized by PRAC between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021, were compiled from non‐public EMA databases and PASS characteristics were extracted. Of the 93 PASS included, 62.4% aimed to measure healthcare professionals' awareness, knowledge, and behavior regarding RMMs. There were 67.7% of the 93 PASS that used primary data, 24.7% used secondary data sources, and 7.5% used both. A cross‐sectional study design was most frequently applied (77.4%), followed by a cohort study design (29.0%). Nearly 40% of the included PASS did not render a conclusion on RMM effectiveness. Of the 60% that did render a conclusion, 82.1% were deemed effective. Only minor differences in characteristics were found when stratified by outcome (i.e., effective RMM, ineffective RMM, and no conclusion on RMM effectiveness). To conclude, 4 out of 10 PASS assessing impact of RMMs did not render a conclusion on RMM effectiveness. No clear differences in PASS characteristics were found in relation to their outcomes, indicating that additional research is needed to understand better the underlying reasons for PASS being inconclusive.",

Despite this collaboration, the two agencies have their own standards for the format and content of labeling for these populations. To understand these differences, the pregnancy and lactation labeling sections for 31 approved drugs were compared, and trends were assessed for use of language concordance and discordance related to use during pregnancy and lactation between the 2 agencies. Further analysis evaluated the presence of human data included in the labeling. The EMA and the FDA had high discordance between pregnancy and lactation labeling language, in 68% and 71% of labeling, respectively, and only 10% of pregnancy labeling and 16% of lactation labeling include human data. Concordance in labeling language is not the norm but occurs when there is a sizeable body of human data, animal data suggesting a particular safety issue, drug mechanism of action information, or disease‐specific considerations. This study highlights the need for more human data to inform prescribing decisions in these populations. The results also suggest that there is an opportunity for alignment in labeling across regions.",

    "abstract": "The antiretroviral drug efavirenz remains widely used in children and mothers during breastfeeding in tuberculosis‐endemic areas. Evaluating the safety of efavirenz during breastfeeding requires an understanding of its pharmacokinetics (PKs) in breast milk, its exposure in the breastfed infant, and the potential influence of polymorphisms in drug disposition genes. The interplay of these factors between the mother and the nursing infant is a complex scenario that can be readily investigated using physiologically‐based PK (PBPK) modeling. A verified PBPK model for efavirenz describing the CYP3A4‐ and CYP2B6‐mediated auto‐induction during multiple dosing was reported previously and was applied in this study to predict the exposure of efavirenz in vulnerable populations, including children (down to the age of 3 months), mothers, and breastfeeding infants, accounting for the various CYP2B6 genotypes. Predicted pharmacokinetic parameters for mothers, breastfeeding infants, and children aged ≥ 3 months were reasonably consistent with observed data, irrespective of CYP2B6 genotype. The clinically significant trend toward higher infant efavirenz exposure from GG/GG to TT/TT composite maternal/infant CYP2B6 genotypes was captured reasonably well by the PBPK model. Thereafter, simulations were performed to determine the adequacy of the current World Health Organization (WHO; ≥ 3 years) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA; ≥ 3 months) weight‐based dosing regimens for efavirenz in children according to CYP2B6 genotype. The findings of this study indicate that PBPK models can be used in designing studies in vulnerable populations and providing guidance on optimal doses based on developmental physiology and pharmacogenetics.",

    "abstract": "Grapefruit is a moderate to strong inactivator of CYP3A4, which metabolizes up to 50% of marketed drugs. The inhibitory effect is mainly attributed to furanocoumarins present in the fruit, irreversibly inhibiting preferably intestinal CYP3A4 as suicide inhibitors. Effects on CYP3A4 victim drugs can still be measured up to 24 hours after grapefruit juice (GFJ) consumption. The current study aimed to establish a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) grapefruit‐drug interaction model by modeling the relevant CYP3A4 inhibiting ingredients of the fruit to simulate and predict the effect of GFJ consumption on plasma concentration‐time profiles of various CYP3A4 victim drugs. The grapefruit model was developed in PK‐Sim and coupled with previously developed PBPK models of CYP3A4 substrates that were publicly available and already evaluated for CYP3A4‐mediated drug–drug interactions. Overall, 43 clinical studies were used for model development. Models of bergamottin (BGT) and 6,7‐dihydroxybergamottin (DHB) as relevant active ingredients in GFJ were established. Both models include: (i) CYP3A4 inactivation informed by in vitro parameters, (ii) a CYP3A4 mediated clearance estimated during model development, as well as (iii) passive glomerular filtration. The final model successfully describes interactions of GFJ ingredients with 10 different CYP3A4 victim drugs, simulating the effect of the CYP3A4 inactivation on the victims' pharmacokinetics as well as their main metabolites. Furthermore, the model sufficiently captures the time‐dependent effect of CYP3A4 inactivation as well as the effect of grapefruit ingestion on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 concentrations.",

Although other clinically relevant drug uptake and efflux transporters have been discussed in ITC white papers, they have been excluded from further recommendation by the ITC and are not included in current regulatory guidances. These include the ubiquitously expressed equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT) 1 and ENT2, which have been recognized by the ITC for their potential role in clinically relevant nucleoside analog drug interactions for patients with cancer. Although there is comparatively limited clinical evidence supporting their role in DDI risk or other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) compared with the nine highlighted transporters, several in vitro and in vivo studies have identified ENT interactions with non‐nucleoside/non‐nucleotide drugs, in addition to nucleoside/nucleotide analogs. Some noteworthy examples of compounds that interact with ENTs include cannabidiol and selected protein kinase inhibitors, as well as the nucleoside analogs remdesivir, EIDD‐1931, gemcitabine, and fialuridine. Consequently, DDIs involving the ENTs may be responsible for therapeutic inefficacy or off‐target toxicity. Evidence suggests that ENT1 and ENT2 should be considered as transporters potentially involved in clinically relevant DDIs and ADRs, thereby warranting further investigation and regulatory consideration.",

Nirmatrelvir co‐packaged with ritonavir (as PAXLOVID) received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on December 22, 2021, as an oral treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and subsequent new drug application approval on May 25, 2023. Pharmacokinetic (PK) capillary blood sampling at‐home using Tasso‐M20 micro‐volumetric sampling device was implemented in the program, including three phase II/III outpatient and several clinical pharmacology studies supporting the EUA. The at‐home sampling complemented venous blood sampling procedures to enrich the PK dataset, to decrease the need for patients' site visit for PK sampling, and to allow different sampling approaches for flexibility and convenience. To demonstrate concordance/equivalence, bridging between venous plasma and Tasso dried blood results was conducted by comparing concentrations and derived PK parameters from both sampling approaches. In addition, a two‐compartment population PK model was utilized to bridge the plasma and Tasso data by estimating the PK parameters using blood‐to‐plasma ratio as a slope parameter. Operational challenges were successfully managed to implement at‐home PK sampling in global phase II/III trials. Sample quality was generally very good with less than 3% samples deemed as “not usable” from over 800 samples collected in all the studies. Experience gained from sites and patients will guide future broader implementations.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). Two BCMA‐directed CAR T‐cell products — idecabtagene vicleucel (ide‐cel) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta‐cel) — have received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for patients with relapsed/refractory MM who underwent four or more prior lines of therapy (including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti‐CD38 monoclonal antibody). Despite producing unprecedented response rates in an otherwise difficult to treat patient population, CAR T‐cell therapies are commonly associated with immune‐related adverse events (e.g., cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity), cytopenias, and infections. Moreover, many patients continue to exhibit relapse post‐treatment, with resistance mechanisms yet to be fully understood. Ongoing basic, translational, and clinical research efforts are poised to generate deeper insights into the optimal utilization of these therapies, improve their efficacy, minimize associated toxicity, and identify new target antigens in patients with MM.",

    "abstract": "The P‐glycoprotein efflux pump, encoded by the ABCB1 gene, has been shown to alter concentrations of various antidepressants in the brain. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to investigate the association between six ABCB1 single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs1045642, rs2032582, rs1128503, rs2032583, rs2235015, and rs2235040) and antidepressant treatment outcomes in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), including new data from the Canadian Biomarker and Integration Network for Depression (CAN‐BIND‐1) cohort. For the CAN‐BIND‐1 sample, we applied regression models to investigate the association between ABCB1 SNPs and antidepressant treatment response, remission, tolerability, and antidepressant serum levels. For the meta‐analysis, we systematically summarized pharmacogenetic evidence of the association between ABCB1 SNPs and antidepressant treatment outcomes. Studies were included in the meta‐analysis if they investigated at least one ABCB1 SNP in individuals with MDD treated with at least one antidepressant. We did not find a significant association between ABCB1 SNPs and antidepressant treatment outcomes in the CAN‐BIND‐1 sample. A total of 39 studies were included in the systematic review. In the meta‐analysis, we observed a significant association between rs1128503 and treatment response (T vs. C‐allele, odds ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval = 1.15–1.48, P value (adjusted) = 0.024, n = 2,526). We did not find associations among the six SNPs and treatment remission nor tolerability. Our findings provide limited evidence for an association between common ABCB1 SNPs and antidepressant outcomes, which do not support the implementation of ABCB1 genotyping to inform antidepressant treatment at this time. Future research, especially on rs1128503, is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Although the United States and Europe have shifted to the prescription use of oral diclofenac due to several serious incidences of cardiotoxicity, it is one of the most commonly used over‐the‐counter (OTC) pain medicines in major parts of the world. We elucidated the quantitative and tissue‐specific contribution of uridine diphosphate‐glucuronosyltransferases 17 (UGT2B17) in diclofenac metabolism and pharmacokinetics (PK). UGT2B17 is one of most deleted genes in humans with the gene deletion frequency ranging from ~ 20% in White population to 90% in Japanese population. The human intestinal and liver microsomes isolated from the high‐UGT2B17 expressing individuals showed 21‐ and 4‐fold greater rate of diclofenac glucuronide (DG) formation than in the null‐UGT2B17 carriers, respectively. The greater contribution of intestinal UGT2B17 was confirmed by a strong correlation ( R = 0.78, P < 0.001) between UGT2B17 abundance and DG formation in individual intestinal microsomes ( n = 14). However, because UGT2B17 is a minor UGT isoform in the liver, DG formation rate correlated better with the expression of UGT2B7. The proteomics‐informed physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model explains the reported higher exposure of diclofenac in women consistent with ~ 3‐fold lower expression of UGT2B17. Similarly, our in silico predictions also corroborate with the reported higher exposure and lower standard clinical dose of diclofenac in Japanese population. Therefore, variable UGT2B17 mediated metabolism of oral diclofenac is a cause of concern, especially in the developing countries where it is still used as an OTC drug. The ontogeny data of UGTs in human hepatocytes can be utilized in developing PBPK models for predicting PK in the pediatric population.",

    "abstract": "Since 2006, the European conditional marketing authorization (CMA) aims to facilitate timely patient access to medicinal products for which there is an unmet medical need by accepting less comprehensive data than normally required. The granting of CMA requires a positive benefit–risk balance, unmet medical needs to be fulfilled, likely submission of comprehensive data postauthorization, and the benefit of immediate availability to outweigh the risks of data noncomprehensiveness. Since its first use, more than half of all CMAs represent (hemato‐)oncology indications. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the conditions in which CMA has been applied for anticancer medicinal products and whether they have changed over time. We retrospectively assessed the European public assessment reports of the 30 anticancer medicinal products granted CMA in 2006–2020 (51% of all 59 CMAs). Comparison of 2006–2013 to 2014–2020 highlighted increased proportions of proactively requested CMAs (+40%), medicinal products that addressed unmet medical needs by providing a major therapeutic advantage over authorized treatments (+38%), and orphan designated indications (+32%). In contrast, it showed decreased proportions of medicinal products for which a scientific advisory group was consulted (−55%) and phase III randomized controlled trial data were available (−38%). This suggests that applicants and the European Medicines Agency have learned how to use the CMA as a regulatory tool, among others, through better planning and proactive interaction. However, the increasing number of granted CMAs complicates the establishment of unmet medical need and the benefit–risk balance, especially in crowded indications and when only phase II uncontrolled trials are available.",

    "abstract": "A novel haplotype composed of two non‐coding variants, CYP2C18 NM_000772.3:c.*31T (rs2860840) and NM_000772.2:c.819+2182G (rs11188059), referred to as “ CYP2C:TG ,” was recently associated with ultrarapid metabolism of various CYP2C19 substrates. As the underlying mechanism and clinical relevance of this effect remain uncertain, we analyzed existing in vivo and in vitro data to determine the magnitude of the CYP2C:TG haplotype effect. We assessed variability in pharmacokinetics of CYP2C19 substrates, including citalopram, sertraline, voriconazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole in 222 healthy volunteers receiving one of these six drugs. We also determined its impact on CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, and CYP2C19 protein abundance in 135 human liver tissue samples, and on CYP2C18/CYP2C19 activity in vitro usin g N ‐desmethyl atomoxetine formation. No effects were observed according to CYP2C:TG haplotype or to CYP2C19*1 + TG alleles (i.e., CYP2C19 alleles containing the CYP2C:TG haplotype). In contrast, CYP2C19 intermediate (e.g., CYP2C19*1/*2 ) and poor metabolizers (e.g., CYP2C19*2/*2 ) showed significantly higher exposure in vivo , lower CYP2C19 protein abundance in human liver microsomes, and lower activity in vitro compared with normal, rapid (i.e., CYP2C19*1/*17 ), and ultrarapid metabolizers (i.e., CYP2C19*17/*17 ). Moreover, a tendency toward lower exposure was observed in ultrarapid metabolizers compared with rapid metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Furthermore, when the CYP2C19*17 allele was present, CYP2C18 protein abundance was increased suggesting that genetic variation in CYP2C19 may be relevant to the overall metabolism of certain drugs by regulating not only its expression levels, but also those of CYP2C18. Considering all available data, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence supporting clinical CYP2C:TG testing to inform drug therapy.",

    "abstract": "Gabapentin is prescribed for pain and is perceived as safe generally. However, gabapentin can cause respiratory depression, exacerbated by concomitant central nervous system depressants (e.g., opioids), a concern for vulnerable populations. We compared mortality rates among new users of either gabapentin or duloxetine with or without concurrent opioids in the 20% Medicare sample. We conducted a new‐user design retrospective cohort study, in Medicare enrollees ages 65–89 years with noncancer chronic pain and no severe illness who filled prescriptions between 2015 and 2018 for gabapentin ( n = 233,060) or duloxetine ( n = 34,009). Daily opioid doses, estimated in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), were classified into none, low (0 < MME < 50), and high (≥ 50 MME), based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. The outcomes were all‐cause mortality (primary) and out‐of‐hospital mortality (secondary). We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for differences between gabapentin and duloxetine users. During 116,707 person‐years of follow‐up, 1,379 patients died. All‐cause mortality rate in gabapentin users was 12.16 per 1,000 person‐years vs. 9.94 per 1,000 in duloxetine users. Risks were similar for users with no concurrent opioids (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80–1.31) or low‐dose daily opioids (aHR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.63–1.76). However, gabapentin users receiving concurrent high‐dose daily opioids had an increased rate of all‐cause mortality compared with duloxetine users on high‐dose opioids (aHR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.19–3.46). Out‐of‐hospital mortality yielded similar results. In this retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries, concurrent use of high‐dose opioids and gabapentin was associated with a higher all‐cause mortality risk than that for concurrent use of high‐dose opioids and duloxetine.",

    "abstract": "Anti‐tumor necrosis factor (anti‐TNF) agents are widely applied for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the timing of the last dosing for IBD pregnancy and time to elimination in anti‐TNF agent‐exposed infants is controversial. This study aimed to determine the optimal timing for the last dosing of anti‐TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab) in pregnant women with IBD, as well as to investigate the recommended vaccine schedules for infants exposed to these drugs. A physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of anti‐TNF agents was built for adults and extrapolated to pregnant patients, fetuses, and infants. The PBPK models successfully predicted and verified the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab in pregnancy, fetuses, and infants. The predicted PK data were within two‐fold of the observed data. The simulated results were used as timing advice. According to the dose of administration, the suggested timing of the last dosing for infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab is successfully provided based on PBPK predictions. PBPK models indicated that, for infants, the advocated timing of vaccination is 12, 8, and 5 months after birth for infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab, respectively. Our study illustrated that PBPK models can provide a valuable tool to predict the PKs of large macromolecules in pregnant women, fetuses, and infants, ultimately informing drug‐treatment decisions for pregnancy and vaccination regimens for infants.",

Although there is a surge in NLP usage across various industries in recent years, NLP has not been widely evaluated and utilized to support drug development. To demonstrate how advanced NLP can expedite the extraction and analyses of information to help address clinical pharmacology questions, inform clinical trial designs, and support drug development, three use cases are described in this article: (1) dose optimization strategy in oncology, (2) common covariates on pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in oncology, and (3) physiologically‐based PK (PBPK) analyses for regulatory review and product label. The NLP workflow includes (1) preparation of source files, (2) NLP model building, and (3) automation of data extraction. The Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) documents, US package inserts (USPI), and approval letters from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were used as our source data. As demonstrated in the three example use cases, advanced NLP can expedite the extraction and analyses of large amounts of information from regulatory review documents to help address important clinical pharmacology questions. Although this has not been adopted widely, integrating advanced NLP into the clinical pharmacology workflow can increase efficiency in extracting impactful information to advance drug development.",

    "abstract": "Regulators are faced with many challenges surrounding health data usage, including privacy, fragmentation, validity, and generalizability, especially in the European Union, for which synthetic data may provide innovative solutions. Synthetic data, defined as data artificially generated rather than captured in the real world, are increasingly being used for healthcare research purposes as a proxy to real‐world data (RWD). Currently, there are barriers particularly challenging in Europe, where sharing patient's data is strictly regulated, costly, and time‐consuming, causing delays in evidence generation and regulatory approvals. Recent initiatives are encouraging the use of synthetic data in regulatory decision making and health technology assessment to overcome these challenges, but synthetic data have still to overcome realistic obstacles before their adoption by researchers and regulators in Europe. Thus, the emerging use of RWD and synthetic data by pharmaceutical and medical device industries calls regulatory bodies to provide a framework for proper evidence generation and informed regulatory decision making. As the provision of data becomes more ubiquitous in scientific research, so will innovations in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and generation of synthetic data, making the exploration and intricacies of this topic all the more important and timely. In this review, we discuss the potential merits and challenges of synthetic data in the context of decision making in the European regulatory environment. We explore the current uses of synthetic data and ongoing initiatives, the value of synthetic data for regulatory purposes, and realistic barriers to the adoption of synthetic data in healthcare.",

To bridge this gap, physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a scientifically well‐founded tool that can be used to enable model‐informed dosing (MID) recommendations in children in clinical practice. In this tutorial, we provide a pragmatic, PBPK‐based pediatric modeling workflow. For this approach to be successfully implemented in pediatric clinical practice, a thorough understanding of the model assumptions and limitations is required. More importantly, careful evaluation of an MID approach within the context of overall benefits and the potential risks is crucial. The tutorial is aimed to help modelers, researchers, and clinicians, to effectively use PBPK simulations to support pediatric drug dosing.",

Three frequentist statistical borrowing methods were evaluated: a two‐step Cox model, a fixed Cox model, and propensity score‐integrated composite likelihood (“Methods 1–3”). The experimental treatment effect for hybrid control designs were evaluated using hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) estimated from the Cox models accounting for covariate differences. The reduction in study duration compared to the RCT was also evaluated. All three statistical borrowing methods achieved comparable experimental treatment effects to that observed in the CheckMate‐057 clinical trial, with HRs of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.92), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.91), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.88) for Methods 1–3, respectively. Reduction in study duration time was 99–115 days when borrowing 30–38 events for Methods 1–3, respectively. This study demonstrated that it is feasible to emulate an RCT using a hybrid control arm design using three frequentist propensity‐score based statistical borrowing methods. Selection of an appropriate, fit‐for‐use RWD cohort is critical to minimizing bias in experimental treatment effect.",

    "abstract": "Rozibafusp alfa (AMG 570) is a first‐in‐class bispecific IgG2‐peptide fusion designed to inhibit inducible T‐cell costimulator ligand (ICOSL) and B‐cell activating factor (BAFF). The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rozibafusp alfa were investigated in two randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical studies: a phase Ia single ascending‐dose study (7–700 mg subcutaneously (s.c.)) in healthy subjects and a phase Ib multiple ascending‐dose study (70–420 mg s.c. every 2 weeks (q2w)) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Rozibafusp alfa exhibited nonlinear PK and dose‐related and reversible dual‐target engagement. Maximal reduction of naïve B cells from baseline (> 40%), reflective of BAFF inhibition, was achieved with rozibafusp alfa exposure (area under the concentration‐time curve from time 0 to time infinity (AUC inf ) and AUC within a dosing interval from day 0 to day 14 (AUC tau )) above 51 and 57 days•μg/mL for the single‐dose (≥ 70 mg) and multiple‐dose studies (≥ 70 mg q2w), respectively. ICOSL receptor occupancy on circulating B cells, a surrogate PD end point for ICOSL inhibition, was directly related to drug concentration. PK/PD analysis showed > 90% RO at rozibafusp alfa ≥ 22.2 μg/mL (≥ 420‐mg single dose or ≥ 210 mg q2w multiple dose), with saturation occurring at higher drug concentrations. These results informed the design and dose selection of a phase IIb study assessing the safety and efficacy of rozibafusp alfa in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus.",

    "abstract": "The promise of transforming digital technologies into treatments is what drives the development of digital therapeutics (DTx), generally known as software applications embedded within accessible technologies—such as smartphones—to treat, manage, or prevent a pathological condition. Whereas DTx solutions that successfully demonstrate effectiveness and safety could drastically improve the life of patients in multiple therapeutic areas, there is a general consensus that generating therapeutic evidence for DTx presents challenges and open questions. We believe there are three main areas where the application of clinical pharmacology principles from the drug development field could benefit DTx development: the characterization of the mechanism of action, the optimization of the intervention, and, finally, its dosing. We reviewed DTx studies to explore how the field is approaching these topics and to better characterize the challenges associated with them. This leads us to emphasize the role that the application of clinical pharmacology principles could play in the development of DTx and to advocate for a development approach that merges such principles from development of traditional therapeutics with important considerations from the highly attractive and fast‐paced world of digital solutions.",

We conducted secondary analyses on pooled data from two randomized phase III clinical trials (NCT02697773 and NCT02709486) conducted in participants with moderate to severe osteoarthritis randomized to subcutaneous placebo ( n = 514) or tanezumab 2.5 mg ( n = 514). We used gradient boosted regression trees to identify variables that predicted Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain subscale scores at Week 16 and marginal plots to determine the directional relationship between each variable category and responses to placebo or tanezumab within the models. We also used Virtual Twins models to identify potential subgroups of response to the active treatment vs. placebo. We found that responses to placebo were predicted by baseline WOMAC Physical Function, baseline WOMAC Pain, the radiographic classification of the index joint, and the standard deviation of diary pain scores at baseline. In contrast, baseline WOMAC Pain along with failure of prior medications, duration of disease, and standard deviation of diary pain scores at baseline were predictive of tanezumab responses as expressed by the WOMAC Pain scores at Week 16. Those who responded to tanezumab vs. placebo were identified based on the radiographic classification of the index joint and either age or smoking status. These secondary‐data analyses identified distinct and common patient‐based variables to predict response to placebo or tanezumab. These findings will inform the design of future clinical trials, helping to move forward clinical pharmacology and translational science.",

    "abstract": "Mavacamten is a first‐in‐class, oral, selective, allosteric, reversible cardiac myosin inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with symptomatic New York Heart Association functional class II–III obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mavacamten is metabolized in the liver, predominantly via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP2C19 (74%), CYP3A4 (18%), and CYP2C9 (8%). A physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed using Simcyp version 19 (Certara, Princeton, NJ). Following model verification, the PBPK model was used to explore the effects of strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inducers, and strong, moderate, and weak CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitors on mavacamten pharmacokinetics (PK) in a healthy population, with the effect of CYP2C19 phenotype predicted for poor, intermediate, normal, and ultrarapid metabolizers. The PBPK model met the acceptance criteria for all verification simulations (> 80% of model‐predicted PK parameters within 2‐fold of those observed clinically). A weak induction effect was predicted when mavacamten was administered with a strong CYP3A4 inducer in poor metabolizers. Moderate reductions in mavacamten exposure were predicted with a strong CYP2C19/CYP3A4 inducer in all CYP2C19 phenotypes. Except for the effect of strong CYP2C19 inhibitors on ultrarapid metabolizers, steady‐state area under plasma concentration–time curve and maximum plasma concentration values were weakly affected (< 2‐fold) or not affected (< 1.25‐fold), regardless of CYP2C19 phenotype. In conclusion, a fit‐for‐purpose PBPK model was developed and verified, which accurately predicted the available clinical data and was used to simulate the potential impact of CYP induction and inhibition on mavacamten PKs, stratified by CYP2C19 phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Virtual patient simulation is increasingly performed to support model‐based optimization of clinical trial designs or individualized dosing strategies. Quantitative pharmacological models typically incorporate individual‐level patient characteristics, or covariates, which enable the generation of virtual patient cohorts. The individual‐level patient characteristics, or covariates, used as input for such simulations should accurately reflect the values seen in real patient populations. Current methods often make unrealistic assumptions about the correlation between patient's covariates or require direct access to actual data sets with individual‐level patient data, which may often be limited by data sharing limitations. We propose and evaluate the use of copulas to address current shortcomings in simulation of patient‐associated covariates for virtual patient simulations for model‐based dose and trial optimization in clinical pharmacology. Copulas are multivariate distribution functions that can capture joint distributions, including the correlation, of covariate sets. We compare the performance of copulas to alternative simulation strategies, and we demonstrate their utility in several case studies. Our work demonstrates that copulas can reproduce realistic patient characteristics, both in terms of individual covariates and the dependence structure between different covariates, outperforming alternative methods, in particular when aiming to reproduce high‐dimensional covariate sets. In conclusion, copulas represent a versatile and generalizable approach for virtual patient simulation which preserve relationships between covariates, and offer an open science strategy to facilitate re‐use of patient data sets.",

A subcutaneous (s.c.) nivolumab formulation with and without recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 enzyme is being evaluated in CheckMate 8KX (NCT03656718). A model‐based analysis was conducted to characterize the PK of nivolumab s.c. and predict systemic exposures after i.v. and s.c. administration to guide dosing regimen selection for nivolumab s.c. A prior i.v. model was modified to incorporate an s.c. extravascular compartment and estimate the absorption rate constant and bioavailability of nivolumab s.c. Serum concentration–time data from 82 patients treated with nivolumab s.c. 720, 960, or 1,200 mg were pooled with existing i.v. data from multiple studies for model development. Prediction‐corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC) plots assessed the model's performance. Stochastic simulations were conducted to predict exposures for i.v. and s.c. administration. The data were described by a two‐compartment model with time‐varying clearance, zero‐order infusion into the central compartment after i.v. dosing, and first‐order absorption from the extravascular compartment after s.c. dosing. The pcVPC suggested that the model adequately described the observed nivolumab s.c. data. Predicted nivolumab exposures at 1,200 mg s.c. every 4 weeks (q4w) were higher than those at the approved dose of 3 mg/kg i.v. q2w and lower than those at the highest tested safe dose of 10 mg/kg i.v. q2w. Nivolumab PK is well‐characterized using the combined s.c./i.v. population PK model. The model‐based analysis facilitated a comprehensive benefit–risk assessment of nivolumab s.c. and informed selection of 1,200 mg s.c. q4w for phase III evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Overall survival is defined as the time since randomization into the clinical trial to event of death or censor (end of trial or follow‐up), and is considered to be the most reliable cancer end point. However, the introduction of second‐line treatment after disease progression could influence survival and be considered a confounding factor. The aim of the current study was to set up a multistate model framework, using data from the IMpower131 study, to investigate the influence of second‐line immunotherapies on overall survival analysis. The model adequately described the transitions between different states in patients with advanced squamous non‐small cell lung cancer treated with or without atezolizumab plus nab‐paclitaxel and carboplatin, and characterized the survival data. High PD‐L1 expression at baseline was associated with a decreased hazard of progression, while the presence of liver metastasis at baseline was indicative of a high risk of disease progression after initial response. The hazard of death after progression was lower for participants who had longer treatment response, i.e., longer time to progression. The simulations based on the final multistate model showed that the addition of atezolizumab to the nab‐paclitaxel and carboplatin regimen had significant improvement in the patients' survival (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% prediction interval: 0.61–0.90 favoring the atezolizumab + nab‐paclitaxel and carboplatin arm). The developed modeling approach can be applied to other cancer types and therapies to provide a better understanding of efficacy of drug and characterizing different states, and investigate the benefit of primary therapy in survival while accounting for the switch to alternative treatment in the case of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Tenofovir diphosphate (TFVdp; an active metabolite of oral HIV pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)) is measured in dried blood spots (DBS) to estimate adherence. However, TFVdp's long half‐life in whole blood may lead to misclassification following a recent change in adherence. PrEP's other metabolite, emtricitabine triphosphate (FTCtp), has a shorter half‐life in whole blood but adherence thresholds are undefined. We characterized DBS TFVdp and FTCtp concentrations across many dosing scenarios. Population pharmacokinetic models were fit to TFVdp and FTCtp DBS concentrations from a directly observed therapy study (NCT03218592). Concentrations were simulated for 90 days of daily dosing followed by 90 days of 1 to 7 doses/week and for event‐driven PrEP (edPrEP) scenarios. Thresholds of 1,000 and 200 fmol/punch, for TFVdp and FTCtp, respectively, were reflective of taking 4 doses/week (a minimum target for effective PrEP in men). TFVdp was < 1,000 fmol/punch for 17 days after initiating daily PrEP and > 1,000 fmol/punch for 62 days after decreasing to 3 doses/week. Respectively, FTCtp was < 200 fmol/punch for 4 days and > 200 fmol/punch for 6 days. Accuracy of edPrEP adherence classification depended on duration between last sex act and DBS sampling for both measures with misclassification ranging from 9–100%. These data demonstrate adherence misclassification by DBS TFVdp for 2 months following a decline in adherence, elucidating the need for FTCtp to estimate recent adherence. We provide proof of principle that individualized interpretation is needed to support edPrEP adherence monitoring. Our collective approach facilitates clinicians' ability to interpret DBS results and administer patient‐centric interventions.",

    "abstract": "Self‐perceived statin‐associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are prevalent, but only a minority is drug‐dependent. Diagnostic biomarkers are not yet identified. The local statin exposure in skeletal muscle tissue may correlate to the adverse effects. We aimed to determine whether atorvastatin metabolites in blood reflect the corresponding metabolite levels in skeletal muscle, and whether genetic variants of statin transporters modulate this relationship. We also addressed atorvastatin metabolites as potential objective biomarkers of SAMS. Muscle symptoms were examined in patients with coronary disease and self‐perceived SAMS during 7 weeks of double‐blinded treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day and placebo in randomized order. A subset of 12 patients individually identified with more muscle symptoms on atorvastatin than placebo (confirmed SAMS) and 15 patients with no difference in muscle symptom intensity (non‐SAMS) attended the present follow‐up study. All received 7 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day followed by 8 weeks without statins. Biopsies from the quadriceps muscle and blood plasma were collected after each treatment period. Strong correlations (rho > 0.7) between muscle and blood plasma concentrations were found for most atorvastatin metabolites. The impact of the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (rs4149056) gene variant on atorvastatin's systemic pharmacokinetics was translated into muscle tissue. The SLCO2B1 c.395G>A (rs12422149) variant did not modulate the accumulation of atorvastatin metabolites in muscle tissue. Atorvastatin pharmacokinetics in patients with confirmed SAMS were not different from patients with non‐SAMS. In conclusion, atorvastatin metabolite levels in skeletal muscle and plasma are strongly correlated, implying that plasma measurements are suitable proxies of atorvastatin exposure in muscle tissue. The relationship between atorvastatin metabolites in plasma and SAMS deserves further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small vesicles deriving from all cell types during cell activation, involved in transcellular communication, and regarded as predictors of vascular damage and of cardiovascular events. We tested the hypothesis that, in patients on chronic low‐dose aspirin treatment for cardiovascular prevention, aspirin may affect the release of EVs within the 24‐hour interval. We enrolled 84 patients, mostly at high or very high cardiovascular risk, on chronic low‐dose aspirin treatment. The numbers of circulating EVs (cEVs) and annexinV+ cEVs ( total , platelet‐derived , endothelial ‐ derived , and leucocyte‐derived ) were assessed immediately before, and after 10 and 24 hours of a witnessed aspirin administration. Platelet cyclooxygenase 1 (COX‐1) recovery was characterized by measuring serum thromboxane B 2 (sTXB 2 ) at the same timepoints. Nine healthy participants were also enrolled. In patients, daily aspirin administration acutely inhibited after 10 hours following aspirin administrations the release of cEVs ( total and leukocyte‐derived ) and annexinV+ cEVs ( total , platelet‐derived , endothelial ‐ derived , and leukocyte‐derived ), with a rapid recovery at 24 hours. The inhibition after 10 hours suggests a COX‐1–dependent mechanism. Interestingly, the slope of platelet‐derived and of annexinV+ platelet‐derived cEVs were both directly related to sTXB 2 slope and COX‐1 messenger RNA, raising the hypothesis that vice versa , cEVs may affect the rate of COX‐1 recovery and the subsequent duration of aspirin effect. In healthy participants, no circadian difference was observed, except for leukocyte‐derived cEVs. Our findings suggest a previously unappreciated effect of aspirin on the kinetics of a subset of cEVs possibly contributing to the cardioprotective effects of this drug.",

    "abstract": "The new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR) introduces important changes in the EU legal framework for companion diagnostics (CDx), including a new risk‐based classification system for in vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs), a first legal definition for CDx and enhanced involvement of notified bodies in the conformity assessment and certification process of CDx. The IVDR also establishes an important link between the assessment of a CDx and the corresponding medicinal product by requiring the notified body to seek a scientific opinion from the medicines regulator on the suitability of the CDx for use with the concerned medicinal product(s) before issuing an IVD certificate. Whereas the IVDR aims at establishing a robust regulatory framework for IVDs, it is also associated with several challenges, such as insufficient capacity of notified bodies and readiness of manufacturers. To ensure timely access for patients to essential IVDs, a progressive roll‐out for this new legislation has been introduced. In addition, the new consultation process for CDx requires increased collaboration and alignment of assessments performed by the different stakeholders involved in this process. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and notified bodies are currently building experience based on the first CDx consultation procedures that have been submitted from January 2022 onward. In the current article, we describe the new European regulatory framework for certification of CDx and highlight several challenges for medicine and CDx co‐development. In addition, we briefly touch upon the interplay between the Clinical Trial Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014 (CTR) and the IVDR.",

    "abstract": "Oncolytic viruses (OVs) represent a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive quantitative models characterizing clinical OV kinetics and distribution to the tumor. In this work, we present a mechanistic modeling framework for V937 OV, after intratumoral (i.t.) or intravascular (i.v.) administration in patients with cancer. A minimal physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic model was built to characterize biodistribution of OVs in humans. Viral dynamics was incorporated at the i.t. cellular level and linked to tumor response, enabling the characterization of a direct OV killing triggered by the death of infected tumor cells and an indirect killing induced by the immune response. The model provided an adequate description of changes in V937 mRNA levels and tumor size obtained from phase I/II clinical trials after V937 administration. The model showed prominent role of viral clearance from systemic circulation and infectivity in addition to known tumor aggressiveness on clinical response. After i.v. administration, i.t. exposure of V937 was predicted to be several orders of magnitude lower compared with i.t. administration. These differences could be overcome if there is high virus infectivity and/or replication. Unfortunately, the latter process could not be identified at the current clinical setting. This work provides insights on selecting optimal OV considering replication rate and infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing Ponatinib Treatment in CP‐CML (OPTIC) was a randomized, phase II dose‐optimization trial of ponatinib in chronic phase‐chronic myeloid leukemia (CP‐CML) resistant to ≥ 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors or with T315I mutation. Patients were randomized to starting doses of 45‐, 30‐, or 15‐mg ponatinib once daily. Patients receiving 45‐ or 30‐mg reduced to 15‐mg upon achievement of ≤ 1% BCR::ABL1 IS (≥ molecular response with 2‐log reduction (MR2)). The exposure‐molecular response relationship was described using a four‐state, discrete‐time Markov model. Time‐to‐event models were used to characterize the relationship between exposure and arterial occlusive events (AOEs), grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Increasing systemic exposures were associated with increasing probability of transitioning from no response to ≥ MR1, and from MR1 to ≥ MR1, with odds ratios of 1.63 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06–2.73) and 2.05 (95% CI, 1.53–2.89) for a 15‐mg dose increase, respectively. Ponatinib exposure was a significant predictor of AOEs (hazard ratio (HR) 2.05, 95% CI, 1.43–2.93, for a 15‐mg dose increase). In the exposure‐safety models for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, exposure was a significant predictor of grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia (HR 1.31, 95% CI, 1.05–1.64, for a 15‐mg dose increase). Model‐based simulations predicted a clinically meaningful higher rate of ≥ MR2 response at 12 months for the 45‐mg starting dose (40.4%) vs. 30‐mg (34%) and 15‐mg (25.2%). The exposure–response analyses supported a ponatinib starting dose of 45 mg with reduction to 15 mg at response for patients with CP‐CML.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenetics can improve clinical outcomes by reducing adverse drug effects and enhancing therapeutic efficacy for commonly used drugs that treat a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. One of the major barriers to the clinical implementation of cardiovascular pharmacogenetics is limited education on this field for current healthcare providers and students. The abundance of pharmacogenetic literature underscores its promise, but it can also be challenging to learn such a wealth of information. Moreover, current clinical recommendations for cardiovascular pharmacogenetics can be confusing because they are outdated, incomplete, or inconsistent. A myriad of misconceptions about the promise and feasibility of cardiovascular pharmacogenetics among healthcare providers also has halted clinical implementation. Therefore, the main goal of this tutorial is to provide introductory education on the use of cardiovascular pharmacogenetics in clinical practice. The target audience is any healthcare provider (or student) with patients that use or have indications for cardiovascular drugs. This tutorial is organized into the following 6 steps: (1) understand basic concepts in pharmacogenetics; (2) gain foundational knowledge of cardiovascular pharmacogenetics; (3) learn the different organizations that release cardiovascular pharmacogenetic guidelines and recommendations; (4) know the current cardiovascular drugs/drug classes to focus on clinically and the supporting evidence; (5) discuss an example patient case of cardiovascular pharmacogenetics; and (6) develop an appreciation for emerging areas in cardiovascular pharmacogenetics. Ultimately, improved education among healthcare providers on cardiovascular pharmacogenetics will lead to a greater understanding for its potential in improving outcomes for a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "During systemic inflammation, pro‐inflammatory cytokines alter metabolism and transport of drugs affecting the clinical outcome. We used an in vivo like human 3D liver spheroid model to study the effects and mechanisms of pro‐inflammatory cytokines on the expression of 9 different genes encoding enzymes responsible for the metabolism of > 90% of clinically used drugs. Treatment of spheroids with pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of IL‐1β, IL‐6, or TNFα resulted in a pronounced decrease in mRNA expression of CYP3A4 and UGT2B10 within 5 hours. The reduction of CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , and CYP2D6 mRNA expression was less pronounced, whereas the pro‐inflammatory cytokines caused increased CYP2E1 , and UGT1A3 mRNA expression. The cytokines did not influence expression of key nuclear proteins, nor the activities of specific kinases involved in the regulation of genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes. However, ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, inhibited the IL‐6 dependent increase in CYP2E1 and the decrease in CYP3A4 and UGT2B10 mRNA expression. We evaluated the effect of TNFα in hepatocytes in 2D plates and found a rapid decrease in drug‐metabolizing enzyme mRNA both in the absence or presence of the cytokines. Taken together, these data suggest that pro‐inflammatory cytokines regulate multiple gene‐ and cytokine‐specific events seen in in vivo and in 3D but not in 2D liver models. We propose that the 3D spheroid system is suitable for the prediction of drug metabolism under conditions of inflammation and constitutes a versatile system for short‐ and long‐term preclinical and mechanistic studies of cytokine‐induced changes in drug metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The promise of viral vector‐based gene therapy (GT) as a transformative paradigm for treating severely debilitating and life‐threatening diseases is slowly coming to fruition with the recent approval of several drug products. However, they have a unique mechanism of action often necessitating a tortuous clinical development plan. Expertise in such complex therapeutic modality is still fairly limited in this emerging class of adeno‐associated virus (AAV) vector‐based gene therapies. Because of the irreversible mode of action and incomplete understanding of genotype–phenotype relationship and disease progression in rare diseases careful considerations should be given to GT product's benefit–risk profile. In particular, special attention needs to be paid to safe dose selection, reliable dose exposure response (including clinically relevant endpoints), or creative approaches in study design targeting small patient populations during clinical development. We believe that quantitative tools encompassed within model‐informed drug development (MIDD) framework fits quite well in the development of such novel therapies, as they enable us to benefit from the totality of data approach in order to support dose selection as well as optimize clinical trial designs, end point selection, and patient enrichment. In this thought leadership paper, we provide our collective experiences, identify challenges, and suggest areas of improvement in applications of modeling and innovative trial design in development of AAV‐based GT products and reflect on the challenges and opportunities for incorporating MIDD tools and more in rational development of these products.",

    "abstract": "The decentralized clinical trial (DCT) approach is increasingly recognized as a means to accelerate the development of potential therapeutic interventions. DCTs have a crucial advantage over traditional clinical trials: patients are monitored in their environment using technology (e.g., wearables), that capture data as they continue in daily life. This narrative review outlines a gap analysis focused on the frameworks and guidance from expert working groups and regulatory agencies for the design and execution of DCTs. Eight DCT elements guided the analysis and summarized the frameworks and guidance: (1) suitability, (2) protocol, (3) investigational medicinal product (IMP) supply, (4) investigators and health care providers, (5) safety, (6) regulatory and ethics, (7) data and technology, and (8) engagement, communication, and advocacy. Based on the gap analysis, two key takeaways were identified: (1) a need for a comprehensive sustainability assessment of each DCT element; and (2) current frameworks and guidance provide recommendations on social sustainability and some on economic sustainability. DCTs are an essential evolution in healthcare research; however, more guidance related to a comprehensive assessment of designing and executing sustainable DCTs is needed. This is especially the case for environmental sustainability, including, for example, carbon footprint and disposal of IMPs and sensors.",

Through analysis of the FDA approvals, several authors have identified methodologic issues commonly discussed by FDA reviewers. However, in our analysis of FDA guidance and use cases, acceptability of RWE also critically depends on whether the characteristics of the clinical development program align with circumstances in which the FDA may have flexibility in considering evidence from real‐world study designs relative to more robust designs. Successful use of RWD requires advance planning to allocate the necessary resources and time to undertake principled epidemiology approaches to study design, data selection, and implementation of analyses as well as address regulatory feedback. Thus, sponsors benefit from early identification of programs in which successful RWD use is more likely, to ensure efficient use of resources required for the next steps of scientific feasibility assessment. We developed SURF, a screening tool intended to help a sponsor decide whether to prioritize resources for further exploring the feasibility of using an RWD approach to meet the FDA's effectiveness evidentiary standards for a particular clinical development program. Here, we provide an analysis of FDA guidance, highlighting the circumstances in which RWD approaches may be most acceptable, and demonstrate the use of this screening tool, including the rationale for its construction, types of evidence needed, and application to publicly available approvals as support of concept.",

    "abstract": "Ticagrelor and rosuvastatin are often used concomitantly after atherothrombotic events. Several cases of rhabdomyolysis during concomitant ticagrelor and rosuvastatin have been reported, suggesting a drug–drug interaction. We showed recently that ticagrelor inhibits breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, 1B3, and 2B1‐mediated rosuvastatin transport in vitro . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ticagrelor on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in humans. In a randomized, crossover study, 9 healthy volunteers ingested a single dose of 90 mg ticagrelor or placebo, followed by a single 10 mg dose of rosuvastatin 1 hour later. Ticagrelor 90 mg or placebo were additionally administered 12, 24, and 36 hours after their first dose. Ticagrelor increased rosuvastatin area under the plasma concentration‐time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration 2.6‐fold (90% confidence intervals: 1.8–3.8 and 1.7–4.0, P = 0.001 and P = 0.003), and prolonged its half‐life from 3.1 to 6.6 hours ( P = 0.009). Ticagrelor also decreased the renal clearance of rosuvastatin by 11% (3%–19%, P = 0.032). The N‐desmethylrosuvastatin:rosuvastatin AUC 0–10h ratio remained unaffected by ticagrelor. Ticagrelor had no effect on the plasma concentrations of the endogenous OATP1B substrates glycodeoxycholate 3‐O‐glucuronide, glycochenodeoxycholate 3‐O‐glucuronide, glycodeoxycholate 3‐O‐sulfate, and glycochenodeoxycholate 3‐O‐sulfate, or the sodium‐taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide substrate taurocholic acid. These data indicate that ticagrelor increases rosuvastatin concentrations more than twofold in humans, probably mainly by inhibiting intestinal BCRP. Because the risk for rosuvastatin‐induced myotoxicity increases along with rosuvastatin plasma concentrations, using ticagrelor concomitantly with high doses of rosuvastatin should be avoided.",

We aim to explore the AE induced by sacituzumab govitecan by mining the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The association between sacituzumab govitecan and AEs was evaluated using the information component. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted for all identified signals to explore the risk factors associated with AEs leading to hospitalization. In total, 1,884 reports related to sacituzumab govitecan were retrieved, and 114 AE signals involving 20 systems were identified. The median time for onset of AEs was ~ 6–7 days after initiating treatment with sacituzumab govitecan, with over 80% of AEs occurring within 30 days. Subgroup analysis revealed that 14 signals were reported in men and 110 in women. There were 58 signals reported in patients under 65 following the use of sacituzumab govitecan, 59 signals in patients over 65, and 31 signals were present in both groups. Multivariable analysis showed that being male and the occurrence of colitis, pneumonitis, febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, sepsis, dehydration, and diarrhea were risk factors leading to hospitalization with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89. Additionally, sensitivity analysis revealed that this study had good robustness. This is the first retrospective analysis based on FAERS to review the safety of sacituzumab govitecan. The results highlight the need to closely monitor adverse reactions such as neutropenia, diarrhea, colitis, and sepsis when using sacituzumab govitecan.",

    "abstract": "Sotatercept, a soluble fusion protein comprising the extracellular domain of activin receptor type IIA linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1, is a first‐in‐class activin signaling inhibitor under development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We evaluated antidrug antibody (ADA) development and determined the effects of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetics (PKs), efficacy, and safety of sotatercept in STELLAR, a multicenter, double‐blind phase III trial (NCT04576988) wherein participants with PAH were randomized 1:1 to receive sotatercept (starting dose 0.3; target dose 0.7 mg/kg) or placebo subcutaneously every 3 weeks in combination with background therapies for ≤ 72 weeks. ADA‐positive (ADA‐POS) participants were identified and characterized for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). PKs, efficacy, and safety were evaluated by ADA and NAb status. Of 162 evaluable participants, 42 (25.9%) were ADA‐POS through week 24, of whom 11 (6.8%) were also NAb‐POS. Median onset of ADAs was 3.29 weeks (interquartile range (IQR): 3.14–6.14), and median duration was 6 weeks (IQR: 3.14–17.86). No clinically meaningful differences were found across subgroups that were ADA‐NEG, ADA‐POS/NAb‐NEG, and ADA‐POS/NAb‐POS, in terms of PKs (sotatercept trough concentration over time, mean postdose trough concentration at the end of treatment, and clearance), efficacy (changes from baseline in 6‐minute walk distance, pulmonary vascular resistance, and N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide levels), and safety (incidence of hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reactions, and administration site reactions). We conclude that ADA incidence from sotatercept treatment was 25.9% and did not meaningfully affect the PKs, efficacy, or safety of sotatercept in participants with PAH.",

    "abstract": "Tissue drug concentrations determine the efficacy and toxicity of drugs. When a drug is the substrate of transporters that are present at the blood:tissue barrier, the steady‐state unbound tissue drug concentrations cannot be predicted from their corresponding plasma concentrations. To accurately predict transporter‐modulated tissue drug concentrations, all clearances (CLs) mediating the drug's entry and exit (including metabolism) from the tissue must be accurately predicted. Because primary cells of most tissues are not available, we have proposed an alternative approach to predict such CLs, that is the use of transporter‐expressing cells/vesicles (TECs/TEVs) and relative expression factor (REF). The REF represents the abundance of the relevant transporters in the tissue vs. in the TECs/TEVs. Here, we determined the transporter‐based intrinsic CL of glyburide (GLB) and pitavastatin (PTV) in OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, and NTCP‐expressing cells and MRP3‐, BCRP‐, P‐gp‐, and MRP2‐expressing vesicles and scaled these CLs to in vivo using REF. These predictions fell within a priori set twofold range of the hepatobiliary CLs of GLB and PTV, estimated from their hepatic positron emission tomography imaging data: 272.3 and 607.8 mL/min for in vivo hepatic sinusoidal uptake CL, 47.8 and 17.4 mL/min for sinusoidal efflux CL, and 0 and 4.20 mL/min for biliary efflux CL, respectively. Moreover, their predicted hepatic concentrations (area under the hepatic concentration‐time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration ( C max )), fell within twofold of their mean observed data. These data, together with our previous findings, confirm that the REF approach can successfully predict transporter‐based drug CLs and tissue concentrations to enhance success in drug development.",

    "abstract": "Drug – target – drug complexes (DTDCs) are phenomena newly observed in patients who switch from the complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor eculizumab to crovalimab, a novel, anti‐C5 antibody in development for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), because these agents bind to different C5 epitopes. In Part 3 of the four‐part, phase I/II COMPOSER study, 19 patients with PNH switching from eculizumab received 1,000‐mg crovalimab intravenously, then subcutaneous maintenance doses from Day 8 (680 mg every 4 weeks (q4w), 340 mg every 2 weeks, or 170 mg every week). Crovalimab exposure was transiently reduced, and size‐exclusion chromatography and crovalimab‐specific enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays revealed DTDCs in all 19 patients' sera. Additionally, self‐limiting mild to moderate symptoms suggestive of type III hypersensitivity reactions occurred in two patients. Mathematical modeling simulations of DTDC kinetics and effects of dosing on DTDC size distribution using Part 3 data predicted that increased crovalimab concentrations could reduce the proportion of large, slow‐clearing DTDCs in the blood. A simulation‐guided, optimized crovalimab regimen (1,000 mg intravenously; four weekly, subcutaneous 340‐mg doses; then 680 mg q4w from Day 29) was evaluated in Part 4. Confirming the model's predictions, mean proportions of large DTDCs in patients who switched from eculizumab to this optimized regimen decreased by > 50% by Day 22, and target crovalimab concentrations were maintained. No type III hypersensitivity reactions occurred in Part 4. Optimizing crovalimab dosing thus reduced the proportion of large DTDCs, ensured adequate complement inhibition, and may improve safety. Model‐based dosing optimization to mitigate DTDC formation offers a useful strategy for patients switching to novel antibody treatments targeting soluble epitopes.",

    "abstract": "Genetics are presumed to contribute 30–40% to opioid use disorder (OUD), allowing for the possibility that genetic markers could be used to identify personal risk for developing OUD. We aimed to test the potential association among 180 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 120 of which were related to the dopamine reward pathway and 60 related to pharmacokinetics. Participants were randomly recruited in 2020–2021 in a cross‐sectional genetic association study. Self‐reported health history including Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐5) OUD criteria and buccal swabs were collected. A total of 1,301 participants were included in the analyses for this study. Of included participants, 250 met the DSM‐5 criteria for ever having OUD. Logistic regression, adjusting for age and biologic sex, was used to characterize the association between each SNP and DSM‐5 criteria consistent with OUD. Six SNPs found in four genes were associated with OUD: increased odds with CYP3A5 (rs15524 and rs776746) and DRD3 (rs324029 and rs2654754), and decreased odds with CYP3A4 (rs2740574) and CYP1A2 (rs2069514). Homozygotic CYP3A5 (rs15524 and rs776746) had the highest adjusted odds ratio of 2.812 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.737, 4.798) and 2.495 (95% CI 1.670, 3.835), respectively. Variants within the dopamine reward and opioid metabolism pathways have significant positive ( DRD3 and CYP3A5 ) and negative ( CYP3A4 and CYP1A 2) associations with OUD. Identification of these variants provides promising possibilities for genetic prognostic and therapeutic targets for future investigation.",

    "abstract": "Despite (repeated) boosting, kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) may remain at increased risk of severe COVID‐19 since a substantial number of individuals remain seronegative or with low antibody titers. In particular, mycophenolic acid use has been shown to affect antibody formation negatively and may be an important modifiable risk factor. We investigated the exposure–response relationship between mycophenolic acid 12‐hour area under the curve (AUC 0–12h ) exposure and seroconversion including antibody titers after vaccination using mRNA‐1273 SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine (Moderna) in 316 KTRs from our center that participated in the national Dutch renal patients COVID‐19 vaccination – long term efficacy and safety of SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination in kidney disease patients vaccination study. After two vaccination doses, 162 (51%) KTRs seroconverted. KTRs treated with mycophenolic acid showed less seroconversion and lower antibody titers compared with KTRs without mycophenolic acid (44% vs. 77%, and 36 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL vs. 340 BAU/mL; P < 0.001). The mean mycophenolic acid AUC 0–12h exposure was significantly lower in KTRs who seroconverted compared with KTRs who did not (39 vs. 29 mg⋅h/L; P < 0.001). High mycophenolic acid exposure (±90 mg⋅h/L) and no exposure to mycophenolic acid resulted in a seroconversion rate ranging from 10% to 80%. Every 10 mg⋅h/L increase in mycophenolic acid AUC 0–12h gave an adjusted odds ratio for seroconversion of 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79–0.97; P = 0.010) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85–0.93; P < 0.001) for KTRs on dual and triple maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, respectively. Higher mycophenolic acid AUC 0–12h correlated with lower antibody titers (R = 0.44, P < 0.001). This study demonstrates the exposure–response relationship between gold standard mycophenolic acid exposure and antibody formation to support interventional studies investigating mycophenolic acid adjustment to improve antibody formation after further boosting.",

    "abstract": "Disease progression modeling (DPM) represents an important model‐informed drug development framework. The scientific communities support the use of DPM to accelerate and increase efficiency in drug development. This article summarizes International Consortium for Innovation & Quality (IQ) in Pharmaceutical Development mediated survey conducted across multiple biopharmaceutical companies on challenges and opportunities for DPM. Additionally, this summary highlights the viewpoints of IQ from the 2021 workshop hosted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sixteen pharmaceutical companies participated in the IQ survey with 36 main questions. The types of questions included single/multiple choice, dichotomous, rank questions, and open‐ended or free text. The key results show that DPM has different representation, it encompasses natural disease history, placebo response, standard of care as background therapy, and can even be interpreted as pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling. The most common reasons for not implementing DPM as frequently seem to be difficulties in internal cross‐functional alignment, lack of knowledge of disease/data, and time constraints. If successfully implemented, DPM can have an impact on dose selection, reduction of sample size, trial read‐out support, patient selection/stratification, and supportive evidence for regulatory interactions. The key success factors and key challenges of disease progression models were highlighted in the survey and about 24 case studies across different therapeutic areas were submitted from various survey sponsors. Although DPM is still evolving, its current impact is limited but promising. The success of such models in the future will depend on collaboration, advanced analytics, availability of and access to relevant and adequate‐quality data, collaborative regulatory guidance, and published examples of impact.",

    "abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) is commonly taken in overdose and can cause acute liver injury via the toxic metabolite NAPQI formed by cytochrome (CYP) P450 pathway. We aimed to evaluate the concentrations of APAP metabolites on presentation following an acute APAP poisoning and whether these predicted the subsequent onset of hepatotoxicity (peak alanine aminotransferase > 1,000 U/L). The Australian Toxicology Monitoring (ATOM) study is a prospective observational study, recruiting via two poison information centers and four toxicology units. Patients following an acute APAP ingestion presenting < 24 hours post‐ingestion were recruited. Initial samples were analyzed for APAP metabolites, those measured were the nontoxic glucuronide (APAP‐Glu) and sulfate (APAP‐Sul) conjugates and NAPQI (toxic metabolite) conjugates APAP‐cysteine (APAP‐Cys) and APAP‐mercapturate (APAP‐Mer). The primary outcome was hepatotoxicity. In this study, 200 patients were included, with a median ingested dose of 20 g, 191 received acetylcysteine at median time of 5.8 hours post‐ingestion. Twenty‐six patients developed hepatotoxicity, one had hepatotoxicity on arrival (excluded from analysis). Those who developed hepatotoxicity had significantly higher total CYP metabolite concentrations: (36.8 μmol/L interquartile range (IQR): 27.8–51.7 vs. 10.8 μmol/L IQR: 6.9–19.5) and these were a greater proportion of total metabolites (5.4%, IQR: 3.8–7.7) vs. 1.7%, IQR: 1.3–2.6, P < 0.001)]. Furthermore, those who developed hepatotoxicity had lower APAP‐Sul concentrations (49.1 μmol/L, IQR: 24.7–72.2 vs. 78.7 μmol/L, IQR: 53.6–116.4) and lower percentage of APAP‐Sul (6.3%, IQR: 4.6–10.9 vs. 13.1%, IQR, 9.1–20.8, P < 0.001)]. This study found that those who developed hepatotoxicity had higher APAP metabolites derived from CYP pathway and lower sulfation metabolite on presentation. APAP metabolites may be utilized in the future to identify patients who could benefit from increased acetylcysteine or newer adjunct or research therapies.",

    "abstract": "Failure to perform adequate dose adjustment in patients with liver cirrhosis may be associated with increased toxicity. We compared the prediction of area under the curve (AUC) and clearance for the six compounds of the Basel phenotyping cocktail (caffeine, efavirenz, flurbiprofen, omeprazole, metoprolol, and midazolam) using a well‐known physiology‐based pharmacokinetic approach (physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic [PBPK] approach, Simcyp) and a novel top‐down method based on the systemic clearance in healthy volunteers adjusted for markers of liver and renal dysfunction (“top‐down approach”). With few exceptions, plasma concentration‐time curves were accurately predicted by the PBPK approach. In comparison to the measured AUC and clearance of these drugs in patients with liver cirrhosis and healthy controls, except for efavirenz, the estimates of both approaches were within two standard deviations of the mean for total and free drug concentrations. For both approaches, a correction factor for dose adjustment in patients with liver cirrhosis could be calculated for the drugs administered. AUCs calculated using the adjusted doses were comparable to the AUCs measured in control subjects, with slightly more accurate predictions generated by the PBPK approach. For drugs with a free fraction < 50%, predictions using free drug concentrations were more accurate than with total drug concentrations. In conclusion, both methods provided good qualitative predictions of the changes by liver cirrhosis in the pharmacokinetics of the six compounds investigated. The top‐down approach is easier to implement but the PBPK approach predicted changes in drug exposure more accurately than the top‐down approach and provided reliable estimates for plasma concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Trimethoprim is predicted to inhibit several thiamine transporters, including the primary thiamine intestinal absorptive transporter, ThTR‐2, and the hepatic and renal organic cation transporters, OCT1, OCT2, and MATEs. To investigate the effect of trimethoprim on thiamine absorption, studies were conducted in cells, mice, and healthy volunteers and supported by use of real‐world data. In a randomized, crossover clinical study, seven healthy volunteers were given a single oral dose of thiamine or thiamine plus trimethoprim, followed by blood sampling. The thiamine area under the curve (AUC) increased with trimethoprim co‐administration ( P value = 0.031). Similar results were seen in mice. Trimethoprim appeared to act on thiamine absorption through inhibition of hepatic OCT1 as evidenced from its ability to modulate levels of isobutyrylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine, OCT1 biomarkers identified from metabolomic analyses. Real‐world data further supported this finding, showing an association between trimethoprim use and higher levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol, consistent with OCT1 inhibition ( P values: 2.2 × 10 −16 , 5.75 × 10 −7 , and 5.82 × 10 −7 , respectively). These findings suggest that trimethoprim increases plasma levels of thiamine by inhibiting hepatic OCT1. Trimethoprim reduced urinary excretion and clearance of biomarkers for OCT2 and MATEs, consistent with inhibition of renal organic cation transporters. This inhibition did not appear to play a role in the observed increases in thiamine levels. This study highlights the potential for drug‐nutrient interactions involving transporters, in addition to transporters' established role in drug–drug interactions.",

    "abstract": "A different drug–drug interaction (DDI) scenario may exist in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared with healthy volunteers (HVs), depending on the interplay between drug–drug and disease (drug‐drug‐disease interaction (DDDI)). Physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, in lieu of a clinical trial, is a promising tool for evaluating these complex DDDIs in patients. However, the prediction confidence of PBPK modeling in the severe CKD population is still low when nonrenal pathways are involved. More mechanistic virtual disease population and robust validation cases are needed. To this end, we aimed to: (i) understand the implications of severe CKD on statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin) pharmacokinetics (PK) and DDI; and (ii) predict untested clinical scenarios of statin‐roxadustat DDI risks in patients to guide suitable dose regimens. A novel virtual severe CKD population was developed incorporating the disease effect on both renal and nonrenal pathways. Drug and disease PBPK models underwent a four‐way validation. The verified PBPK models successfully predicted the altered PKs in patients for substrates and inhibitors and recovered the observed statin‐rifampicin DDIs in patients and the statin‐roxadustat DDIs in HVs within 1.25‐ and 2‐fold error. Further sensitivity analysis revealed that the severe CKD effect on statins PK is mainly mediated by hepatic BCRP for rosuvastatin and OATP1B1/3 for atorvastatin. The magnitude of statin‐roxadustat DDI in patients with severe CKD was predicted to be similar to that in HVs. PBPK‐guided suitable dose regimens were identified to minimize the risk of side effects or therapeutic failure of statins when co‐administered with roxadustat.",

    "abstract": "Face recognition deficits occur in diseases such as prosopagnosia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and dementias. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether degrading the architecture of artificial intelligence (AI) face recognition algorithms can model deficits in diseases. Two established face recognition models, convolutional‐classification neural network (C‐CNN) and Siamese network (SN), were trained on the FEI faces data set (~ 14 images/person for 200 persons). The trained networks were perturbed by reducing weights (weakening) and node count (lesioning) to emulate brain tissue dysfunction and lesions, respectively. Accuracy assessments were used as surrogates for face recognition deficits. The findings were compared with clinical outcomes from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set. Face recognition accuracy decreased gradually for weakening factors less than 0.55 for C‐CNN, and 0.85 for SN. Rapid accuracy loss occurred at higher values. C‐CNN accuracy was similarly affected by weakening any convolutional layer whereas SN accuracy was more sensitive to weakening of the first convolutional layer. SN accuracy declined gradually with a rapid drop when nearly all nodes were lesioned. C‐CNN accuracy declined rapidly when as few as 10% of nodes were lesioned. CNN and SN were more sensitive to lesioning of the first convolutional layer. Overall, SN was more robust than C‐CNN, and the findings from SN experiments were concordant with ADNI results. As predicted from modeling, brain network failure quotient was related to key clinical outcome measures for cognition and functioning. Perturbation of AI networks is a promising method for modeling disease progression effects on complex cognitive outcomes.",

To explore potential mechanisms underlying this interaction, we used DILIsym, a quantitative systems toxicology model, to predict ALT elevations in a simulated human population treated with CBD alone, VPA alone, and when CBD dosing was starting during treatment with VPA. We gathered in vitro data assessing the potential for CBD, the two major CBD metabolites, and VPA to cause hepatotoxicity via inhibition of bile acid transporters, mitochondrial dysfunction, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic models for CBD and VPA were used to predict liver exposure. DILIsym simulations predicted dose‐dependent ALT elevations from CBD treatment and this was predominantly driven by ROS production from the parent molecule. DILIsym also predicted VPA treatment to cause ALT elevations which were transient when mitochondrial biogenesis was incorporated into the model. Contrary to the clinical experience, simulation of 2 weeks treatment with VPA prior to introduction of CBD treatment did not predict an increase of the incidence of ALT elevations relative to CBD treatment alone. We conclude that the marked increased incidence of CBD‐associated ALT elevations in patients already receiving VPA is unlikely to involve the three major mechanisms of direct hepatotoxicity.",

Several studies have reported predictive values of ICH S7B results for clinical QT C outcomes for small molecules; none has examined peptides and proteins other than monoclonal antibodies. To address this knowledge gap, information for peptides and proteins submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was collected. Results of hERG assays, ventricular repolarization assays, and in vivo QT assessment were compared with clinical QT C study outcomes. The results show that 14% clinical QT C studies for approved and investigational products failed to exclude 10‐ms QT C prolongation. Clinical QT C prolongation for these molecules lacked concentration‐dependence which is expected for hERG block‐mediated mechanism or QT C prolongation could not be excluded due to characterization in the clinical study. The hERG and ventricular repolarization assays do not identify clinical QT C prolongation potential for peptides and proteins. Lack of alignment between hERG and ventricular repolarization assay results and clinical QT C outcomes suggests that the mechanisms of QT C prolongation by some peptides and proteins are unrelated to direct cardiac ion channel block. Similar to large targeted proteins and monoclonal antibodies, peptides and proteins regardless of size have a low likelihood of direct cardiac ion channel interactions. This characteristic supports waiving the requirement for thorough QT assessment for products comprised of naturally occurring amino acids unless proarrhythmia potential is suggested by nonclinical or clinical data.",

    "abstract": "Pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have been associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer, including metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, very few models link survival to longitudinal LDH measured repeatedly over time during treatment. We investigated the prognostic value of on‐treatment LDH dynamics in mCRC. Using data from two large phase III studies (2L and 3L+ mCRC settings, n = 824 and 210, respectively), we found that integrating longitudinal LDH data with baseline risk factors significantly improved survival prediction. Current LDH values performed best, enhancing discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) by 4.5~15.4% and prediction accuracy (Brier score) by 3.9~15.0% compared with baseline variables. Combining all longitudinal LDH markers further improved predictive performance. After controlling for baseline covariates and other longitudinal LDH indicators, current LDH levels remained a significant risk factor in mCRC, increasing mortality risk by over 90% ( P < 0.001) in 2L patients and 60–70% ( P < 0.01) in 3L+ patients per unit increment in current log (LDH). Machine‐learning techniques, like functional principal component analysis (FPCA), extracted informative features from longitudinal LDH data, capturing over 99% of variability and allowing prediction of survival. Unsupervised clustering based on the extracted FPCA features stratified patients into three groups with distinct LDH dynamics and survival outcomes. Hence, our approaches offer a valuable and cost‐effective way for risk stratification and improves survival prediction in mCRC using LDH trajectories.",

    "abstract": "COVID‐19 vaccination is critical in frequently immunocompromised patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, there is a question about the risk of RA flares following vaccination. Our study intended to find out about cases of new RA or flare‐ups in people who already had RA that were reported in French and international pharmacovigilance databases after COVID‐19 vaccination. We performed a “case–noncase” method in the international pharmacovigilance database VigiBase to identify the risk of RA following COVID‐19 vaccination compared with other nonlive vaccines. Using the French Pharmacovigilance Database (FPVD), a descriptive analysis was carried out for RA cases after COVID‐19 immunization and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to compare variables in the new‐onset vs. flare‐up groups. In 2021, 2,387 cases of RA were reported from 2,817,902 adverse drug reactions associated with COVID‐19 vaccines recorded in VigiBase. The reporting odds ratio of RA onset with COVID‐19 vaccines compared with the other nonlive vaccines was 0.66 ( P < 0.0001). The FPVD reported 161 cases of RA with COVID‐19 vaccines, including 77 new‐onset RA and 84 cases of RA flare‐up. In 88 cases (84.7%), RA occurred after the first dose. The mean time between vaccination and disease onset was 14 ± 21 days, and the delay was significantly shorter in the flare‐up group. We do not show a higher risk of RA after COVID‐19 vaccination compared with other nonlive vaccines in adults. De novo RA was more likely to happen quickly, be more severe, and have a worse outcome than flares in patients with RA.",

This analysis investigated the relationship between β‐D‐N4‐hydroxycytidine (NHC) pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes in patients with mild to moderate COVID‐19 in the phase III part of the randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled MOVe‐OUT trial. Logistic regression models of the dependency of outcomes on exposures and covariates were constructed using a multistep process. Influential covariates were identified first using placebo arm data, followed by assessment of exposure‐dependency in drug effect using data from both the placebo and MOV arms. The exposure‐response (E‐R) analysis included 1,313 participants; 630 received MOV and 683 received placebo. Baseline viral load, baseline disease severity, age, weight, viral clade, active cancer, and diabetes were identified as significant determinants of response using placebo data. Absolute measures of viral load on days 5 and 10 were strong on‐treatment predictors of hospitalization. An additive area under the curve (AUC)‐based maximum effect (E max ) model with a fixed Hill coefficient of 1 best represented the exposure‐dependency in drug effect and the AUC50 was estimated to be 19,900 nM hour. Patients at 800 mg achieved near maximal response, which was larger than for 200 or 400 mg. The final E‐R model was externally validated and predicted that the relative reduction in hospitalization with MOV treatment would vary with patient characteristics and factors in the population. In conclusion, the E‐R results support the MOV dose of 800 mg twice daily to treat COVID‐19. Many patient characteristics and factors impacted outcomes beyond drug exposures.",

    "abstract": "Realistic models predicting hepatobiliary processes in health and disease are lacking. We therefore aimed to develop a physiologically relevant human liver model consisting of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of explanted diseased human livers that can assess hepatic extraction, clearance, biliary excretion, and drug–drug interaction (DDI). Eleven livers were included in the study, seven with a cirrhotic and four with a noncirrhotic disease background. After explantation of the diseased liver, NMP was initiated. After 120 minutes of perfusion, a drug cocktail (rosuvastatin, digoxin, metformin, and furosemide; OATP1B1/1B3, P‐gp, BCRP, and OCT1 model compounds) was administered to the portal vein and 120 minutes later, a second bolus of the drug cocktail was co‐administered with perpetrator drugs to study relevant DDIs. The explanted livers showed good viability and functionality during 360 minutes of NMP. Hepatic extraction ratios close to in vivo reported values were measured. Hepatic clearance of rosuvastatin and digoxin showed to be the most affected by cirrhosis with an increase in maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) of 11.50 and 2.89 times, respectively, compared with noncirrhotic livers. No major differences were observed for metformin and furosemide. Interaction of rosuvastatin or digoxin with perpetrator drugs were more pronounced in noncirrhotic livers compared with cirrhotic livers. Our results demonstrated that NMP of human diseased explanted livers is an excellent model to assess hepatic extraction, clearance, biliary excretion, and DDI. Gaining insight into pharmacokinetic profiles of OATP1B1/1B3, P‐gp, BCRP, and OCT1 model compounds is a first step toward studying transporter functions in diseased livers.",

    "abstract": "Regulators and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies are increasingly familiar with, and publishing guidance on, external controls derived from real‐world data (RWD) to generate real‐world evidence (RWE). We recently conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) evaluating publicly available information on the use of RWD‐derived external controls to contextualize outcomes from uncontrolled trials submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and/or select HTA bodies. The review identified several key operational and methodological aspects for which more detailed guidance and alignment within and between regulatory agencies and HTA bodies is necessary. This paper builds on the SLR findings by delineating a set of key takeaways for the responsible generation of fit‐for‐purpose RWE. Practical methodological and operational guidelines for designing, conducting, and reporting RWD‐derived external control studies are explored and discussed. These considerations include: (i) early engagement with regulators and HTA bodies during the study planning phase; (ii) consideration of the appropriateness and comparability of external controls across multiple dimensions, including eligibility criteria, temporality, population representation, and clinical evaluation; (iii) ensuring adequate sample sizes, including hypothesis testing considerations; (iv) implementation of a clear and transparent strategy for assessing and addressing data quality, including data missingness across trials and RWD; (v) selection of comparable and meaningful endpoints that are operationalized and analyzed using appropriate analytic methods; and (vi) conduct of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings in the context of uncertainty and sources of potential bias.",

Tumor growth rate (KG) was estimated for patients in IMbrave151. A pre‐existing TGI‐OS model for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in IMbrave150 was modified to include available IMbrave151 study covariates and KG estimates and used to simulate IMbrave151 study outcomes. At the interim progression‐free survival (PFS) analysis (98 patients, 27 weeks follow‐up), clear separation in tumor dynamic profiles with a faster shrinkage rate and slower KG (0.0103 vs. 0.0117 week −1 ; tumor doubling time 67 vs. 59 weeks; KG geometric mean ratio of 0.84) favoring the bevacizumab containing arm was observed. At the first interim analysis for PFS, the simulated OS hazard ratio (HR) 95% prediction interval (PI) of 0.74 (95% PI: 0.58–0.94) offered an early prediction of treatment benefit later confirmed at the final analysis, observed HR of 0.76 based on 159 treated patients and 34 weeks of follow‐up. This is the first prospective application of a TGI‐OS modeling framework supporting gating of a phase III trial. The findings demonstrate the utility for longitudinal TGI and KG geometric mean ratio as relevant end points in oncology studies to support go/no‐go decision making and facilitate interpretation of the IMbrave151 results to support future development efforts for novel therapeutics for patients with advanced BTC.",

    "abstract": "Flucloxacillin is a widely used antibiotic. It is an agonist to the nuclear receptor PXR that regulates the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Treatment with flucloxacillin reduces warfarin efficacy and plasma concentrations of tacrolimus, voriconazole, and repaglinide. We conducted a translational study to investigate if flucloxacillin induces CYP enzymes. We also investigated if flucloxacillin induces its own metabolism as an autoinducer. We performed a randomized, unblinded, two‐period, cross‐over, clinical pharmacokinetic cocktail study. Twelve healthy adults completed the study. They ingested 1 g flucloxacillin 3 times daily for 31 days, and we assessed the full pharmacokinetics of the Basel cocktail drugs on days 0, 10, and 28, and plasma concentrations of flucloxacillin on days 0, 9, and 27. The 3D spheroid of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) were exposed to flucloxacillin (concentration range: 0.15–250 μM) for 96 hours. Induction of mRNA expression, protein abundance, and enzyme activity of CYP enzymes were assessed. Flucloxacillin treatment reduced the metabolic ratio of midazolam (CYP3A4), (geometric mean ratio (GMR) 10 days (95% confidence interval (CI)): 0.75 (0.64–0.89)) and (GMR 28 days (95% CI): 0.72 (0.62–0.85)). Plasma concentrations of flucloxacillin did not change during 27 days of treatment. Flucloxacillin caused concentration‐dependent induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 (mRNA, protein, and activity), CYP2C9 (mRNA and protein), CYP2C19 (mRNA and activity), and CYP2D6 (activity) in 3D spheroid PHH. In conclusion, flucloxacillin is a weak inducer of CYP3A4, which may lead to clinically relevant drug–drug interactions for some narrow therapeutic range drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use during pregnancy may cause fetal toxicity driven by in utero exposure to (−)‐∆ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its psychoactive metabolite, (±)‐11‐hydroxy‐∆ 9 ‐THC (11‐OH‐THC). THC concentrations in the human term fetal plasma appear to be lower than the corresponding maternal concentrations. Therefore, we investigated whether THC and its metabolites are effluxed by placental transporters using the dual cotyledon, dual perfusion, term human placenta. The perfusates contained THC alone (5 μM) or in combination (100–250 nM) with its metabolites (100 nM or 250 nM 11‐OH‐THC, 100 nM COOH‐THC), plus a marker of P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp) efflux (1 or 10 μM saquinavir), and a passive diffusion marker (106 μM antipyrine). All perfusions were conducted with ( n = 7) or without ( n = 16) a P‐gp/BCRP (breast‐cancer resistance protein) inhibitor, 4 μM valspodar. The maternal‐fetal and fetal‐maternal unbound cotyledon clearance indexes (m‐f‐CL u,c,i and f‐m‐CL u,c,i ) were normalized for transplacental antipyrine clearance. At 5 μM THC, the m‐f‐CL u,c,i , 5.1 ± 2.1, was significantly lower than the f‐m‐CL u,c,i , 13 ± 6.1 ( P = 0.004). This difference remained in the presence of valspodar or when the lower THC concentrations were perfused. In contrast, neither metabolite, 11‐OH‐THC/COOH‐THC, had significantly different m‐f‐CL u,c,i vs. f‐m‐CL u,c,i . Therefore, THC appears to be effluxed by placental transporter(s) not inhibitable by the P‐gp/BCRP antagonist, valspodar, while 11‐OH‐THC and COOH‐THC appear to passively diffuse across the placenta. These findings plus our previously quantified human fetal liver clearance, extrapolated to in vivo , yielded a THC fetal/maternal steady‐state plasma concentration ratio of 0.28 ± 0.09, comparable to that observed in vivo , 0.26 ± 0.10.",

An umbrella review was conducted via electronic databases from January 2020 to April 2022. All SLRs (and meta‐analyses) in English were considered. Data screening and extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. AMSTAR 2 tool was used to assess SLR quality. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD4202232576). Out of 4,564 publications, 171 SLRs were included of which 3 were umbrella reviews. Our primary analysis included 35 SLRs published in 2022, which incorporated studies since the beginning of the pandemic. Consistent findings showed that, for adults, older age, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer were more strongly predictive of risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality due to COVID‐19. Male sex was associated with higher risk of short‐term adverse outcomes, but female sex was associated with higher risk of long COVID. For children, socioeconomic determinants that may unravel COVID‐19 disparities were rarely reported. This review highlights key prognostic factors of COVID‐19, which can help clinicians and health officers identify high‐risk groups for optimal care. Findings can also help optimize confounding adjustment and patient phenotyping in comparative effectiveness research. A living SLR approach may facilitate dissemination of new findings. This paper is endorsed by the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology.",

    "abstract": "Recently, multiple chimeric antigen receptor T‐cell (CAR‐T)‐based therapies have been approved for treating hematological malignancies, targeting CD19 and B‐cell maturation antigen. Unlike protein or antibody therapies, CAR‐T therapies are “living cell” therapies whose pharmacokinetics are characterized by expansion, distribution, contraction, and persistence. Therefore, this unique modality requires a different approach for quantitation compared with conventional ligand binding assays implemented for most biologics. Cellular (flow cytometry) or molecular assays (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) can be deployed with each having unique advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we describe the molecular assays utilized: quantitative PCR (qPCR), which was the initial platform used to estimate transgene copy numbers and more recently droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) which quantitates the absolute copy numbers of CAR transgene. The comparability of the two methods in patient samples and of each method across different matrices (isolated CD3 + T‐cells or whole blood) was also performed. The results show a good correlation between qPCR and ddPCR for the amplification of same gene in clinical samples from a CAR‐T therapy trial. In addition, our studies show that the qPCR‐based amplification of transgene levels was well‐correlated, independent of DNA sources (either CD3 + T‐cells or whole blood). Our results also highlight that ddPCR can be a better platform for monitoring samples at the early phase of CAR‐T dosing prior to expansion and during long‐term monitoring as they can detect samples with very low copy numbers with high sensitivity, in addition to easier implementation and sample logistics.",

    "abstract": "BAY1128688 is a selective inhibitor of AKR1C3, investigated recently in a trial that was prematurely terminated due to drug‐induced liver injury. These unexpected observations prompted use of the quantitative systems toxicology model, DILIsym, to determine possible mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Using mechanistic in vitro toxicity data as well as clinical exposure data, DILIsym predicted the potential for BAY1128688 to cause liver toxicity (elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) and elevations in serum bilirubin. Initial simulations overpredicted hepatotoxicity and bilirubin elevations, so the BAY1128688 representation within DILIsym underwent optimization. The liver partition coefficient K p was altered to align simulated bilirubin elevations with those observed clinically. Altering the mode of bile acid canalicular and basolateral efflux inhibition was necessary to accurately predict ALT elevations. Optimization results support that bilirubin elevations observed early during treatment are due to altered bilirubin metabolism and transporter inhibition, which is independent of liver injury. The modeling further supports that on‐treatment ALT elevations result from inhibition of bile acid transporters, particularly the bile salt excretory pump, leading to accumulation of toxic bile acids. The predicted dose‐dependent intrinsic hepatotoxicity may increase patient susceptibility to an adaptive immune response, accounting for ALT elevations observed after completion of treatment. These BAY1128688 simulations provide insight into the mechanisms behind hepatotoxicity and bilirubin elevations and may inform the potential risk posed by future compounds.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies have demonstrated that misclassification of study variables due to electronic health record (EHR)‐discontinuity can be mitigated by restricting EHR‐based analyses to subjects with high predicted EHR‐continuity based on a simple algorithm. In this study, we compared EHR continuity in populations covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or commercial insurance. Using claims‐linked EHRs from a multicenter network in Massachusetts, including Medicare (MA EHR‐Medicare cohort) and Medicaid (MA EHR‐Medicaid cohort) claims data; and TriNetX (TriNetX cohort) claims‐linked EHR data from 11 US‐based healthcare organizations, we assessed (1) EHR‐continuity quantified by proportion of encounters captured by EHR (capture proportion (CP)); (2) area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) of previously validated model to identify patients with high EHR‐continuity (CP ≥ 0.6); (3) misclassification of 40 patient characteristics, quantified by average standardized absolute mean difference (ASAMD). Study participants were ≥ 65 years (Medicare) or ≥ 18 years (Medicaid, TriNetX) with ≥ 365 days of continuous insurance enrollment overlapping with an EHR encounter. We found that the mean CP was 0.30, 0.18, and 0.19 and AUROC of the prediction model to identify patients with high EHR‐continuity was 0.92, 0.89, and 0.77 in the MA EHR‐Medicare, MA EHR‐Medicaid, and TriNetX cohorts, respectively. Restricting to patients with predicted EHR‐continuity percentile of top 20%, 50%, and 50% in MA EHR‐Medicare, MA EHR‐Medicaid, and TriNetX cohorts resulted in acceptable levels of misclassification (ASAMD < 0.1). Using a prediction model to identify cohorts with high EHR‐continuity can improve validity, but cutoffs to achieve this goal vary by population.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to determine whether CYP2C19 loss‐of‐function (LoF) variants were associated with long‐term ischemic stroke risk in Chinese primary care patients treated with clopidogrel. Patients treated with clopidogrel were ascertained from Chinese electronic medical records linked with a biobank for a retrospective cohort study. Their medical information was examined for the period from January 2018 to December 2021. Two CYP2C19 major loss of function variants (*2:rs4244285 and *3: rs4986893) were genotyped. The clinical outcome was ischemic stroke event. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between the occurrence of ischemic stroke events and CYP2C19 LoF variants. Covariates included age, gender, body mass index, prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoidemia, smoke status, aspirin use, proton‐pump inhibitor use, and statin use. Of the 1,141 patients included in the clopidogrel therapy cohort, 61.9% carried at least one CYP2C19 LoF variant. During a median follow‐up period of 12 months, 103 patients (9.0%) had an ischemic stroke. After adjusting for other risk factors, carriers of CYP2C19 LoF variants had significantly higher risk of ischemic stroke compared with non‐carriers (hazard ratio: 1.64, 95% confidence interval: 1.06–2.53, P = 0.025). This pharmacogenetic study of clopidogrel provides novel insights into the association between the CYP2C19 LoF variant and long‐term stroke risk. We established that there is still a need for CYP2C19 genotype‐guided personalized antiplatelet therapy in those who have returned to the primary care setting for clopidogrel prescription.",

    "abstract": "First pass metabolism by phase I and phase II enzymes in the intestines and liver is a major determinant of the oral bioavailability of many drugs. Several studies analyzed expressions of major drug‐metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), such as CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 in the human gut and liver. However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding other DMEs (i.e., “minor” DMEs), although several clinically relevant drugs are affected by those enzymes. Moreover, there is very limited intra‐subject data on hepatic and intestinal expression levels of minor DMEs. To fill this gap of knowledge, we analyzed gene expression (quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction) and protein abundance (targeted proteomics) of 24 clinically relevant DMEs, that is, carboxylesterases (CES), UDP‐glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), and cytochrome P450 (CYP)‐enzymes. We performed our analysis using jejunum and liver tissue specimens from the same 11 healthy organ donors (8 men and 3 women, aged 19–60 years). Protein amounts of all investigated DMEs, with the exception of CYP4A11, were detected in human liver samples. CES2, CYP2C18, CYP3A4, and UGT2B17 protein abundance was similar or even higher in the jejunum, and all other DMEs were found in higher amounts in the liver. Significant correlations between gene expression and protein levels were observed only for 2 of 15 jejunal, but 13 of 23 hepatic DMEs. Intestinal and hepatic protein amounts only significantly correlated for CYP3A4 and UGT1A3. Our results demonstrated a notable variability between the individuals, which was even higher in the intestines than in the liver. Our intrasubject analysis of DMEs in the jejunum and liver from healthy donors, may be useful for physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic‐based modeling and prediction in order to improve efficacy and safety of oral drug therapy.",

The ADEs about hepatobiliary disorders, thrombosis, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, infections, and so on were observed more differently in each age group. Meta‐analysis results showed differences in the four system organ classes between adults and children with ITP: infections and infestations, general disorders and administration site conditions, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and investigations. The adverse drug reactions in the latest version of instructions were searched in the databases to analyze their postmarketing safety signal strength. We observed signals of elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and blood bilirubin levels in all age groups. For children, urinary tract infection and back pain showed signals. Due to the inherent limitations of pharmacovigilance studies, more experiments are needed to assess the risks of eltrombopag in different ages.",

To date, only preclinical studies and case reports have focused on this potential adverse drug reaction. We aimed to assess the reporting association between DCCIs and hypoxia using the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database (VigiBase). We performed a disproportionality analysis to evaluate the strength of the reporting association between i.v. clevidipine and nicardipine, thought to be a surrogate of patients in the intensive care unit, and hypoxia. The information component and the lower end of its 95% credibility interval were used to evaluate disproportionality. A description of the cases was made. Secondary outcomes included the association between all DCCIs and hypoxia compared with other treatments with similar indications, urapidil and labetalol, regardless of the route of administration. Association between oral nicardipine and hypoxia was also searched. A statistically significant signal of hypoxia was found for intravenous clevidipine and nicardipine. The time to onset was reported with a median of 2 days (interquartile range 1.5–4.5). Four dechallenges were performed with intravenous nicardipine, leading to the resolution of the symptoms. Regardless of the route of administration, a signal of hypoxia was also found for nimodipine but not for other drugs, including comparators. For nicardipine no signal of hypoxia was found with the oral route of administration. Our pharmacovigilance database analysis showed a significant association between the use of intravenous DCCIs and hypoxia.",

We report on the first 6 years of ARIA utilization in the Sentinel System (2016–2021). The FDA has used the ARIA system to evaluate 133 safety concerns; 54 of these evaluations have closed with regulatory determinations, whereas the rest remain in progress. If the ARIA system and the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System are deemed insufficient to address a safety concern, then the FDA may issue a postmarket requirement to a product's manufacturer. One hundred ninety‐seven ARIA insufficiency determinations have been made. The most common situation for which ARIA was found to be insufficient is the evaluation of adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes following in utero drug exposure, followed by neoplasms and death. ARIA was most likely to be sufficient for thromboembolic events, which have high positive predictive value in claims data alone and do not require supplemental clinical data. The lessons learned from this experience illustrate the continued challenges using administrative claims data, especially to define novel clinical outcomes. This analysis can help to identify where more granular clinical data are needed to fill gaps to improve the use of real‐world data for drug safety analyses and provide insights into what is needed to efficiently generate high‐quality real‐world evidence for efficacy.",

A retrospective analysis of all PGx alerts that fired at a tertiary academic medical center from August 2020 through May 2022 was performed. Alert acceptance rate was calculated and compared across six gene–drug pairs, patient care setting, and clinician specialty. The disposition of the triggering medication was compared with the alert response and evaluated for congruence. There were a total of 818 alerts included for analysis of alert response, 557 alerts included in acceptance rate calculations, and 392 alerts with sufficient information to assess clinical response. The overall acceptance rate was 63%. The alert response and clinical response were congruent for 47% of alerts. Alert response was influenced by the triggering gene–drug pair, clinician specialty, patient care setting, and specialty of the provider who initially ordered the PGx test. Clinical response was mostly incongruent with alert response. Alert acceptance is influenced by the triggering gene–drug pair, clinician specialty, and care setting. Alert response is not a reliable surrogate marker for clinical action. Any future research into the impact of clinical decision support (CDS) alerts should focus on clinical response rather than alert response. Given the reliance on CDS alerts to enhance uptake of PGx, it is worthwhile to further investigate their impact on prescribing and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Amivantamab has demonstrated durable responses with a tolerable safety profile in non‐small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertions (Ex20ins) who progressed after prior platinum chemotherapy. Data supporting the amivantamab recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in this patient population are presented. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and population PK (PopPK) modeling were conducted using serum concentration data obtained following amivantamab intravenous administration (140–1,750 mg). Pharmacodynamics (PDs) were evaluated using depletion of soluble EGFR and MET. Exposure‐response (E‐R) analyses were performed using the primary efficacy end point of objective response rate in patients with EGFR Ex20ins. The E‐R relationship for safety was explored for adverse events of clinical interest. Amivantamab exhibited linear PKs at 350–1,750 mg dose levels following administration, with no maximum tolerated dose identified. A two‐compartment PopPK model with linear clearance adequately described the observed PKs. Body weight was a covariate of clearance and volume of distribution in the central compartment. PopPK modeling showed that a weight‐based, 2‐tier (< 80 and ≥ 80 kg) dosing strategy reduces PK variability and provides comparable exposure across 2 weight groups, with 87% of patients achieving exposures above the target threshold. The final confirmed RP2D of amivantamab was 1,050 mg for < 80 kg (1,400 mg for ≥ 80 kg) weekly in cycle 1 (28 days) and every 2 weeks thereafter. No significant exposure‐efficacy or safety correlation was observed. In conclusion, the amivantamab RP2D is supported by PK, PD, safety, and efficacy analyses. E‐R analyses confirmed that the current regimen provides durable efficacy with tolerable safety.",

    "abstract": "Although anti‐severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 antibody kinetics have been described in large populations of vaccinated individuals, we still poorly understand how they evolve during a natural infection and how this impacts viral clearance. For that purpose, we analyzed the kinetics of both viral load and neutralizing antibody levels in a prospective cohort of individuals during acute infection with alpha variant. Using a mathematical model, we show that the progressive increase in neutralizing antibodies leads to a shortening of the half‐life of both infected cells and infectious viral particles. We estimated that the neutralizing activity reached 90% of its maximal level within 11 days after symptom onset and could reduce the half‐life of both infected cells and circulating virus by a 6‐fold factor, thus playing a key role to achieve rapid viral clearance. Using this model, we conducted a simulation study to predict in a more general context the protection conferred by pre‐existing neutralization titers, due to either vaccination or prior infection. We predicted that a neutralizing activity, as measured by 50% effective dose > 10 3 , could reduce by 46% the risk of having viral load detectable by standard polymerase chain reaction assays and by 98% the risk of having viral load above the threshold of infectiousness. Our model shows that neutralizing activity could be used to define correlates of protection against infection and transmission.",

    "abstract": "Etrolizumab, an investigational anti‐β7 integrin monoclonal antibody, has undergone evaluation for safety and efficacy in phase III clinical trials on patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Etrolizumab was terminated because mixed efficacy results were shown in the induction and maintenance phase in patients with UC. In this post hoc analysis, we characterized the impact of explanatory variables on the probability of remission using XGBoost machine learning (ML) models alongside with the SHapley Additive exPlanations framework for explainability. We used patient‐level data encompassing demographics, physiology, disease history, clinical questionnaires, histology, serum biomarkers, and etrolizumab drug exposure to develop ML models aimed at predicting remission. Baseline covariates and early etrolizumab exposure at week 4 in the induction phase were utilized to develop an induction ML model, whereas covariates from the end of the induction phase and early etrolizumab exposure at week 4 in the maintenance phase were used to develop a maintenance ML model. Both the induction and maintenance ML models exhibited good predictive performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.74 ± 0.03 and 0.75 ± 0.06 (mean ± SD), respectively. Compared with placebo, the highest tertile of etrolizumab exposure contributed to 15.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.7–19.9) and 17.0% (95% CI: 8.1–26.4) increases in remission probability in the induction and maintenance phases, respectively. Additionally, the key covariates that predicted remission were CRP, MAdCAM‐1, and stool frequency for the induction phase and white blood cells, fecal calprotectin and age for the maintenance phase. These findings hold significant implications for establishing stratification factors in the design of future clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Children with asthma and obesity are more likely to have lower vitamin D levels, but the optimal replacement dose is unknown in this population. The objective of this study is identifying a vitamin D dose in children with obesity‐related asthma that safely achieves serum vitamin D levels of ≥ 40 ng/mL. This prospective multisite randomized controlled trial recruited children/adolescents with asthma and body mass index ≥ 85% for age/sex. Part 1 (dose finding), evaluated 4 oral vitamin D regimens for 16 weeks to identify a replacement dose that achieved serum vitamin D levels ≥ 40 ng/mL. Part 2 compared the replacement dose calculated from part 1 (50,000 IU loading dose with 8,000 IU daily) to standard of care (SOC) for 16 weeks to identify the proportion of children achieving target serum 25(OH)D level. Part 1 included 48 randomized participants. Part 2 included 64 participants. In Part 1, no SOC participants achieved target serum level, but 50–72.7% of participants in cohorts A‐C achieved the target serum level. In part 2, 78.6% of replacement dose participants achieved target serum level compared with none in the SOC arm. No related serious adverse events were reported. This trial confirmed a 50,000 IU loading dose plus 8,000 IU daily oral vitamin D as safe and effective in increasing serum 25(OH)D levels in children/adolescents with overweight/obesity to levels ≥ 40 ng/mL. Given the critical role of vitamin D in many conditions complicating childhood obesity, these data close a critical gap in our understanding of vitamin D dosing in children.",

    "abstract": "Induction of mycobacterial efflux pumps is a cause of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) drug tolerance, a barrier to shortening antitubercular treatment. Verapamil inhibits Mtb efflux pumps that mediate tolerance to rifampin, a cornerstone of tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Verapamil's mycobacterial efflux pump inhibition also limits Mtb growth in macrophages in the absence of antibiotic treatment. These findings suggest that verapamil could be used as an adjunctive therapy for TB treatment shortening. However, verapamil is rapidly and substantially metabolized when co‐administered with rifampin. We determined in a dose‐escalation clinical trial of persons with pulmonary TB that rifampin‐induced clearance of verapamil can be countered without toxicity by the administration of larger than usual doses of verapamil. An oral dosage of 360 mg sustained‐release (SR) verapamil given every 12 hours concomitantly with rifampin achieved median verapamil exposures of 903.1 ng.h/mL (area under the curve (AUC) 0‐12 h ) in the 18 participants receiving this highest studied verapamil dose; these AUC findings are similar to those in persons receiving daily doses of 240 mg verapamil SR but not rifampin. Moreover, norverapamil:verapamil, R:S verapamil, and R:S norverapamil AUC ratios were all significantly greater than those of historical controls receiving SR verapamil in the absence of rifampin. Thus, rifampin administration favors the less‐cardioactive verapamil metabolites and enantiomers that retain similar Mtb efflux inhibitory activity to verapamil, increasing overall benefit. Finally, rifampin exposures were 50% greater after verapamil administration, which may also be advantageous. Our findings suggest that a higher dosage of verapamil can be safely used as adjunctive treatment in rifampin‐containing treatment regimens.",

We identified the provenance of the FIC drugs that entered the French market from 2008 to 2018 and matched these medicines to the clinical benefit grading by Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) and Prescrire. Analyses were performed using descriptive statistics to present our findings by drug origin and therapeutic area and to establish the degree of concordance between HAS and Prescrire. Of the 135 FIC drugs identified, 71.1% ( n = 96) originated from the industry, 16.3% ( n = 22) from academia, and 12.6% ( n = 17) from joint partnerships. Three therapeutic areas accounted for most FIC medications: antineoplastic (25.9%, N = 35), anti‐infective (14.1%, N = 19), and metabolic (11.1%, N = 15) agents. HAS and Prescrire agreed on 60.74% of clinical benefit gradings. According to HAS, only 5% of all FIC drugs had substantial added benefit, and only 3%, according to Prescrire. HAS and Prescrire graded 45.9% and 68.2%, respectively, of FIC drugs as no clinical benefit and 48.9% and 28.9%, respectively, as some clinical benefit. FIC‐designated drugs are primarily of industry (> 70%) rather than academic origin. We found that 55% of FIC medicines that entered the French market over the 10‐year period deliver no additional clinical benefit. Whereas FIC medicines may represent important scientific advancements in drug development, in > 50% of cases, the new mode of action does not translate into additional clinical benefits for patients.",

    "abstract": "This exploratory, post hoc analysis aimed to model circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) dynamics and predict disease progression in patients with treatment‐naïve locally advanced/metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (EGFRm)‐positive non‐small cell lung cancer, from the FLAURA trial (NCT02296125). Patients were randomized 1:1 and received osimertinib 80 mg once daily (q.d.) or comparator EGFR‐TKIs (gefitinib 250 mg q.d. or erlotinib 150 mg q.d.). Plasma was collected at baseline and multiple timepoints until treatment discontinuation. Patients with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) imaging data and detectable EGFR mutations (Ex19del/L858R) at baseline and ≥ 3 additional timepoints were evaluable. Joint modeling was conducted to characterize the relationship between longitudinal changes in ctDNA and probability of progression‐free survival (PFS). A Bayesian joint model of ctDNA and PFS was developed solving differential equations with the ctDNA dynamics and the PFS time‐to‐event probability. Of 556 patients, 353 had detectable ctDNA at baseline. Evaluable patients (with available imaging and ≥ 3 additional timepoints, n = 320; ctDNA set) were divided into training ( n = 259) and validation ( n = 61) sets. In the validation set, the model predicted a median PFS of 17.7 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.9–28.3) for osimertinib ( n = 23) and 9.1 months (95% CI: 6.3–14.8) for comparator ( n = 38), consistent with observed RECIST PFS (16.4 months and 9.7, respectively). The model demonstrates that EGFRm ctDNA dynamics can predict the risk of disease progression in this patient population and could be used to predict RECIST‐defined disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatitis is the most common complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). As the management of pancreatitis is limited, clinical approaches focus on the prevention of post‐ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). In theory, the serine protease inhibitor nafamostat can reduce circulating inflammatory mediators in pancreatitis. We aimed to investigate the effect of nafamostat in the prevention of PEP in this systematic review and meta‐analysis. The protocol for this review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022367988). We systematically searched 5 databases without any filters on September 26, 2022. The eligible population was adult patients undergoing ERCP. We compared the PEP preventive effect of nafamostat to placebo. The main outcome was the occurrence of PEP. We calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs), mean differences, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and multilevel model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Rob2 tool. Seven randomized controlled trials involving 2,962 patients were eligible for inclusion. Nafamostat reduced the overall incidence rate of PEP (20 mg, OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30–0.82 and 50 mg, OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.24–0.96). However, the occurrence of mild PEP was significantly reduced only in the subgroup receiving 20 mg nafamostat (OR, 0.49, 95% CI: 0.31–0.77). Overall, nafamostat therapy reduced moderate PEP in high‐risk patients (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.0.4–0.84) and mild PEP in low‐risk patients (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.17–0.61). Nafamostat is an effective therapy in the prevention of mild post‐ERCP pancreatitis. Further research is required to determine the cost‐effectiveness of this therapy.",

However, due to identified potentially genotoxic nitrosamine impurities, it should not any longer be used in healthy volunteer studies. Available clinical data suggest carbamazepine as an alternative to rifampicin as strong index CYP3A4 inducer in clinical DDI studies. Further, physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a tool with increasing importance to support the DDI risk assessment of drugs during drug development. CYP3A4 induction properties and the safety profile of carbamazepine were investigated in two open‐label, fixed sequence, crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers using midazolam as a sensitive index CYP3A4 substrate. Carbamazepine was up‐titrated from 100 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) to 200 mg b.i.d., and to a final dose of 300 mg b.i.d. for 10 consecutive days. Mean area under plasma concentration‐time curve from zero to infinity (AUC( 0‐∞ )) of midazolam consistently decreased by 71.8% (ratio: 0.282, 90% confidence interval (CI): 0.235–0.340) and 67.7% (ratio: 0.323, 90% CI: 0.256–0.407) in study 1 and study 2, respectively. The effect was adequately described by an internally developed PBPK model for carbamazepine which has been made freely available to the scientific community. Further, carbamazepine was safe and well‐tolerated in the investigated dosing regimen in healthy participants. The results demonstrated that the presented design is appropriate for the use of carbamazepine as alternative inducer to rifampicin in DDI studies acknowledging its CYP3A4 inductive potency and safety profile.",

However, identifying culprit drugs in ADRs remains challenging, although it is one of the foremost steps to managing ADRs. Aiming to estimate the likelihood of prescribed drugs being culprit drugs for given ADRs, we devised a Bayesian estimation model based on the Japanese Adverse Drug Events Reports database. After developing the model, a validation study was conducted with 67 ADR reports with a gross of 1,387 drugs (67 culprit drugs and 1,320 concomitant drugs) prescribed and recorded at Yamaguchi University Hospital. As a result, the model estimated a culprit drug of ADRs with acceptable accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.88–0.97)). The estimation results provided by the model to healthcare practitioners can be used as one clue to determine the culprit drugs for various ADRs, which will improve the management of ADRs by shortening the treatment turnaround time and increasing the precision of diagnosis, leading to minimizing the adverse effects on patients.",

The efficacy of DOACs was significantly higher in Asian regions regarding stroke/systemic embolism events (RR: 0.62 and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49–0.78 for the Asian region; RR: 0.83 and 95% CI: 0.75–0.92 for non‐Asian regions; P interaction: 0.02), when compared with warfarin. The safety of DOACs was significantly higher in Asian regions regarding major bleeding (RR: 0.62 and 95% CI: 0.51–0.75 for Asian regions; RR: 0.90 and 95% CI: 0.76–1.05 for non‐Asian regions; P interaction: 0.004), compared with warfarin. In addition, we conducted meta‐regression analysis to discuss the true regional differences of DOACs to warfarin. The meta‐regression analysis, which adjusts the effect of individual backgrounds in each study, indicated that the regional differences were observed in the efficacy but not in drug safety. These results suggest that treatment with DOACs may be more effective than the conventional warfarin in the Asian region.",

Participants allocated in Groups 1 ( n = 15; F0/F1 and F2, mild to moderate liver fibrosis) and 2 ( n = 13; F3 and F4, advanced course of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis) received in both phases fexofenadine (10 mg) and rosuvastatin (2 mg). OATP1B1 & BCRP activity (rosuvastatin area under the plasma concentration‐time curve of rosuvastatin from time zero to infinity (AUC 0–∞ )) was reduced in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, by 25% (ratio 0.75 (0.53–0.82), P < 0.01) and 31% (ratio 0.69 (0.46–0.85), P < 0.05) in Phase 1 compared with Phase 2.

    "abstract": "Ixazomib has been approved in several countries as single‐agent maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, in both posttransplant and transplant‐ineligible settings, based on two phase III studies. In these maintenance studies, patients were initially administered 3 mg ixazomib, escalating to 4 mg if the initial dose level was well tolerated through Cycles 1–4. Here, we report the results of exposure–response analyses of TOURMALINE‐MM4, wherein relationships between exposure and clinical response, dose adjustments, and selected adverse events were evaluated. Similar progression‐free survival benefits were observed across the range of ixazomib exposures achieved in the study. Moreover, increased ixazomib exposures corresponded to a higher probability of maintaining complete response. Exposure was not a significant predictor ( P > 0.05) of hematological adverse events (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and peripheral neuropathy; however, higher exposures did correlate to increased probabilities of experiencing diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, rash, and fatigue. While ixazomib exposure was not predictive of dose reductions, lower apparent clearance values (corresponding to higher systemic exposures) were correlated with a reduced likelihood of escalating to the 4 mg dose. Thus, the dose titration approach balanced patient benefit and risk; it ensured that only patients for whom the 3 mg dose was safe/tolerable escalated to the higher dose, while maximizing the fraction of patients (85%) who were able to derive additional clinical benefit at 4 mg. Collectively, these results highlight the value of safety‐driven personalized dosing to maximize patient benefit/risk.",

Our population‐based study assessed whether intraclass pharmacologic heterogeneity among sulfonylureas (long‐ vs. short‐acting) and DPP‐4i (peptidomimetic vs. non‐peptidomimetic) modifies this interaction. We conducted a cohort study using the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum linked to hospitalization and vital statistics data. We assembled a cohort of patients initiating sulfonylureas (2007–2020). Using a time‐varying exposure definition, we assessed the risk of severe hypoglycemia (hospitalization with or death due to hypoglycemia) associated with (i) concomitant use of long‐acting sulfonylureas (glimepiride and glibenclamide) with DPP‐4i compared with concomitant use of short‐acting sulfonylureas (gliclazide and glipizide) with DPP‐4i; and (ii) concomitant use of sulfonylureas with peptidomimetic DPP‐4i (saxagliptin and vildagliptin) compared with concomitant use of sulfonylureas with non‐peptidomimetic DPP‐4i (sitagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin). Time‐dependent Cox models estimated confounder‐adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our cohort included 196,138 sulfonylurea initiators. During a median follow‐up of 6 years, 8,576 events of severe hypoglycemia occurred. Compared with concomitant use of short‐acting sulfonylureas with DPP‐4i, concomitant use of long‐acting sulfonylureas with DPP‐4i was not associated with the risk of severe hypoglycemia (adjusted HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.65–1.16). Compared with concomitant use of sulfonylureas with non‐peptidomimetic DPP‐4i, concomitant use of sulfonylureas with peptidomimetic DPP‐4i was also not associated with the risk of severe hypoglycemia (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.76–1.22). Intra‐class pharmacologic heterogeneity did not modify the association between concomitant use of sulfonylureas (short‐ vs. long‐acting) and DPP‐4i (peptidomimetic vs. non‐peptidomimetic) and the risk of severe hypoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "The STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) regimen of single‐dose tremelimumab 300 mg, plus durvalumab 1,500 mg every 4 weeks demonstrated potential for long‐term survival in studies of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC; Study 22 and HIMALAYA). The aim of this analysis was to investigate changes in proliferating CD4+ Ki67+ and CD8+ Ki67+ T cells and their relationship with tremelimumab exposure in patients with uHCC. Median cell count, change from baseline, and percent change from baseline in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells peaked around 14 days after STRIDE. A model of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response to tremelimumab exposure was developed. Patients with lower baseline T cell counts had a greater percent change from baseline in T cell response to tremelimumab, and baseline T‐cell count was included in the final model. With the full covariate model, the half‐maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) of tremelimumab was 6.10 μg/mL (standard error = 1.07 μg/mL); > 98.0% of patients were predicted to have a minimum plasma concentration greater than EC 50 with tremelimumab 300 or 750 mg. For EC 75 (9.82 μg/mL), 69.5% and 98.2% of patients were predicted to exceed the EC 75 with tremelimumab 300 and 750 mg, respectively. This analysis supports the clinical hypothesis that combination anti‐cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated antigen 4 (anti‐CTLA‐4) and anti‐programmed cell death ligand‐1 (anti‐PD‐L1) therapy primes an immune response that may then be sustained by anti‐PD‐L1 monotherapy and supports the clinical utility of the STRIDE regimen in patients with uHCC. These insights may also help inform dose selection of anti‐CTLA‐4 plus anti‐PD‐L1 combination strategies.",

Some groups have evaluated the use of RWE in regulatory submissions in the United States and abroad, reporting that reliance on RWE to support new product approvals is relatively common. Confusion regarding the use of RWE in drug‐approval decisions may arise, however, based on different application of the terms real‐world data (RWD) and RWE. We evaluated RWE in new drug applications (NDAs) and biologics license applications (BLAs) from January 2019 to June 2021 for novel drugs and biologics approved by the FDA with indications related to psychiatry, neurology, pain, or sedation (here, termed neuroscience‐related). We sought to determine whether the submissions included RWE and to describe the types of data and study designs used. Thirty neuroscience‐related NDAs or BLAs were identified for novel drugs and biologics approved during the time‐period of interest. Among these approvals, three applications (10%) were adjudicated as containing RWE, one of which included RWE as primary evidence of effectiveness. Our findings highlight how different operational definitions of the terms RWD and RWE can result in demonstrably different reporting of the use of RWE in regulatory decision making for neuroscience‐related novel drugs and biologics. A better understanding of this topic, along with awareness of regulatory definitions of RWE, are important factors to promote accurate tracking and reporting of regulatory submissions involving RWE. These factors can also improve awareness among the stakeholder community regarding the role of RWD and RWE in regulatory decision making.",

The patients treated with platelet function and genotype‐related long‐term prognosis in drug‐eluting stent (PTRG‐DES) consortium enrolled a total of 13,160 Korean patients treated with DES who had platelet function test (PFT) or CYP2C19 genotype, of which, 6,717 patients with PFT and genotype together were categorized. HPR was defined as VerifyNow ≥ 252 P2Y12 reaction unit. The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) 5 years after treatment. The patients with both HPR and CYP2C19 LoF/LoF had the highest MACCE rates (6.2%) and increased MACCE risk (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.89, 95% confidence interval: 1.20–2.91, P = 0.006) compared with those without both HPR and CYP2C19 LoF/LoF. There was no effect of interaction between HPR and CYP2C19 genotype on the primary outcome ( P = 0.424). Adding combined HPR and CYP2C19 genotype to the conventional model had an incremental influence in predicting MACCE and stent thrombosis. Compared to the model including HPR or CYP2C19 genotype alone, a combination model significantly improved the risk stratification for stent thrombosis but not MACCE. In DES‐treated East Asian patients, the combined evaluation of PFT results and CYP2C19 genotyping might improve risk prediction of ischemic events during clopidogrel treatment.",

However, reference biologics labeling documents do not necessarily mention immunogenicity impact, rendering the development of biosimilars more challenging. We aimed to investigate the comparative assessment of immunogenicity profiles between biosimilars and their respective reference biologics in the review reports of the biosimilar monoclonal antibody applications approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of March 13, 2022, covering 22 applications approved between April 5, 2016, and December 17, 2021. The maximum differences in anti‐drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) incidences between biosimilars and reference products mostly fell within ± 15% (−13.6% to 12%) and ± 20% (−17.4% to 17.1%, except extreme values of −23.4% and 66.7%), respectively. In comparison with antineoplastic agents, more immunosuppressants had ADA‐positive (11/11, 100.0% vs. 8/10, 80.0%)/NAb‐positive (11/11, 100.0% vs. 3/10, 30.0%) subjects, and the distribution of the aforementioned incidence differences was wider. The investigated biosimilars with available data for analysis demonstrated a high degree of consistency with their reference products in terms of the impact on pharmacokinetic parameters. No increase in immunogenicity was found in available switching studies. Most (16/22, 72.7%) biosimilars were issued post‐marketing requirements that were not directly related to immunogenicity concerns. The FDA considered the totality of evidence assessing clinical consequences of immunogenicity differences, if any. Additional information on titers and subgroup analysis may be warranted to elucidate the critical attributes of immunogenicity impact and to aid in forming cost‐effective strategies for biosimilar development.",

    "abstract": "Oral extended‐release (ER) dosage forms have been used to sustain blood drug levels, reduce adverse events, and improve patient compliance. We investigated potential effects of comedication on pharmacokinetic exposure of nifedipine ER products with different formulation designs and manufacturing processes. A clinical study compared a generic version of nifedipine ER tablet with pH‐dependent dissolution behavior with an osmotic pump product with pH independent drug release under fasting condition. In this study, two nifedipine tablet products were tested with or without short‐term omeprazole comedication in healthy subjects. Seven‐day administration of omeprazole before nifedipine dosing significantly increased the gastric pH, and subsequently increased the geometric least square (LS) means of area under the concentration–time curve from time zero to the last measurable timepoint (AUC 0– t ) and maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) of nifedipine to 132.6% (90% confidence interval (CI): 120.6–145.7%) and 112.8% (90% CI: 100.8–126.3%) for pH‐dependent ER tablets, and 120.6% (90% CI: 109.7–132.5%) and 122.5% (90% CI: 113.7–131.9%) for the pH‐independent ER tablets, respectively. Similar extent of increase in AUC 0– t and C max was confirmed in the subpopulations whose gastric pH was ≥ 4 or ≤ 3 in subjects with or without omeprazole administration. Given that similar increases in drug exposures were observed for both pH‐dependent and pH‐independent nifedipine formulations and the geometric LS mean ratios were between 112% and 133% with and without short‐term omeprazole comedication, the gastric pH may have limited effects on omeprazole‐induced nifedipine PK changes on the tested formulations. The inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may play a significant role causing nifedipine exposure changes for both formulations, which would warrant additional assessment.",

    "abstract": "Increase in serum bile acids (BAs) in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) may play a causal role in cholestatic pruritus (itch). Linerixibat is a selective small molecule inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter, which blocks re‐absorption of BAs in the gastrointestinal tract thereby lowering BAs in the systemic circulation and reducing itch. One consequence is excess BAs in the colon, leading to diarrhea and abdominal pain. GLIMMER (NCT02966834) was a placebo‐controlled phase IIb dose‐ranging trial of linerixibat once (q.d.) or twice daily (b.i.d.) in adults with moderate to severe pruritus and PBC. To determine the optimal dose for maximum itch reduction while minimizing diarrhea, a kinetic‐pharmacodynamic (k‐PD) model was developed using data from GLIMMER. The PD end point modeled was worst daily itch, derived from itch score reported by patients b.i.d. A proportional odds model was developed post hoc to indicate the probability of diarrhea occurrence, a patient‐reported outcome (GI‐5) recorded weekly. The final k‐PD model successfully described the effects of linerixibat and placebo on itch. Model simulations were consistent with the observed dose‐dependent increase in the average number of itch responders (patients with a ≥ 2‐point improvement in itch). This was paralleled by a dose‐dependent increase in the probability of higher diarrhea frequency scores. The b.i.d. dosing regimens led to a modest increase in the number of itch responders as compared with q.d. dosing. This quantitative framework highlights the trade‐off between benefit and tolerability and supported the selection of 40 mg b.i.d. in the phase III GLISTEN trial (NCT04950127).",

    "abstract": "CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of many drugs. Its activity is affected by pharmacogenetic variability leading to highly polymorphic phenotypes between individuals, affecting safety and efficacy of drugs. Recently, solanidine, a steroidal alkaloid from potatoes, and its metabolites, has been identified as a dietary‐derived activity marker for CYP2D6. The intraday variability in plasma within individuals has not been studied yet in healthy subjects. As part of a CYP phenotyping cocktail study with 20 healthy participants, plasma concentrations of solanidine, 4‐OH‐solanidine and 3,4‐secosolanidine‐3,4‐dioic acid (SSDA) were determined using a sensitive liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry method in urine and in plasma at timepoints 0, 2.5, 5, 8, and 24 hours after intake of test substances. The participants were phenotyped for CYP2D6 with oral metoprolol (12.5 mg) with 15 plasma sampling points over 24 hours (DRKS00028922). Metabolic ratios (MRs) of metabolite to parent plasma concentrations were formed from single timepoints and the area under the curve (AUC). All participants were genotyped for CYP2D6. The intra‐individual variability of the CYP2D6 metabolite SSDA was highly stable with a median SD of 11.62% over 24 hours. MR SSDA/solanidine was more variable (median SD 31.90%) but correlated significantly at all measured timepoints with AUC MR α‐OH‐metoprolol/metoprolol. The AUC MR SSDA/solanidine showed a significant linear relationship with the genetically predicted CYP2D6 activity score. This study substantiates the MR SSDA/solanidine as CYP2D6 activity marker. The high correlation with metoprolol MR indicates a valid prediction of the CYP2D6 phenotype at any timepoint during the study day.",

    "abstract": "Hydroxyurea treatment for children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) is effective and life‐saving. Stepwise escalation to maximum tolerated dose (MTD) provides optimal benefits, but is logistically challenging and time‐consuming, especially in low‐income countries where most people with SCA live. Model‐informed precision dosing (MIPD) of hydroxyurea expedites MTD determination and improves outcomes compared with trial‐and‐error dose adjustments. HdxSim, a user‐friendly, online, clinical decision support tool was developed to facilitate hydroxyurea MIPD and evaluated using real‐world pharmacokinetic (PK) data. First‐dose hydroxyurea PK profiles were analyzed from two clinical trial datasets (Hydroxyurea Study of Long‐Term Effects (HUSTLE), NCT00305175 and Therapeutic Response Evaluation and Adherence Trial (TREAT), NCT02286154). Areas under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) estimated by HdxSim were compared with those determined using traditional trapezoidal methodology and PK software (MWPharm‐DOS). The doses predicted by HdxSim and MWPharm‐DOS were compared with the observed clinical MTD. For HUSTLE participants, HdxSim accurately estimated hydroxyurea AUC compared with the trapezoidal method, with < 20% variance. The average (mean ± SD) AUC for TREAT participants estimated with HdxSim (68.6 ± 18.0 mg*hour/L) was lower than MWPharm‐DOS (78.6 ± 20.7 mg*hour/L, P = 0.012), but the average recommended doses were not different (425 vs. 423 mg/day, P = 0.97). Moreover, HdxSim was non‐inferior to MWPharm‐DOS at predicting clinical MTD (absolute difference 3.9 ± 5.8 vs. 4.9 ± 8.2 mg/kg/day, P = 0.19). HdxSim accurately estimates hydroxyurea exposure and is noninferior to traditional PK approaches at predicting the clinical hydroxyurea MTD. Hydroxyurea dosing based on target exposure leads to improved outcomes in children with SCA, and has the potential to make PK‐guided hydroxyurea dosing more accessible to this neglected population globally.",

Novel implementation of a hybrid machine‐learning pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/toxicodynamic (ML‐PK/PD/TD) approach optimizes combination therapy using human PK/TD data along with in vitro PD data. This study utilized human population PK (PopPK) of aztreonam, ceftazidime/avibactam, and polymyxin B along with in vitro PDs from the Hollow Fiber Infection Model (HFIM) to derive optimal multi‐drug regimens de novo through implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA). The mechanism‐based PD model was constructed based on 7‐day HFIM experiments across 4 clinical, extensively drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. GA‐led optimization was performed using 13 different fitness functions to compare the effects of different efficacy (60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of simulated subjects achieving bacterial counts of 10 2 CFU/mL) and toxicity (66% of simulated subjects having a target polymyxin B area under the concentration‐time curve [AUC] of 100 mg·h/L and aztreonam AUC of 1,332 mg·h/L) on the optimized regimen. All regimens, except those most heavily weighted for toxicity prevention, were able to achieve the target efficacy threshold (10 2 CFU/mL). Overall, GA‐based regimen optimization using preclinical data from animal‐sparing in vitro studies and human PopPK produced clinically relevant dosage regimens similar to those developed empirically over many years for all three antibiotics. Taken together, these data provide significant insight into new therapeutic approaches incorporating ML to regimen design and treatment of resistant bacterial infections.",

Forty‐nine trials of 16 drugs were identified in the literature, comprising 21,340 patients. Trial‐level covariates, including prior biologic use, concomitant methotrexate use, time since diagnosis, trial completion year, and active comparator were considered for exploratory models. The final model was selected using leave‐one‐out cross‐validation (LOO CV) to assess predictive performance based on prespecified criteria. LOO CV was conducted for 15 trials; the final model demonstrated that 91.5% (952/1,040) of the observed treatment differences, and 96.1% of the observed ACR20/50/70 response rates were within the 95% prediction interval (PI). Median ACR50 response rates (95% PI) at week 16 in biologic‐naïve patients were predicted to be 44% (40–49%) for bimekizumab 160 mg, among the highest of all treatments analyzed. Response rates for secukinumab 150 mg and risankizumab 150 mg were 28% (25–32%) and 27% (24–31%), respectively. The MBMA was also used to predict the probability of success (PoS) of potential head‐to‐head trials using ACR50 response as the end point with varying sample sizes: vs. secukinumab 150 mg, the PoS for bimekizumab 160 mg was 62% ( N = 200) and 90% ( N = 400). Versus risankizumab 150 mg, the PoS for bimekizumab 160 mg was 68% ( N = 200) and 94% ( N = 400). In summary, a predictive MBMA described ACR20/50/70 outcomes in PsA, allowing accurate and precise treatment comparisons and robust PoS calculations.",

    "abstract": "The most intuitive question for market access for medicinal products is the benefit/risk (B/R) balance. The B/R assessment can conceptually be divided into subquestions related to establishing efficacy and safety. There are additional layers to the B/R ratio for medical products, including questions related to dose selection, clinical and nonclinical pharmacology, and drug quality. Explicitly stating the actual questions and how they contribute to the overall B/R provides a structure that fosters better informed cross‐domain discussions. There is currently no systematic approach in the regulatory setting to assess and establish the acceptability of alternative methods and data sources. In most cases, the medicinal product sponsors tend to prioritize traditional data types and methods, which are well accepted by regulators for inclusion in regulatory submissions. This, in addition to the absence of rigor in the use and validation of new data types and methods, and the limited training of assessors in related fields can lead to increased regulatory skepticism toward new data types and methods. A data‐knowledge backbone is needed to mitigate the uncertainty in efficacy and safety characterization. This white paper discusses the value of explicitly redefining and restructuring the regulatory scientific decision making around the scientific question to be addressed. The ecosystem proposed is based on three pillars: (i) a repository connecting questions, data, and methods; (ii) the development and validation of high‐quality standards for data and methods; and (iii) credibility assessment. The ecosystem is applied to four use cases for illustration. The need for training and regulatory guidance is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Hepatotoxicity is a serious adverse drug reaction related to methotrexate (MTX). However, the cause of drug‐induced liver injury (DILI) is still unclear and unpredictable. Genetic risk factors may predispose for MTX‐DILI. Therefore, we conducted a nested case‐control genome‐wide association study to explore genetic risk factors associated with MTX‐DILI. Seven international groups contributed blood samples and data of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who used MTX. MTX‐DILI was defined as an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of at least three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), to increase contrast controls ALT levels did not raise above two times the ULN. Per study site, control subjects and patients with MTX‐DILI (ratio 3:1) were matched for age, gender, and duration of MTX use. Patients were genotyped using Illumina GSA MD‐24v1‐0 and data were imputed using the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed using an additive genetic model, corrected for sex, country, and age. A P ‐value of ≤ 5 × 10 −8 was considered significant, whereas a P ‐value of ≤ 5 × 10 −6 was considered suggestive. A total of 108 MTX‐DILI cases and 311 controls were included for association analysis. None of the SNPs were significantly associated with MTX‐DILI. However, we found seven suggestive genetic variants associated with MTX‐DILI ( P ‐values 7.43 × 10 −8 to 4.86 × 10 −6 ). Of those, five SNPs were in the intronic protein‐coding regions of FTCDNL1 , BCOR , FGF14 , RBMS3 , and PFDN4/DOK5 . Investigation of candidates SPATA9 (rs72783407), PLCG2 (rs60427389), RAVER2 (rs72675408), JAK1 (rs72675451), PTPN2 (rs2476601), MTHFR C677T (rs1801133), and into the HLA region did not show significant findings. No genetic variants associated with MTX‐DILI were found, whereas suggestive SNPs need further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Clinical outcomes of tamoxifen (TAM) treatment show wide interindividual variability. Comedications and genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in TAM metabolism contributes to this variability. Drug–drug and drug–gene interactions have seldom been studied in African Black populations. We evaluated the effects of commonly co‐administered medicines on TAM pharmacokinetics in a cohort of 229 South African Black female patients with hormone‐receptor positive breast cancer. We also investigated the pharmacokinetic effects of genetic polymorphism in enzymes involved in TAM metabolism, including the variants CYP2D6*17 and *29 , which have been mainly reported in people of African descent. TAM and its major metabolites, N‐desmethyltamoxifen (NDM), 4‐OH‐tamoxifen, and endoxifen (ENDO), were quantified in plasma using the liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry. The GenoPharm open array was used to genotype CYP2D6 , CYP3A5 , CYP3A4 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 . Results showed that CYP2D6 diplotype and CYP2D6 phenotype significantly affected endoxifen concentration ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.001). CYP2D6*17 and CYP2D6*29 significantly reduced the metabolism of NDM to ENDO. Antiretroviral therapy had a significant effect on NDM levels and the TAM/NDM and NDM/ENDO metabolic ratios but did not result in significant effects on ENDO levels. In conclusion, CYP2D6 polymorphisms affected endoxifen concentration and the variants CYP2D6*17 and CYP2D6*29 significantly contributed to low exposure levels of ENDO. This study also suggests a low risk of drug–drug interaction in patients with breast cancer on TAM.",

    "abstract": "Resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) despite the use of three or more antihypertensive drugs of different classes. Although genetic factors may greatly contribute to hypertension with resistance to multiple drug classes, more than for general hypertension, its pathogenesis remains unknown. To reveal the genetic background of resistant hypertension, we categorized 32,239 patients whose data were obtained from the BioBank Japan Project, by prescription of 7 classes of antihypertensive drugs and performed genome‐wide association studies (GWAS). Our GWAS identified four loci with significant association ( P < 5 × 10 −8 ): rs6445583 in CACNA1D and rs12308051 in the intergenic region on chromosome 12 for angiotensin II receptor blockers, rs35497065 in FOXA3 for calcium channel blockers, and rs11066280 in HECTD4 for αβ‐blockers. Because these loci are known to be susceptibility loci for hypertension and/or BP, our results indicate that resistant hypertension is caused by a combination of excessive BP and drug resistance to each antihypertensive pharmacological class. Furthermore, to investigate the genetic difference between BP traits and the treatment effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs, we performed gene‐set analysis and calculated the genetic correlation continuously. Most of the genetic factors were in common between BP traits and antihypertensive effectiveness, but it seems that the genetic architecture of the drug response to antihypertensive treatment is more complicated than BP traits. This corresponds to the well‐known mosaic theory of hypertension. Our findings reveal the complex pathogenesis of hypertension with resistance to multiple classes of antihypertensive drugs.",

    "abstract": "Live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) are human microbiome therapies showing promise in the clinic for a range of diseases and conditions. Describing the kinetics and behavior of LBPs poses a unique modeling challenge because, unlike traditional therapies, LBPs can expand, contract, and colonize the host digestive tract. Here, we present a novel cellular kinetic‐pharmacodynamic quantitative systems pharmacology model of an LBP. The model describes bacterial growth and competition, vancomycin effects, binding and unbinding to the epithelial surface, and production and clearance of butyrate as a therapeutic metabolite. The model is calibrated and validated to published data from healthy volunteers. Using the model, we simulate the impact of treatment dose, frequency, and duration as well as vancomycin pretreatment on butyrate production. This model enables model‐informed drug development and can be used for future microbiome therapies to inform decision making around antibiotic pretreatment, dose selection, loading dose, and dosing duration.",

    "abstract": "In June 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The accelerated approval decision was controversial due to concerns about the use of an unvalidated surrogate measure, beta‐amyloid, as the basis for approval and a lack of clinical outcome benefit. Between October 2021 and September 2022, we conducted a survey of a nationally representative group of internists, medical oncologists, and cardiologists to understand perspectives around aducanumab's approval and how this FDA decision may influence trust in other drugs approved through the accelerated approval program. Among 214 physician respondents familiar with the accelerated approval of aducanumab, 184 (86%) would not prescribe or recommend aducanumab. Further, 143 (67%) physicians reported losing trust in other drugs approved through the accelerated approval program due to the FDA's decision with aducanumab. As a growing number of similar novel Alzheimer's disease treatments are on the horizon, the first of which, lecanemab, already has received accelerated approval in January 2023, our survey findings provide insight into the impact of the FDA's regulatory decisions on the perspectives and prescribing behavior of physicians concerning these novel drug treatments.",

    "abstract": "Methotrexate polyglutamates (MTX‐PG) concentrations in red blood cells (RBCs) have been suggested as a biomarker of response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving low‐dose MTX therapy. We investigated the association and interpatient variability between RBC‐MTX‐PG 3‐5 ‐exposure and response in patients with RA starting MTX. Data of three prospective cohorts were available. The relationship between exposure and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) was analyzed using a population pharmacokinetic‐pharmacodynamic model. Relevant covariates were tested using full covariate modeling and backward elimination. From 395 patients, 3,401 MTX‐PG concentrations and 1,337 DAS28 measurements were available between 0 and 300 days after MTX treatment onset. The developed model adequately described the time course of MTX‐PG 3‐5 and DAS28. The median MTX‐PG 3‐5 level at month 1 was 30.9 nmol/L (interquartile range (IQR): 23.6–43.7; n = 41) and at month 3: 69.3 nmol/L (IQR: 17.9–41.2; n = 351). Clearance of MTX‐PG 3‐5 from RBCs was 28% lower (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.6–32.8%) in a woman and 10% lower (95% CI: 7.7–12.4%) in a 65‐year‐old compared with a 35‐year‐old patient. MTX‐PG 3‐5 concentrations associated with DAS28: half‐maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) was 9.14 nmol/L (95% CI: 4.2 nmol/L‐14.1 nmol/L). EF at 80% (EC 80 ) above 47 nmol/L was regarded as the optimal response. Independent of the MTX‐PG 3–5 – response association, co‐administration of disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs and corticosteroids improved response (additive effect on maximum effect ( E max )), whereas smoking, high body mass index and low albumin decreased E max . In patients with RA starting MTX, RBC‐MTX‐PG 3‐5 was associated with clinical response. A dose increase is suggested when MTX‐PG 3‐5 at month 1 is below 9.15 nmol/L, continued with the same dose when the concentration is above 47 nmol/L, and consider other treatment options above 78 nmol/L from 3 months onwards.",

    "abstract": "Oral azacitidine (oral‐AZA) maintenance is approved for adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in remission post‐intensive chemotherapy, not proceeding to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model to characterize oral‐AZA concentration–time profiles in patients with AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. PopPK‐estimated exposure parameters were used to evaluate exposure–response relationships in the phase III QUAZAR AML‐001 study. The PopPK dataset comprised 286 patients with 1,933 evaluable oral‐AZA concentration records. The final PopPK model was a one‐compartment model with first‐order absorption incorporating an absorption lag time and first‐order elimination. Regression analyses identified two oral‐AZA exposure parameters (area under the plasma concentration–time curve at steady state (AUC ss ); maximum plasma concentration ( C max )) as statistically significant predictors for relapse‐free survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.521, P < 0.001; HR = 0.630, P = 0.013; respectively), and AUC ss as a significant predictor for overall survival (HR = 0.673, P = 0.042). The probability of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia was significantly increased with increases in AUC ss (odds ratio (OR) = 5.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.73–12.62, P < 0.001), cumulative AUC through cycles 1 to 6 (OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.76–4.44, P < 0.001), and C max at steady‐state (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.23–4.76, P = 0.012). A decreasing trend was identified between AUC ss and relapse‐related schedule extensions, vs. an increasing trend between AUC ss and event‐related dose reductions. As the majority (56.8%) of patients required no dose modifications, and the proportions requiring schedule extension (19.4%) or dose reduction (22.9%) were almost equal, oral‐AZA 300 mg once daily for 14 days is the optimal dosing schedule balancing survival benefit and safety risk.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing holds the potential for curative treatments of human disease, however, clinical realization has proven to be a challenging journey with incremental progress made up until recently. Over the last decade, advances in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR‐associated protein (Cas) systems have provided the necessary breakthrough for genome editing in the clinic. The progress of investigational CRISPR therapies from bench to bedside reflects the culmination of multiple advances occurring in parallel, several of which intersect with clinical pharmacology and translation. Directing the CRISPR therapy to the intended site of action has necessitated novel delivery platforms, and this has resulted in special considerations for the complete characterization of distribution, metabolism, and excretion, as well as immunogenicity. Once at the site of action, CRISPR therapies aim to make permanent alterations to the genome and achieve therapeutically relevant effects with a single dose. This fundamental aspect of the mechanism of action for CRISPR therapies results in new considerations for clinical translation and dose selection. Early advances in model‐informed development of CRISPR therapies have incorporated key facets of the mechanism of action and have captured hallmark features of clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics from phase I investigations. Given the recent emergence of CRISPR therapies in clinical development, the landscape continues to evolve rapidly with ample opportunity for continued innovation. Here, we provide a snapshot of selected topics in clinical pharmacology and translation that has supported the advance of systemically administered in vivo and ex vivo CRISPR‐based investigational therapies in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating cancer treatments in real‐world data (RWD) requires informative endpoints. This study replicated the atezolizumab and docetaxel arms of the OAK trial using RWD and compared progression‐free survival (PFS) outcomes derived from abstracted physician's notes in RWD (rwPFS) against PFS outcomes derived from the clinical trial PFS (ctPFS). Atezolizumab and docetaxel arms of the phase III OAK randomized controlled trial (RCT; NCT02008227) were replicated in a US nationwide real‐world database using selected OAK inclusion/exclusion criteria and propensity score‐based adjustment for baseline prognostic variables. Concordance of outcomes was assessed using Kaplan–Meier medians and hazard ratios (HRs). The RWD cohorts comprised 133 patients on atezolizumab and 479 patients on docetaxel. After adjustment, prognostic variables were balanced between RCT arms and corresponding RWD cohorts. The rwPFS and ctPFS outcomes showed better concordance for docetaxel (2.99 vs. 3.52 months; HR: 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85–1.15) than for atezolizumab (3.71 vs. 2.76 months; HR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.61–1.02). Excluding events labeled “pseudo‐progression” from both RWD and RCT improved concordance for atezolizumab (4.24 vs. 4.14 months; HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.70–1.25). These findings were robust across sensitivity analyses. Replicating RCTs using RWD and comparing outcomes can help characterize RWD endpoints. Similarity of results between rwPFS and ctPFS at the cohort level may depend on drug category, highlighting the need for further studies to verify and understand when the corresponding outcomes can be compared, including within the same patient.",

    "abstract": "Bispecific T cell engagers (Bi‐TCEs) have revolutionized the treatment of oncology indications across both liquid and solid tumors. Bi‐TCEs are rapidly evolving from conventional intravenous (i.v.) to more convenient subcutaneous (s.c.) administrations and extending beyond adults to also benefit pediatric patients. Leveraging clinical development experience across three generations of Bi‐TCE molecules across both liquid and solid tumor indications from i.v./s.c. dosing in adults and pediatric subjects, we developed a mechanistic‐physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) platform model for Bi‐TCEs. The model utilizes a full PBPK model framework and was successfully validated for PK predictions following i.v. and s.c. dosing across both liquid and solid tumor space in adults for eight Bi‐TCEs. After refinement to incorporate physiological ontogeny, the model was successfully validated to predict pediatric PKs in 1 month – < 2 years, 2–11 years, and 12–17 years old subjects following i.v. dosing. Following s.c. dosing in pediatric subjects, the model predicted similar bioavailability, however, a shorter time to maximum concentration ( T max ) for the three age groups compared with adults. The model was also applied to guide the dosing strategy for first generation of Bi‐TCEs for organ impairment, specifically renal impairment, and was able to accurately predict the impact of renal impairment on PK for these relatively small‐size Bi‐TCEs. This work highlights a novel mechanistic platform model for accurately predicting the PK in adult and pediatric patients across liquid and solid tumor indications from i.v./s.c. dosing and can be used to guide optimal dose and dosing regimen selection and accelerating the clinical development for Bi‐TCEs.",

Our objective was to characterize trends of pregnancy and lactation‐related postmarketing commitments (PMCs) and postmarketing requirements (PMRs) for new molecular entities approved by the FDA between 2000 and 2022. Approval letters of original New Drug Applications (NDAs, N = 488) for new molecular entities were obtained from the FDA website. NDAs with pregnancy and lactation‐based PMCs/PMRs were identified, and data extracted. Data included: PMC/PMR timelines and attributes of requested study(ies) (type, design elements, and outcomes) when available. Fifty‐nine NDAs included 92 PMCs/PMRs related to pregnancy and lactation. Forty‐one NDAs had pregnancy‐related PMRs/PMCs, 4 had lactation‐related PMRs, and 14 had both. Most PMRs/PMCs were for nervous system medications ( N = 33). Forty‐seven NDAs specified safety data collection in infants in at least the first year of life. All pregnancy‐related PMRs were issued after 2008, most PMCs ( N = 8) were issued before 2008. Only one PMC requested a pharmacokinetic study in pregnant women. All lactation‐related PMRs ( N = 18) requested measurement of drug concentrations in breast milk with one also requiring measurement of maternal blood concentrations. Eighty‐nine percent of lactation‐related PMRs were requested after 2015. There was a steady increase in pregnancy and lactation‐related PMRs following enactment of FDAAA and PLLR. Additions involved information collection pertaining to safety of the medication in pregnant and lactating women and children exposed to medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding.",

    "abstract": "DPYD ‐guided dosing has improved the safety of fluoropyrimidine‐based chemotherapy in recent years. However, severe toxicity remains in ~ 23% of patients not carrying DPYD variant alleles treated with capecitabine. Therefore, we developed a predictive model based on patient‐related and treatment‐related factors aimed at estimating the risk of developing severe capecitabine‐related toxicity. The nomogram was developed using data from two large clinical trials (NCT00838370 and NCT02324452). Patients with cancer carrying a DPYD variant allele ( DPYD *2A, c.1236G>A, c.2846A>T, and c.1679T>G) were excluded. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression using predetermined predictors based on previous findings, including age, sex, body surface area, type of treatment regimen, and creatinine levels were used to develop the nomogram. The developed model was internally validated using bootstrap resampling and cross‐validation. This model was not externally or clinically validated. A total of 2,147 DPYD wild‐type patients with cancer treated with capecitabine‐based chemotherapy regimens were included of which complete data of 1,745 patients were available and used for the development of the nomogram. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression showed that age, sex, and type of treatment regimen were strong predictors of severe capecitabine‐related toxicity in DPYD wild‐type patients. Internal validation demonstrated a concordance index of 0.68 which indicates a good discriminative ability for prediction of severe capecitabine‐related toxicity. The developed nomogram includes readily available parameters and may be a helpful tool for clinicians to assess the risk of developing severe capecitabine‐related toxicity in patients without known risk DPYD variant alleles treated with capecitabine‐based anticancer regimens.",

    "abstract": "Influenza infection may lead to serious complications in the postpartum period, therefore, oseltamivir treatment in these patients and their breastfed infants is of great importance. However, the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir in postpartum lactating women with acute influenza infection, and the consequent infant exposure to oseltamivir are still unknown, and these data would help in assessing risk and the need for dose adjustment in breastfed infants. Six lactating women with influenza‐like symptoms, at a standard dose of 75 mg oral oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days, were recruited in this phase IV clinical study during the 2011/2012 H1N1 pandemic seasons. Breast milk/colostrum and venous blood samples were taken at multiple timepoints, maternal urine samples were obtained from total output within the 12‐hour observational period following the seventh dose of oseltamivir. Oseltamivir phosphate (OP) reached a maximum 69.5 ± 29.4 ng/mL concentration in breast milk, higher than that found in the plasma, and showed elimination within ~ 8 hours. Oseltamivir carboxylate (active metabolite of OP) showed a lower, nearly steady‐state concentration in breast milk during the observational period (maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) = 38.4 ± 12.9 ng/mL). Based on estimated daily milk consumption of exclusively breastfed infants, their calculated daily exposure is < 0.1% of the infant dose of oseltamivir for treatment of influenza as per marketing authorization. Here, we provide the first maternal breast milk pharmacokinetic data for oral multiple‐dose oseltamivir in lactating patients with influenza and showed that its concentration in the breast milk is not sufficient to reach a therapeutic dose for breastfed infants.",

    "abstract": "Rational prescribing is essential for the quality of health care. However, many final‐year medical students and junior doctors lack prescribing competence to perform this task. The availability of a list of medicines that a junior doctor working in Europe should be able to independently prescribe safely and effectively without supervision could support and harmonize teaching and training in clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (CPT) in Europe. Therefore, our aim was to achieve consensus on such a list of medicines that are widely accessible in Europe. For this, we used a modified Delphi study method consisting of three parts. In part one, we created an initial list based on a literature search. In part two, a group of 64 coordinators in CPT education, selected via the Network of Teachers in Pharmacotherapy of the European Association for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, evaluated the accessibility of each medicine in his or her country, and provided a diverse group of experts willing to participate in the Delphi part. In part three, 463 experts from 24 European countries were invited to participate in a 2‐round Delphi study. In total, 187 experts (40%) from 24 countries completed both rounds and evaluated 416 medicines, 98 of which were included in the final list. The top three Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code groups were (1) cardiovascular system ( n = 23), (2) anti‐infective ( n = 21), and (3) musculoskeletal system ( n = 11). This European List of Key Medicines for Medical Education could be a starting point for country‐specific lists and could be used for the training and assessment of CPT.",

    "abstract": "Clinical investigation of emvododstat for the treatment of solid tumors was halted after two patients who were heavily treated with other anticancer therapies experienced drug‐induced liver failure. However, preclinical investigations supported that emvododstat at lower doses might be effective in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and against severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 as a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor. Therefore, a quantitative systems toxicology model, DILIsym, was used to predict liver safety of the proposed dosing of emvododstat in AML clinical trials. In vitro mechanistic toxicity data of emvododstat and its desmethyl metabolite were integrated with in vivo exposure within DILIsym to predict hepatotoxicity responses in a simulated human population. DILIsym simulations predicted alanine aminotransferase elevations observed in prior emvododstat clinical trials in patients with solid tumors, but not in the prospective AML clinical trial with the proposed dosing regimens. Exposure predictions based on physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic modeling suggested that reduced doses of emvododstat would produce clinical exposures that would be efficacious to treat AML. In the AML clinical trial, only eight patients experienced aminotransferase elevations, all of which were mild (grade 1), all resolving within a short period of time, and no patient showed symptoms of hepatotoxicity, confirming the prospective prediction of liver safety. Overall, retrospective DILIsym simulations adequately predicted the liver safety liabilities of emvododstat in solid tumor trials and prospective simulations predicted the liver safety of reduced doses in an AML clinical trial. The modeling was critical to enabling regulatory approval to proceed with the AML clinical trial wherein the predicted liver safety was confirmed.",

    "abstract": "The transition from intravenous (i.v.) to subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of biologics is a critical strategy in drug development aimed at improving patient convenience, compliance, and therapeutic outcomes. Focusing on the increasing role of model‐informed drug development (MIDD) in the acceleration of this transition, an in‐depth overview of the essential clinical pharmacology, and regulatory considerations for successful i.v. to s.c. bridging for biologics after the i.v. formulation has been approved are presented. Considerations encompass multiple aspects beginning with adequate pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (i.e., exposure‐response) evaluations which play a vital role in establishing comparability between the i.v. and s.c. routes of administrations. Selected key recommendations and points to consider include: (i) PK characterization of the s.c. formulation, supported by the increasing preclinical understanding of the s.c. absorption, and robust PK study design and analyses in humans; (ii) a thorough characterization of the exposure‐response profiles including important metrics of exposure for both efficacy and safety; (iii) comparability studies designed to meet regulatory considerations and support approval of the s.c. formulation, including noninferiority studies with PK and/or efficacy and safety as primary end points; and (iv) comprehensive safety package addressing assessments of immunogenicity and patients' safety profile with the new route of administration. Recommendations for successful bridging strategies are evolving and MIDD approaches have been used successfully to accelerate the transition to s.c. dosing, ultimately leading to improved patient experiences, adherence, and clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Autotaxin (ATX) contributes to the production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which is associated with fibrosis development in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The ATX inhibitor ziritaxestat failed to reduce decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with IPF in ISABELA 1 and 2 (NCT03711162 and NCT03733444), two identically designed phase III studies. In the current analysis, we evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the pooled ISABELA studies to determine whether the lack of efficacy could be attributed to insufficient exposure and/or target engagement. Nonlinear mixed effect modeling was performed to predict ziritaxestat exposure in individual patients and describe its effect on LPA C18:2 levels. We assessed whether there was a correlation between ziritaxestat and ATX concentration and evaluated the relationship between LPA C18:2 reduction and change from baseline in FVC. Ziritaxestat exposure in patients with IPF was numerically lower in those who received ziritaxestat on top of pirfenidone than in those who received ziritaxestat on top of nintedanib or ziritaxestat alone. In most patients, LPA C18:2 reduction was comparable to that reported in healthy volunteers. ATX concentrations increased over time and correlated weakly with ziritaxestat exposure and LPA C18:2 reduction. No correlation between reduction in LPA C18:2 and change from baseline in FVC was apparent. Based on these evaluations, exposure and target engagement are not thought to have contributed to the lack of efficacy observed. We hypothesize that the lack of efficacy of ziritaxestat in the ISABELA program, despite adequate LPA reduction, could be due to the involvement of an alternative pro‐fibrotic pathway.",

    "abstract": "Despite the requirement of routine blood tests during thiamazole treatment in Japan, granulocytopenia among patients treated with thiamazole has been occasionally reported to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). To characterize granulocytopenia in patients with thiamazole in Japan, the effects of routine blood tests were examined in a cohort of new users of thiamazole or propylthiouracil utilizing the MID‐NET. The occurrence of granulocytopenia (neutrophil count ≤ 1,500/μL) in a given period was compared between patients with and without blood test results prior to the period. The trend in neutrophil count during thiamazole treatment was also compared between patients with and without granulocytopenia. A nested case–control study based on the cohort was conducted to identify potential risk factors for granulocytopenia during thiamazole treatment. In the new user cohort including 4,371 patients treated with thiamazole, the occurrence of granulocytopenia in patients who had undergone blood tests at all previous periods was similar or higher than that among those who had not undergone blood test in all previous periods (e.g., adjusted odds ratio in period 2 was 1.63). The neutrophil count was relatively lower in the group of patients with granulocytopenia even before the occurrence of granulocytopenia. In a nested case–control study, an upward tendency of the risk was observed when a patient was co‐prescribed anti‐arrhythmic drugs or antiulcer drugs with thiamazole. The characteristics of granulocytopenia during thiamazole treatment elucidated in this study should be recognized in clinical practice for the proper use of thiamazole.",

    "abstract": "To support informed decision making, clear descriptions of the beneficial and harmful effects of a treatment are needed by various stakeholders. The current paradigm is to generate evidence sequentially through different experiments. However, data generated later, perhaps through observational studies, can be difficult to compare with earlier randomized trial data, resulting in confusion in understanding and interpretation of treatment effects. Moreover, the scientific questions these later experiments can serve to answer often remain vague. We propose Flexible Augmented Clinical Trial for Improved eVidence gEneration (FACTIVE), a new class of study designs enabling flexible augmentation of confirmatory randomized controlled trials with concurrent and close‐to‐real‐world elements. Our starting point is to use clearly defined objectives for evidence generation, which are formulated through early discussion with health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and are additional to regulatory requirements for authorization of a new treatment. These enabling designs facilitate estimation of certain well‐defined treatment effects in the confirmatory part and other complementary treatment effects in a concurrent real‐world part. Each stakeholder should use the evidence that is relevant within their own decision‐making framework. High quality data are generated under one single protocol and the use of randomization ensures rigorous statistical inference and interpretation within and between the different parts of the experiment. Evidence for the decision making of HTA bodies could be available earlier than is currently the case.",

    "abstract": "Warfarin is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). Concomitant use with the potent CYP2C9 inducer, rifampin, requires close monitoring and dosage adjustments. Although, in theory, warfarin dose increase should overcome this interaction, most reported cases over the last 50 years have not responded even to high warfarin doses, but some have responded to modest doses. To investigate the genetic polymorphisms' impact on this unexplained interpatient variability, we performed genotyping of CYP2C9 , VKORC1 , and CYP4F2 for warfarin and rifampin concomitant receivers from 2016 to 2022 at Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar. We identified and included 36 patients: 22 responders and 14 nonresponders. Warfarin‐responders were significantly more likely to have one or more warfarin‐sensitizing CYP2C9 / VKORC1 alleles than nonresponders (odds ratio = 23.2, 95% confidence interval = 3.2–195.6; P = 0.0001). The mean genetic‐based pre‐interaction calculated dose was significantly lower for responders than for nonresponders ( P < 0.001); and was negatively correlated with warfarin sensitivity index (WSI) ( r = −0.58; P = 0.0002). The median percentage time in therapeutic range and mean WSI were significantly higher in the warfarin‐sensitizing CYP2C9 / VKORC1 alleles carriers than noncarriers ( P = 0.017 and 0.0004, respectively). Whereas the warfarin‐sensitizing CYP2C9 / VKORC1 genotypes were associated with modest on‐rifampin warfarin dose requirements, the noncarriers would have required more than double these doses to respond. Warfarin‐sensitizing CYP2C9 / VKORC1 genotypes and low genetic‐based warfarin calculated doses were associated with higher warfarin sensitivity and better anticoagulation quality in patients receiving rifampin concomitantly.",

    "abstract": "Metformin is the first‐line drug for type 2 diabetes (T2D) while acarbose is suggested as a viable alternative in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2D. However, few biomarkers have been established to guide the choice between these two agents. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number (mtDNA‐CN) is a biomarker of mitochondrial function, which is associated with various metabolic outcomes. Using data from the trial of Metformin and Acarbose in Chinese as the Initial Hypoglycaemic Treatment (MARCH) (metformin n = 214; acarbose n = 198), we examined whether mtDNA‐CN was associated with response to the drugs in terms of glycemic response and β‐cell function protection response. The glycemic response is defined as the maximum glucose reduction of glycated hemoglobin A 1c , fasting plasma glucose, or postprandial blood glucose during 48 weeks. β‐cell function protection response is defined as the maximum increment of insulinogenic index (IGI) or disposition index (DI). For all three glycemic responses, mtDNA‐CN was not significantly associated with either metformin or acarbose. Importantly, for β‐cell function protection response, we found the increased mtDNA‐CN was significantly associated with more IGI increment (beta: 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.02 to 1.66) in the metformin group, but less IGI increment (beta: −1.38; 95% CI, −2.52 to −0.23) in the acarbose group. A significant interaction ( P = 0.008) between mtDNA‐CN and the treatment group was observed. Consistent results were also obtained when DI increment was used as a measure of β‐cell function response. This study demonstrated the potential application of mtDNA‐CN in guiding the treatment choice between metformin and acarbose based on β‐cell protection.",

    "abstract": "To protect people from severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, tremendous research efforts have been made toward coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19) treatment development. Externally controlled trials (ECTs) may help reduce their development time. To evaluate whether ECT using real‐world data (RWD) of patients with COVID‐19 is feasible enough to be used for regulatory decision making, we built an external control arm (ECA) based on RWD as a control arm of a previously conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT), and compared it to the control arm of the RCT. The electronic health record (EHR)‐based COVID‐19 cohort dataset was used as RWD, and three Adaptive COVID‐19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) datasets were used as RCTs. Among the RWD datasets, eligible patients were evaluated as a pool of external control subjects of the ACTT‐1, ACTT‐2, and ACTT‐3 trials, respectively. The ECAs were built using propensity score matching, and the balance of age, sex, and baseline clinical status ordinal scale as covariates between the treatment arms of Asian patients in each ACTT and the pools of external control subjects was assessed before and after 1:1 matching. There was no statistically significant difference in time to recovery between ECAs and the control arms of each ACTT. Among the covariates, the baseline status ordinal score had the greatest influence on the building of ECA. This study demonstrates that ECA based on EHR data of COVID‐19 patients could sufficiently replace the control arm of an RCT, and it is expected to help develop new treatments faster in emergency situations, such as the COVID‐19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Mercaptopurine is a cornerstone of maintenance chemotherapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Its cytotoxic effects are mediated by 6‐thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) incorporation into lymphocyte DNA. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) inactivates mercaptopurine, and deficiency resulting from genetic variants increases TGN exposure and hematopoietic toxicity. Although mercaptopurine‐dose reduction reduces toxicity risk without compromising relapse rate in patients with TPMT deficiency, dosing recommendations for those with moderately reduced activity (intermediate metabolizer (IM)) are less clear and their clinical impacts have yet to be established. This cohort study assessed the effect of TPMT IM status on mercaptopurine‐associated toxicity and TGN blood exposure in pediatric patients with ALL initiated on standard dose mercaptopurine. Of 88 patients studied (mean age 4.8 years), 10 (11.4%) were TPMT IM, and all had undergone ≥ 3 cycles of maintenance therapy (80% completed). A larger proportion of TPMT IM than normal metabolizers (NM) had febrile neutropenia (FN) during the first two cycles of maintenance, reaching significance in the second cycle (57% vs. 15%, respectively; odds ratio = 7.33, P < 0.05). Compared to NM, FN events occurred more frequently and with prolonged duration in IM in cycles 1 and 2 (adjusted P < 0.05). IM had a 2.46‐fold increased hazard ratio for FN, and about twofold higher TGN level than NM ( P < 0.05). Myelotoxicity was more common in IM than NM (86% vs. 42%, respectively) during cycle 2 (odds ratio = 8.2, P < 0.05). TPMT IM initiated at a standard mercaptopurine dose are at greater risk for FN during early cycles of maintenance therapy, thus our findings support genotype‐guided dose adjustment to reduce toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Instructions for administration with regard to food are a key aspect of how patients experience oral drugs. Through potential effects on pharmacokinetics, the food condition can influence safety and efficacy, and thereby is one of many dimensions of dose optimization. Regulatory guidance from major health authorities advocates for the early investigation of food effect (FE) in clinical development. In oncology, exploratory FE (eFE) evaluation is often incorporated into the first‐in‐human (FIH) studies in patients to inform food condition of later clinical studies. However, the design aspects of such exploratory assessments are generally under‐reported and barely described, and yet complex, due to uniqueness of FIH study design and drug development process in oncology. Herein, we review literature of eFE assessment study design in oncology in patients, and present the Novartis experience in the design, execution, and impact of eFE in FIH oncology studies from 2014 to 2021. Based on this, we propose a roadmap for eFE assessment in early clinical drug development for oncology drugs in patients, including a framework for common study design options with a focus on study‐ and patient‐level timing for typical scenarios. We also provide a broad spectrum of decision‐making factors which should be evaluated to drive the design and implementation of eFE assessment, spanning from clinical development strategy, FIH study design, to compound‐specific features.",

    "abstract": "Whereas islet autoantibodies (AAs) are well‐established risk factors for developing type 1 diabetes (T1D), there is a lack of biomarkers endorsed by regulators to enrich clinical trial populations for those at risk of developing T1D. As such, the development of therapies that delay or prevent the onset of T1D remains challenging. To address this drug development need, the Critical Path Institute's T1D Consortium (T1DC) acquired patient‐level data from multiple observational studies and used a model‐based approach to evaluate the utility of islet AAs as enrichment biomarkers in clinical trials. An accelerated failure time model was developed, discussed in our previous publication, which provided the underlying evidence required to receive a qualification opinion for islet AAs as enrichment biomarkers from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2022. To further democratize the use of the model for scientists and clinicians, we developed a Clinical Trial Enrichment Graphical User Interface. The interactive tool allows users to specify trial participant characteristics, including the percentage of participants with a specific AA combination. Users can specify ranges for participant baseline age, sex, blood glucose measurement from the 120‐minute timepoints of an oral glucose tolerance test, and HbA1c. The tool then applies the model to predict the mean probability of a T1D diagnosis for that trial population and renders the results to the user. To ensure adequate data privacy and to make the tool open‐source, a deep learning‐based generative model was used to generate a cohort of synthetic subjects that underpins the tool.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid designs with both randomized arms and an external control cohort preserve key features of randomization and utilize external information to augment clinical trials. In this study, we propose to leverage high‐quality, patient‐level concurrent registries to enhance clinical trials and illustrate the impact on trial design for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The proposed methodology was evaluated in a randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trial. We used patient‐level information from a well‐defined, population‐based registry, that was running parallel to the randomized clinical trial, to identify concurrently nonparticipating, eligible patients who could be matched with trial participants, and integrate them into the statistical analysis. We assessed the impact of the addition of the external controls on the treatment effect estimate, precision, and time to reach a conclusion. During the runtime of the trial, a total of 1,141 registry patients were alive; 473 (41.5%) of them fulfilled the eligibility criteria and 133 (11.7%) were enrolled in the study. A matched control population could be identified among the nonparticipating patients. Augmenting the randomized controls with matched external controls could have avoided unnecessary randomization of 17 patients (−12.8%) as well as reducing the study duration from 30.1 months to 22.6 months (−25.0%). Matching eligible external controls from a different calendar period led to bias in the treatment effect estimate. Hybrid trial designs utilizing a concurrent registry with rigorous matching can minimize bias due to a mismatch in calendar time and differences in standard of care, and may accelerate the development of new treatments.",

    "abstract": "Tocilizumab and sarilumab are IL‐6‐receptor antagonists registered for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with equal effectiveness and safety. Switching from tocilizumab to sarilumab could be a strategy to reduce injection burden, in case of drug shortages, and to reduce costs. This study therefore aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of switching patients with RA with well‐controlled disease under tocilizumab treatment to sarilumab. Patients with RA with low Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28;‐CRP < 2.9 or < 3.5 with clinical judgment), on stable dose tocilizumab (> 6 months) were offered to switch to sarilumab. Patients who switched and consented were followed for 6 months. Sarilumab was started at 200 mg and double the last tocilizumab interval. Co‐primary outcomes at 6 months were (i) the 90% confidence interval (CI) of DAS28‐CRP change from baseline compared with the non‐inferiority margin of 0.6 and (ii) the 90% CI of the proportion of patients persisting with sarilumab, compared with a prespecified minimum of 70%. Of 50 invited patients, 25 agreed to switch to sarilumab, and 23 patients switched and were included. One patient was lost to follow‐up immediately after inclusion, therefore 22 patients are included in the analyses. At 6 months, mean change in DAS28‐CRP was 0.48 (90% CI: 0.11–0.87), compared with the non‐inferiority margin of 0.6. Sarilumab persistence was 68% (90% CI: 51–82%, 15 out of 22 patients), compared with the prespecified minimum of 70%. Non‐medical switching from tocilizumab to sarilumab in patients doing well on tocilizumab failed to show non‐inferiority regarding disease activity and drug persistence.",

    "abstract": "Novel drug treatments for pediatric patients with cancer are urgently needed. Success of drug development in pediatric oncology has been promising, but many drugs still fail in translation from preclinical to clinical phases. To increase the translational potential, several improvements have been implemented, including the use of clinically achievable concentrations in the drug testing phase. Although pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of numerous investigated drugs are published, a comprehensive PK overview of the most common drugs in pediatric oncology could guide preclinical trial design and improve the translatability into clinical trials. A review of the literature was conducted for PK parameters of 74 anticancer drugs, from the drug sensitivity profiling library of the INdividualized Therapy FOr Relapsed Malignancies in Childhood (INFORM) registry. PK data in the pediatric population were reported and complemented by adult parameters when no pediatric data were available. In addition, blood–brain barrier (BBB)‐penetration assessment of drugs was provided by using the BBB score. Maximum plasma concentration was available for 73 (97%), area under the plasma concentration‐time curve for 69 (92%), plasma protein binding for 66 (88%), plasma half‐life for 57 (76%), time to maximum concentration for 54 (72%), clearance for 52 (69%), volume of distribution for 37 (49%), lowest plasma concentration reached by the drug before the next dose administration for 21 (28%), and steady‐state concentration for 4 (5%) of drugs. Pediatric PK data were available for 48 (65%) drugs. We provide a comprehensive review of PK data for 74 drugs studied in pediatric oncology. This data set can serve as a reference to design experiments more closely mimicking drug PK conditions in patients, and may thereby increase the probability of successful clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Patho‐physiological changes in liver cirrhosis create portacaval shunts that allow blood flow to bypass the hepatic portal vein into the systemic circulation affecting drug pharmacokinetics (PKs). The objectives of this work were to implement a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) framework describing shunted blood flows in virtual patients with differing degrees of liver cirrhosis; and to assess the minimal and full PBPK model's performance using drugs with intermediate to high hepatic extraction. Single dose concentration‐time profiles and PK parameters for oral ibrutinib, midazolam, propranolol, and buspirone were simulated in healthy volunteers (HVs) and subjects with cirrhosis (Child‐Pugh severity score (CP‐A, CP‐B, or CP‐C)). Model performance was verified by comparing predicted to observed fold‐changes in PK parameters between HVs and cirrhotic subjects. The verified model was used to simulate the PK changes for simvastatin in patients with cirrhosis. The predicted area under the curve ratios (AUC Cirr :AUC HV ) for ibrutinib were 3.38, 6.87, and 11.46 using the minimal PBPK model with shunt and 1.61, 2.58, and 4.33 without the shunt, these compared with observed values of 4.33, 8.14, and 9.04, respectively. For ibrutinib, propranolol, and buspirone, including a shunt in the PBPK model improved the prediction of the AUC Cirr :AUC HV and maximum plasma concentration ratios (C maxCirr :C maxHV ). For midazolam, an intermediate extraction drug, the differences were less clear. Simulated simvastatin dose adjustments in cirrhosis suggested that 20 mg in CP‐A and 10 mg in CP‐B could be used clinically. A mechanistic model‐informed understanding of the anatomic and pathophysiology of cirrhosis will facilitate improved dose prediction and adjustment in this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Environmental health science seeks to predict how environmental toxins, chemical toxicants, and prescription drugs accumulate and interact within the body. Xenobiotic transporters of the ATP‐binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) superfamilies are major determinants of the uptake and disposition of xenobiotics across the kingdoms of life. The goal of this study was to integrate drug and environmental chemical interactions of mammalian ABC and SLC proteins in a centralized, integrative database. We built upon an existing publicly accessible platform—the “TransPortal”—which was updated with novel data and searchable features on transporter‐interfering chemicals from manually curated literature data. The integrated resource TransPortal‐TICBase ( https://transportal.compbio.ucsf.edu ) now contains information on 46 different mammalian xenobiotic transporters of the ABC‐ and SLC‐type superfamilies, including 13 newly added rodent and 2 additional human drug transporters, 126 clinical drug–drug interactions, and a more than quadrupled expansion of the initial in vitro chemical interaction data from 1,402 to 6,296 total interactions. Based on our updated database, environmental interference with major human and rodent drug transporters occurs across the ABC‐ and SLC‐type superfamilies, with kinetics indicating that some chemicals, such as the ionic liquid 1‐hexylpyridinium chloride and the antiseptic chlorhexidine, can act as strong inhibitors with potencies similar or even higher than pharmacological model inhibitors. The new integrated web portal serves as a central repository of current and emerging data for interactions of prescription drugs and environmental chemicals with human drug transporters. This archive has important implications for predicting adverse drug–drug and drug‐environmental chemical interactions and can serve as a reference website for the broader scientific community of clinicians and researchers.",

In a phase Ib/IIa placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, multiple ascending dose study in patients with NASH (NCT04048135), administration of pegozafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in hepatic fat fraction (HFF), with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. We aimed to characterize the relationship between pegozafermin dosing, exposure and effects on HFF reduction. We used pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling of data from the phase Ib/IIa study to identify model parameters and covariates affecting the exposure–response relationship. Clinical simulations were performed to help support dose selection for larger studies. Pegozafermin exposure was adequately described by a one compartment PK model, with one additional transit absorption compartment. PK/PD modeling demonstrated that HFF reduction was significantly related to pegozafermin exposure. HFF outcomes were correlated with average pegozafermin concentrations regardless of weekly dosing (q.w.) or dosing every 2 weeks (q2w). The significant PK/PD model covariates included baseline body weight, alanine aminotransferase level, and liver volume. Simulations showed that the 30 mg q.w. dose approximated the full PD effect; almost all patients would benefit from a greater than or equal to 30% HFF reduction, suggesting fibrosis regression. Furthermore, 44 mg q2w dosing (~22 mg q.w.) appeared to be an effective regimen for HFF reduction. Our modeling supports the feasibility of q.w. and q2w dosing for achieving favorable treatment outcomes in patients with NASH, and provides the rationale for dose selection for the phase IIb ENLIVEN study (NCT04929483).",

To confirm 200 mg/day as the recommended phase III dose (RP3D), we integrated preclinical, clinical, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), and exposure–response modeling results. Population PK/PD modeling of IAP inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 21 patients suggested the pharmacologically active dose range was 100–200 mg/day, with a trend for more robust inhibition at the end of the dosing interval at 200 mg/day based on an indirect response model. Additionally, the unbound average plasma concentration at 200 mg/day was similar to that associated with efficacy in preclinical xenograft models. Logistic regression exposure–response analyses of data from 62 patients in the phase II study showed exposure‐related increases in probabilities of locoregional control at 18 months (primary end point), overall response, complete response, and the radiosensitization mechanism‐related composite safety end point “mucositis and/or dysphagia” ( P < 0.05). Exposure–response relationships were not discernible for 12 of 13 evaluated safety end points, incidence of dose reductions, and time to first dose reduction. Quantitative integration of all available data, including model‐derived target inhibition profiles, positive exposure‐efficacy relationships, and lack of discernible exposure‐safety relationships for most safety end points, supports selection of xevinapant 200 mg/day on days 1–14 of a 3‐week cycle as the RP3D, allowing for successive dose reductions to 150 and 100 mg/day to manage adverse events.",

We performed population pharmacokinetic modeling for tremelimumab using data from 1,605 patients across 6 studies (including POSEIDON) in multiple tumors (lung cancer, bladder cancer, malignant mesothelioma, and other solid tumors), and identified a 2‐compartment model with linear and time‐varying clearance for tremelimumab. Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to 326 patients with mNSCLC from POSEIDON to evaluate the association between exposure metrics and efficacy end points, adjusting for baseline prognostic covariates. Improved progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the tremelimumab arm (in combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy) was associated with higher tremelimumab exposure (e.g., minimum concentration at 5th dose ( C min,dose5 ) and area under the curve at 5th dose (AUC dose5 )). However, further case‐matching analyses yielded hazard ratios for the comparison of tremelimumab‐treated patients in the C min,dose5 quartile 1 (Q1) subgroup with matched chemotherapy‐treated patients of 1.04 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76–1.44) for OS and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.72–1.36) for PFS, suggesting that the observed apparent exposure–response relationship might be confounded. No relationship between tremelimumab exposure and safety (grade ≥3 treatment‐emergent adverse events [AEs], AEs of special interest, or discontinuation due to AEs) was identified. These results support the consistent benefit observed with tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks for up to 5 doses in combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy in POSEIDON as first‐line therapy for mNSCLC.",

    "abstract": "A toxicity‐reduced conditioning regimen with treosulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa in patients with high‐risk β‐thalassemia major has significantly improved hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) outcomes. However, complications resulting from regimen‐related toxicities (RRTs), mixed chimerism, and graft rejection remain a challenge. We evaluated the dose–exposure‐response relationship of treosulfan and its active metabolite S, S‐EBDM, in a uniform cohort of patients with β‐thalassemia major to identify whether therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and dose adjustment of treosulfan is feasible. Plasma treosulfan/S, S‐EBDM levels were measured in 77 patients using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using nlmixr2. The influence of treosulfan and S, S‐EBDM exposure, and GSTA1/NQO1 polymorphisms on graft rejection, RRTs, chimerism status, and 1‐year overall survival (OS), and thalassemia‐free survival (TFS) were assessed. We observed that treosulfan exposure was lower in patients with graft rejection than those without (1,655 vs. 2,037 mg•h/L, P = 0.07). Pharmacodynamic modeling analysis to identify therapeutic cutoff revealed that treosulfan exposure ≥1,660 mg•hour/L was significantly associated with better 1‐year TFS (97% vs. 81%, P = 0.02) and a trend to better 1‐year OS (90% vs. 69%, P = 0.07). Further, multivariate analysis adjusting for known pre‐HCT risk factors also revealed treosulfan exposure <1,660 mg•h/L (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12–9.34; P = 0.03) and GSTA1*B variant genotype (HR = 3.75; 95% CI = 1.04–13.47; P = 0.04) to be independent predictors for inferior 1‐year TFS. We conclude that lower treosulfan exposure increases the risk of graft rejection and early transplant‐related mortality affecting TFS. As no RRTs were observed with increasing treosulfan exposure, TDM‐based dose adjustment could be feasible and beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Combination therapies are often evaluated during the clinical development of oncology investigational agents. A new investigational agent may be combined with one or more approved agent(s) or investigational agent(s). As the initial step to test combination therapies, combination dose escalation of an investigational agent and an approved drug is generally conducted using one of the following designs: sequential design, parallel (staggered) design, healthy participant first‐in‐human prior to first‐in‐patient combination escalation, monotherapy lead‐in (intra‐patient “crossover”), and potentially combination escalation (no monotherapy component). Dose‐finding studies for the combinations of two investigational agents may follow similar principles and considerations, and a more conservative approach may be required. A comparison of the characteristics of these designs indicates an efficient design should consider factors including the predicted difference in dose/exposure‐response relationships between monotherapy and combination therapy, any potential for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between the combinatory agents, and the benefit/risk to study participants, etc. In this report, we propose application scenarios for each trial design based on the above considerations and a review of the internal database and published external studies. Generation of robust exposure‐response data via an appropriate design will assist the selection of appropriate doses for further assessment to support optimal dose selection as encouraged by the US Food and Drug Administration based on Project Optimus.",

    "abstract": "Biological plausibility suggests that fluoroquinolones may lead to mitral valve regurgitation or aortic valve regurgitation (MR/AR) through a collagen degradation pathway. However, available real‐world studies were limited and yielded inconsistent findings. We estimated the risk of MR/AR associated with fluoroquinolones compared with other antibiotics with similar indications in a population‐based cohort study. We identified adult patients who initiated fluoroquinolones or comparison antibiotics from the nationwide Taiwanese claims database. Patients were followed for up to 60 days after cohort entry. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of MR/AR comparing fluoroquinolones to comparison antibiotics after 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching. All analyses were conducted by type of fluoroquinolone (fluoroquinolones as a class, respiratory fluoroquinolones, and non‐respiratory fluoroquinolones) and comparison antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam, extended‐spectrum cephalosporins). Among 6,649,284 eligible patients, the crude incidence rates of MR/AR ranged from 1.44 to 4.99 per 1,000 person‐years across different types of fluoroquinolones and comparison antibiotics. However, fluoroquinolone use was not associated with an increased risk in each pairwise PS‐matched comparison. HRs were 1.00 (95% CI, 0.89–1.11) for fluoroquinolones as a class, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.83–1.12) for respiratory fluoroquinolones, and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.75–1.01) for non‐respiratory fluoroquinolones, compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Results were similar when fluoroquinolones were compared with extended‐spectrum cephalosporins (HRs of 0.96, 95% CI, 0.82–1.12, HR, 1.05, 95% CI, 0.86–1.28, and HR, 0.88, 95% CI, 0.75–1.03, respectively). This large‐scale cohort study did not find a higher risk of MR/AR with different types of fluoroquinolones in the adult population.",

    "abstract": "A physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to simulate plasma concentrations of tucatinib (TUKYSA®) after single‐dose or multiple‐dose administration of 300 mg b.i.d. orally. This PBPK model was subsequently applied to support evaluation of drug–drug interaction (DDI) risk as a perpetrator resulting from tucatinib inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P‐gp, or MATE1/2‐K. The PBPK model was also applied to support evaluation of DDI risk as a victim resulting from co‐administration with CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inhibitors, or a CYP3A4 inducer. After refinement with clinical DDI data, the final PBPK model was able to recover the clinically observed single and multiple‐dose plasma concentrations for tucatinib when tucatinib was administered as a single agent in healthy subjects. In addition, the final model was able to recover clinically observed plasma concentrations of tucatinib when administered in combination with itraconazole, rifampin, or gemfibrozil as well as clinically observed plasma concentrations of probe substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P‐gp, or MATE1/2‐K. The PBPK model was then applied to prospectively predict the potential perpetrator or victim DDIs with other substrates, inducers, or inhibitors. To simulate a potential interaction with a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor, two novel PBPK models representing a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor and a sensitive CYP2C8 substrate were developed based on the existing PBPK models for gemfibrozil and rosiglitazone, respectively. The simulated population geometric mean area under the curve ratio of tucatinib with a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor ranged from 1.98‐ to 3.08‐fold, and based on these results, no dose modifications were proposed for moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors for the tucatinib label.",

The purpose of this trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of Episil in improving acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) in patients with breast cancer. This study included patients who met the criteria for postoperative RT for breast cancer. The primary end point was the grade of RD during treatment. A total of 102 patients were included in this study. The patients were grouped in a 2:1 ratio using the randomized number table method: 67 patients received Episil combined with conventional skin care (the Episil group), whereas the remaining 35 patients served as the control group and received conventional skin care only (the control group). According to the grading criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), the skin reaction rate and severity were significantly better in the Episil group than the control group (24.62%, 72.31%, 3.08, 0, 0 vs. 0, 85.71%, 14.29%, 0, 0, 0) across grades 0 to 4 ( P < 0.05). The itchiness score exhibited s significant reduction in the Episil group as compared with the control group ( P < 0.05). The results of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ‐C30) showed that the overall health ( z = −5.855, P < 0.001) and overall quality of life ( z = −6.583, P < 0.001) were better in the Episil group than the control group after RT. Overall, in patients with breast cancer receiving RT, the topical application of Episil may significantly reduce the grading of ARD, alleviate patient symptoms, and improve the patient's overall quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The widely prescribed opioid oxycodone may cause lethal respiratory depression. We compared the effects of oxycodone on breathing and antinociception in healthy young volunteers. After pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, we constructed utility functions to combine the wanted and unwanted end points into a single function. We hypothesized that the function would be predominantly negative over the tested oxycodone concentration range. Twenty‐four male and female volunteers received 20 (n = 12) or 40 (n = 12) mg oral oxycodone immediate‐release tablets. Hypercapnic ventilatory responses (visit 1) or responses to 3 nociceptive assays (pain pressure, electrical, and thermal tests; visit 2) were measured at regular intervals for 7 hours. the PK/PD analyses, that included carbon dioxide kinetics, stood at the basis of the utility function: probability of antinociception minus probability of respiratory depression. Oxycodone had rapid onset/offset times (30–40 minutes) with potency values (effect‐site concentration causing 50% of effect) ranging from 0.05 to 0.13 ng/mL for respiratory variables obtained at hypercapnia and antinociceptive responses. Ventilation at an extrapolated end‐tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure of 55 mmHg, was used for creation of 3 utility functions, one for each of the nociceptive tests. Contrary to expectation, the utility functions were close to zero or positive over the clinical oxycodone concentration range. The similar or better likelihood for antinociception relative to respiratory depression may be related to oxycodone's receptor activation profile or to is high likeability that possibly alters the modulation of nociceptive input. Oxycodone differs from other μ‐opioids, such as fentanyl, that have a consistent negative utility.",

    "abstract": "Sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including canagliflozin, reduce the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with and without type 2 diabetes, albeit with a large interindividual variation. The underlying mechanisms for this variation in response might be attributed to differences in SGLT2 occupancy, resulting from individual variation in plasma and tissue drug exposure and receptor availability. We performed a feasibility study for the use of [ 18 F]canagliflozin positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to determine the association between clinical canagliflozin doses and SGLT2 occupancy in patients with type 2 diabetes. We obtained two 90‐minute dynamic PET scans with diagnostic intravenous [ 18 F]canagliflozin administration and a full kinetic analysis in 7 patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients received 50, 100, or 300 mg oral canagliflozin ( n = 2:4:1) 2.5 hours before the second scan. Canagliflozin pharmacokinetics and urinary glucose excretion were measured. The apparent SGLT2 occupancy was derived from the difference between the apparent volume of distribution of [ 18 F]canagliflozin in the baseline and post‐drug PET scans. Individual canagliflozin area under the curve from oral dosing until 24‐hours (AUC P0‐24h ) varied largely (range 1,715–25,747 μg/L*hour, mean 10,580 μg/L*hour) and increased dose dependently with mean values of 4,543, 6,525, and 20,012 μg/L*hour for 50, 100, and 300 mg, respectively ( P = 0.046). SGLT2 occupancy ranged between 65% and 87%, but did not correlate with canagliflozin dose, plasma exposure, or urinary glucose excretion. We report the feasibility of [ 18 F]canagliflozin PET imaging to determine canagliflozin kidney disposition and SGLT2 occupancy. This suggests the potential of [ 18 F]canagliflozin as a tool to visualize and quantify clinically SGLT2 tissue binding.",

We aimed to assess the impact of EHR‐continuity on the performance of clinical risk scores. The study cohort consisted of patients aged ≥ 65 years with ≥ 1 EHR encounter in the 2 networks in Massachusetts (MA; 2007/1/1–2017/12/31, internal training and validation dataset), and one network in North Carolina (NC; 2007/1/1–2016/12/31, external validation dataset) that were linked with Medicare claims data. Risk scores were calculated using EHR data alone vs. linked EHR‐claims data (not subject to misclassification due to EHR‐discontinuity): (i) combined comorbidity score (CCS), (ii) claim‐based frailty score (CFI), (iii) CHAD 2 DS 2 ‐VASc, and (iv) Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding, Labile, Elderly, and Drugs (HAS‐BLED). We assessed the performance of CCS and CFI predicting death, CHAD 2 DS 2 ‐VASc predicting ischemic stroke, and HAS‐BLED predicting bleeding by area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), stratified by quartiles of predicted EHR‐continuity (Q1‐4). There were 319,740 patients in the MA systems and 125,380 in the NC system. In the external validation dataset, AUROC for EHR‐based CCS predicting 1‐year risk of death was 0.583 in Q1 (lowest) EHR‐continuity group, which increased to 0.739 in Q4 (highest) EHR‐continuity group. The corresponding improvement in AUROC was 0.539 to 0.647 for CFI, 0.556 to 0.637 for CHAD 2 DS 2 ‐VASc, and 0.517 to 0.556 for HAS‐BLED. The AUROC in Q4 EHR‐continuity group based on EHR alone approximates that based on EHR‐claims data. The prediction performance of four clinical risk scores was substantially worse in patients with lower vs. high EHR‐continuity.",

Existing genetics data obtained in the course of research could be used to identify patients who are suspected, but have not yet been confirmed, to carry clinically actionable genotypes, in whom confirmatory genetic testing could be conducted for highly efficient PGx implementation. Herein, we demonstrate that it is regulatorily and technically feasible to implement PGx by identifying suspected carriers of actionable genotypes within an institutional genetics data repository and conduct confirmatory PGx testing immediately prior to that patient receiving the PGx‐relevant drug, using a case study of DPYD testing prior to fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. In 2 years since launching this program, ~ 3,000 suspected DPYD carriers have been passively monitored and one confirmed DPYD carrier was prevented from receiving unacceptably toxic fluoropyrimidine treatment, for minimal cost and effort. Now that we have demonstrated the feasibility of this strategy, we plan to transition to PGx panel testing and expand implementation to other genes and drugs for which the evidence of clinical benefit of PGx‐informed treatment is high but PGx testing is not generally conducted. This highly efficient implementation process will maximize the clinical benefits of testing and could be explored at other institutions that have research‐only genetic data repositories to expand the number of patients who benefit from PGx‐informed treatment while we continue to work toward wide‐scale adoption of PGx testing and implementation.",

    "abstract": "Ethosuximide was identified as the optimal option for new‐onset childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) in a randomized, two‐phase dose escalation comparative effectiveness trial of ethosuximide, lamotrigine, and valproic acid. However, 47% of ethosuximide initial monotherapy participants experienced short‐term treatment failure. This study aimed to characterize the initial monotherapy ethosuximide exposure‐response relationship and to propose model‐informed precision dosing guidance. Dose titration occurred over a 16–20‐week period until patients experienced seizure freedom or intolerable side effects. Subjects with initial monotherapy failure were randomized to one of the other two medications and dose escalation was repeated. A population pharmacokinetic model was created using plasma concentration data ( n = 1,320), collected at 4‐week intervals from 211 unique participants during both the initial and second monotherapy phases. A logistic regression analysis was performed on the initial monotherapy cohort ( n = 103) with complete exposure‐response data. Eighty‐four participants achieved seizure freedom with a wide range of ethosuximide area under the curves (AUC) ranging from 420 to 2,420 μg·h/mL. AUC exposure estimates for achieving a 50% and 75% probability of seizure freedom were 1,027 and 1,489 μg·h/mL, respectively, whereas the corresponding cumulative frequency of intolerable adverse events was 11% and 16%. Monte Carlo Simulation indicated a daily dose of 40 and 55 mg/kg to achieve 50% and 75% probability of seizure freedom in the overall population, respectively. We identified the need for adjusted mg/kg dosing in different body weight cohorts. This ethosuximide proposed model‐informed precision dosing guidance to achieve seizure freedom carries promise to optimize initial monotherapy success for patients with CAE.",

    "abstract": "Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) program forced discontinuation of biologic use in Crohn's disease (CD) after a limited treatment duration, regardless of disease activity. This study investigated the retreatment rate and suboptimal outcomes (i.e., CD‐related surgeries, hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and oral steroid flare‐ups) after forced discontinuation. This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the NHI Database. Patients who received ≥40 weeks of biologic treatment followed by a forced discontinuation were included. The time of biologic retreatment and the cumulative incidence of suboptimal outcomes after the forced discontinuation as well as related risk factors were analyzed. Included were 215 patients (68% male). At the beginning of biologic therapy, the mean age (±SD) was 35.7 (±13.5) years, and the disease duration was 4.46 (±3.52) years. The median (interquartile range) biologic treatment duration was 57.86 (50.3–83.3) weeks. Within the first year after forced discontinuation, 67% of patients ( n = 144) were retreated with a second course of biologics, and 53% of patients ( n = 114) experienced at least one suboptimal outcome. The independent risk factors associated with the occurrence of suboptimal outcomes were CD‐related emergency room visits and hospitalizations during biologic therapy (hazard ratio: 2.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.59–3.89). More than two‐thirds of patients with CD required biological retreatment within 1 year after a forced discontinuation. The substantial proportion of patients with poor disease outcomes highlights the need to continue the biologic.",

Pediatric patients with ALL ( n = 290, age: median (1st–3rd quartile): 4.8 (3.0–8.1) years; boys: 56.9%) were enrolled mainly in 4 medium‐large Italian pediatric hospitals; 14.1% of patients relapsed after a median (1st–3rd quartile) follow‐up time of 4.43 (3.82–5.46) years from maintenance beginning. MP metabolites (thionucleotide (TGN) and methyl‐derivatives (MMPN)) were measured in the erythrocytes of 387 blood samples of 200 patients by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; (rs1800462, rs1800460, and rs1142345 in TPMT gene, rs116855232 in NUDT15, rs1127354, rs7270101, rs6051702 in ITPA, and rs2413739 in PACSIN2) were characterized by Taqman SNP genotyping assays. Cox proportional hazard models did not show an impact of TGN levels and variability on relapse. In contrast, after multivariate analysis, relapse hazard ratio (HR) increased in children with ALL of the intermediate risk arm compared with those in standard risk arm (3.44, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.31–9.05, P = 0.012), and in carriers of the PACSIN2 rs2413739 T allele compared with those with the CC genotype (heterozygotes CT: HR, 2.32, 95% CI, 0.90–5.97, P = 0.081; and homozygous TT: HR, 4.14, 95% CI, 1.54–11.11, P = 0.005).

Tocilizumab was not found to reduce 28‐day mortality in a phase III, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial (COVACTA) among hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pneumonia. We created a real‐world external comparator arm mirroring the COVACTA trial to confirm findings and assess the feasibility of using an external comparator arm to supplement an RCT. Eligible COVACTA participants in both the tocilizumab treatment and placebo arms were matched 1:1 using propensity score matching to persons without tocilizumab exposure in an external comparator arm. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard models estimated differences in 28‐day mortality comparing COVACTA participants to matched external comparator arm participants. Patients in the COVACTA tocilizumab treatment arm had a similar risk of death compared with patients in the external comparator arm (hazard ratio (HR): 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64–1.84) with similar estimated 28‐day mortality in the COVACTA tocilizumab treatment arm compared with the external comparator arm (18%, 95% CI: 13–24 vs. 19%, 95% CI: 13–24, P > 0.9).

At the same time, these modalities present complex scientific, clinical, and regulatory challenges. To realize the promise of individualized medicines, a multistakeholder approach to streamlining medical diagnoses, advancing the technologies that enable development of these therapeutic modalities, and re‐envisioning collaborative environments for access and evidence generation is of critical importance.

    "abstract": "The majority of deaths from malaria are in young African children. Parenteral artesunate (ARS) is the first‐line treatment for severe falciparum malaria. Since 2015, the World Health Organization has recommended individual doses of 3 mg/kg for children weighing < 20 kg. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has challenged this recommendation, based on a simulated pediatric population, and argued for a lower dose in younger children (2.4 mg/kg). In this study, we performed population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling of plasma concentration data from 80 children with severe falciparum malaria in the Democratic Republic of Congo who were given 2.4 mg/kg of ARS intravenously. Bayesian hierarchical modeling and a two‐compartment parent drug‐metabolite PK model for ARS were used to describe the population PKs of ARS and its main biologically active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. We then generated a virtual population representative of the target population in which the drug is used and simulated the total first‐dose exposures. Our study shows that the majority of younger children given the lower 2.4 mg/kg dose of intravenous ARS do not reach the same drug exposures as older children above 20 kg. This finding supports withdrawal of the FDA's recent lower ARS dose recommendation as parenteral ARS is an extremely safe and well‐tolerated drug and there is potential for harm from underdosing in this rapidly lethal infection.",

We developed a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model of ticagrelor based on a randomized 3 × 3 crossover study in healthy subjects. The area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) of Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome was simulated based on this model. Following this, eight machine learning (ML) methods were used to construct bleeding risk models. Variables included in the final bleeding risk model were age, hypertension, body weight, AUC, drinking status, calcium channel blockers, antidiabetic medications, β‐blockers, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, transient ischemic attack, sex, and proton pump inhibitor. In terms of F1 scores and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC‐AUC), the Random Forest model performed best among all models, with an F1 score of 0.73 and ROC‐AUC of 0.81. Moreover, the PopPK model and ML algorithm were used to bridge the real‐world data to build a bleeding risk prediction model based on drug exposure and clinical information. Using this model, a ticagrelor regimen that is associated with a lower risk of bleeding in individuals can be obtained. This model should be further validated prospectively in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Continuous 6‐mercaptopurine (6‐MP) dose titration is necessary because of its narrow therapeutic index and frequently encountered dose‐limiting hematopoietic toxicity. However, evidence‐based guidelines for gene‐based 6‐MP dosing have not been established for Chinese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This multicenter, randomized, open‐label, active‐controlled clinical trial randomly assigned Chinese children with low‐ or intermediate‐risk ALL in a 1:1 ratio to receive TPMT – NUDT15 gene–based dosing of 6‐MP ( N = 44, 10 to 50 mg/m 2 /day) or standard dosing ( N = 44, 50 mg/m 2 /day) during maintenance therapy. The primary end point was the incidence of 6‐MP myelosuppression in both groups. Secondary end points included frequencies of 6‐MP hepatotoxicity, duration of myelosuppression and leukopenia, event‐free survival, and steady‐state concentrations of active metabolites (6‐thioguaninenucleotides and 6‐methylmercaptopurine nucleotides) in erythrocytes. A 2.2‐fold decrease in myelosuppression, the primary end point, was observed in the gene‐based–dose group using ~ 50% of the standard initial 6‐MP dose (odds ratio, 0.26, 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.64, P = 0.003). Patients in the gene‐based–dose group had a significantly lower risk of developing thiopurine‐induced myelosuppression and leukopenia ( P = 0.015 and P = 0.022, respectively). No significant differences were observed in the secondary end points of the incidence of hepatotoxicity and steady‐state concentrations of active metabolites in erythrocytes between the two groups. TPMT‐ and NUDT15 ‐based dosing of 6‐MP will significantly contribute toward further reducing the incidence of leukopenia in Chinese children with ALL.

    "abstract": "Rates of cigarette smoking in people with HIV (PWH) are two to three times higher than in people without HIV. Nicotine is metabolized by CYP2A6 and the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; 3‐hydroxycotinine/cotinine) is a measure of nicotine clearance. Higher NMR has been observed in PWH and is associated with lower quit rates. Efavirenz, a mainstay antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally, partially upregulates its own metabolism through CYP2A6. We hypothesized that efavirenz also upregulates nicotine metabolism by CYP2A6, resulting in a higher NMR, and switching to non‐efavirenz ART would decrease the NMR, potentially leading to improved quit rates. We compared the NMR during and after efavirenz use among PWH in a longitudinal, multisite cohort. Eligibility criteria included: (i) active cigarette smoking, (ii) ART switched from efavirenz‐based to non‐efavirenz‐based regimen, (iii) plasma available at pre‐ and post‐ART switch, and (iv) viral suppression during study period. Plasma cotinine and 3‐hydroxycotinine were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. T ‐tests compared the NMR on and off efavirenz. Samples were collected between 2010 and 2019 in 72 PWH. The mean NMR difference after switching to a non‐efavirenz‐based regimen was −0.24 (SD: 0.37, P < 0.001); 44 PWH had at least a 0.1 decrease in NMR. Effect modification by race was present; Black PWH had a larger mean decrease. Our findings suggest that previously observed higher NMR among PWH may be due to direct pharmacologic effects of ART. Assessing the effect of ART on the NMR suggests that avoiding nicotine metabolism inducers could potentially increase quit rates.",

Innovation in the field, including TCR‐T, allogeneic or “off the shelf” CAR‐T, and autoantigen/armored CAR‐Ts are likely to increase the efficacy and applications of these therapies. The unique aspects of these cell‐based therapeutics; patient‐derived cells, intracellular expression, in vivo expansion, and phenotypic changes provide unique bioanalytical challenges to develop pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity assessments. The International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ) Translational and ADME Sciences Leadership Group (TALG) has brought together a group of industry experts to discuss and consider these challenges.

    "abstract": "Ensuring safe and effective drug therapy in infants and young children often requires accounting for growth and organ development; however, data on organ function maturation are scarce for special populations, such as infants with congenital diseases. Children with critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) often require multiple staged surgeries depending on their age and disease severity. Vancomycin (VCM) is used to treat postoperative infections; however, the standard pediatric dose (60–80 mg/kg/day) frequently results in overexposure in children with CCHD. In this study, we characterized the maturation of VCM clearance in pediatric patients with CCHD and determined the appropriate dosing regimen using population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulations. We analyzed 1,254 VCM serum concentrations from 152 postoperative patients (3 days–13 years old) for population PK analysis. The PK model was developed using a two‐compartment model with allometrically scaled body weight, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and postmenstrual age as covariates. The observed clearance in patients aged ≤ 1 year and 1–2 years was 33% and 40% lower compared with that of non‐CCHD patients, respectively, indicating delayed renal maturation in patients with CCHD. Simulation analyses suggested VCM doses of 25 mg/kg/day (age ≤ 3 months, eGFR 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and 35 mg/kg/day (3 months < age ≤ 3 years, eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). In conclusion, this study revealed delayed renal maturation in children with CCHD, could be due to cyanosis and low cardiac output. Model‐informed simulations identified the lower VCM doses for children with CCHD compared with standard pediatric guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation in CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 is known to impact interindividual response to antiretrovirals, nicotine, and bupropion, among other drugs. However, the full catalogue of clinically relevant pharmacogenetic variants in these genes is yet to be established, especially across African populations. This study therefore aimed to characterize the star allele (haplotype) distribution in CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 across diverse and understudied sub‐Saharan African (SSA) populations. We called star alleles from 961 high‐depth full genomes using StellarPGx, Aldy, and PyPGx. In addition, we performed CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 star allele frequency comparisons between SSA and other global biogeographical groups represented in the new 1000 Genomes Project high‐coverage dataset ( n = 2,000). This study presents frequency information for star alleles in CYP2B6 (e.g., *6 and *18 ; frequency of 21–47% and 2–19%, respectively) and CYP2A6 (e.g., *4 , *9 , and *17 ; frequency of 0–6%, 3–10%, and 6–20%, respectively), and predicted phenotypes (for CYP2B6), across various African populations. In addition, 50 potentially novel African‐ancestry star alleles were computationally predicted by StellarPGx in CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 combined. For each of these genes, over 4% of the study participants had predicted novel star alleles. Three novel star alleles in CYP2A6 (* 54 , * 55 , and * 56 ) and CYP2B6 apiece, and several suballeles were further validated via targeted Single‐Molecule Real‐Time resequencing. Our findings are important for informing the design of comprehensive pharmacogenetic testing platforms, and are highly relevant for personalized medicine strategies, especially relating to antiretroviral medication and smoking cessation treatment in Africa and the African diaspora. More broadly, this study highlights the importance of sampling diverse African ethnolinguistic groups for accurate characterization of the pharmacogene variation landscape across the continent.",

    "abstract": "Patients carrying DPYD variant alleles have increased risk of severe toxicity from systemic fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. There is a paucity of data regarding risk of toxicity from topical 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) treatment in these patients, leading to inconsistent guideline recommendations for pretreatment testing and topical 5‐FU dosing. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether DPYD variant allele carriers have increased risk of toxicity from topical 5‐FU. Treatment and toxicity data were retrospectively abstracted from the electronic medical records. Genotypes for the five DPYD variants that are associated with increased toxicity from systemic fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy ( DPYD*2A , DPYD*13 , DPYD p.D949V , DPYD HapB3 , and DPYD p.Y186C ) were collected from a genetic data repository. Incidence of grade 3+ (primary end point) and 1+ (secondary end point) toxicity was compared between DPYD variant carriers vs. wild‐type patients using Fisher's exact tests. The analysis included 201 patients, 7% (14/201) of whom carried a single DPYD variant allele. No patients carried two variant alleles or experienced grade 3+ toxicity. DPYD variant allele carriers did not have a significantly higher risk of grade 1+ toxicity (21.4% vs. 10.2%, odds ratio = 2.40, 95% confidence interval: 0.10–2.53, P = 0.19). Given the low toxicity risk in patients carrying a single DPYD variant allele, there is limited potential clinical benefit of DPYD genetic testing prior to topical 5‐FU. However, the risk of severe toxicity in patients with complete DPD deficiency remains unknown and topical 5‐FU treatment should be avoided in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (AIGIV [ANTHRASIL]), was developed for the treatment of toxemia associated with inhalational anthrax. It is a plasma product collected from individuals vaccinated with anthrax vaccine and contains antitoxin IgG antibodies against Bacillus anthracis protective antigen. A pharmacokinetic (PK) and exposure–response model was constructed to assess the PKs of AIGIV in anthrax‐free and anthrax‐exposed rabbits, non‐human primates and anthrax‐free humans, as well as the relationship between AIGIV exposure and survival from anthrax, based on available preclinical/clinical studies. The potential effect of anthrax on the PKs of AIGIV was evaluated and estimates of survival odds following administration of AIGIV protective doses with and without antibiotic co‐treatment were established. As the developed PK model can simulate exposure of AIGIV in any species for any dosing scenario, the relationship between the predicted area under the concentration curve of AIGIV in humans and the probability of survival observed in preclinical studies was explored. Based on the simulation results, the intravenous administration of 420 U (units of potency as measured by validated Toxin Neutralization Assay) of AIGIV is expected to result in a > 80% probability of survival in more than 90% of the human population. Additional simulations suggest that exposure levels were similar in healthy and obese humans, and exposure in pediatrics is expected to be up to approximately seven‐fold higher than in healthy adults, allowing for doses in pediatric populations that ranged from one to seven vials. Overall, the optimal human dose was justified based on the PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of AIGIV in animals and model‐based translation of PK/PD to predict human exposure and efficacy.",

The objective of this study was to characterize the time course of ATX and metabolites (4‐hydroxyatomoxetine (4‐OH); N ‐desmethylatomoxetine (NDA); and 2‐carboxymethylatomoxetine (2‐COOH)) exposure following oral ATX dosing in children with ADHD to support individualized dosing. A nonlinear mixed‐effect modeling approach was used to analyze ATX, 4‐OH, and NDA plasma and urine, and 2‐COOH urine profiles obtained over 24–72 hours from children with ADHD ( n = 23) following a single oral ATX dose. Demographics and CYP2D6 activity score (AS) were evaluated as covariates. Simulations were performed to explore the ATX dosing in subjects with various CYP2D6 AS. A simultaneous pharmacokinetic modeling approach was used in which a model for ATX, 4‐OH, and NDA in plasma and urine, and 2‐COOH in urine was developed. Plasma ATX, 4‐OH, and NDA were modeled using two‐compartment models with first‐order elimination. CYP2D6 AS was a significant determinant of ATX apparent oral clearance (CL/F), fraction metabolized to 4‐OH, and systemic exposure of NDA. CL/F of ATX varied almost 7‐fold across the CYP2D6 AS groups: AS 2: 20.02 L/hour; AS 1: 19.00 L/hour; AS 0.5: 7.47 L/hour; and AS 0: 3.10 L/hour. The developed model closely captures observed ATX, 4‐OH, and NDA plasma and urine, and 2‐COOH urine profiles. Application of the model shows the potential for AS‐based dosing recommendations for improved individualized dosing.",

    "abstract": "The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) routine postmarketing drug safety monitoring may lead to safety‐related labeling changes for identified risks. Additionally, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) require the FDA to conduct postmarket pediatric‐focused safety reviews of adverse events. The purpose of these pediatric reviews is to identify risks associated with drug or biological products 18 months after the FDA approves a pediatric labeling change pursuant to studies conducted under the BPCA or PREA. These reviews are presented to the FDA Pediatric Advisory Committee (PAC) or publicly posted on FDA's website. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pediatric reviews prompted by BPCA/PREA from October 1, 2013, to September 30, 2019. The impact was quantified by the number of new safety signals identified and the subsequent safety‐related labeling changes resulting from pediatric reviews relative to safety‐related labeling changes triggered by other data sources. Among 163 products with at least one pediatric review completed, a new safety signal that resulted in a safety‐related labeling change was found for 5 of these products (representing 3 active ingredients); none described risks specific to the pediatric population. Between October 2013 and September 2021, there were 585 safety‐related labeling changes implemented for products with at least one completed pediatric review. Less than 1% of 585 safety‐related labeling changes were the result of a mandated pediatric review. Our study suggests that mandated pediatric reviews conducted 18 months after a pediatric labeling change provided minimal value over other postmarket safety surveillance activities.",

    "abstract": "Dabigatran is the first of four direct‐acting oral anticoagulants approved to prevent stroke in adult patients with atrial fibrillation using a fixed two‐dose scheme compared with warfarin dosing adjusted to a prothrombin time range associated with optimal risk reduction in stroke and serious bleeding. The pivotal phase III trial found dabigatran, depending on dose, is superior to warfarin in stroke reduction and similar in bleeding risk while also showing dabigatran efficacy and safety correlate with steady‐state plasma concentrations. Because the relationship between dabigatran dose and plasma concentration is highly variable, a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model of over 9,000 clinical trial patients was used as a basis for simulations comparing the performance of dosing via the drug label to other proposed doses and regimens. Assessment of dosing regimen performance was based on simulations of trough plasma levels within the therapeutic concentration range of 75–150 ng/mL over a renal function range of 15–250 mL/min creatinine clearance, representing extremes for real‐world patients. An improved regimen that best achieves this therapeutic range was identified, requiring five different dosing schedules, corresponding to specified renal function ranges, compared with the two approved in the label. The discussion focuses on how this information could better inform patient outcomes and future dabigatran development.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics studies how genes influence a person's response to treatment. When complex phenotypes are influenced by multiple genetic variations with little effect, a single piece of genetic information is often insufficient to explain this variability. The application of machine learning (ML) in pharmacogenomics holds great potential — namely, it can be used to unravel complicated genetic relationships that could explain response to therapy. In this study, ML techniques were used to investigate the relationship between genetic variations affecting more than 60 candidate genes and carboplatin‐induced, taxane‐induced, and bevacizumab‐induced toxicities in 171 patients with ovarian cancer enrolled in the MITO‐16A/MaNGO‐OV2A trial. Single‐nucleotide variation (SNV, formerly SNP) profiles were examined using ML to find and prioritize those associated with drug‐induced toxicities, specifically hypertension, hematological toxicity, nonhematological toxicity, and proteinuria. The Boruta algorithm was used in cross‐validation to determine the significance of SNVs in predicting toxicities. Important SNVs were then used to train eXtreme gradient boosting models. During cross‐validation, the models achieved reliable performance with a Matthews correlation coefficient ranging from 0.375 to 0.410. A total of 43 SNVs critical for predicting toxicity were identified. For each toxicity, key SNVs were used to create a polygenic toxicity risk score that effectively divided individuals into high‐risk and low‐risk categories. In particular, compared with low‐risk individuals, high‐risk patients were 28‐fold more likely to develop hypertension. The proposed method provided insightful data to improve precision medicine for patients with ovarian cancer, which may be useful for reducing toxicities and improving toxicity management.",

    "abstract": "Trial results may not be generalizable to target populations treated in clinical practice with different distributions of baseline characteristics that modify the treatment effect. We used outcome models developed with trial data to predict treatment effects in Medicare populations. We used data from the Randomized Evaluation of Long‐Term Anticoagulation Therapy trial (RE‐LY), which investigated the effect of dabigatran vs. warfarin on stroke or systemic embolism (stroke/SE) among patients with atrial fibrillation. We developed outcome models by fitting proportional hazards models in trial data. Target populations were trial‐eligible Medicare beneficiaries who initiated dabigatran or warfarin in 2010–2011 (“early”) and 2010–2017 (“extended”). We predicted 2‐year risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) for stroke/SE, major bleeding, and all‐cause death in the Medicare populations using the observed baseline characteristics. The trial and early target populations had similar mean (SD) CHADS 2 scores (2.15 (SD 1.13) vs. 2.15 (SD 0.91)) but different mean ages (71 vs. 79 years). Compared with RE‐LY, the early Medicare population had similar predicted benefit of dabigatran vs. warfarin for stroke/SE (trial RR = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50 to 0.76 and RD = −1.37%, −1.96% to −0.77%, Medicare RR = 0.73, 0.65 to 0.82 and RD = −0.92%, −1.26% to −0.59%) and risks for major bleeding and all‐cause death. The time‐extended target population showed similar results. Outcome model‐based prediction facilitates estimating the average treatment effects of a drug in different target populations when treatment and outcome data are unreliable or unavailable. The predicted effects may inform payers' coverage decisions for patients, especially shortly after a drug's launch when observational data are scarce.",

The documents of all BPMs available at the EMA regarding the field of oncology from January 1, 2018, to Decemer 31, 2022, were reviewed. For every query, a main category was assigned, and in case of multiple relevant topics, a secondary category was appointed too. For all queries, the follow‐up offered by the EMA was documented, and whether the requested information was available. Subsequently, all queries were scanned for overlapping topics between meetings. From 2018 to 2022, 31 BPMs were held between the EMA and pharmaceutical companies to discuss oncology‐related questions, for a total of 397 queries raised. They were classified into 24 topics, of which 15 were common topics ( n ≥ 10 queries) with regulatory pathways/guidelines and trial design having the most queries. Post‐BPM actions were taken or recommended by the EMA for 41.3% of queries, such as referrals to scientific advice or published guidelines. Forty‐three queries were raised at more than one BPM. Targeted therapy, companion diagnostics, institutional collaboration, trial design, and regulatory pathways/guidelines were the most discussed topics in oncology BPMs, with molecular developments being the common denominator. Creating Q&A documents, publishing new guidelines, providing a framework for discussions, and questionnaire‐based follow‐up research can improve the quality of BPMs, and the accessibility of the information requested during the BPMs.",

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the effect of LLDs on end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and mortality in adult patients with CKD stage 3b, 4, or 5, and dyslipidemia. Participants were recruited between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018, and classified as LLD or non‐LLD users; the final follow‐up date was December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was time to ESKD or death due to renal failure. Sub‐distribution hazard regression models adjusted for multivariables, including time‐varying lipid profile covariates, were used for the analysis. Among the 6,740 participants, 4,280 patients with CKD and dyslipidemia, including 872 using LLDs and 3,408 not using LLDs, completed the primary analysis. The multivariable analyses showed that LLD users had a significantly lower risk of time to the composite renal outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65–0.89), and MACE incidence (aHR, 0.75, 95% CI, 0.62–0.93) than did non‐LLD users. After adjusting for time‐varying covariates of the lipid profile, there was a significant difference in the composite renal outcome (aHR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.65–0.93) and MACEs (aHR, 0.77, 95% CI, 0.60–0.98). Among adult patients with advanced CKD and dyslipidemia, LLD users had a significantly lower risk of composite renal outcomes and MACEs than non‐LLD users. In addition to reducing lipid profile, the use of LLD is associated with renal and cardiovascular protective effects.",

Currently, however, there are technical barriers in sampling human hypoxic tumors and examining drug delivery with high sensitivity and accuracy. Herein, we present a new platform combining functional endoscopy and highly sensitive liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry (LC–MS) to assess drug delivery to hypoxic regions. Because oxygen saturation endoscopic imaging (OXEI), a functional endoscopy, can evaluate lesions and hypoxia in real‐time by simultaneously acquiring a pseudocolor map of oxygen saturation and conventional endoscopic images, this platform can be used to evaluate drug delivery with human samples from hypoxic regions. As the first clinical application of this platform, the relationship between hypoxic regions and the concentration of trifluridine (FTD) incorporated into DNA was evaluated in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with FTD/tipiracil (FTD/TPI; n = 13) by obtaining and analysis of tissue samples by OXEI and LC–MS and vascular maturity index by CD31/α‐SMA staining ex vivo . The results showed that the concentration of FTD was significantly higher in the normoxic region than in the hypoxic region ( P < 0.05) and there were significantly more immature vessels in hypoxic regions than in normoxic regions ( P < 0.05). These results indicate that the platform was sufficiently sensitive to evaluate differences in drug anabolism in different oxygenic regions of human tumor tissue. This new platform allows quantitative drug analysis in hypoxic regions and is expected to initiate a new era of drug discovery and development.",

    "abstract": "All patients treated with anticancer agents should receive the most effective anti‐emetic regimen. Anti‐emetic guidelines provide recommendations but do not take into account possible drug–drug interactions between anti‐emetics and anticancer drugs. This study determines the clinical relevance of the potential drug–drug interaction of the neurokinin‐1 receptor antagonist, aprepitant, on the pharmacokinetics of etoposide. Aprepitant is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and may increase the systemic exposure of etoposide which is partly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). In this prospective observational study, the pharmacokinetics of etoposide with and without concomitant use of aprepitant was determined in 12 patients receiving first‐line chemotherapy for testicular cancer. The geometric mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) area under the plasma concentration‐time curve 0–24 hour (AUC 0–24h ) of etoposide with aprepitant was 86.2 (79.7–93.2) mg/L*hour vs. 83.7 (75.8–92.4) mg/L*hour without aprepitant. Geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) of AUC 0–24h and maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) for etoposide with and without aprepitant were 1.03 (0.96–1.10) and 0.96 (0.89–1.03), respectively. This study confirms the absence of a clinically relevant interaction between etoposide and aprepitant. Both drugs can be safely combined without affecting etoposide exposure.",

    "abstract": "Better therapies for childhood cancer remain an unmet need to improve the dismal prognosis of certain malignancies and to reduce the burden of toxicity. Rescuing discontinued or shelved drugs for children, adolescents, and young adults is a strategy to identify new uses for approved or investigational medicines outside the scope of their original medical indication. Our proposed multistakeholder consensus focuses on the development of innovative, patent‐protected targeted agents, sourced from previously shelved or discontinued programs that have the potential to provide significant benefit to underserved patient populations, with unmet medical needs. There are several challenges to continuing/rescuing drugs for pediatric oncology development, which include the lack of information for decision making, corporate strategy considerations underlying the decision to invest in pediatric development, and the contracting and technology transfer complexities required to enable divestment and subsequent development. The multistakeholder approach for drug development has the advantage of conveying a consensus among academia, patient advocates, and importantly industry itself. We propose three areas of action to facilitate rescuing potentially beneficial drugs for children and adolescents with cancer: (i) initiatives to provide information to companies considering developing these drugs and a standards framework; (ii) incentives both in Europe and in the United States to encourage companies to develop pediatric‐only drugs, with the reform of the EU Pharmaceutical Legislation posing an important opportunity; and (iii) communication of the issues to all stakeholders. Ultimately, this will benefit children and adolescents with cancer.",

    "abstract": "Tusamitamab ravtansine is an antibody‐drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) and DM4 payload. Even if DM4 and its main metabolite methyl‐DM4 (Me‐DM4) circulate at low concentrations after ADC administration, their potential as perpetrators of cytochrome P450 mediated drug–drug interaction was assessed. In vitro studies in human hepatocytes indicated that Me‐DM4 elicited a clear concentration‐dependent down regulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4, 1A2, and 2B6). Because DM4 was unstable under the incubation conditions studied, the in vitro constants could not be determined for this entity. Thus, to predict the clinical relevance of this observed downregulation, an in vitro‐in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pharmacokinetic (PK) based approach was developed. To mitigate model prediction errors and because of their similar inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization, the same downregulation constants were used for DM4 and Me‐DM4. This approach describes the time course of decreasing CYP3A4, 1A2, and 2B6 enzyme amounts as a function of circulating concentrations of DM4 and Me‐DM4 predicted from a population PK model. The developed IVIVE‐PK model showed that the highest CYP abundance decrease was observed for CYP3A4, with a transient reduction of < 10% from baseline. The impact on midazolam exposure, as probe substrate of CYP3A, was then simulated based on a physiologically‐based PK static method. The maximal CYP3A4 abundance reduction was associated with a predicted midazolam area under the curve (AUC) ratio of 1.14. To conclude, the observed in vitro downregulation of CYPs by Me‐DM4 is not expected to have relevant clinical impact.",

The lack of randomization can result in confounding between the experimental and eControl cohorts. To balance potentially confounding variables between the cohorts, one of the proposed methods is to match on prognostic scores. Still, the performance of prognostic scores to construct eControls in oncology has not been analyzed yet. Using an electronic health record‐derived de‐identified database, we constructed eControls using one of three methods: ROPRO, a state‐of‐the‐art prognostic score, or either a propensity score composed of five (5Vars) or 27 covariates (ROPROvars). We compared the performance of these methods in estimating the overall survival (OS) hazard ratio (HR) of 11 recent advanced non‐small cell lung cancer. The ROPRO eControls had a lower OS HR error (median absolute deviation (MAD), 0.072, confidence interval (CI): 0.036–0.185), than the 5Vars (MAD 0.081, CI: 0.025–0.283) and ROPROvars eControls (MAD 0.087, CI: 0.054–0.383). Notably, the OS HR errors for all methods were even lower in the phase III studies. Moreover, the ROPRO eControl cohorts included, on average, more patients than the 5Vars (6.54%) and ROPROvars cohorts (11.7%). The eControls matched with the prognostic score reproduced the controls more reliably than propensity scores composed of the underlying variables. Additionally, prognostic scores could allow eControls to be built on many prognostic variables without a significant increase in the variability of the propensity score, which would decrease the number of matched patients.",

    "abstract": "Methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone are opioid agonist therapies for opioid use disorder treatment. Genetic factors contribute to individual differences in opioid response; however, little is known regarding genetic associations with clinical outcomes in people receiving opioid agonist therapies. Participants diagnosed with opioid use disorder, principally consisting of prescription opioids (licit or illicit), were randomized to methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone for 24 weeks of daily treatment (NCT03033732). Urine was collected at 12 biweekly study visits and analyzed for non‐treatment opioids. Variants in genes involved in methadone metabolism ( CYP2B6 , CYP2C19 , and CYP3A4 ), buprenorphine metabolism ( CYP3A4 and UGT2B7 ), and μ‐opioid receptor function ( OPRM1 ) were genotyped and analyzed for their association with the number of non‐treatment opioid‐free urine screens. Primary analyses focused on the last 12 weeks (6 study visits, post‐titration) of treatment among those reporting White ethnicity. Additional sensitivity and exploratory analyses were performed. Among methadone‐treated participants ( n = 52), the OPRM1 rs1799971 AA genotype (vs. G‐genotypes, i.e., having one or two G alleles) was associated with greater opioid‐free urine screens (incidence rate ratio = 5.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.43–11.26, P = 0.000023); longitudinal analyses showed a significant genotype‐by‐time interaction over the full 24 weeks (12 study visits, β = −0.28, 95% CI = −0.45 to −0.11, P = 0.0015). Exploratory analyses suggest an OPRM1 rs1799971 genotype effect on retention. No evidence of association was found between other genetic variants, including in metabolic variants, and non‐treatment opioid‐free urine screens in the methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone arms. Those with the OPRM1 rs1799971 G‐genotypes may have a poorer response to methadone maintenance treatment, an effect that persisted through 24 weeks of treatment.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that an interferon (IFN)‐inducible protein, BST2, was regulated by the JAK–STAT pathway activated by CD40, and subsequently suppressing hepatitis B virus (HBV) repliaction and transcription. The current research attempted to assess the impact of BST2 on the IFN‐treated anti‐HBV effect, and explore BST2 variants for predicting pegylated IFN alpha (PegIFNα) therapy response of patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)‐positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Using an HBV‐transfected cell model, the function of BST2 on HBV DNA replication and transcription driven by IFN was studied. The potentially functional BST2 variants were selected through a strategy of gene‐wide screening. The associations of BST2 variants and polygenic score (PGS) model, which was used to quantify the combined influence of several genetic variants, with treatment response were examined in 2 separate PegIFNα‐treated cohorts of 238 and 707 patients with CHB, respectively. We found that overexpression of BST2 improved the anti‐HBV activity triggered by IFN‐α. Among PegIFNα‐treated patients with CHB, BST2 _rs9576 was screened out to be significantly correlated with combined response (CR; i.e., HBeAg seroconversion along with HBV DNA level <3.3log 10 IU/mL, P = 7.12 × 10 −5 ). Additionally, there was a strong correlation between the PGS incorporating BST2 _rs9576 and other 5 genetic variations (previously described predictors of therapy response to PegIFNα) and CR ( P = 1.81 × 10 −13 ), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level ( P = 0.004), as well as HBsAg decline ( P = 0.017). In conclusion, higher BST2 expression responded better to IFN‐α treatment. BST2 _rs9576 is an effective indicator to forecast therapy response of PegIFNα‐treated patients with CHB. The PGS possesses the potential to boost the ability of PegIFNα therapy response.",

    "abstract": "Extensive investigations have been conducted regarding the potential correlation between blood type and the immune system, as well as cancer risk in the Southern Chinese population. However, the prognostic value of the blood group and its genetic determinants in the context of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment remains unclear. Therefore, the associations between the ABO blood group and its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined in relation to ICI treatment outcomes in 370 eligible patients with cancer. This approach allowed us to derive the blood group from the SNPs responsible for blood group determination. In the discovery cohort ( N = 168), antigen A carriers (blood types A and AB) exhibited an extended progression‐free survival (PFS; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.34–0.98). The association results from the SNP‐derived blood were consistent with those from the measured blood group. In the validation cohort ( N = 202), Cox regression analysis revealed that the antigen A carriers (rs507666 AA+GA genotype carriers) experienced significantly extended PFS compared with the non‐antigen A carriers (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.40–0.93). Therefore, a longer PFS was observed in antigen A carriers ( P value = 0.003, HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.44–0.84). Furthermore, haplotype 2 carriers (rs507666 GA and rs659104 GG) demonstrated both extended PFS and improved overall survival. Notably, the presence of antigen A was not associated with the occurrence of overall immune‐related adverse events (irAEs) or organ‐specific toxicity. In summary, our findings revealed that antigen A carriers did not experience a higher incidence of irAEs while exhibiting better immunotherapy efficacy.",

NAM undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by NAM N‐methyltransferase to methylnicotinamide (MNA), which is subsequently metabolized to methyl‐2‐pyridone‐5‐carboxamide (M2PY) by aldehyde oxidase. However, the pharmacokinetics of NAM and its major metabolites has never been studied in pregnant individuals. Blood samples were collected before and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after single 1 g oral NAM dose in healthy pregnant (gestational age 24–33 weeks) and nonpregnant female volunteers ( n = 6/group). Pooled urine was collected from 0 to 8 hours. NAM, MNA, and M2PY area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) data were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis. No difference in the plasma AUC 0→24 of NAM (median (25%–75%): 463 (436–576) vs. 510 (423, 725) μM*hour, P = 0.430) and its intermediate metabolite MNA (89.1 (60.4, 124.4) vs. 83.8 (62.7, 93.7) μM*hour, P = 0.515) was observed in pregnant and nonpregnant volunteers, respectively; however, the terminal metabolite M2PY AUC 0 → 24 was significantly lower in pregnant individuals (218 (188, 254) vs. 597 (460, 653) μM*hour, P < 0.001). NAM renal clearance (CL R ; P = 0.184), MNA CL R ( P = 0.180), and total metabolite formation clearance ( P = 0.405) did not differ across groups; however, M2PY CL R was significantly higher in pregnant individuals (10.5 (9.3–11.3) vs. 7.5 (6.4–8.5) L/h, P = 0.002). These findings demonstrate that the PK of NAM and systemic exposure to its intermediate metabolite MNA are not significantly altered during pregnancy, and systemic exposure to NAM's major metabolite M2PY was reduced during pregnancy due to increased renal elimination.",

    "abstract": "To inform fetal drug safety, it is important to determine or predict fetal drug exposure throughout pregnancy. The former is not possible in the first or second trimester. In contrast, at the time of birth, fetal drug exposure, relative to maternal exposure, can be estimated as K p,uu (unbound fetal umbilical venous (UV) plasma area under the curve (AUC)/unbound maternal plasma (MP) AUC), provided the observed UV/MP values, spanning the dosing interval, are available from multiple maternal‐fetal dyads. However, this fetal K p,uu cannot be extrapolated to other drugs. To overcome the above limitations, we have used an efflux ratio‐relative expression factor (ER‐REF) approach to successfully predict the fetal K p,uu of P‐gp substrates. Because many drugs taken by pregnant people are also BCRP substrates, here, we extend this approach to drugs that are effluxed by both placental BCRP and P‐gp or P‐gp alone. To verify our predictions, we chose drugs for which UV/MP data were available at term: glyburide and imatinib (both BCRP and P‐gp substrates) and nelfinavir (only P‐gp substrate). First, the ER of the drugs was determined using Transwells and MDCKII cells expressing either BCRP or P‐gp. Then, the ER was scaled using the proteomics‐informed REF value to predict the fetal K p,uu of the drug at term. The ER‐REF predicted fetal K p,uu of glyburide (0.43), imatinib (0.42), and nelfinavir (0.40) fell within two‐fold of the corresponding in vivo fetal K p,uu (0.44, 0.37, and 0.46, respectively). These data confirm that the ER‐REF approach can successfully predict fetal drug exposure to BCRP/P‐gp and P‐gp substrates, at term.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate how much safety information is added to the drug label based on large trials after initial authorization. Changes made to the “undesirable effects” section of the drug label of cardiometabolic agents approved between 2000 and 2020 based on the results of large (> 1,000 patient) clinical trials submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) were evaluated. The study focused on glucose lowering, antithrombotic, and lipid‐modifying agents. The primary outcome was the number of changes in adverse drug reactions in the drug label. The EMA reviewed 55 large trials concerning 25 cardiometabolic agents after the initial marketing authorization, which included 402,444 patients. Ultimately, 38 trials (69%) resulted in a safety section update, whereas 17 trials (31%) did not. Changes in listed adverse drug reactions were made following 19 trials (35%) for 12 agents: 77 adverse drug reactions were added, 11 were deleted, and the frequencies of 43 were changed. Most changes in adverse drug reactions arose from trials with antithrombotic agents (88%) and trials performed in a new population (92%). Large trials for cardiometabolic agents reported after authorization add limited new safety information on adverse drug reactions, especially when performed in the population studied prior to approval. This suggests that selective safety data collection does not reduce learnings from late stage cardiometabolic trials in populations comprehensively studied before.",

    "abstract": "The Research Acceleration for Cure and Equity (RACE) for Children Act requires sponsors to submit a Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) with a proposed pediatric investigation of new molecularly targeted drugs and biologics that are intended for treatment of adult cancers, and whose target is relevant to pediatric cancer or provide a justification for a plan to request a deferral or waiver of the required investigation. A landscape analysis was performed to identify trends in information gaps associated with a sponsor's first initial PSP (iPSP) submission for oncologic new molecular entities received in 2021. Comments sent to sponsors by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the review process of each evaluated iPSP were categorized using nine flags relating to different portions of the PSP. For iPSPs that included a plan for a full waiver request, the most common information gap was inadequate justification based on molecular target relevance. All other sponsor proposed plans (deferral and/or partial waiver or investigation) were found to have information gaps related to clinical study features, clinical pharmacology, and/or missing clinical or nonclinical data. This landscape analysis of iPSPs shows the trends in comments that often occur during initial review and may help to provide sponsors with more direction for preparing an adequate iPSP to fulfill statutory requirements aimed at ensuring pediatric patients are considered in the development of new molecularly targeted drugs.",

    "abstract": "Infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome commonly receive morphine treatment to manage their withdrawal signs. However, the effectiveness of this pharmacotherapy in managing the infants' withdrawal signs vary widely. We sought to understand how information available early in infant monitoring can anticipate this treatment response, focusing on early modified Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (FNASS) scores, polygenic risk for opioid dependence (polygenic risk score (PRS)), and drug exposure. Using k‐means clustering, we divided the 213 infants in our cohort into 3 groups based on their FNASS scores in the 12 hours before and after the initiation of pharmacotherapy. We found that these groups were pairwise significantly different for risk factors, including methadone exposure, and for in‐hospital outcomes, including total morphine received, length of stay, and highest FNASS score. Whereas PRS was not predictive of receipt of treatment, PRS was pairwise significantly different between a subset of the groups. Using tree‐based machine learning methods, we then constructed network graphs of the relationships among these groups, FNASS scores, PRS, drug exposures, and in‐hospital outcomes. The resulting networks also showed meaningful connection between early FNASS scores and PRS, as well as between both of those and later in‐hospital outcomes. These analyses present clinicians with the opportunity to better anticipate infant withdrawal progression and prepare accordingly, whether with expedited morphine treatment or non‐pharmacotherapeutic alternative treatments.",

    "abstract": "Chronic opioid prescribing (COP) for noncancer pain is highly restricted in Taiwan, but tramadol is not listed in the regulation on chronic prescribing. This study investigated the trajectories of COP in noncancer pain when considering tramadol in Taiwan and identified the risk of serious adverse events. This population‐wide longitudinal cohort study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance claims records from 2001 to 2016. Adults prescribed opioids (including tramadol) and without cancer were selected. Patients who received COP (opioid supply days for 28 days or continuous opioid supply for 14 days) in the first patient quarter were included, and serious adverse events were identified. Group‐based trajectory models were applied to identify patients with a similar trajectory of quarterly COP. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied to assess the association between adverse events and patients' trajectories. Of the 2,360,358 noncancer opioid users, 476,934 (20.2%) received COP in the first quarter. Four groups of COP trajectory were identified, and 59,310 (12.8%) patients received COP quarterly over 2 years. Patients categorized into the trajectory of long‐term COP had a significantly higher crude incidence rate of cardiovascular death, seizure, and hypoglycemia. Still, there is no newly developed opioid use disorder. There was a substantial underestimate in COP in Taiwan when tramadol was not considered. Notably, 10% of them could receive COP for over 2 years. The result raises concern about unmet pain management needs and the limited accessibility of alternative treatments for noncancer pain.",

    "abstract": "The INVESTED trial did not show benefits of high‐dose (HD) vaccine vs. standard‐dose (SD) for a primary composite outcome of cardiopulmonary hospitalization or all‐cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.96–1.15) and its components (all‐cause mortality HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.84–1.21, cardiopulmonary hospitalization HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.96–1.16) during three influenza seasons (2016–2019) among participants with recent myocardial infarction or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). We emulated INVESTED using Medicare claims data to assess whether the real‐world evidence (RWE) study reached similar conclusions. We identified 1:1 propensity score (PS)‐matched trial‐eligible Medicare beneficiaries aged > 65 years and with prior HHF who received an HD or SD vaccine for the 2016–2019 seasons. We also re‐analyzed the INVESTED trial data restricting to participants > 65 years with prior HHF to align eligibility criteria more closely with the RWE study. We compared HRs from the trial and RWE study for the main outcomes. Among 53,393 pairs of PS‐matched Medicare beneficiaries, the HD vaccine group showed lower risk of the primary composite outcome (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.95–0.98) and all‐cause mortality (HR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.91–0.95), and similar risk of cardiopulmonary hospitalization (HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96–1.00), compared with SD. The RWE and trial results were closely concordant after the trial population was limited to participants > 65 years with prior HHF: trial‐based results for the primary composite outcome (HR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.89–1.17), all‐cause mortality (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.72–1.16), and cardiopulmonary hospitalization (HR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.88–1.18). Although similar to the main trial results, the RWE was closer to the results from trial participants with aligned eligibility criteria. This study affirms the importance of considering different distributions of baseline patient characteristics when comparing trial findings to RWE.",

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis increasingly provides a promising minimally invasive alternative to tissue biopsies in precision oncology. However, there are no ctDNA analysis approaches available in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and current methods of ctDNA mutation profiling have limited resolution because of the high background noise and false‐positive rate caused by benign variants in plasma cell‐free DNA (cfDNA), majorly generated during clonal hematopoiesis. Although personalized parallel white blood cell genome sequencing suppresses the noise of clonal hematopoiesis variances, the system cost and complexity restrict its extensive application in clinical settings. We developed Matched WBC Genome sequencing Independent CtDNA profiling (MaGIC) approaches, which synergically integrated a ctDNA capturing panel for a hybrid capture cfDNA deep sequencing, in silico background elimination, and a reliable readout measurement. We profiled the ctDNAs of 80 plasma samples from 40 patients with NPC before and during chemotherapy by MaGICs. In addition, the public cfDNA sequencing data and The Cancer Genome Atlas project data were analyzed by MaGICs to evaluate their application in other scenarios of patient classification. The MaGIC version‐2 has the ability to predict the chemosensitivity of patients with NPC with high accuracy by utilizing a single sample of liquid biopsy from each patient prior to a standardized treatment regimen. Moreover, both versions of MaGICs are of ideal performance in the diagnosis of patients with prostate cancer by liquid biopsy and prognosis prediction of multiple cancers by tissue biopsy. This study has the potential to enhance the sensitivity and expand the application scope of ctDNA detection, independently of other paired genome sequencing methods. As a result, it might further increase the clinical utilization of liquid biopsy based on ctDNA.",

    "abstract": "Although various lipophilic drugs are bound to lipoproteins, lipoprotein binding in plasma is not usually considered in current physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. Amiodarone is extensively bound to serum triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins. Total plasma amiodarone concentration, which is the sum of both unbound and bound concentrations, increases with increasing serum triglyceride levels. We investigated the impact of lipoprotein binding on amiodarone pharmacokinetics using PBPK modeling and simulations. An amiodarone PBPK model that incorporates plasma lipoprotein binding (LPP model) was developed based on the correlation between serum triglyceride levels and lipoprotein‐bound amiodarone. The predicted unbound fraction of amiodarone in plasma and systemic clearance in the LPP and base models (with albumin binding only) were similar, but the coefficients of variation for the LPP model were greater than those for the base model and were closer to the observed data. The total plasma amiodarone concentration predicted using the LPP model increased with higher levels of plasma lipoprotein binding and serum albumin. In contrast, changes in plasma lipoprotein binding and serum albumin levels did not influence the predicted unbound plasma amiodarone concentration at steady‐state. This study demonstrates that incorporating plasma lipoprotein binding into a PBPK model improves the accuracy of predicting interindividual variabilities in amiodarone clearance by more reliably predicting the interindividual variability in the plasma unbound fraction of amiodarone. Plasma lipoprotein binding should be considered in PBPK modeling and simulations for lipoprotein‐associated drugs if there is available information on the relationship between plasma lipoprotein binding and hyperlipidemia.",

    "abstract": "The lethality of torsades de pointes (TdP) by drugs is one of main reasons that some drugs were withdrawn from the market. In order to assess drug‐induced TdP risks, a model of cardiac ionic current suppression in human ventricular myocytes (ToR‐ORd model), combined with the maximum effective free therapeutic plasma concentration or the maximum effective free therapeutic myocyte concentration was often used, with the latter proved to be more relevant and more accurate. We aimed to develop a whole‐body physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, incorporated with a human cardiomyocyte pharmacodynamic (PD) model, to provide a comprehensive assessment of drug‐induced TdP risks in normal and specific scenarios. Quinidine served as an example to validate the PBPK‐PD model via predicting plasma quinidine concentrations and quinidine‐induced changes in QT interval (ΔQTc). The predicted plasma quinidine concentrations and ΔQTc values following oral administration or intravenous administration of quinidine were comparable to clinic observations. Visual predictive checks showed that most of the observed plasma concentrations and ΔQTc values fell within the 5th and 95th percentiles of simulations. The validated PBPK‐PD model was further applied to assess the TdP risks using frequencies of early afterdepolarization and long‐QT syndrome occurrence in 4 scenarios, such as therapeutic dose, supra‐therapeutic dose, alkalosis, and hyperkalemia in 200 human subjects. In conclusion, the developed PBPK‐PD model may be applied to predict the quinidine pharmacokinetics and quinidine‐induced TdP risks in healthy subjects, but also simulate quinidine‐induced TdP risks under disease conditions, such as hypokalemia and alkalosis.",

    "abstract": "Janus kinase (JAK) signaling has been implicated in human inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Lorpucitinib (JNJ‐64251330) is an oral, small molecule, pan‐JAK inhibitor. Unlike systemic JAK antagonists, lorpucitinib was found to have enteric (gut)‐selective properties, providing possible applications in diseases of the human gastrointestinal tract. Here, lorpucitinib was evaluated in a phase I, two‐part, dosing study (NCT04552197) to assess pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and safety in healthy participants. In part 1, 24 participants were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms receiving either lorpucitinib (30 mg daily, 30 mg every 12 hours (q12h), or 75 mg q12h) or tofacitinib (5 mg q12h) for 5 days. Part 2 was a food‐effect study in which 12 participants received a single 75‐mg dose of lorpucitinib under either fasting or fed conditions. In part 1, plasma and gut tissue concentrations of lorpucitinib showed approximately dose‐proportional increases. At all doses, lorpucitinib concentrations were significantly higher (392‐ to 1928‐fold) in the gut mucosal biopsies vs. the corresponding plasma samples, demonstrating high enteric selectivity and significantly exceeding both the tissue concentrations (> 200‐fold) and tissue/plasma ratios observed with tofacitinib. JAK inhibition in biopsies was confirmed via reduction in pSTAT‐3 levels. In part 2, lorpucitinib plasma concentrations were detectable but at low levels, with no statistical differences in PK parameters between the fed and fasted groups. Lorpucitinib was safe and well‐tolerated, and the data may be useful in designing studies to evaluate lorpucitinib in patients with JAK/STAT‐driven gastrointestinal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Human challenge studies (HCS) are controlled clinical trials in which participants are deliberately infected with a pathogen. Such trials are being developed for an increasing number of diseases. Partly as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, there has been a recent ethical debate about the reasons for and against HCS in general, or rather, about the requirements that individual HCS must fulfill to be ethically acceptable. A systematic review was conducted to categorize and summarize such requirements and the reasons given for them. Ethics literature was searched in PubMed, Google Scholar, BELIT, and PhilPapers; eligibility criteria were articles published in a scientific/scholarly journal (original research, reviews, editorials, opinion pieces, and conference/meeting reports). Of 1,322 records identified, 161 publications were included, with 183 requirements (with associated reasons) in 10 thematic categories extracted via qualitative content analysis. In synthesizing and interpreting the requirements and their reasons, three issues emerge as particularly sensitive in the case of HCS: the meaning of the right to withdraw from research procedures, communication of researchers with the public and various stakeholders, and the conditions of informed consent. However, four other issues, not specific to HCS, stand out as the most controversial: the acceptable level of risk to participants, payment of participants, protection of vulnerable groups, and standards for international collaborations. Controversies in these areas indicate that further debate is warranted, possibly leading to more specific instructions in ethics guidance documents.",
