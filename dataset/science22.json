    "abstract": "Copper is an essential cofactor for all organisms, and yet it becomes toxic if concentrations exceed a threshold maintained by evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanisms. How excess copper induces cell death, however, is unknown. Here, we show in human cells that copper-dependent, regulated cell death is distinct from known death mechanisms and is dependent on mitochondrial respiration. We show that copper-dependent death occurs by means of direct binding of copper to lipoylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This results in lipoylated protein aggregation and subsequent iron-sulfur cluster protein loss, which leads to proteotoxic stress and ultimately cell death. These findings may explain the need for ancient copper homeostatic mechanisms.",

Synthesizing paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies, we provide a revised shortlist of global \u201ccore\u201d tipping elements and regional \u201cimpact\u201d tipping elements and their temperature thresholds. Current global warming of ~1.1\u00b0C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to <2\u00b0C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3\u00b0C of warming expected on current policy trajectories. This strengthens the evidence base for urgent action to mitigate climate change and to develop improved tipping point risk assessment, early warning capability, and adaptation strategies.",

By injecting CD5-targeted lipid nanoparticles containing the messenger RNA (mRNA) instructions needed to reprogram T lymphocytes, the researchers were able to generate therapeutic CAR T cells entirely inside the body. Analysis of a mouse model of heart disease revealed that the approach was successful in reducing fibrosis and restoring cardiac function. The ability to produce CAR T cells in vivo using modified mRNA may have a number of therapeutic applications. \u2014PNK",

We tested the hypothesis that MS is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in a cohort comprising more than 10 million young adults on active duty in the US military, 955 of whom were diagnosed with MS during their period of service. Risk of MS increased 32-fold after infection with EBV but was not increased after infection with other viruses, including the similarly transmitted cytomegalovirus. Serum levels of neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of neuroaxonal degeneration, increased only after EBV seroconversion. These findings cannot be explained by any known risk factor for MS and suggest EBV as the leading cause of MS.",

Gilbert et al . determined that antibodies are the correlate of protection in vaccinated individuals enrolled in the Moderna COVE phase 3 clinical trial (see the Perspective by Openshaw). By measuring binding and neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein, the authors found that the levels of both antibodies correlated with the degree of vaccine efficacy. The higher the antibody level, the greater the protection afforded by the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine.

On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4% compared with 32.9% for Rosetta. The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges. We demonstrate the broad utility and high accuracy of ProteinMPNN using x-ray crystallography, cryo\u2013electron microscopy, and functional studies by rescuing previously failed designs, which were made using Rosetta or AlphaFold, of protein monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, tetrahedral nanoparticles, and target-binding proteins.",

We created a human reference atlas comprising nearly 500,000 cells from 24 different tissues and organs, many from the same donor. This atlas enabled molecular characterization of more than 400 cell types, their distribution across tissues, and tissue-specific variation in gene expression. Using multiple tissues from a single donor enabled identification of the clonal distribution of T cells between tissues, identification of the tissue-specific mutation rate in B cells, and analysis of the cell cycle state and proliferative potential of shared cell types across tissues. Cell type\u2013specific RNA splicing was discovered and analyzed across tissues within an individual.",

The formed lead-sulfur (Pb-S) bonds upshifted the Fermi level at the perovskite interface and induced an extra back-surface field for electron extraction. The resulting inverted devices exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) >24% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.19 volts, corresponding to a low voltage loss of 0.36 volts. The strong Pb-S bonds could stabilize perovskite heterojunctions and strengthen underlying perovskite structures that have a similar crystal lattice. Devices with surface sulfidation retained more than 90% of the initial PCE after aging at 85\u00b0C for 2200 hours or operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1000 hours at 55\u00b0 \u00b1 5\u00b0C.",

In this study, we designed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with high-density and long-range\u2013ordered polar carboxyl groups linked to an aluminum oxide\u2013coated separator to provide strong dipole moments, thus offering excess electrons to accelerate the degradation dynamics of carbon-fluorine bond cleavage in Li bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. Hence, an SEI with enriched lithium fluoride (LiF) nanocrystals is generated, facilitating rapid Li + transfer and suppressing dendritic Li growth. In particular, the SAMs endow the full cells with substantially enhanced cyclability under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions. As such, our work extends the long-established SAMs technology into a platform to control electrolyte degradation and SEI formation toward LMBs with ultralong life spans.",

We surveyed the immune compartment of 16 tissues from 12 adult donors by single-cell RNA sequencing and VDJ sequencing generating a dataset of ~360,000 cells. To systematically resolve immune cell heterogeneity across tissues, we developed CellTypist, a machine learning tool for rapid and precise cell type annotation. Using this approach, combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells. Our multitissue approach lays the foundation for identifying highly resolved immune cell types by leveraging a common reference dataset, tissue-integrated expression analysis, and antigen receptor sequencing.",

    "abstract": "The newly reported Omicron variant is poised to replace Delta as the most prevalent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant across the world. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis of the Omicron variant spike protein in complex with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) reveals new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds formed by mutated residues arginine-493, serine-496, and arginine-498 in the receptor binding domain with ACE2. These interactions appear to compensate for other Omicron mutations such as the substitution of asparagine for lysine at position 417 (K417N) that are known to reduce ACE2 binding affinity, resulting in similar biochemical ACE2 binding affinities for the Delta and Omicron variants. Neutralization assays show that pseudoviruses that display the Omicron spike protein exhibit increased antibody evasion. The increase in antibody evasion and the retention of strong interactions at the ACE2 interface thus represent important molecular features that likely contribute to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.",

We provide an in-depth analysis of cell type\u2013related gene signatures and transcription factor markers, as well as sexual dimorphism, across the whole animal. Analysis of common cell types between tissues, such as blood and muscle cells, reveals rare cell types and tissue-specific subtypes.

By tuning electron and phonon localization, we enhanced the figure-of-merit value to 2.7 at 750 kelvin in germanium telluride\u2013based high-entropy materials and realized a high experimental conversion efficiency of 13.3% at a temperature difference of 506 kelvin with the fabricated segmented module. By increasing the entropy, the increased crystal symmetry delocalized the distribution of electrons in the distorted rhombohedral structure, resulting in band convergence and improved electrical properties. By contrast, the localized phonons from the entropy-induced disorder dampened the propagation of transverse phonons, which was the origin of the increased anharmonicity and largely depressed lattice thermal conductivity. We provide a paradigm for tuning electron and phonon localization by entropy manipulation, but we have also demonstrated a route for improving the performance of high-entropy thermoelectric materials.",

Systems that can assist programmers or even generate programs themselves could make programming more productive and accessible. Recent transformer-based neural network models show impressive code generation abilities yet still perform poorly on more complex tasks requiring problem-solving skills, such as competitive programming problems. Here, we introduce AlphaCode, a system for code generation that achieved an average ranking in the top 54.3% in simulated evaluations on recent programming competitions on the Codeforces platform. AlphaCode solves problems by generating millions of diverse programs using specially trained transformer-based networks and then filtering and clustering those programs to a maximum of just 10 submissions. This result marks the first time an artificial intelligence system has performed competitively in programming competitions.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant of concern evades antibody-mediated immunity that comes from vaccination or infection with earlier variants due to accumulation of numerous spike mutations. To understand the Omicron antigenic shift, we determined cryo\u2013electron microscopy and x-ray crystal structures of the spike protein and the receptor-binding domain bound to the broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody (mAb) S309 (the parent mAb of sotrovimab) and to the human ACE2 receptor. We provide a blueprint for understanding the marked reduction of binding of other therapeutic mAbs that leads to dampened neutralizing activity. Remodeling of interactions between the Omicron receptor-binding domain and human ACE2 likely explains the enhanced affinity for the host receptor relative to the ancestral virus.",

    "abstract": "Forest restoration is being scaled up globally to deliver critical ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits; however, there is a lack of rigorous comparison of cobenefit delivery across different restoration approaches. Through global synthesis, we used 25,950 matched data pairs from 264 studies in 53 countries to assess how delivery of climate, soil, water, and wood production services, in addition to biodiversity, compares across a range of tree plantations and native forests. Benefits of aboveground carbon storage, water provisioning, and especially soil erosion control and biodiversity are better delivered by native forests, with compositionally simpler, younger plantations in drier regions performing particularly poorly. However, plantations exhibit an advantage in wood production. These results underscore important trade-offs among environmental and production goals that policy-makers must navigate in meeting forest restoration commitments.",

A remaining challenge is to combine high mechanical robustness with good electrical conduction, especially when patterned at small feature sizes. We develop a molecular engineering strategy based on a topological supramolecular network, which allows for the decoupling of competing effects from multiple molecular building blocks to meet complex requirements. We obtained simultaneously high conductivity and crack-onset strain in a physiological environment, with direct photopatternability down to the cellular scale. We further collected stable electromyography signals on soft and malleable octopus and performed localized neuromodulation down to single-nucleus precision for controlling organ-specific activities through the delicate brainstem.",

Now, a complete, telomere-to-telomere human genome assembly (T2T-CHM13) has enabled us to comprehensively characterize pericentromeric and centromeric repeats, which constitute 6.2% of the genome (189.9 megabases). Detailed maps of these regions revealed multimegabase structural rearrangements, including in active centromeric repeat arrays. Analysis of centromere-associated sequences uncovered a strong relationship between the position of the centromere and the evolution of the surrounding DNA through layered repeat expansions. Furthermore, comparisons of chromosome X centromeres across a diverse panel of individuals illuminated high degrees of structural, epigenetic, and sequence variation in these complex and rapidly evolving regions.",

Unsupervised clustering of these networks delineates functional communities that facilitate biological discovery. We found that remarkably precise functional information can be derived from protein localization patterns, which often contain enough information to identify molecular interactions, and that RNA binding proteins form a specific subgroup defined by unique interaction and localization properties.

We engineer a robust soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida , to funnel these oxygenated compounds into a single exemplary chemical product, either \u03b2-ketoadipate or polyhydroxyalkanoates.

We obtained a certified PCE of 25.6% for FAPbI 3 (FA, formamidinium) perovskite solar cells on the basis of this strategy. Devices retained 96% of their original PCE values after 1000 hours of shelf storage and 80% after 500 hours of thermal stability testing at 85\u00b0C.",

We fabricated damp heat\u2013stable PSCs by tailoring the dimensional fragments of two-dimensional perovskite layers formed at room temperature with oleylammonium iodide molecules; these layers passivate the perovskite surface at the electron-selective contact. The resulting inverted PSCs deliver a 24.3% PCE and retain >95% of their initial value after >1000 hours at damp-heat test conditions, thereby meeting one of the critical industrial stability standards for PV modules.",

Discovering those with valuable properties, however, too often relies on serendipity, because thermodynamic alloy design rules alone often fail in high-dimensional composition spaces. We propose an active learning strategy to accelerate the design of high-entropy Invar alloys in a practically infinite compositional space based on very sparse data. Our approach works as a closed-loop, integrating machine learning with density-functional theory, thermodynamic calculations, and experiments. After processing and characterizing 17 new alloys out of millions of possible compositions, we identified two high-entropy Invar alloys with extremely low thermal expansion coefficients around 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 per degree kelvin at 300 kelvin. We believe this to be a suitable pathway for the fast and automated discovery of high-entropy alloys with optimal thermal, magnetic, and electrical properties.",

The Higgs boson was the last missing component of the model. After observation of the Higgs boson, a measurement of the W boson mass provides a stringent test of the model. We measure the W boson mass, M W , using data corresponding to 8.8 inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity collected in proton-antiproton collisions at a 1.96 tera\u2013electron volt center-of-mass energy with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. A sample of approximately 4 million W boson candidates is used to obtain M W = 80 , 433.5 \u00b1 6.4 stat \u00b1 6.9 syst = 80 , 433.5 \u00b1 9.4 MeV / c 2 , the precision of which exceeds that of all previous measurements combined (stat, statistical uncertainty; syst, systematic uncertainty; MeV, mega\u2013electron volts; c , speed of light in a vacuum). This measurement is in significant tension with the standard model expectation.",

    "abstract": "Animal genomes are folded into loops and topologically associating domains (TADs) by CTCF and loop-extruding cohesins, but the live dynamics of loop formation and stability remain unknown. Here, we directly visualized chromatin looping at the Fbn2 TAD in mouse embryonic stem cells using super-resolution live-cell imaging and quantified looping dynamics by Bayesian inference. Unexpectedly, the Fbn2 loop was both rare and dynamic, with a looped fraction of approximately 3 to 6.5% and a median loop lifetime of approximately 10 to 30 minutes. Our results establish that the Fbn2 TAD is highly dynamic, and about 92% of the time, cohesin-extruded loops exist within the TAD without bridging both CTCF boundaries. This suggests that single CTCF boundaries, rather than the fully CTCF-CTCF looped state, may be the primary regulators of functional interactions.",

    "abstract": "Realizing solution-processed heterostructures is a long-enduring challenge in halide perovskites because of solvent incompatibilities that disrupt the underlying layer. By leveraging the solvent dielectric constant and Gutmann donor number, we could grow phase-pure two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskite stacks of the desired composition, thickness, and bandgap onto 3D perovskites without dissolving the underlying substrate. Characterization reveals a 3D\u20132D transition region of 20 nanometers mainly determined by the roughness of the bottom 3D layer. Thickness dependence of the 2D perovskite layer reveals the anticipated trends for n-i-p and p-i-n architectures, which is consistent with band alignment and carrier transport limits for 2D perovskites. We measured a photovoltaic efficiency of 24.5%, with exceptional stability of T 99 (time required to preserve 99% of initial photovoltaic efficiency) of >2000 hours, implying that the 3D/2D bilayer inherits the intrinsic durability of 2D perovskite without compromising efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The human immune system displays substantial variation between individuals, leading to differences in susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We present single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 1,267,758 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 healthy human subjects. For 14 cell types, we identified 26,597 independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 990 trans-eQTLs, with most showing cell type\u2013specific effects on gene expression. We subsequently show how eQTLs have dynamic allelic effects in B cells that are transitioning from na\u00efve to memory states and demonstrate how commonly segregating alleles lead to interindividual variation in immune function. Finally, using a Mendelian randomization approach, we identify the causal route by which 305 risk loci contribute to autoimmune disease at the cellular level. This work brings together genetic epidemiology with scRNA-seq to uncover drivers of interindividual variation in the immune system.",

Exploiting intrinsic chirality and giant field enhancement, we revealed how to simultaneously modify and control spectra, radiation patterns, and spin angular momentum of photoluminescence and lasing without any spin injection. The superior characteristics of chiral emission and lasing promise multiple applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics.",

We identified gene networks correlated with astrocyte morphology, several of which unexpectedly contained Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) risk genes. CRISPR/Cas9\u2013mediated reduction of candidate genes reduced astrocyte morphological complexity and resulted in cognitive deficits. The same genes were down-regulated in human AD, in an AD mouse model that displayed reduced astrocyte morphology, and in other human brain disorders. We thus provide comprehensive molecular data on astrocyte diversity and mechanisms across the CNS and on the molecular basis of astrocyte morphology in health and disease.",

We demonstrate the ability of high-entropy metal cation mixes to improve ionic conductivity in a compound, which leads to less reliance on specific chemistries and enhanced synthesizability. The local distortions introduced into high-entropy materials give rise to an overlapping distribution of site energies for the alkali ions so that they can percolate with low activation energy. Experiments verify that high entropy leads to orders-of-magnitude higher ionic conductivities in lithium (Li)\u2013sodium (Na) superionic conductor (Li-NASICON), sodium NASICON (Na-NASICON), and Li-garnet structures, even at fixed alkali content. We provide insight into selecting the optimal distortion and designing high-entropy superionic conductors across the vast compositional space.",

An experiment that processes quantum data with a quantum computer could have substantial advantages over conventional experiments in which quantum states are measured and outcomes are processed with a classical computer. We proved that quantum machines could learn from exponentially fewer experiments than the number required by conventional experiments. This exponential advantage is shown for predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis, and learning about physical dynamics. Furthermore, the quantum resources needed for achieving an exponential advantage are quite modest in some cases. Conducting experiments with 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrated that a substantial quantum advantage is possible with today\u2019s quantum processors.",

The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, was identified as a likely source of cases in early reports, but later this conclusion became controversial. We show here that the earliest known COVID-19 cases from December 2019, including those without reported direct links, were geographically centered on this market. We report that live SARS-CoV-2\u2013susceptible mammals were sold at the market in late 2019 and that within the market, SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive environmental samples were spatially associated with vendors selling live mammals. Although there is insufficient evidence to define upstream events, and exact circumstances remain obscure, our analyses indicate that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 occurred through the live wildlife trade in China and show that the Huanan market was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Cases exhibited elevated expression of type 1 interferon\u2013stimulated genes (ISGs) in monocytes, reduction of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells that correlated with monocyte ISG expression, and expansion of repertoire-restricted cytotoxic GZMH + CD8 + T cells.

We integrated dense genotyping data to map cell type\u2013specific cis\u2013expression quantitative trait loci and to link SLE-associated variants to cell type\u2013specific expression.

    "abstract": "Lowering platinum (Pt) loadings without sacrificing power density and durability in fuel cells is highly desired yet challenging because of the high mass transport resistance near the catalyst surfaces. We tailored the three-phase microenvironment by optimizing the ionomer by incorporating ionic covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets into Nafion. The mesoporous apertures of 2.8 to 4.1 nanometers and appendant sulfonate groups enabled the proton transfer and promoted oxygen permeation. The mass activity of Pt and the peak power density of the fuel cell with Pt/Vulcan (0.07 mg of Pt per square centimeter in the cathode) both reached 1.6 times those values without the COF. This strategy was applied to catalyst layers with various Pt loadings and different commercial catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Preservation of cycling behavior Understanding the changes in interfaces between electrode and electrolyte during battery cycling, including the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), is key to the development of longer lasting batteries. Z. Zhang et al . adapt a thin-film vitrification method to ensure the preservation of liquid electrolyte so that the samples taken for analysis using microscopy and spectroscopy better reflect the state of the battery during operation. A key finding is that the SEI is in a swollen state, in contrast to current belief that it only contained solid inorganic species and polymers. The extent of swelling can affect transport through the SEI, which thickens with time, and thus might also decrease the amount of free electrolyte available for battery cycling. \u2014MSL",

    "abstract": "CrCoNi-based medium- and high-entropy alloys display outstanding damage tolerance, especially at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we examined the fracture toughness values of the equiatomic CrCoNi and CrMnFeCoNi alloys at 20 kelvin (K). We found exceptionally high crack-initiation fracture toughnesses of 262 and 459 megapascal-meters \u00bd (MPa\u00b7m \u00bd ) for CrMnFeCoNi and CrCoNi, respectively; CrCoNi displayed a crack-growth toughness exceeding 540 MPa\u00b7m \u00bd after 2.25 millimeters of stable cracking. Crack-tip deformation structures at 20 K are quite distinct from those at higher temperatures. They involve nucleation and restricted growth of stacking faults, fine nanotwins, and transformed epsilon martensite, with coherent interfaces that can promote both arrest and transmission of dislocations to generate strength and ductility. We believe that these alloys develop fracture resistance through a progressive synergy of deformation mechanisms, dislocation glide, stacking-fault formation, nanotwinning, and phase transformation, which act in concert to prolong strain hardening that simultaneously elevates strength and ductility, leading to exceptional toughness.",

    "abstract": "Conventional separation technologies to separate valuable commodities are energy intensive, consuming 15% of the worldwide energy. Mixed-matrix membranes, combining processable polymers and selective adsorbents, offer the potential to deploy adsorbent distinct separation properties into processable matrix. We report the rational design and construction of a highly efficient, mixed-matrix metal-organic framework membrane based on three interlocked criteria: (i) a fluorinated metal-organic framework, AlFFIVE-1-Ni, as a molecular sieve adsorbent that selectively enhances hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide diffusion while excluding methane; (ii) tailoring crystal morphology into nanosheets with maximally exposed (001) facets; and (iii) in-plane alignment of (001) nanosheets in polymer matrix and attainment of [001]-oriented membrane. The membrane demonstrated exceptionally high hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide separation from natural gas under practical working conditions. This approach offers great potential to translate other key adsorbents into processable matrix.",

Vaccinated individuals show protection against severe disease, often attributed to primed cellular immunity. We investigated T and B cell immunity against B.1.1.529 in triple BioNTech BNT162b2 messenger RNA\u2013vaccinated health care workers (HCWs) with different SARS-CoV-2 infection histories. B and T cell immunity against previous variants of concern was enhanced in triple-vaccinated individuals, but the magnitude of T and B cell responses against B.1.1.529 spike protein was reduced. Immune imprinting by infection with the earlier B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant resulted in less durable binding antibody against B.1.1.529. Previously infection-na\u00efve HCWs who became infected during the B.1.1.529 wave showed enhanced immunity against earlier variants but reduced nAb potency and T cell responses against B.1.1.529 itself. Previous Wuhan Hu-1 infection abrogated T cell recognition and any enhanced cross-reactive neutralizing immunity on infection with B.1.1.529.",

Neutrinos, which rarely interact with matter, could provide information on the galaxy\u2019s active core. We searched for neutrino emission from astrophysical objects using data recorded with the IceCube neutrino detector between 2011 and 2020. The positions of 110 known gamma-ray sources were individually searched for neutrino detections above atmospheric and cosmic backgrounds. We found that NGC 1068 has an excess of 79 \u2212 20 + 22 neutrinos at tera\u2013electron volt energies, with a global significance of 4.2\u03c3, which we interpret as associated with the active galaxy. The flux of high-energy neutrinos that we measured from NGC 1068 is more than an order of magnitude higher than the upper limit on emissions of tera\u2013electron volt gamma rays from this source.",

We developed a global analysis of satellite data to simultaneously monitor change in three highly interconnected intertidal ecosystem types\u2014tidal flats, tidal marshes, and mangroves\u2014from 1999 to 2019. Globally, 13,700 square kilometers of tidal wetlands have been lost, but these have been substantially offset by gains of 9700 km 2 , leading to a net change of \u22124000 km 2 over two decades. We found that 27% of these losses and gains were associated with direct human activities such as conversion to agriculture and restoration of lost wetlands. All other changes were attributed to indirect drivers, including the effects of coastal processes and climate change.",

    "abstract": "The performance of perovskite solar cells with inverted polarity (p-i-n) is still limited by recombination at their electron extraction interface, which also lowers the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of p-i-n perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells. A MgF x interlayer with thickness of ~1 nanometer at the perovskite/C 60 interface favorably adjusts the surface energy of the perovskite layer through thermal evaporation, which facilitates efficient electron extraction and displaces C 60 from the perovskite surface to mitigate nonradiative recombination. These effects enable a champion open-circuit voltage of 1.92 volts, an improved fill factor of 80.7%, and an independently certified stabilized PCE of 29.3% for a monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell ~1 square centimeter in area. The tandem retained ~95% of its initial performance after damp-heat testing (85\u00b0C at 85% relative humidity) for >1000 hours.",

Using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions, we experimentally investigate quantum algorithms for solving the maximum independent set problem. We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find that the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and we experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm\u2019s performance against classical simulated annealing. On the hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins.",

By mapping 55 neoantigen-specific TCR clonotypes (NeoTCRs) from 10 metastatic human tumors to their single-cell transcriptomes, we identified signatures of CD8 + and CD4 + neoantigen-reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Neoantigen-specific TILs exhibited tumor-specific expansion with dysfunctional phenotypes, distinct from blood-emigrant bystanders and regulatory TILs. Prospective prediction and testing of 73 NeoTCR signature\u2013derived clonotypes demonstrated that half of the tested TCRs recognized tumor antigens or autologous tumors. NeoTCR signatures identified TCRs that target driver neoantigens and nonmutated viral or tumor-associated antigens, suggesting a common metastatic TIL exhaustion program. NeoTCR signatures delineate the landscape of TILs across metastatic tumors, enabling successful TCR prediction based purely on TIL transcriptomic states for use in cancer immunotherapy.",

Conventional doping of spiro-OMeTAD with hygroscopic lithium salts and volatile 4- tert -butylpyridine is a time-consuming process and also leads to poor device stability. We developed a new doping strategy for spiro-OMeTAD that avoids post-oxidation by using stable organic radicals as the dopant and ionic salts as the doping modulator (referred to as ion-modulated radical doping). We achieved PCEs of >25% and much-improved device stability under harsh conditions. The radicals provide hole polarons that instantly increase the conductivity and work function (WF), and ionic salts further modulate the WF by affecting the energetics of the hole polarons. This organic semiconductor doping strategy, which decouples conductivity and WF tunability, could inspire further optimization in other optoelectronic devices.",

We identify hundreds of thousands of variants per sample in previously unresolved regions, showcasing the promise of the T2T-CHM13 reference for evolutionary and biomedical discovery. Simultaneously, this reference eliminates tens of thousands of spurious variants per sample, including reduction of false positives in 269 medically relevant genes by up to a factor of 12. Because of these improvements in variant discovery coupled with population and functional genomic resources, T2T-CHM13 is positioned to replace GRCh38 as the prevailing reference for human genetics.",

    "abstract": "Persuading people to mask Even in places where it is obligatory, people tend to optimistically overstate their compliance for mask wearing. How then can we persuade more of the population at large to act for the greater good? Abaluck et al . undertook a large, cluster-randomized trial in Bangladesh involving hundreds of thousands of people (although mostly men) over a 2-month period. Colored masks of various construction were handed out free of charge, accompanied by a range of mask-wearing promotional activities inspired by marketing research. Using a grassroots network of volunteers to help conduct the study and gather data, the authors discovered that mask wearing averaged 13.3% in villages where no interventions took place but increased to 42.3% in villages where in-person interventions were introduced. Villages where in-person reinforcement of mask wearing occurred also showed a reduction in reporting COVID-like illness, particularly in high-risk individuals. \u2014CA",

    "abstract": "The human somatosensory network relies on ionic currents to sense, transmit, and process tactile information. We investigate hydrogels that similarly transduce pressure into ionic currents, forming a piezoionic skin. As in rapid- and slow-adapting mechanoreceptors, piezoionic currents can vary widely in duration, from milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. These currents are shown to elicit direct neuromodulation and muscle excitation, suggesting a path toward bionic sensory interfaces. The signal magnitude and duration depend on cationic and anionic mobility differences. Patterned hydrogel films with gradients of fixed charge provide voltage offsets akin to cell potentials. The combined effects enable the creation of self-powered and ultrasoft piezoionic mechanoreceptors that generate a charge density four to six orders of magnitude higher than those of triboelectric and piezoelectric devices.",

    "abstract": "The 15 January 2022 climactic eruption of Hunga volcano, Tonga, produced an explosion in the atmosphere of a size that has not been documented in the modern geophysical record. The event generated a broad range of atmospheric waves observed globally by various ground-based and spaceborne instrumentation networks. Most prominent was the surface-guided Lamb wave (\u22720.01 hertz), which we observed propagating for four (plus three antipodal) passages around Earth over 6 days. As measured by the Lamb wave amplitudes, the climactic Hunga explosion was comparable in size to that of the 1883 Krakatau eruption. The Hunga eruption produced remarkable globally detected infrasound (0.01 to 20 hertz), long-range (~10,000 kilometers) audible sound, and ionospheric perturbations. Seismometers worldwide recorded pure seismic and air-to-ground coupled waves. Air-to-sea coupling likely contributed to fast-arriving tsunamis. Here, we highlight exceptional observations of the atmospheric waves.",

Using the resulting cross-tissue atlas, we highlight shared and tissue-specific features of tissue-resident cell populations; identify cell types that might contribute to neuromuscular, metabolic, and immune components of monogenic diseases and the biological processes involved in their pathology; and determine cell types and gene modules that might underlie disease mechanisms for complex traits analyzed by genome-wide association studies.",

We have developed PyR 0 , a hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model that infers relative prevalence of all viral lineages across geographic regions, detects lineages increasing in prevalence, and identifies mutations relevant to fitness. Applying PyR 0 to all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we identify numerous substitutions that increase fitness, including previously identified spike mutations and many nonspike mutations within the nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins. PyR 0 forecasts growth of new lineages from their mutational profile, ranks the fitness of lineages as new sequences become available, and prioritizes mutations of biological and public health concern for functional characterization.",

We compiled a global dataset of matched single-species and multispecies plantations to evaluate the impact of multispecies planting on stand growth. Average tree height, diameter at breast height, and aboveground biomass were 5.4, 6.8, and 25.5% higher, respectively, in multispecies stands compared with single-species stands. These positive effects were mainly the result of interspecific complementarity and were modulated by differences in leaf morphology and leaf life span, stand age, planting density, and temperature. Our results have implications for designing afforestation and reforestation strategies and bridging experimental studies of biodiversity\u2013ecosystem functioning relationships with real-world practices.",

We identified previously unknown satellite arrays, expanded the catalog of variants and families for repeats and mobile elements, characterized classes of complex composite repeats, and located retroelement transduction events. We detected nascent transcription and delineated CpG methylation profiles to define the structure of transcriptionally active retroelements in humans, including those in centromeres.

Through its application, we reveal principles that relate cell type to synaptic properties and intralaminar circuit organization in the mouse and human cortex. The dynamics of excitatory synapses align with the postsynaptic cell subclass, whereas inhibitory synapse dynamics partly align with presynaptic cell subclass but with considerable overlap. Synaptic properties are heterogeneous in most subclass-to-subclass connections. The two main axes of heterogeneity are strength and variability. Cell subclasses divide along the variability axis, whereas the strength axis accounts for substantial heterogeneity within the subclass. In the human cortex, excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic dynamics are distinct from those in the mouse cortex and vary with depth across layers 2 and 3.",

E-PCBs require elastic conductors that have high conductivity, high stretchability, tough adhesion to various components, and imperceptible resistance changes even under large strain. We present a liquid metal particle network (LMP Net ) assembled by applying an acoustic field to a solid-state insulating liquid metal particle composite as the elastic conductor. The LMP Net conductor satisfies all the aforementioned requirements and enables the fabrication of a multilayered high-density E-PCB, in which numerous electronic components are intimately integrated to create highly stretchable skin electronics. Furthermore, we could generate the LMP Net in various polymer matrices, including hydrogels, self-healing elastomers, and photoresists, thus showing their potential for use in soft electronics.",

Under CR, mice self-impose chronic cycles of 2-hour feeding and 22-hour fasting, raising the question of if it is calories, fasting, or time of day that is the cause of this increased life span. We show here that 30% CR was sufficient to extend the life span by 10%; however, a daily fasting interval and circadian alignment of feeding acted together to extend life span by 35% in male C57BL/6J mice. These effects were independent of body weight. Aging induced widespread increases in gene expression associated with inflammation and decreases in the expression of genes encoding components of metabolic pathways in liver from ad libitum\u2013fed mice. CR at night ameliorated these aging-related changes. Our results show that circadian interventions promote longevity and provide a perspective to further explore mechanisms of aging.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant has become the dominant infective strain. We report the structures of the Omicron spike trimer on its own and in complex with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or an anti-Omicron antibody. Most Omicron mutations are located on the surface of the spike protein and change binding epitopes to many current antibodies. In the ACE2-binding site, compensating mutations strengthen receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to ACE2. Both the RBD and the apo form of the Omicron spike trimer are thermodynamically unstable. An unusual RBD-RBD interaction in the ACE2-spike complex supports the open conformation and further reinforces ACE2 binding to the spike trimer. A broad-spectrum therapeutic antibody, JMB2002, which has completed a phase 1 clinical trial, maintains neutralizing activity against Omicron. JMB2002 binds to RBD differently from other characterized antibodies and inhibits ACE2 binding.",

However, breakdown of the main chains in these polymers requires the cleavage of carbon\u2013carbon bonds that tend to resist selective chemical transformations. Here, we report the production of propylene by partial dehydrogenation of polyethylene and tandem isomerizing ethenolysis of the desaturated chain. Dehydrogenation of high-density polyethylene with either an iridium-pincer complex or platinum/zinc supported on silica as catalysts yielded dehydrogenated material containing up to 3.2% internal olefins; the combination of a second-generation Hoveyda-Grubbs metathesis catalyst and [PdP( t Bu) 3 (\u03bc-Br)] 2 as an isomerization catalyst selectively degraded this unsaturated polymer to propylene in yields exceeding 80%.

Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI)\u2013induced encapsulation of platinum particles on titania observed under reducing conditions is lost once the system is exposed to a redox-reactive environment containing oxygen and hydrogen at a total pressure of ~1 bar. Destabilization of the metal\u2013oxide interface and redox-mediated reconstructions of titania lead to particle dynamics and directed particle migration that depend on nanoparticle orientation.

In this work, we developed a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)\u2013lipid nanoparticle vaccine encoding hemagglutinin antigens from all 20 known influenza A virus subtypes and influenza B virus lineages. This multivalent vaccine elicited high levels of cross-reactive and subtype-specific antibodies in mice and ferrets that reacted to all 20 encoded antigens. Vaccination protected mice and ferrets challenged with matched and mismatched viral strains, and this protection was at least partially dependent on antibodies.

However, issues with Br\u2013I phase segregation under solar cell operational conditions (such as light and heat) limit the device voltage and operational stability. This challenge is often exacerbated by the ready defect formation associated with the rapid crystallization of Br-rich perovskite chemistry with antisolvent processes. We combined the rapid Br crystallization with a gentle gas-quench method to prepare highly textured columnar 1.75\u2013electron volt Br\u2013I mixed WBG perovskite films with reduced defect density. With this approach, we obtained 1.75\u2013electron volt WBG PSCs with greater than 20% power conversion efficiency, approximately 1.33-volt open-circuit voltage ( V oc ), and excellent operational stability (less than 5% degradation over 1100 hours of operation under 1.2 sun at 65\u00b0C). When further integrated with 1.25\u2013electron volt narrow-bandgap PSC, we obtained a 27.1% efficient, all-perovskite, two-terminal tandem device with a high V oc of 2.2 volts.",

SDs account for nearly one-third of the additional sequence, increasing the genome-wide estimate from 5.4 to 7.0% [218 million base pairs (Mbp)]. An analysis of 268 human genomes shows that 91% of the previously unresolved T2T-CHM13 SD sequence (68.3 Mbp) better represents human copy number variation. Comparing long-read assemblies from human ( n = 12) and nonhuman primate ( n = 5) genomes, we systematically reconstruct the evolution and structural haplotype diversity of biomedically relevant and duplicated genes. This analysis reveals patterns of structural heterozygosity and evolutionary differences in SD organization between humans and other primates.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The eukaryotic nucleus pro\u00adtects the genome and is enclosed by the two membranes of the nuclear envelope. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) perforate the nuclear envelope to facilitate nucleocytoplasmic transport. With a molecular weight of \u223c120 MDa, the human NPC is one of the larg\u00adest protein complexes. Its ~1000 proteins are taken in multiple copies from a set of about 30 distinct nucleoporins (NUPs). They can be roughly categorized into two classes. Scaf\u00adfold NUPs contain folded domains and form a cylindrical scaffold architecture around a central channel. Intrinsically disordered NUPs line the scaffold and extend into the central channel, where they interact with cargo complexes. The NPC architecture is highly dynamic. It responds to changes in nuclear envelope tension with conforma\u00adtional breathing that manifests in dilation and constriction movements. Elucidating the scaffold architecture, ultimately at atomic resolution, will be important for gaining a more precise understanding of NPC function and dynamics but imposes a substantial chal\u00adlenge for structural biologists. RATIONALE Considerable progress has been made toward this goal by a joint effort in the field. A synergistic combination of complementary approaches has turned out to be critical. In situ structural biology techniques were used to reveal the overall layout of the NPC scaffold that defines the spatial reference for molecular modeling. High-resolution structures of many NUPs were determined in vitro. Proteomic analysis and extensive biochemical work unraveled the interaction network of NUPs. Integra\u00adtive modeling has been used to combine the different types of data, resulting in a rough outline of the NPC scaffold. Previous struc\u00adtural models of the human NPC, however, were patchy and limited in accuracy owing to several challenges: (i) Many of the high-resolution structures of individual NUPs have been solved from distantly related species and, consequently, do not comprehensively cover their human counterparts. (ii) The scaf\u00adfold is interconnected by a set of intrinsically disordered linker NUPs that are not straight\u00adforwardly accessible to common structural biology techniques. (iii) The NPC scaffold intimately embraces the fused inner and outer nuclear membranes in a distinctive topol\u00adogy and cannot be studied in isolation. (iv) The conformational dynamics of scaffold NUPs limits the resolution achievable in structure determination. RESULTS In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI)\u2013based prediction to generate an exten\u00adsive repertoire of structural models of human NUPs and their subcomplexes. The resulting models cover various domains and interfaces that so far remained structurally uncharac\u00adterized. Benchmarking against previous and unpublished x-ray and cryo\u2013electron micros\u00adcopy structures revealed unprecedented accu\u00adracy. We obtained well-resolved cryo\u2013electron tomographic maps of both the constricted and dilated conformational states of the hu\u00adman NPC. Using integrative modeling, we fit\u00adted the structural models of individual NUPs into the cryo\u2013electron microscopy maps. We explicitly included several linker NUPs and traced their trajectory through the NPC scaf\u00adfold. We elucidated in great detail how mem\u00adbrane-associated and transmembrane NUPs are distributed across the fusion topology of both nuclear membranes. The resulting architectural model increases the structural coverage of the human NPC scaffold by about twofold. We extensively validated our model against both earlier and new experimental data. The completeness of our model has enabled microsecond-long coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the NPC scaffold within an explicit membrane en\u00advironment and solvent. These simulations reveal that the NPC scaffold prevents the constriction of the otherwise stable double-membrane fusion pore to small diameters in the absence of membrane tension. CONCLUSION Our 70-MDa atomically re\u00adsolved model covers >90% of the human NPC scaffold. It captures conforma\u00adtional changes that occur during dilation and constriction. It also reveals the precise anchoring sites for intrinsically disordered NUPs, the identification of which is a prerequisite for a complete and dy\u00adnamic model of the NPC. Our study exempli\u00adfies how AI-based structure prediction may accelerate the elucidation of subcellular ar\u00adchitecture at atomic resolution.

High-resolution models are color coded according to nucleoporin subcomplex membership. The nuclear envelope is shown as a gray surface.",

These epistatic shifts shape subsequent evolutionary change\u2014for example, enabling many of the antibody-escape substitutions in the Omicron RBD.

    "abstract": "Crop leaves in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. This protective dissipation continues after the leaf transitions to shade, reducing crop photosynthesis. A bioengineered acceleration of this adjustment increased photosynthetic efficiency and biomass in tobacco in the field. But could that also translate to increased yield in a food crop? Here we bioengineered the same change into soybean. In replicated field trials, photosynthetic efficiency in fluctuating light was higher and seed yield in five independent transformation events increased by up to 33%. Despite increased seed quantity, seed protein and oil content were unaltered. This validates increasing photosynthetic efficiency as a much needed strategy toward sustainably increasing crop yield in support of future global food security.",

Here, we present spatial-CUT&Tag for spatially resolved genome-wide profiling of histone modifications by combining in situ CUT&Tag chemistry, microfluidic deterministic barcoding, and next-generation sequencing. Spatially resolved chromatin states in mouse embryos revealed tissue-type-specific epigenetic regulations in concordance with ENCODE references and provide spatial information at tissue scale. Spatial-CUT&Tag revealed epigenetic control of the cortical layer development and spatial patterning of cell types determined by histone modification in mouse brain. Single-cell epigenomes can be derived in situ by identifying 20-micrometer pixels containing only one nucleus using immunofluorescence imaging. Spatial chromatin modification profiling in tissue may offer new opportunities to study epigenetic regulation, cell function, and fate decision in normal physiology and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance in cancer is often linked to changes in tumor cell state or lineage, but the molecular mechanisms driving this plasticity remain unclear. Using murine organoid and genetically engineered mouse models, we investigated the causes of lineage plasticity in prostate cancer and its relationship to antiandrogen resistance. We found that plasticity initiates in an epithelial population defined by mixed luminal-basal phenotype and that it depends on increased Janus kinase (JAK) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) activity. Organoid cultures from patients with castration-resistant disease harboring mixed-lineage cells reproduce the dependency observed in mice by up-regulating luminal gene expression upon JAK and FGFR inhibitor treatment. Single-cell analysis confirms the presence of mixed-lineage cells with increased JAK/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and FGFR signaling in a subset of patients with metastatic disease, with implications for stratifying patients for clinical trials.",

Whereas current PFAS destruction strategies use nonselective destruction mechanisms, we found that perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) could be mineralized through a sodium hydroxide\u2013mediated defluorination pathway. PFCA decarboxylation in polar aprotic solvents produced reactive perfluoroalkyl ion intermediates that degraded to fluoride ions (78 to ~100%) within 24 hours. The carbon-containing intermediates and products were inconsistent with oft-proposed one-carbon-chain shortening mechanisms, and we instead computationally identified pathways consistent with many experiments. Degradation was also observed for branched perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids and might be extended to degrade other PFAS classes as methods to activate their polar headgroups are identified.",

We demonstrate efficient all-perovskite tandem solar modules using scalable fabrication techniques. By systematically tuning the cesium ratio of a methylammonium-free 1.8\u2013electron volt mixed-halide perovskite, we improve the homogeneity of crystallization for blade-coated films over large areas. An electrically conductive conformal \u201cdiffusion barrier\u201d is introduced between interconnecting subcells to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of all-perovskite tandem solar modules. Our tandem modules achieve a certified PCE of 21.7% with an aperture area of 20 square centimeters and retain 75% of their initial efficiency after 500 hours of continuous operation under simulated 1-sun illumination.",

We profiled nine prenatal tissues combining single-cell RNA sequencing, antigen-receptor sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics to reconstruct the developing human immune system. This revealed the late acquisition of immune-effector functions by myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets and the maturation of monocytes and T cells before peripheral tissue seeding. Moreover, we uncovered system-wide blood and immune cell development beyond primary hematopoietic organs, characterized human prenatal B1 cells, and shed light on the origin of unconventional T cells.

We demonstrate the modulation of tunneling current by about three orders of magnitude in ferroelectric tunnel junction devices by changing the polarization state of MoS 2 /WS 2 heterobilayers.

Herein, we report the skeletal editing of indoles through nitrogen atom insertion, accessing the corresponding quinazoline or quinoxaline bioisosteres by trapping of an electrophilic nitrene species generated from ammonium carbamate and hypervalent iodine. This reactivity relies on the strategic use of a silyl group as a labile protecting group that can facilitate subsequent product release. The utility of this highly functional group-compatible methodology in the context of late-stage skeletal editing of several commercial drugs is demonstrated.",

We report that about 14% CR for 2 years in healthy humans improved thymopoiesis and was correlated with mobilization of intrathymic ectopic lipid. CR-induced transcriptional reprogramming in adipose tissue implicated pathways regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, anti-inflammatory responses, and longevity. Expression of the gene Pla2g7 encoding platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PLA2G7) is inhibited in humans undergoing CR. Deletion of Pla2g7 in mice showed decreased thymic lipoatrophy, protection against age-related inflammation, lowered NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and improved metabolic health. Therefore, the reduction of PLA2G7 may mediate the immunometabolic effects of CR and could potentially be harnessed to lower inflammation and extend the health span.",

    "abstract": "Drugs that target the human serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT 2A R) are used to treat neuropsychiatric diseases; however, many have hallucinogenic effects, hampering their use. Here, we present structures of 5-HT 2A R complexed with the psychedelic drugs psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) and d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), as well as the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin and the nonhallucinogenic psychedelic analog lisuride. Serotonin and psilocin display a second binding mode in addition to the canonical mode, which enabled the design of the psychedelic IHCH-7113 (a substructure of antipsychotic lumateperone) and several 5-HT 2A R \u03b2-arrestin\u2013biased agonists that displayed antidepressant-like activity in mice but without hallucinogenic effects. The 5-HT 2A R complex structures presented herein and the resulting insights provide a solid foundation for the structure-based design of safe and effective nonhallucinogenic psychedelic analogs with therapeutic effects.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and neurologic disability. Further understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies requires a deeper knowledge of cerebrovascular cells in humans. We profiled transcriptomes of 181,388 cells to define a cell atlas of the adult human cerebrovasculature, including endothelial cell molecular signatures with arteriovenous segmentation and expanded perivascular cell diversity. By leveraging this reference, we investigated cellular and molecular perturbations in brain arteriovenous malformations, which are a leading cause of stroke in young people, and identified pathologic endothelial transformations with abnormal vascular patterning and the ontology of vascularly derived inflammation. We illustrate the interplay between vascular and immune cells that contributes to brain hemorrhage and catalog opportunities for targeting angiogenic and inflammatory programs in vascular malformations.",

We engineered an enamel analog with the essential hierarchical structure at multiple scales through assembly of amorphous intergranular phase (AIP)\u2013coated hydroxyapatite nanowires intertwined with polyvinyl alcohol. The nanocomposite simultaneously exhibited high stiffness, hardness, strength, viscoelasticity, and toughness, exceeding the properties of enamel and previously manufactured bulk enamel-inspired materials. The presence of AIP, polymer confinement, and strong interfacial adhesion are all needed for high mechanical performance. This multiscale design is suitable for scalable production of high-performance materials.",

    "abstract": "Grazing represents the most extensive use of land worldwide. Yet its impacts on ecosystem services remain uncertain because pervasive interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil properties, and biodiversity may occur but have never been addressed simultaneously. Using a standardized survey at 98 sites across six continents, we show that interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil, and biodiversity are critical to explain the delivery of fundamental ecosystem services across drylands worldwide. Increasing grazing pressure reduced ecosystem service delivery in warmer and species-poor drylands, whereas positive effects of grazing were observed in colder and species-rich areas. Considering interactions between grazing and local abiotic and biotic factors is key for understanding the fate of dryland ecosystems under climate change and increasing human pressure.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogels are promising as materials for soft actuators because of qualities such as softness, transparency, and responsiveness to stimuli. However, weak and slow actuations remain challenging as a result of low modulus and osmosis-driven slow water diffusion, respectively. We used turgor pressure and electroosmosis to realize a strong and fast hydrogel-based actuator. A turgor actuator fabricated with a gel confined by a selectively permeable membrane can retain a high osmotic pressure that drives gel swelling; thus, our actuator exerts large stress [0.73 megapascals (MPa) in 96 minutes (min)] with a 1.16 cubic centimeters of hydrogel. With the accelerated water transport caused by electroosmosis, the gel swells rapidly, enhancing the actuation speed (0.79 MPa in 9 min). Our strategies enable a soft hydrogel to break a brick and construct underwater structures within a few minutes.",

The samples contain low abundances of materials that formed at high temperatures, such as chondrules and calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions. The samples are rich in phyllosilicates and carbonates, which formed through aqueous alteration reactions at low temperature, high pH, and water/rock ratios of <1 (by mass). Less altered fragments contain olivine, pyroxene, amorphous silicates, calcite, and phosphide. Numerical simulations, based on the mineralogical and physical properties of the samples, indicate that Ryugu\u2019s parent body formed ~2 million years after the beginning of Solar System formation.",

    "abstract": "From tropical forests to gut microbiomes, ecological communities host notably high numbers of coexisting species. Beyond high biodiversity, communities exhibit a range of complex dynamics that are difficult to explain under a unified framework. Using bacterial microcosms, we performed a direct test of theory predicting that simple community-level features dictate emergent behaviors of communities. As either the number of species or the strength of interactions increases, we show that microbial ecosystems transition between three distinct dynamical phases, from a stable equilibrium in which all species coexist to partial coexistence to emergence of persistent fluctuations in species abundances, in the order predicted by theory. Under fixed conditions, high biodiversity and fluctuations reinforce each other. Our results demonstrate predictable emergent patterns of diversity and dynamics in ecological communities.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of bacterial infections currently focuses on choosing an antibiotic that matches a pathogen\u2019s susceptibility, with less attention paid to the risk that even susceptibility-matched treatments can fail as a result of resistance emerging in response to treatment. Combining whole-genome sequencing of 1113 pre- and posttreatment bacterial isolates with machine-learning analysis of 140,349 urinary tract infections and 7365 wound infections, we found that treatment-induced emergence of resistance could be predicted and minimized at the individual-patient level. Emergence of resistance was common and driven not by de novo resistance evolution but by rapid reinfection with a different strain resistant to the prescribed antibiotic. As most infections are seeded from a patient\u2019s own microbiota, these resistance-gaining recurrences can be predicted using the patient\u2019s past infection history and minimized by machine learning\u2013personalized antibiotic recommendations, offering a means to reduce the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens.",

This resource precisely maps CpG methylation (32.28 million CpGs), DNA accessibility, and short-read datasets (166,058 previously unresolved chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing peaks) to provide evidence of activity across previously unidentified or corrected genes and reveals clinically relevant paralog-specific regulation. Probing CpG methylation across human centromeres from six diverse individuals generated an estimate of variability in kinetochore localization.

Here, by screening candidate photosynthesis-related transcription factors in rice, we identified a DREB (Dehydration Responsive Element Binding) family member, OsDREB1C, in which expression is induced by both light and low nitrogen status. We show that OsDREB1C drives functionally diverse transcriptional programs determining photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen utilization, and flowering time. Field trials with OsDREB1C -overexpressing rice revealed yield increases of 41.3 to 68.3% and, in addition, shortened growth duration, improved nitrogen use efficiency, and promoted efficient resource allocation, thus providing a strategy toward achieving much-needed increases in agricultural productivity.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease endemic in Central and West Africa. In May 2022, dozens of non-endemic countries reported hundreds of monkeypox cases, most with no epidemiological link to Africa. We identified two lineages of monkeypox virus (MPXV) among two 2021 and seven 2022 US monkeypox cases: the major 2022 outbreak variant called B.1 and a minor contemporaneously sampled variant called A.2. Analyses of mutations among these two variants revealed an extreme preference for GA-to-AA mutations indicative of human APOBEC3 cytosine deaminase activity among Clade IIb MPXV (previously West African, Nigeria) sampled since 2017. Such mutations were not enriched within other MPXV clades. These findings suggest that APOBEC3 editing may be a recurrent and a dominant driver of MPXV evolution within the current outbreak.",

Systematic discovery of stimulation-dependent cytokine regulators requires both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies, which have been challenging in primary human cells. We now report genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and interference (CRISPRi) screens in primary human T cells to identify gene networks controlling interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production. Arrayed CRISPRa confirmed key hits and enabled multiplexed secretome characterization, revealing reshaped cytokine responses. Coupling CRISPRa screening with single-cell RNA sequencing enabled deep molecular characterization of screen hits, revealing how perturbations tuned T cell activation and promoted cell states characterized by distinct cytokine expression profiles. These screens reveal genes that reprogram critical immune cell functions, which could inform the design of immunotherapies.",

We further explored cell-cell interactions arising from soma contact or proximity in a cell type\u2013specific manner. Comparison of the human and mouse cortices showed conservation in the laminar organization of cells and differences in somatic interactions across species.

We compared immune responses elicited by mosaic-8 (SARS-CoV-2 and seven animal sarbecoviruses) and homotypic (only SARS-CoV-2) RBD nanoparticles in mice and macaques and observed stronger responses elicited by mosaic-8 to mismatched (not on nanoparticles) strains, including SARS-CoV and animal sarbecoviruses. Mosaic-8 immunization showed equivalent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicrons, and protected from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV challenges, whereas homotypic SARS-CoV-2 immunization protected only from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Epitope mapping demonstrated increased targeting of conserved epitopes after mosaic-8 immunization. Together, these results suggest that mosaic-8 RBD nanoparticles could protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future sarbecovirus spillovers.",

As the size, geometric, surface roughness, and mechanical strength requirements of glass evolve, conventional processing methods are challenged. We introduce microscale computed axial lithography (micro-CAL) of fused silica components, by tomographically illuminating a photopolymer-silica nanocomposite that is then sintered. We fabricated three-dimensional microfluidics with internal diameters of 150 micrometers, free-form micro-optical elements with a surface roughness of 6 nanometers, and complex high-strength trusses and lattice structures with minimum feature sizes of 50 micrometers. As a high-speed, layer-free digital light manufacturing process, micro-CAL can process nanocomposites with high solids content and high geometric freedom, enabling new device structures and applications.",

Both of these nonlinear effects require momentum conservation for the participating photons, which strongly limits the versatility of the resulting quantum states. Nonlinear metasurfaces have subwavelength thickness and allow the relaxation of this constraint; when combined with resonances, they greatly expand the possibilities of quantum state engineering. Here, we generated entangled photons via spontaneous parametric downconversion in semiconductor metasurfaces with high\u2013quality factor, quasi-bound state in the continuum resonances. By enhancing the quantum vacuum field, our metasurfaces boost the emission of nondegenerate entangled photons within multiple narrow resonance bands and over a wide spectral range. A single resonance or several resonances in the same sample, pumped at multiple wavelengths, can generate multifrequency quantum states, including cluster states. These features reveal metasurfaces as versatile sources of complex states for quantum information.",

Johnson et al . report that diverse bacteria encode structural and functional homologs of mammalian gasdermins. Like their mammalian counterparts, bacterial gasdermins are activated by caspase-like proteases, oligomerize into large membrane pores, and defend against pathogen\u2014in this case, bacteriophage\u2014infection. Proteolytic activation occurs through the release of a short inhibitory peptide, and many bacterial gasdermins are lipidated to facilitate membrane pore formation. Pyroptotic cell death, a central component of mammalian innate immunity, thus has a shared origin with an ancient antibacteriophage defense system. \u2014SMH",

We encapsulate individual microbes in droplets with microfluidics and liberate their DNA, which we then amplify, tag with droplet-specific barcodes, and sequence. We explore the human gut microbiome, sequencing more than 20,000 microbial single-amplified genomes (SAGs) from a single human donor and coassembling genomes of almost 100 bacterial species, including several with multiple subspecies strains. We use these genomes to probe microbial interactions, reconstructing the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) network and observing HGT between 92 species pairs; we also identify a significant in vivo host-phage association between crAssphage and one strain of Bacteroides vulgatus .

    "abstract": "Understanding the circumstances that lead to pandemics is important for their prevention. We analyzed the genomic diversity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We show that SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity before February 2020 likely comprised only two distinct viral lineages, denoted \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB.\u201d Phylodynamic rooting methods, coupled with epidemic simulations, reveal that these lineages were most probably the result of at least two separate cross-species transmission events into humans. The first zoonotic transmission likely involved lineage B viruses around 18 November 2019 (23 October to 8 December), and the separate introduction of lineage A likely occurred within weeks of this event. These findings indicate that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 circulated widely in humans before November 2019 and define the narrow window between when SARS-CoV-2 first jumped into humans and when the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. As with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 emergence likely resulted from multiple zoonotic events.",

Consistent with immunological imprinting, most antibodies derived from memory B cells or plasma cells of Omicron breakthrough cases cross-react with the Wuhan-Hu-1, BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5 receptor-binding domains, whereas Omicron primary infections elicit B cells of narrow specificity up to 6 months after infection.

Highly sensitive spectral measurement using a single detector allows the footprints of such spectrometers to be scaled down while achieving spectral resolution approaching that of benchtop systems. We report a high-performance computational spectrometer based on a single van der Waals junction with an electrically tunable transport-mediated spectral response. We achieve high peak wavelength accuracy (\u223c0.36 nanometers), high spectral resolution (\u223c3 nanometers), broad operation bandwidth (from \u223c405 to 845 nanometers), and proof-of-concept spectral imaging. Our approach provides a route toward ultraminiaturization and offers unprecedented performance in accuracy, resolution, and operation bandwidth for single-detector computational spectrometers.",

Here, we address this by establishing high-speed image-enabled cell sorting (ICS), which records multicolor fluorescence images and sorts cells based on measurements from image data at speeds up to 15,000 events per second. We show that ICS quantifies cell morphology and localization of labeled proteins and increases the resolution of cell cycle analyses by separating mitotic stages. We combine ICS with CRISPR-pooled screens to identify regulators of the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway, enabling the completion of genome-wide image-based screens in about 9 hours of run time. By assessing complex cellular phenotypes, ICS substantially expands the phenotypic space accessible to cell-sorting applications and pooled genetic screening.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we find that CD8 + T cells expressing inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are the human equivalent of Ly49 + CD8 + regulatory T cells in mice and are increased in the blood and inflamed tissues of patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases. Moreover, these CD8 + T cells efficiently eliminated pathogenic gliadin-specific CD4 + T cells from the leukocytes of celiac disease patients in vitro. We also find elevated levels of KIR + CD8 + T cells, but not CD4 + regulatory T cells, in COVID-19 patients, correlating with disease severity and vasculitis. Selective ablation of Ly49 + CD8 + T cells in virus-infected mice led to autoimmunity after infection. Our results indicate that in both species, these regulatory CD8 + T cells act specifically to suppress pathogenic T cells in autoimmune and infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Dielectric elastomers (DEs) can act as deformable capacitors that generate mechanical work in response to an electric field. DEs are often based on commercial acrylic and silicone elastomers. Acrylics require prestretching to achieve high actuation strains and lack processing flexibility. Silicones allow for processability and rapid response but produce much lower strains. In this work, a processable, high-performance dielectric elastomer (PHDE) with a bimodal network structure is synthesized, and its electromechanical properties are tailored by adjusting cross-linkers and hydrogen bonding within the elastomer network. The PHDE exhibits a maximum areal strain of 190% and maintains strains higher than 110% at 2 hertz without prestretching. A dry stacking process with high efficiency, scalability, and yield enables multilayer actuators that maintain the high actuation performance of single-layer films.",

    "abstract": "Past studies offer contradictory claims for the role of genome organization in the regulation of gene activity. Here, we show through high-resolution chromosome conformation analysis that the Drosophila genome is organized by two independent classes of regulatory sequences, tethering elements and insulators. Quantitative live imaging and targeted genome editing demonstrate that this two-tiered organization is critical for the precise temporal dynamics of Hox gene transcription during development. Tethering elements mediate long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and foster fast activation kinetics. Conversely, the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) prevent spurious interactions with enhancers and silencers located in neighboring TADs. These two levels of genome organization operate independently of one another to ensure precision of transcriptional dynamics and the reliability of complex patterning processes.",

Despite decades of investigation, the atomic-scale dynamic processes of GB deformation remain elusive, particularly for the GBs in polycrystals, which are commonly of the asymmetric and general type. We conducted an in situ atomic-resolution study to reveal how sliding-dominant deformation is accomplished at general tilt GBs in platinum bicrystals. We observed either direct atomic-scale sliding along the GB or sliding with atom transfer across the boundary plane. The latter sliding process was mediated by movements of disconnections that enabled the transport of GB atoms, leading to a previously unrecognized mode of coupled GB sliding and atomic plane transfer. These results enable an atomic-scale understanding of how general GBs slide in polycrystalline materials.",

It is installed by a writer complex and can be reversed by erasers such as the fat mass and obesity-associated protein FTO. Despite extensive research, the primary physiological substrates of FTO in mammalian tissues and development remain elusive. Here, we show that FTO mediates m 6 A demethylation of long-interspersed element-1 (LINE1) RNA in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), regulating LINE1 RNA abundance and the local chromatin state, which in turn modulates the transcription of LINE1-containing genes. FTO-mediated LINE1 RNA m 6 A demethylation also plays regulatory roles in shaping chromatin state and gene expression during mouse oocyte and embryonic development. Our results suggest broad effects of LINE1 RNA m 6 A demethylation by FTO in mammals.",

Using data from more than 400 networks of seed dispersal interactions, Fricke et al . quantified the changes in seed disposal function brought about globally by defaunation. Their analyses indicate that past defaunation has severely reduced long-distance seed dispersal, cutting by more than half the number of seeds dispersed far enough to track climate change. In addition, their approach enables the prediction of seed dispersal interactions using species traits and an estimation of how these interactions translate into ecosystem functioning, thus informing ecological forecasting and the consequences of animal declines. \u2014AMS",

We performed spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing (Stereo-seq) to capture spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes of axolotl telencephalon sections during development and regeneration. Annotated cell types exhibited distinct spatial distribution, molecular features, and functions. We identified an injury-induced ependymoglial cell cluster at the wound site as a progenitor cell population for the potential replenishment of lost neurons, through a cell state transition process resembling neurogenesis during development. Transcriptome comparisons indicated that these induced cells may originate from local resident ependymoglial cells. We further uncovered spatially defined neurons at the lesion site that may regress to an immature neuron\u2013like state. Our work establishes spatial transcriptome profiles of an anamniote tetrapod brain and decodes potential neurogenesis from ependymoglial cells for development and regeneration, thus providing mechanistic insights into vertebrate brain regeneration.",

Our results are inconsistent with the previously known bimodal radius distribution arising from atmospheric loss of a hydrogen/helium envelope.

The underlying mechanism responsible for the ultrahigh electrostrain is the interaction between defect dipoles and domain switching. The fatigue resistance, thermal stability, and strain value (0.25%) at 20 kilovolt/centimeter are comparable with or better than those of commercial Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 -based ceramics, showing great potential for practical applications.

    "abstract": "Information flow in neurons proceeds by integrating inputs in dendrites, generating action potentials near the soma, and releasing neurotransmitters from nerve terminals in the axon. We found that in the striatum, acetylcholine-releasing neurons induce action potential firing in distal dopamine axons. Spontaneous activity of cholinergic neurons produced dopamine release that extended beyond acetylcholine-signaling domains, and traveling action potentials were readily recorded from dopamine axons in response to cholinergic activation. In freely moving mice, dopamine and acetylcholine covaried with movement direction. Local inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors impaired dopamine dynamics and affected movement. Our findings uncover an endogenous mechanism for action potential initiation independent of somatodendritic integration and establish that this mechanism segregates the control of dopamine signaling between axons and somata.",

    "abstract": "Learning to predict rewards based on environmental cues is essential for survival. It is believed that animals learn to predict rewards by updating predictions whenever the outcome deviates from expectations, and that such reward prediction errors (RPEs) are signaled by the mesolimbic dopamine system\u2014a key controller of learning. However, instead of learning prospective predictions from RPEs, animals can infer predictions by learning the retrospective cause of rewards. Hence, whether mesolimbic dopamine instead conveys a causal associative signal that sometimes resembles RPE remains unknown. We developed an algorithm for retrospective causal learning and found that mesolimbic dopamine release conveys causal associations but not RPE, thereby challenging the dominant theory of reward learning. Our results reshape the conceptual and biological framework for associative learning.",

Surprisingly, KPZ universality was recently conjectured to also describe spin transport in the one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model. We tested this conjecture by experimentally probing transport in a cold-atom quantum simulator via the relaxation of domain walls in spin chains of up to 50 spins. We found that domain-wall relaxation is indeed governed by the KPZ dynamical exponent z = 3/2 and that the occurrence of KPZ scaling requires both integrability and a nonabelian SU(2) symmetry. Finally, we leveraged the single-spin\u2013sensitive detection enabled by the quantum gas microscope to measure an observable based on spin-transport statistics. Our results yield a clear signature of the nonlinearity that is a hallmark of KPZ universality.",

Here, we show that antiviral STAND (Avs) homologs in bacteria and archaea detect hallmark viral proteins, triggering Avs tetramerization and the activation of diverse N-terminal effector domains, including DNA endonucleases, to abrogate infection. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy reveals that Avs sensor domains recognize conserved folds, active-site residues, and enzyme ligands, allowing a single Avs receptor to detect a wide variety of viruses. These findings extend the paradigm of pattern recognition of pathogen-specific proteins across all three domains of life.",

Climate change may reduce alpine snow cover and increase vegetation productivity, as in the Arctic. Here, we demonstrate that 77% of the European Alps above the tree line experienced greening (productivity gain) and <1% browning (productivity loss) over the past four decades. Snow cover declined significantly during this time, but in <10% of the area. These trends were only weakly correlated: Greening predominated in warmer areas, driven by climatic changes during summer, while snow cover recession peaked at colder temperatures, driven by precipitation changes. Greening could increase carbon sequestration, but this is unlikely to outweigh negative implications, including reduced albedo and water availability, thawing permafrost, and habitat loss.",

Modern human transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) differs from Neanderthal TKTL1 by a lysine-to-arginine amino acid substitution. Using overexpression in developing mouse and ferret neocortex, knockout in fetal human neocortical tissue, and genome-edited cerebral organoids, we found that the modern human variant, hTKTL1, but not the Neanderthal variant, increases the abundance of basal radial glia (bRG) but not that of intermediate progenitors (bIPs). bRG generate more neocortical neurons than bIPs. The hTKTL1 effect requires the pentose phosphate pathway and fatty acid synthesis. Inhibition of these metabolic pathways reduces bRG abundance in fetal human neocortical tissue. Our data suggest that neocortical neurogenesis in modern humans differs from that in Neanderthals.",

We found that the quantitative trait locus KRN2 in maize and its rice ortholog, OsKRN2 , experienced convergent selection. These orthologs encode WD40 proteins and interact with a gene of unknown function, DUF1644, to negatively regulate grain number in both crops. Knockout of KRN2 in maize or OsKRN2 in rice increased grain yield by ~10% and ~8%, respectively, with no apparent trade-offs in other agronomic traits. Furthermore, genome-wide scans identified 490 pairs of orthologous genes that underwent convergent selection during maize and rice evolution, and these were enriched for two shared molecular pathways. KRN2 , together with other convergently selected genes, provides an excellent target for future crop improvement.",

Hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate over a C 60 -Cu/SiO 2 catalyst at ambient pressure and temperatures of 180\u00b0 to 190\u00b0C had an EG yield of up to 98 \u00b1 1%.

We used three-dimensional electron microscopy of mouse, macaque, and human cortical samples to study their cell type composition and synaptic circuit architecture. The 2.5-fold increase in interneurons in humans compared with mice was compensated by a change in axonal connection probabilities and therefore did not yield a commensurate increase in inhibitory-versus-excitatory synaptic input balance on human pyramidal cells. Rather, increased inhibition created an expanded interneuron-to-interneuron network, driven by an expansion of interneuron-targeting interneuron types and an increase in their synaptic selectivity for interneuron innervation. These constitute key neuronal network alterations in the human cortex.",

In this study, we estimate the minimum land area to secure important biodiversity areas, ecologically intact areas, and optimal locations for representation of species ranges and ecoregions. We discover that at least 64 million square kilometers (44% of terrestrial area) would require conservation attention (ranging from protected areas to land-use policies) to meet this goal. More than 1.8 billion people live on these lands, so responses that promote autonomy, self-determination, equity, and sustainable management for safeguarding biodiversity are essential. Spatially explicit land-use scenarios suggest that 1.3 million square kilometers of this land is at risk of being converted for intensive human land uses by 2030, which requires immediate attention. However, a sevenfold difference exists between the amount of habitat converted in optimistic and pessimistic land-use scenarios, highlighting an opportunity to avert this crisis. Appropriate targets in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework to encourage conservation of the identified land would contribute substantially to safeguarding biodiversity.",

Although preserving genetic diversity is key to maintaining species\u2019 adaptability, we lack predictive tools and global estimates of genetic diversity loss across ecosystems. We introduce a mathematical framework that bridges biodiversity theory and population genetics to understand the loss of naturally occurring DNA mutations with decreasing habitat. By analyzing genomic variation of 10,095 georeferenced individuals from 20 plant and animal species, we show that genome-wide diversity follows a mutations-area relationship power law with geographic area, which can predict genetic diversity loss from local population extinctions. We estimate that more than 10% of genetic diversity may already be lost for many threatened and nonthreatened species, surpassing the United Nations\u2019 post-2020 targets for genetic preservation.",

By contrast, under a widely accepted conjecture, classical algorithms that do not learn from data cannot achieve the same guarantee. We also prove that classical ML algorithms can efficiently classify a wide range of quantum phases.

    "abstract": "In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the loss of androgen receptor (AR) dependence leads to clinically aggressive tumors with few therapeutic options. We used ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing), RNA-seq, and DNA sequencing to investigate 22 organoids, six patient-derived xenografts, and 12 cell lines. We identified the well-characterized AR-dependent and neuroendocrine subtypes, as well as two AR-negative/low groups: a Wnt-dependent subtype, and a stem cell\u2013like (SCL) subtype driven by activator protein\u20131 (AP-1) transcription factors. We used transcriptomic signatures to classify 366 patients, which showed that SCL is the second most common subtype of CRPC after AR-dependent. Our data suggest that AP-1 interacts with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD proteins to maintain subtype-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic landscapes in this group. Together, this molecular classification reveals drug targets and can potentially guide therapeutic decisions.",

    "abstract": "Nitrate is an essential nutrient and signaling molecule for plant growth. Plants sense intracellular nitrate to adjust their metabolic and growth responses. Here we identify the primary nitrate sensor in plants. We found that mutation of all seven Arabidopsis NIN-like protein (NLP) transcription factors abolished plants\u2019 primary nitrate responses and developmental programs. Analyses of NIN-NLP7 chimeras and nitrate binding revealed that NLP7 is derepressed upon nitrate perception via its amino terminus. A genetically encoded fluorescent split biosensor, mCitrine-NLP7, enabled visualization of single-cell nitrate dynamics in planta. The nitrate sensor domain of NLP7 resembles the bacterial nitrate sensor NreA. Substitutions of conserved residues in the ligand-binding pocket impaired the ability of nitrate-triggered NLP7 to control transcription, transport, metabolism, development, and biomass. We propose that NLP7 represents a nitrate sensor in land plants.",

Availability of oxygen is crucial for many species\u2019 metabolism. Kraft et al . were surprised to find that pure cultures of an ammonia-oxidizing archaean (AOA) (see the Perspective by Martens-Habbena and Qin), Nitosopumilus maritimus , were able to regenerate small amounts of oxygen when placed under anoxic conditions. Isotope labeling of nitrogen species revealed a series of reactions transforming nitrite, the expected metabolic end product, into nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, and, eventually, dinitrogen. Oxygen was also formed, likely from nitric oxide disproportionation, but was mostly consumed, which is consistent with the overall aerobic metabolism of AOA. These organisms can be found in oxygen-depleted waters and may benefit from producing oxygen from nitrite under these conditions. \u2014MAF",

We assessed more than 600,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes from adult human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset dlPFC. Although most cell subtypes defined transcriptomically are conserved, we detected several that exist only in a subset of species as well as substantial species-specific molecular differences across homologous neuronal, glial, and non-neural subtypes. The latter are exemplified by human-specific switching between expression of the neuropeptide somatostatin and tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production in certain interneurons. The above molecular differences are also illustrated by expression of the neuropsychiatric risk gene FOXP2 , which is human-specific in microglia and primate-specific in layer 4 granular neurons. We generated a comprehensive survey of the dlPFC cellular repertoire and its shared and divergent features in anthropoid primates.",

This is because many of the necessary chemical transformations required to modify compound cores in a straightforward fashion are not applicable in complex contexts. We report a method that addresses one facet of this problem by allowing chemists to hop directly between chemically distinct heteroaromatic scaffolds. Specifically, we show that selective photolysis of quinoline N -oxides with 390-nanometer light followed by acid-promoted rearrangement affords N -acylindoles while showing broad compatibility with medicinally relevant functionality. Applications to late-stage skeletal modification of compounds of pharmaceutical interest and more complex transformations involving serial single-atom changes are demonstrated.",

We show that the large number of Omicron sublineage spike mutations leads to enhanced angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding, reduced fusogenicity, and severe dampening of plasma neutralizing activity elicited by infection or seven clinical vaccines relative to the ancestral virus. Administration of a homologous or heterologous booster based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike sequence markedly increased neutralizing antibody titers and breadth against BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 across all vaccines evaluated. Our data suggest that although Omicron sublineages evade polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses elicited by primary vaccine series, vaccine boosters may provide sufficient protection against Omicron-induced severe disease.",

In this work, we demonstrated on-demand creation of artificial neurons, synapses, and memory capacitors in post-fabricated perovskite NdNiO 3 devices that can be simply reconfigured for a specific purpose by single-shot electric pulses. The sensitivity of electronic properties of perovskite nickelates to the local distribution of hydrogen ions enabled these results. With experimental data from our memory capacitors, simulation results of a reservoir computing framework showed excellent performance for tasks such as digit recognition and classification of electrocardiogram heartbeat activity. Using our reconfigurable artificial neurons and synapses, simulated dynamic networks outperformed static networks for incremental learning scenarios.

The ammoximation of several additional simple ketones is also demonstrated. Our approach eliminates the need to transport and store highly concentrated, stabilized H 2 O 2 , potentially achieving substantial environmental and economic savings.

Omicron-infected hamsters lost significantly less body weight and exhibited reduced clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine and chemokine dysregulation, and lung damage than Delta-infected hamsters. Both variants were highly transmissible through contact transmission. In noncontact transmission studies Omicron demonstrated similar or higher transmissibility than Delta. Delta outcompeted Omicron without selection pressure, but this scenario changed once immune selection pressure with neutralizing antibodies\u2014active against Delta but poorly active against Omicron\u2014was introduced.

Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we characterized the transcriptome of 880,000 nuclei from 18 control and 61 failing, nonischemic human hearts with pathogenic variants in DCM and ACM genes or idiopathic disease. We performed genotype-stratified analyses of the ventricular cell lineages and transcriptional states. The resultant DCM and ACM ventricular cell atlas demonstrated distinct right and left ventricular responses, highlighting genotype-associated pathways, intercellular interactions, and differential gene expression at single-cell resolution. Together, these data illuminate both shared and distinct cellular and molecular architectures of human heart failure and suggest candidate therapeutic targets.",

We report the design of van der Waals thin films consisting of staggered two-dimensional nanosheets with bond-free van der Waals interfaces. The films feature sliding and rotation degrees of freedom among the staggered nanosheets to ensure mechanical stretchability and malleability, as well as a percolating network of nanochannels to endow permeability and breathability. With an excellent mechanical match to soft biological tissues, the freestanding films can naturally adapt to local surface topographies and seamlessly merge with living organisms with highly conformal interfaces, rendering living organisms with electronic functions, including leaf-gate and skin-gate transistors. On-skin transistors allow high-fidelity monitoring and local amplification of skin potentials and electrophysiological signals.",

Upon heat stress, plasma membrane\u2013localized E3 ligase TT3.1 translocates to the endosomes, on which TT3.1 ubiquitinates chloroplast precursor protein TT3.2 for vacuolar degradation, implying that TT3.1 might serve as a potential thermosensor.

Although pain development has been well studied, pain recovery mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we found that CD11c-expressing spinal microglia appear after the development of behavioral pain hypersensitivity following nerve injury. Nerve-injured mice with spinal CD11c + microglial depletion failed to recover spontaneously from this hypersensitivity. CD11c + microglia expressed insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), and interference with IGF1 signaling recapitulated the impairment in pain recovery. In pain-recovered mice, the depletion of CD11c + microglia or the interruption of IGF1 signaling resulted in a relapse in pain hypersensitivity. Our findings reveal a mechanism for the remission and recurrence of neuropathic pain, providing potential targets for therapeutic strategies.",

We investigated the neural code underlying sequence working memory using two-photon calcium imaging to record thousands of neurons in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys memorizing and then reproducing a sequence of locations after a delay. We discovered a regular geometrical organization: The high-dimensional neural state space during the delay could be decomposed into a sum of low-dimensional subspaces, each storing the spatial location at a given ordinal rank, which could be generalized to novel sequences and explain monkey behavior. The rank subspaces were distributed across large overlapping neural groups, and the integration of ordinal and spatial information occurred at the collective level rather than within single neurons. Thus, a simple representational geometry underlies sequence working memory.",

Without chemical reaction, the US can amplify the adhesion energy and interfacial fatigue threshold between hydrogels and porcine skin by up to 100 and 10 times. Combined experiments and theoretical modeling suggest that the key mechanism is US-induced cavitation, which propels and immobilizes anchoring primers into tissues with mitigated barrier effects. Our strategy achieves spatial patterning of tough bioadhesion, on-demand detachment, and transdermal drug delivery.

Although recent developments of highly permeable polymer membranes have advanced the upper bounds for various gas pairs, these polymers typically exhibit limited selectivity. We report a class of hydrocarbon ladder polymers that can achieve both high selectivity and high permeability in membrane separations for many industrially relevant gas mixtures. Additionally, their corresponding films exhibit desirable mechanical and thermal properties. Tuning of the ladder polymer backbone configuration was found to have a profound effect on separation performance and aging behavior.",

We study theoretically the emission of light from a radiation source placed inside a PTC and find that radiation corresponding to the momentum bandgap is exponentially amplified, whether initiated by a macroscopic source, an atom, or vacuum fluctuations, drawing the amplification energy from the modulation. The radiation linewidth becomes narrower with time, eventually becoming monochromatic in the middle of the bandgap, which enables us to propose the concept of nonresonant tunable PTC laser. Finally, we find that the spontaneous decay rate of an atom embedded in a PTC vanishes at the band edge because of the low density of photonic states.",

Intentionally depositing traces of platinum nanoparticles on the alumina binder or the outer surface of zeolite crystals, instead of inside the zeolite crystals, enhanced isomer selectivity without compromising activity.

We use a transmission model fitted to empirical sexual partnership data to show that the heavy-tailed sexual partnership distribution, in which a handful of individuals have disproportionately many partners, can explain the sustained growth of monkeypox among MSM despite the absence of such patterns previously. We suggest that the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for monkeypox over the MSM sexual network may be substantially above 1, which poses challenges to outbreak containment. Ensuring support and tailored messaging to facilitate prevention and early detection among MSM with high numbers of partners is warranted.",

To date, there are few robust estimates of this parameter for natural populations, and it is therefore unclear whether adaptive evolution can play a meaningful role in short-term population dynamics. We developed and applied quantitative genetic methods to long-term datasets from 19 wild bird and mammal populations and found that, while estimates vary between populations, additive genetic variance in relative fitness is often substantial and, on average, twice that of previous estimates. We show that these rates of contemporary adaptive evolution can affect population dynamics and hence that natural selection has the potential to partly mitigate effects of current environmental change.",

Polytetrafluoroethylene has a dense fluorine surface, leading to its strong water repellence. We report a series of fluorous oligoamide nanorings with interior diameters ranging from 0.9 to 1.9 nanometers. These nanorings undergo supramolecular polymerization in phospholipid bilayer membranes to form fluorous nanochannels, the interior walls of which are densely covered with fluorine atoms. The nanochannel with the smallest diameter exhibits a water permeation flux that is two orders of magnitude greater than those of aquaporins and carbon nanotubes. The proposed nanochannel exhibits negligible chloride ion (Cl \u2013 ) permeability caused by a powerful electrostatic barrier provided by the electrostatically negative fluorous interior surface.

We show that the optimization of these processes yields the observed allometries of metazoan life, particularly metabolic scaling. We conclude that metabolism, growth, and reproduction are inextricably linked; that together they determine fitness; and, in contrast to longstanding dogma, that no single component drives another. Our model predicts that anthropogenic change will cause animals to evolve decreased scaling exponents of metabolism, increased growth rates, and reduced lifetime reproductive outputs, with worrying consequences for the replenishment of future populations.",

Through statistical analysis of thousands of particles using x-ray phase contrast holotomography in a LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 -based cathode, we found that the local network heterogeneity results in asynchronous activities in the early cycles, and subsequently the particle assemblies move toward a synchronous behavior.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the molecular conduit in the nuclear membrane of eukaryotic cells that regulates import and export of biomolecules between the nucleus and the cytosol, with vertebrate NPCs ~110 to 125 MDa in molecular mass and ~120 nm in diameter. NPCs are organized into four main rings: the cytoplasmic ring (CR) at the cytosolic side, the inner ring and the luminal ring on the plane of the nuclear membrane, and the nuclear ring facing the nucleus. Each ring possesses an approximate eightfold symmetry and is composed of multiple copies of different nucleoporins. NPCs have been implicated in numerous biological processes, and their dysfunctions are associated with a growing number of serious human diseases. However, despite pioneering studies from many groups over the past two decades, we still lack a full understanding of NPCs\u2019 organization, dynamics, and complexity. RATIONALE We used the Xenopus laevis oocyte as a model system for the structural characterization because each oocyte possesses a large number of NPC particles that can be visualized on native nuclear membranes without the aid of detergent extraction. We used single-particle cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis on data collected at different stage tilt angles for three-dimensional reconstruction and structure prediction with AlphaFold for model building. RESULTS We reconstructed the CR map of X. laevis NPC at 6.9 and 6.7 \u00c5 resolutions for the full CR protomer and a core region, respectively, and predicted the structures of the individual nucleoporins using AlphaFold because no high-resolution models of X. laevis Nups were available. For any ambiguous subunit interactions, we also predicted complex structures, which further guided model fitting of the CR protomer. We placed the nucleoporin or complex structures into the CR density to obtain an almost full CR atomic model, composed of the inner and outer Y-complexes, two copies of Nup205, two copies of the Nup214-Nup88-Nup62 complex, one Nup155, and five copies of Nup358. In particular, we predicted the largest protein in the NPC, Nup358, as having an S-shaped globular domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a largely disordered C-terminal region containing phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats previously shown to form a gel-like condensate phase for selective cargo passage. Four of the Nup358 copies clamp around the inner and outer Y-complexes to stabilize the CR, and the fifth Nup358 situates in the center of the cluster of clamps. AlphaFold also predicted a homo-oligomeric, likely specifically pentameric, coiled-coil structure of Nup358 that may provide the avidity for Nup358 recruitment to the NPC and for lowering the threshold for Nup358 condensation in NPC biogenesis. CONCLUSION Our studies offer an example of integrative cryo-EM and structure prediction as a general approach for attaining more precise models of megadalton protein complexes from medium-resolution density maps. The more accurate and almost complete model of the CR presented here expands our understanding of the molecular interactions in the NPC and represents a substantial step forward toward the molecular architecture of a full NPC, with implications for NPC function, biogenesis, and regulation. Cryo-EM structure of the cytoplasmatic ring of the nuclear pore complex from X. laevis . The 6.9 \u00c5 map was generated with single-particle cryo-EM, and the model was built with AlphaFold structure prediction. The secondary structural elements guided EM map fitting, resulting in an almost complete model of the complex. The approach allowed the identification of five copies of Nup358 and a second copy of the trimeric Nup214-Nup88-Nup62 complex.",

This compact representation of multiple datasets explores the challenges of missing and erroneous data and uses ancient samples to constrain and date relationships. We demonstrate the power of the method to recover relationships between individuals and populations as well as to identify descendants of ancient samples.

    "abstract": "The rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant and its resistance to neutralization by vaccinee and convalescent sera are driving a search for monoclonal antibodies with potent neutralization. To provide insight into effective neutralization, we determined cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures and evaluated receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies for their ability to bind and neutralize B.1.1.529. Mutations altered 16% of the B.1.1.529 RBD surface, clustered on an RBD ridge overlapping the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)\u2013binding surface and reduced binding of most antibodies. Substantial inhibitory activity was retained by select monoclonal antibodies\u2014including A23-58.1, B1-182.1, COV2-2196, S2E12, A19-46.1, S309, and LY-CoV1404\u2014that accommodated these changes and neutralized B.1.1.529. We identified combinations of antibodies with synergistic neutralization. The analysis revealed structural mechanisms for maintenance of potent neutralization against emerging variants.",

    "abstract": "The active chemical state of zinc (Zn) in a zinc-copper (Zn-Cu) catalyst during carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide (CO 2 /CO) hydrogenation has been debated to be Zn oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles, metallic Zn, or a Zn-Cu surface alloy. We used x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at 180 to 500 millibar to probe the nature of Zn and reaction intermediates during CO 2 /CO hydrogenation over Zn/ZnO/Cu(211), where the temperature is sufficiently high for the reaction to rapidly turn over, thus creating an almost adsorbate-free surface. Tuning of the grazing incidence angle makes it possible to achieve either surface or bulk sensitivity. Hydrogenation of CO 2 gives preference to ZnO in the form of clusters or nanoparticles, whereas in pure CO a surface Zn-Cu alloy becomes more prominent. The results reveal a specific role of CO in the formation of the Zn-Cu surface alloy as an active phase that facilitates efficient CO 2 methanol synthesis.",

Using an independent nationally representative survey of 0.14 million (M) adults, we compared COVID mortality during the 2020 and 2021 viral waves to expected all-cause mortality. COVID constituted 29% (95% confidence interval, 28 to 31%) of deaths from June 2020 to July 2021, corresponding to 3.2 M (3.1 to 3.4) deaths, of which 2.7 M (2.6 to 2.9) occurred in April to July 2021 (when COVID doubled all-cause mortality). A subsurvey of 57,000 adults showed similar temporal increases in mortality, with COVID and non-COVID deaths peaking similarly. Two government data sources found that, when compared to prepandemic periods, all-cause mortality was 27% (23 to 32%) higher in 0.2 M health facilities and 26% (21 to 31%) higher in civil registration deaths in 10 states; both increases occurred mostly in 2021. The analyses find that India\u2019s cumulative COVID deaths by September 2021 were six to seven times higher than reported officially.",

We applied a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally evaluate genetic variants in high, local LD for independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We found that 17.7% of eQTLs exhibit more than one major allelic effect in tight LD. The detected regulatory variants were highly and specifically enriched for activating chromatin structures and allelic transcription factor binding. Integration of MPRA profiles with eQTL/complex trait colocalizations across 114 human traits and diseases identified causal variant sets demonstrating how genetic association signals can manifest through multiple, tightly linked causal variants.",

Satellite observations reveal that fires burned ~4.7 million hectares in 2019 and 2020, accounting for 44% of the total burned area in the Siberian Arctic for the entire 1982\u20132020 period. The summer of 2020 was the warmest in four decades, with fires burning an unprecedentedly large area of carbon-rich soils. We show that factors of fire associated with temperature have increased in recent decades and identified a near-exponential relationship between these factors and annual burned area. Large fires in the Arctic are likely to recur with climatic warming before mid-century, because the temperature trend is reaching a threshold in which small increases in temperature are associated with exponential increases in the area burned.",

A high-solubility mechanism enriches the concentration of CO 2 in the surface layer hydrated by water vapor naturally present in target gas streams, followed by fast CO 2 transport through a highly permeable (but low-selectivity) polymer substrate. Analytical methods confirm the existence of an amine surface layer. Integrated multilayer membranes prepared in this way are not diffusion limited and retain much of their high CO 2 permeability, and their CO 2 selectivity is concurrently increased in some cases by more than ~150-fold.",

We were able to shift the water-sorption equilibrium on the catalyst surface, leading to a greater proportion of free surface that in turn raised the rate of syngas conversion by nearly a factor of 2. The carbon monoxide conversion reached 63.5%, and 71.4% of the hydrocarbon products were light olefins at 250\u00b0C, outperforming poly(divinylbenzene)-free catalyst under equivalent reaction conditions.

To overcome suppression, we engineered circuits in which tumor-specific synNotch receptors locally induce production of the cytokine IL-2. These circuits potently enhance CAR T cell infiltration and clearance of immune-excluded tumors, without systemic toxicity. The most effective IL-2 induction circuit acts in an autocrine and T cell receptor (TCR)- or CAR-independent manner, bypassing suppression mechanisms including consumption of IL-2 or inhibition of TCR signaling. These engineered cells establish a foothold in the target tumors, with synthetic Notch\u2013induced IL-2 production enabling initiation of CAR-mediated T cell expansion and cell killing. Thus, it is possible to reconstitute synthetic T cell circuits that activate the outputs ultimately required for an antitumor response, but in a manner that evades key points of tumor suppression.",

We tracked the evolution of fitness-associated phenotypes and allele frequencies genome-wide in 10 replicate field populations of Drosophila melanogaster over 10 generations from summer to late fall. Adaptation was evident over each sampling interval (one to four generations), with exceptionally rapid phenotypic adaptation and large allele frequency shifts at many independent loci. The direction and basis of the adaptive response shifted repeatedly over time, consistent with the action of strong and rapidly fluctuating selection. Overall, we found clear phenotypic and genomic evidence of adaptive tracking occurring contemporaneously with environmental change, thus demonstrating the temporally dynamic nature of adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral genetics in dogs has focused on modern breeds, which are isolated subgroups with distinctive physical and, purportedly, behavioral characteristics. We interrogated breed stereotypes by surveying owners of 18,385 purebred and mixed-breed dogs and genotyping 2155 dogs. Most behavioral traits are heritable [heritability ( h 2 ) > 25%], and admixture patterns in mixed-breed dogs reveal breed propensities. Breed explains just 9% of behavioral variation in individuals. Genome-wide association analyses identify 11 loci that are significantly associated with behavior, and characteristic breed behaviors exhibit genetic complexity. Behavioral loci are not unusually differentiated in breeds, but breed propensities align, albeit weakly, with ancestral function. We propose that behaviors perceived as characteristic of modern breeds derive from thousands of years of polygenic adaptation that predates breed formation, with modern breeds distinguished primarily by aesthetic traits.",

Here, we report electroreductive XEC of previously incompatible electrophiles including tertiary alkyl bromides, aryl chlorides, and aryl/vinyl triflates. Reactions rely on the merger of an electrochemically active complex that selectively reacts with alkyl bromides through 1e \u2013 processes and an electrochemically inactive Ni 0 (phosphine) complex that selectively reacts with aryl electrophiles through 2e \u2013 processes. Accessing Ni 0 (phosphine) intermediates is critical to the strategy but is often challenging. We uncover a previously unknown pathway for electrochemically generating these key complexes at mild potentials through a choreographed series of ligand-exchange reactions. The mild methodology is applied to the alkylation of a range of substrates including natural products and pharmaceuticals.",

Forest conservation and restoration can help mitigate climate change; however, climate change could fundamentally imperil forests in many regions and undermine their ability to provide such mitigation. The extent of climate risks facing forests has not been synthesized globally nor have different approaches to quantifying forest climate risks been systematically compared. We combine outputs from multiple mechanistic and empirical approaches to modeling carbon, biodiversity, and disturbance risks to conduct a synthetic climate risk analysis for Earth\u2019s forests in the 21st century. Despite large uncertainty in most regions we find that some forests are consistently at higher risk, including southern boreal forests and those in western North America and parts of the Amazon.",

    "abstract": "The prospect of controlling the electronic properties of materials via the vacuum fields of cavity electromagnetic resonators is emerging as one of the frontiers of condensed matter physics. We found that the enhancement of vacuum field fluctuations in subwavelength split-ring resonators strongly affects one of the most paradigmatic quantum protectorates, the quantum Hall electron transport in high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases. The observed breakdown of the topological protection of the integer quantum Hall effect is interpreted in terms of a long-range cavity-mediated electron hopping where the anti-resonant terms of the light-matter coupling Hamiltonian develop into a finite resistivity induced by the vacuum fluctuations. Our experimental platform can be used for any two-dimensional material and provides a route to manipulate electron phases in matter by means of vacuum-field engineering.",

    "abstract": "Understanding broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus antibody responses is key to developing countermeasures against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and future zoonotic sarbecoviruses. We describe the isolation and characterization of a human monoclonal antibody, designated S2K146, that broadly neutralizes viruses belonging to SARS-CoV\u2013 and SARS-CoV-2\u2013related sarbecovirus clades, which use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor. Structural and functional studies show that most of the virus residues that directly bind S2K146 are also involved in binding to ACE2. This allows the antibody to potently inhibit receptor attachment. S2K146 protects against SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant challenge in hamsters, and viral passaging experiments reveal a high barrier for emergence of escape mutants, making it a good candidate for clinical development. The conserved ACE2-binding residues present a site of vulnerability that might be leveraged for developing vaccines eliciting broad sarbecovirus immunity.",

However, 3D manufacturing of inorganic nanostructures typically requires nanomaterial-polymer composites and is limited by a photopolymerization mechanism, resulting in a reduction of material purity and degradation of intrinsic properties. We developed a polymerization-independent, laser direct writing technique called photoexcitation-induced chemical bonding. Without any additives, the holes excited inside semiconductor quantum dots are transferred to the nanocrystal surface and improve their chemical reactivity, leading to interparticle chemical bonding. As a proof of concept, we printed arbitrary 3D quantum dot architectures at a resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Our strategy will enable the manufacturing of free-form quantum dot optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting devices or photodetectors.",

Through use of new emissions estimates and a multiregional input-output model, we evaluated land-use emissions embodied in global trade from 2004 to 2017. Annually, 27% of land-use emissions and 22% of agricultural land are related to agricultural products ultimately consumed in a different region from where they were produced. Roughly three-quarters of embodied emissions are from land-use change, with the largest transfers from lower-income countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, and Argentina to more industrialized regions such as Europe, the United States, and China. Mitigation of global land-use emissions and sustainable development may thus depend on improving the transparency of supply chains.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainties surrounding tree carbon allocation to growth are a major limitation to projections of forest carbon sequestration and response to climate change. The prevalence and extent to which carbon assimilation (source) or cambial activity (sink) mediate wood production are fundamentally important and remain elusive. We quantified source-sink relations across biomes by combining eddy-covariance gross primary production with extensive on-site and regional tree ring observations. We found widespread temporal decoupling between carbon assimilation and tree growth, underpinned by contrasting climatic sensitivities of these two processes. Substantial differences in assimilation-growth decoupling between angiosperms and gymnosperms were determined, as well as stronger decoupling with canopy closure, aridity, and decreasing temperatures. Our results reveal pervasive sink control over tree growth that is likely to be increasingly prominent under global climate change.",

    "abstract": "By sequencing 727 ancient individuals from the Southern Arc (Anatolia and its neighbors in Southeastern Europe and West Asia) over 10,000 years, we contextualize its Chalcolithic period and Bronze Age (about 5000 to 1000 BCE), when extensive gene flow entangled it with the Eurasian steppe. Two streams of migration transmitted Caucasus and Anatolian/Levantine ancestry northward, and the Yamnaya pastoralists, formed on the steppe, then spread southward into the Balkans and across the Caucasus into Armenia, where they left numerous patrilineal descendants. Anatolia was transformed by intra\u2013West Asian gene flow, with negligible impact of the later Yamnaya migrations. This contrasts with all other regions where Indo-European languages were spoken, suggesting that the homeland of the Indo-Anatolian language family was in West Asia, with only secondary dispersals of non-Anatolian Indo-Europeans from the steppe.",

    "abstract": "The authors analyzed data from multiple large-scale randomized experiments on LinkedIn\u2019s People You May Know algorithm, which recommends new connections to LinkedIn members, to test the extent to which weak ties increased job mobility in the world\u2019s largest professional social network. The experiments randomly varied the prevalence of weak ties in the networks of over 20 million people over a 5-year period, during which 2 billion new ties and 600,000 new jobs were created. The results provided experimental causal evidence supporting the strength of weak ties and suggested three revisions to the theory. First, the strength of weak ties was nonlinear. Statistical analysis found an inverted U-shaped relationship between tie strength and job transmission such that weaker ties increased job transmission but only to a point, after which there were diminishing marginal returns to tie weakness. Second, weak ties measured by interaction intensity and the number of mutual connections displayed varying effects. Moderately weak ties (measured by mutual connections) and the weakest ties (measured by interaction intensity) created the most job mobility. Third, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries.",

    "abstract": "Proposed hydropower dams at more than 350 sites throughout the Amazon require strategic evaluation of trade-offs between the numerous ecosystem services provided by Earth\u2019s largest and most biodiverse river basin. These services are spatially variable, hence collective impacts of newly built dams depend strongly on their configuration. We use multiobjective optimization to identify portfolios of sites that simultaneously minimize impacts on river flow, river connectivity, sediment transport, fish diversity, and greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy production goals. We find that uncoordinated, dam-by-dam hydropower expansion has resulted in forgone ecosystem service benefits. Minimizing further damage from hydropower development requires considering diverse environmental impacts across the entire basin, as well as cooperation among Amazonian nations. Our findings offer a transferable model for the evaluation of hydropower expansion in transboundary basins.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization transforms environments in ways that alter biological evolution. We examined whether urban environmental change drives parallel evolution by sampling 110,019 white clover plants from 6169 populations in 160 cities globally. Plants were assayed for a Mendelian antiherbivore defense that also affects tolerance to abiotic stressors. Urban-rural gradients were associated with the evolution of clines in defense in 47% of cities throughout the world. Variation in the strength of clines was explained by environmental changes in drought stress and vegetation cover that varied among cities. Sequencing 2074 genomes from 26 cities revealed that the evolution of urban-rural clines was best explained by adaptive evolution, but the degree of parallel adaptation varied among cities. Our results demonstrate that urbanization leads to adaptation at a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Activation of microglia in the spinal cord dorsal horn after peripheral nerve injury contributes to the development of pain hypersensitivity. How activated microglia selectively enhance the activity of spinal nociceptive circuits is not well understood. We discovered that after peripheral nerve injury, microglia degrade extracellular matrix structures, perineuronal nets (PNNs), in lamina I of the spinal cord dorsal horn. Lamina I PNNs selectively enwrap spinoparabrachial projection neurons, which integrate nociceptive information in the spinal cord and convey it to supraspinal brain regions to induce pain sensation. Degradation of PNNs by microglia enhances the activity of projection neurons and induces pain-related behaviors. Thus, nerve injury\u2013induced degradation of PNNs is a mechanism by which microglia selectively augment the output of spinal nociceptive circuits and cause pain hypersensitivity.",

We report the realization of an integrated two-qubit network node based on silicon-vacancy centers (SiVs) in diamond nanophotonic cavities. Our qubit register consists of the SiV electron spin acting as a communication qubit and the strongly coupled silicon-29 nuclear spin acting as a memory qubit with a quantum memory time exceeding 2 seconds. By using a highly strained SiV, we realize electron-photon entangling gates at temperatures up to 1.5 kelvin and nucleus-photon entangling gates up to 4.3 kelvin.

    "abstract": "Highly efficient halide perovskite solar cells generally rely on lithium-doped organic hole transporting layers that are thermally and chemically unstable, in part because of migration of iodide anions from the perovskite layer. We report a solution strategy to stabilize the hole transport in organic layers by ionic coupling positive polymer radicals and molecular anions through an ion-exchange process. The target layer exhibited a hole conductivity that was 80 times higher than that of the conventional lithium-doped layer. Moreover, after extreme iodide invasion caused by light-soaking at 85\u00b0C for 200 hours, the target layer maintained high hole conductivity and well-matched band alignment. This ion-exchange strategy enabled fabrication of perovskite solar cells with a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.9% that maintained 92% under standard illumination at 85\u00b0C after 1000 hours.",

    "abstract": "Human cells produce thousands of lipids that change during cell differentiation and can vary across individual cells of the same type. However, we are only starting to characterize the function of these cell-to-cell differences in lipid composition. Here, we measured the lipidomes and transcriptomes of individual human dermal fibroblasts by coupling high-resolution mass spectrometry imaging with single-cell transcriptomics. We found that the cell-to-cell variations of specific lipid metabolic pathways contribute to the establishment of cell states involved in the organization of skin architecture. Sphingolipid composition is shown to define fibroblast subpopulations, with sphingolipid metabolic rewiring driving cell-state transitions. Therefore, cell-to-cell lipid heterogeneity affects the determination of cell states, adding a new regulatory component to the self-organization of multicellular systems.",

Membrane technology can offer an energy-efficient alternative but requires selective differentiation of crude oil molecules with rapid liquid transport. We synthesized multiblock oligomer amines, which comprised a central amine segment with two hydrophobic oligomer blocks, and used them to fabricate hydrophobic polyamide nanofilms by interfacial polymerization from self-assembled vesicles. These polyamide nanofilms provide transport of hydrophobic liquids more than 100 times faster than that of conventional hydrophilic counterparts. In the fractionation of light crude oil, manipulation of the film thickness down to ~10 nanometers achieves permeance one order of magnitude higher than that of current state-of-the-art hydrophobic membranes while retaining comparable size- and class-based separation. This high permeance can markedly reduce plant footprint, which expands the potential for using membranes made of ultrathin nanofilms in crude oil fractionation.",

Scintillation has widespread applications in medical imaging, x-ray nondestructive inspection, electron microscopy, and high-energy particle detectors. Most research focuses on finding materials with brighter, faster, and more controlled scintillation. We developed a unified theory of nanophotonic scintillators that accounts for the key aspects of scintillation: energy loss by high-energy particles, and light emission by non-equilibrium electrons in nanostructured optical systems. We then devised an approach based on integrating nanophotonic structures into scintillators to enhance their emission, obtaining nearly an order-of-magnitude enhancement in both electron-induced and x-ray\u2013induced scintillation. Our framework should enable the development of a new class of brighter, faster, and higher-resolution scintillators with tailored and optimized performance.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiomes of human populations worldwide have many core microbial species in common. However, within a species, some strains can show remarkable population specificity. The question is whether such specificity arises from a shared evolutionary history (codiversification) between humans and their microbes. To test for codiversification of host and microbiota, we analyzed paired gut metagenomes and human genomes for 1225 individuals in Europe, Asia, and Africa, including mothers and their children. Between and within countries, a parallel evolutionary history was evident for humans and their gut microbes. Moreover, species displaying the strongest codiversification independently evolved traits characteristic of host dependency, including reduced genomes and oxygen and temperature sensitivity. These findings all point to the importance of understanding the potential role of population-specific microbial strains in microbiome-mediated disease phenotypes.",

However, it is unclear how elexacaftor exerts its effects, in part because the structure of \u0394508 CFTR is unknown. Here, we present cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of \u0394508 CFTR in the absence and presence of CFTR modulators. When used alone, elexacaftor partially rectified interdomain assembly defects in \u0394508 CFTR, but when combined with a type I corrector, did so fully.

We found that hyperexcitable hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/OX) neurons drive sleep fragmentation during aging. In aged mice, Hcrt neurons exhibited more frequent neuronal activity epochs driving wake bouts, and optogenetic activation of Hcrt neurons elicited more prolonged wakefulness. Aged Hcrt neurons showed hyperexcitability with lower KCNQ2 expression and impaired M-current, mediated by KCNQ2/3 channels. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed adaptive changes to Hcrt neuron loss in the aging brain. Disruption of Kcnq2/3 genes in Hcrt neurons of young mice destabilized sleep, mimicking aging-associated sleep fragmentation, whereas the KCNQ-selective activator flupirtine hyperpolarized Hcrt neurons and rejuvenated sleep architecture in aged mice. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism underlying sleep instability during aging and a strategy to improve sleep continuity.",

Although discrete time crystals have been extensively studied in periodically driven systems, the experimental realization of a continuous time crystal is still pending. We report the observation of a limit cycle phase in a continuously pumped dissipative atom-cavity system that is characterized by emergent oscillations in the intracavity photon number. The phase of the oscillation was found to be random for different realizations, and hence, this dynamical many-body state breaks continuous time translation symmetry spontaneously. Furthermore, the observed limit cycles are robust against temporal perturbations and therefore demonstrate the realization of a continuous time crystal.",

The magnitude of the stress depends on the type and amount of mineral. Using in-operando synchrotron x-ray scattering, we analyzed the kinetics of mineral deposition. Whereas no contraction occurs when the mineral deposits outside fibrils only, intrafibrillar mineralization generates fibril contraction. This chemomechanical effect occurs with collagen fully immersed in water and generates a mineral-collagen composite with tensile fibers, reminiscent of the principle of reinforced concrete.",

Using in situ electron microscopy, we imaged the straight channels of ZSM-5 zeolite with benzene as a probe molecule and observed subcell flexibility of the framework. The opening pores stretched along the longest direction of confined benzene molecules with a maximum aspect change of 15%, and the Pnma space group symmetry of the MFI framework caused adjacent channels to deform. This compensation maintained the stability and rigidity of the overall unit cell within 0.5% deformation. The subcell flexibility originates mainly from the topologically soft silicon-oxygen-silicon hinges between rigid tetrahedral SiO 4 units, with inner angles varying from 135\u00b0 to 153\u00b0, as confirmed by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.",

An attractive strategy is to repurpose developmental BBB regulators, such as Wnt7a, into BBB-protective agents. However, safe therapeutic use of Wnt ligands is complicated by their pleiotropic Frizzled signaling activities. Taking advantage of the Wnt7a/b-specific Gpr124/Reck co-receptor complex, we genetically engineered Wnt7a ligands into BBB-specific Wnt activators. In a \u201chit-and-run\u201d adeno-associated virus\u2013assisted CNS gene delivery setting, these new Gpr124/Reck-specific agonists protected BBB function, thereby mitigating glioblastoma expansion and ischemic stroke infarction. This work reveals that the signaling specificity of Wnt ligands is adjustable and defines a modality to treat CNS disorders by normalizing the BBB.",

    "abstract": "Investment in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequencing in Africa over the past year has led to a major increase in the number of sequences that have been generated and used to track the pandemic on the continent, a number that now exceeds 100,000 genomes. Our results show an increase in the number of African countries that are able to sequence domestically and highlight that local sequencing enables faster turnaround times and more-regular routine surveillance. Despite limitations of low testing proportions, findings from this genomic surveillance study underscore the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic and illuminate the distinct dispersal dynamics of variants of concern\u2014particularly Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron\u2014on the continent. Sustained investment for diagnostics and genomic surveillance in Africa is needed as the virus continues to evolve while the continent faces many emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats. These investments are crucial for pandemic preparedness and response and will serve the health of the continent well into the 21st century.",

The mechanisms by which this cycle is generated are incompletely understood. We found that a transient increase of dopamine (DA) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during NREM sleep terminates NREM sleep and initiates REM sleep. DA acts on dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2)\u2013expressing neurons in the BLA to induce the NREM-to-REM transition. This mechanism also plays a role in cataplectic attacks\u2014a pathological intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness\u2014in narcoleptics. These results show a critical role of DA signaling in the BLA in initiating REM sleep and provide a neuronal basis for sleep cycle generation.",

We analyzed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and its dynamics in England from the end of November to mid-December 2021 among almost 100,000 participants in the REACT-1 study. Prevalence was high with rapid growth nationally and particularly in London during December 2021, with an increasing proportion of infections due to Omicron. We observed large decreases in swab positivity among mostly vaccinated older children (12 to 17 years) relative to unvaccinated younger children (5 to 11 years), and in adults who received a third (booster) vaccine dose versus two doses. Our results reinforce the importance of vaccination and booster campaigns, although additional measures have been needed to control the rapid growth of the Omicron variant.",

    "abstract": "Postmeiotic spermatids use a unique strategy to coordinate gene expression with morphological transformation, in which transcription and translation take place at separate developmental stages, but how mRNAs stored as translationally inert messenger ribonucleoproteins in developing spermatids become activated remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the RNA binding protein FXR1, a member of the fragile X\u2013related (FXR) family, is highly expressed in late spermatids and undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to merge messenger ribonucleoprotein granules with the translation machinery to convert stored mRNAs into a translationally activated state. Germline-specific Fxr1 ablation in mice impaired the translation of target mRNAs and caused defective spermatid development and male infertility, and a phase separation\u2013deficient FXR1 L351P mutation in Fxr1 knock-in mice produced the same developmental defect. These findings uncover a mechanism for translational reprogramming with LLPS as a key driver in spermiogenesis.",

We discerned the physical origins of fatigue strength in a large set of face-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and body-centered cubic metallic materials by considering cyclic deformation processes at nanometer resolution over large volumes of individual materials at the earliest stages of cycling. We identified quantitative relations between the yield strength and the ultimate tensile strength, fatigue strength, and physical characteristics of early slip localization events. The fatigue strength of metallic alloys that deform by slip could be predicted by the amplitude of slip localization during the first cycle of loading. Our observations provide a physical basis for well-known empirical fatigue laws and enable a rapid method of predicting fatigue strength as reflected by measurement of slip localization amplitude.",

The direct allylic C\u2013H amination of alkenes serves as the most straightforward method toward these motifs. However, use of widely available internal alkenes with aliphatic amines in this transformation remains a synthetic challenge. In particular, palladium catalysis faces the twin challenges of inefficient coordination of Pd(II) to internal alkenes but excessively tight and therefore inhibitory coordination of Pd(II) by basic aliphatic amines. We report a general solution to these problems. The developed protocol, in contrast to a classical Pd(II/0) scenario, operates through a blue light\u2013induced Pd(0/I/II) manifold with mild aryl bromide oxidant. This open-shell approach also enables enantio- and diastereoselective allylic C\u2013H amination.",

We report on the thickness-dependent antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition in zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2 ) thin films on silicon. The emergent ferroelectricity and hysteretic polarization switching in ultrathin ZrO 2 , conventionally a paraelectric material, notably persists down to a film thickness of 5 angstroms, the fluorite-structure unit-cell size. This approach to exploit three-dimensional centrosymmetric materials deposited down to the two-dimensional thickness limit, particularly within this model fluorite-structure system that possesses unconventional ferroelectric size effects, offers substantial promise for electronics, demonstrated by proof-of-principle atomic-scale nonvolatile ferroelectric memory on silicon. Additionally, it is also indicative of hidden electronic phenomena that are achievable across a wide class of simple binary materials.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Cytoplasmic face of the human NPC. Near-atomic composite structure of the NPC generated by docking high-resolution crystal structures into a cryo\u2011ET reconstruction of an intact human NPC. The symmetric core, embedded in the nuclear envelope, is decorated with NUP358 (red) domains bound to Ran (gray), flexibly projected into the cytoplasm, and CFNCs (pink) overlooking the central transport channel. The subcellular compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells requires selective transport of folded proteins and protein\u2013nucleic acid complexes. Embedded in nuclear envelope pores, which are generated by the circumscribed fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the sole bidirectional gateways for nucleocytoplasmic transport. The ~110-MDa human NPC is an ~1000-protein assembly that comprises multiple copies of ~34 different proteins, collectively termed nucleoporins. The symmetric core of the NPC is composed of an inner ring encircling the central transport channel and outer rings formed by Y\u2011shaped coat nucleoporin complexes (CNCs) anchored atop both sides of the nuclear envelope. The outer rings are decorated with compartment\u2011specific asymmetric nuclear basket and cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins, which establish transport directionality and provide docking sites for transport factors and the small guanosine triphosphatase Ran. The cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins also play an essential role in the irreversible remodeling of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) as they exit the central transport channel. Unsurprisingly, the NPC\u2019s cytoplasmic face represents a hotspot for disease\u2011associated mutations and is commonly targeted by viral virulence factors. RATIONALE Previous studies established a near-atomic composite structure of the human NPC\u2019s symmetric core by combining (i) biochemical reconstitution to elucidate the interaction network between symmetric nucleoporins, (ii) crystal and single-particle cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure determination of nucleoporins and nucleoporin complexes to reveal their three-dimensional shape and the molecular details of their interactions, (iii) quantitative docking in cryo\u2013electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps of the intact human NPC to uncover nucleoporin stoichiometry and positioning, and (iv) cell\u2011based assays to validate the physiological relevance of the biochemical and structural findings. In this work, we extended our approach to the cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins to reveal the near-atomic architecture of the cytoplasmic face of the human NPC. RESULTS Using biochemical reconstitution, we elucidated the protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction networks of the human and Chaetomium thermophilum cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins, establishing an evolutionarily conserved heterohexameric cytoplasmic filament nucleoporin complex (CFNC) held together by a central heterotrimeric coiled\u2011coil hub that tethers two separate mRNP\u2011remodeling complexes. Further biochemical analysis and determination of a series of crystal structures revealed that the metazoan\u2011specific cytoplasmic filament nucleoporin NUP358 is composed of 16 distinct domains, including an N\u2011terminal S\u2011shaped \u03b1\u2011helical solenoid followed by a coiled\u2011coil oligomerization element, numerous Ran\u2011interacting domains, an E3 ligase domain, and a C\u2011terminal prolyl\u2011isomerase domain. Physiologically validated quantitative docking into cryo-ET maps of the intact human NPC revealed that pentameric NUP358 bundles, conjoined by the oligomerization element, are anchored through their N\u2011terminal domains to the central stalk regions of the CNC, projecting flexibly attached domains as far as ~600 \u00c5 into the cytoplasm. Using cell\u2011based assays, we demonstrated that NUP358 is dispensable for the architectural integrity of the assembled interphase NPC and RNA export but is required for efficient translation. After NUP358 assignment, the remaining 4-shaped cryo\u2011ET density matched the dimensions of the CFNC coiled\u2011coil hub, in close proximity to an outer-ring NUP93. Whereas the N-terminal NUP93 assembly sensor motif anchors the properly assembled related coiled\u2011coil channel nucleoporin heterotrimer to the inner ring, biochemical reconstitution confirmed that the NUP93 assembly sensor is reused in anchoring the CFNC to the cytoplasmic face of the human NPC. By contrast, two C. thermophilum CFNCs are anchored by a divergent mechanism that involves assembly sensors located in unstructured portions of two CNC nucleoporins. Whereas unassigned cryo\u2011ET density occupies the NUP358 and CFNC binding sites on the nuclear face, docking of the nuclear basket component ELYS established that the equivalent position on the cytoplasmic face is unoccupied, suggesting that mechanisms other than steric competition promote asymmetric distribution of nucleoporins. CONCLUSION We have substantially advanced the biochemical and structural characterization of the asymmetric nucleoporins\u2019 architecture and attachment at the cytoplasmic and nuclear faces of the NPC. Our near\u2011atomic composite structure of the human NPC\u2019s cytoplasmic face provides a biochemical and structural framework for elucidating the molecular basis of mRNP remodeling, viral virulence factor interference with NPC function, and the underlying mechanisms of nucleoporin diseases at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC.",

To date, the global picture of their distribution and relative natural and anthropogenic contributions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing 563,705 Sentinel-1 images from 2014\u20132019, we provide the first global map of oil slicks and a detailed inventory of static-and-persistent sources (natural seeps, platforms, and pipelines). About 90% of oil slicks were within 160 kilometers of shorelines, with 21 high-density slick belts coinciding well with shipping routes. Quantified by slick area, the proportion of anthropogenic discharges was an order of magnitude greater than natural seepages (94 versus 6%), in contrast to the previous estimate quantified by volume during 1990\u20131999 (54 versus 46%). Our findings reveal that the present-day anthropogenic contribution to marine oil pollution may have been substantially underestimated.",

Previous assessments of resilience to sea level rise, to which marshes can adjust by sediment accretion and elevation gain, revealed contrasting results, depending on contemporary or Holocene geological data. By analyzing globally distributed contemporary data, we found that marsh sediment accretion increases in parity with sea level rise, seemingly confirming previously claimed marsh resilience.

In this work, we filled a commercial polyimide with ultrahigh loadings of a high\u2013aspect ratio, CO 2 -philic Na-SSZ-39 zeolite with a three-dimensional channel system that precisely separates gas molecules. By carefully designing both zeolite and MMM synthesis, we created a gas-percolation highway across a flexible and aging-resistant (more than 1 year) membrane.

Progress in engineering plant roots to optimize water and nutrient acquisition has been limited by our capacity to design and build genetic programs that alter root growth in a predictable manner. We developed a collection of synthetic transcriptional regulators for plants that can be compiled to create genetic circuits. These circuits control gene expression by performing Boolean logic operations and can be used to predictably alter root structure. This work demonstrates the potential of synthetic genetic circuits to control gene expression across tissues and reprogram plant growth.",

    "abstract": "Covalently bonded ceramics exhibit preeminent properties\u2014including hardness, strength, chemical inertness, and resistance against heat and corrosion\u2014yet their wider application is challenging because of their room-temperature brittleness. In contrast to the atoms in metals that can slide along slip planes to accommodate strains, the atoms in covalently bonded ceramics require bond breaking because of the strong and directional characteristics of covalent bonds. This eventually leads to catastrophic failure on loading. We present an approach for designing deformable covalently bonded silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) ceramics that feature a dual-phase structure with coherent interfaces. Successive bond switching is realized at the coherent interfaces, which facilitates a stress-induced phase transformation and, eventually, generates plastic deformability.",

    "abstract": "Cellular solids (e.g., foams and honeycombs) are widely found in natural and engineering systems because of their high mechanical efficiency and tailorable properties. While these materials are often based on polycrystalline or amorphous constituents, here we report an unusual dual-scale, single-crystalline microlattice found in the biomineralized skeleton of the knobby starfish, Protoreaster nodosus . This structure has a diamond-triply periodic minimal surface geometry (lattice constant, approximately 30 micrometers), the [111] direction of which is aligned with the c -axis of the constituent calcite at the atomic scale. This dual-scale crystallographically coaligned microlattice, which exhibits lattice-level structural gradients and dislocations, combined with the atomic-level conchoidal fracture behavior of biogenic calcite, substantially enhances the damage tolerance of this hierarchical biological microlattice, thus providing important insights for designing synthetic architected cellular solids.",

    "abstract": "The observation of genetic correlations between disparate human traits has been interpreted as evidence of widespread pleiotropy. Here, we introduce cross-trait assortative mating (xAM) as an alternative explanation. We observe that xAM affects many phenotypes and that phenotypic cross-mate correlation estimates are strongly associated with genetic correlation estimates ( R 2 = 74%). We demonstrate that existing xAM plausibly accounts for substantial fractions of genetic correlation estimates and that previously reported genetic correlation estimates between some pairs of psychiatric disorders are congruent with xAM alone. Finally, we provide evidence for a history of xAM at the genetic level using cross-trait even/odd chromosome polygenic score correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that previous reports have likely overestimated the true genetic similarity between many phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare and severe condition that follows benign COVID-19. We report autosomal recessive deficiencies of OAS1 , OAS2 , or RNASEL in five unrelated children with MIS-C. The cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)\u2013sensing OAS1 and OAS2 generate 2\u2032-5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) that activate the single-stranded RNA\u2013degrading ribonuclease L (RNase L). Monocytic cell lines and primary myeloid cells with OAS1, OAS2, or RNase L deficiencies produce excessive amounts of inflammatory cytokines upon dsRNA or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) stimulation. Exogenous 2-5A suppresses cytokine production in OAS1-deficient but not RNase L\u2013deficient cells. Cytokine production in RNase L\u2013deficient cells is impaired by MDA5 or RIG-I deficiency and abolished by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) deficiency. Recessive OAS\u2013RNase L deficiencies in these patients unleash the production of SARS-CoV-2\u2013triggered, MAVS-mediated inflammatory cytokines by mononuclear phagocytes, thereby underlying MIS-C.",

    "abstract": "Piezoelectrics are materials that linearly deform in response to an applied electric field. As a fundamental prerequisite, piezoelectric materials must have a noncentrosymmetric crystal structure. For more than a century, this has remained a major obstacle for finding piezoelectric materials. We circumvented this limitation by breaking the crystallographic symmetry and inducing large and sustainable piezoelectric effects in centrosymmetric materials by the electric field\u2013induced rearrangement of oxygen vacancies. Our results show the generation of extraordinarily large piezoelectric responses [with piezoelectric strain coefficients ( d 33 ) of ~200,000 picometers per volt at millihertz frequencies] in cubic fluorite gadolinium-doped CeO 2\u2212 x films, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the responses observed in the presently best-known lead-based piezoelectric relaxor\u2013ferroelectric oxide at kilohertz frequencies. These findings provide opportunities to design piezoelectric materials from environmentally friendly centrosymmetric ones.",

    "abstract": "The inflammasome-mediated cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) causes pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release to control pathogen infection, but how pathogens evade this immune response remains largely unexplored. Here we identify the known protein phosphatase PtpB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a phospholipid phosphatase inhibiting the host inflammasome-pyroptosis pathway. Mechanistically, PtpB dephosphorylated phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate in host cell membrane, thus disrupting the membrane localization of the cleaved GSDMD to inhibit cytokine release and pyroptosis of macrophages. Notably, this phosphatase activity requires PtpB binding to ubiquitin. Disrupting phospholipid phosphatase activity or the ubiquitin-interacting motif of PtpB enhanced host GSDMD-dependent immune responses and reduced intracellular pathogen survival. Thus, pathogens inhibit pyroptosis and counteract host immunity by altering host membrane composition.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary development of the human brain is characterized by the expansion of various brain regions. Here, we show that developmental processes specific to humans are responsible for malformations of cortical development (MCDs), which result in developmental delay and epilepsy in children. We generated a human cerebral organoid model for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and identified a specific neural stem cell type, caudal late interneuron progenitor (CLIP) cells. In TSC, CLIP cells over-proliferate, generating excessive interneurons, brain tumors, and cortical malformations. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition reduces tumor burden, identifying potential treatment options for TSC and related disorders. The identification of CLIP cells reveals the extended interneuron generation in the human brain as a vulnerability for disease. In addition, this work demonstrates that analyzing MCDs can reveal fundamental insights into human-specific aspects of brain development.",

The step change in efficiency of this approach is exemplified through the scalable preparation of 13 complex terpenes, which minimized protecting group manipulations, functional group interconversions, and redox fluctuations.

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remain without effective therapies. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is a potential therapeutic target, but conflicting interpretations have been proposed for how mTORC1 controls lipid homeostasis. We show that selective inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in mice, through deletion of the RagC/D guanosine triphosphatase\u2013activating protein folliculin (FLCN), promotes activation of transcription factor E3 (TFE3) in the liver without affecting other mTORC1 targets and protects against NAFLD and NASH. Disease protection is mediated by TFE3, which both induces lipid consumption and suppresses anabolic lipogenesis. TFE3 inhibits lipogenesis by suppressing proteolytic processing and activation of sterol regulatory element\u2013binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and by interacting with SREBP-1c on chromatin. Our data reconcile previously conflicting studies and identify selective inhibition of mTORC1 as a potential approach to treat NASH and NAFLD.",

Using high-resolution spatial analysis of global drylands, we found 448 million hectares suitable for afforestation. This area\u2019s carbon sequestration potential until 2100 is 32.3 billion tons of carbon (Gt C), but 22.6 Gt C of that is required to balance albedo effects. The net carbon equivalent would offset ~1% of projected medium-emissions and business-as-usual scenarios over the same period. Focusing forestation only on areas with net cooling effects would use half the area and double the emissions offset. Although such smart forestation is clearly important, its limited climatic benefits reinforce the need to reduce emissions rapidly.",

However, the northern Tibet Plateau (NTP) remains poorly investigated. We use pollen records of montane conifers ( Tsuga , Podocarpus , Abies , and Picea ) as a new paleoaltimetry to construct two parallel midrange paleoelevation sequences in the NTP at 1332 \u00b1 189 m and 433 \u00b1 189 m, respectively, during the Middle Miocene [~15 million years ago (Ma)]. Both midranges increased rapidly to 3685 \u00b1 87 m in the Late Miocene (~11 Ma) in the east, and to 3589 \u00b1 62 m at ~7 Ma in the west. Our estimated rises in the east and west parts of the NTP during 15 to 7 Ma, together with data from other TP regions, indicate that during the Late Miocene the entire plateau may have reached a high elevation close to that of today, with consequent impacts on atmospheric precipitation and alpine biodiversity.",

The immunological profiles of these people depended on how often the subject had encountered antigen and which variant was involved. Vaccine responses after infection were found to be less effective if the infection involved heterologous spike from a variant virus. Unfortunately, the N501Y spike mutation, found in many variants, seems to induce the regulatory T cell transcription factor FOXP3, indicating that the virus could subvert effective T cell function. Changes to antibody binding between variants also means that serology data using the Wuhan Hu-1 S1 receptor-binding domain sequence may not be a reliable measure of protection. \u2014CA",

Using cryo\u2013electron microscopy, we obtained structures of the RNAPII elongation complex (EC) passing through a nucleosome in the presence of the transcription elongation factors Spt6, Spn1, Elf1, Spt4/5, and Paf1C and the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription). The structures show snapshots of EC progression on DNA mediating downstream nucleosome disassembly, followed by its reassembly upstream of the EC, which is facilitated by FACT. FACT dynamically adapts to successively occurring subnucleosome intermediates, forming an interface with the EC. Spt6, Spt4/5, and Paf1C form a \u201ccradle\u201d at the EC DNA-exit site and support the upstream nucleosome reassembly. These structures explain the mechanism by which the EC traverses nucleosomes while maintaining the chromatin structure and epigenetic information.",

Here, we integrated ultra-low-input ribosome profiling (Ribo-lite) with messenger RNA sequencing to co-profile the translatome and transcriptome in human oocytes and early embryos. Comparison with mouse counterparts identified widespread differentially translated gene functioning in epigenetic reprogramming, transposon defense, and small RNA biogenesis, in part driven by species-specific regulatory elements in 3\u2032 untranslated regions. Moreover, PRD-like homeobox transcription factors, including TPRXL , TPRX1 , and TPRX2 , are highly translated around ZGA. TPRX1/2/L knockdown leads to defective ZGA and preimplantation development. Ectopically expressed TPRXs bind and activate key ZGA genes in human embryonic stem cells. These data reveal the conservation and divergence of translation landscapes during OET and identify critical regulators of human ZGA.",

Using geostationary satellite images of the 15 January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai volcano, we find that the volcanic plume produced by this volcano reached an altitude of 57 kilometers at its highest extent. This places the plume in the lower mesosphere and provides observational evidence of a volcanic eruption injecting material through the stratosphere and directly into the mesosphere. We then discuss potential implications of this injection and suggest that the altitude reached by plumes from previous eruptions, such as the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, may have been underestimated because of a lack of observational data.",

We used the Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) instrument to perform deep-ultraviolet Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy of three rocks within the crater. We identify evidence for two distinct ancient aqueous environments at different times. Reactions with liquid water formed carbonates in an olivine-rich igneous rock. A sulfate-perchlorate mixture is present in the rocks, which probably formed by later modifications of the rocks by brine. Fluorescence signatures consistent with aromatic organic compounds occur throughout these rocks and are preserved in minerals related to both aqueous environments.",

    "abstract": "The cilium is an antenna-like organelle that performs numerous cellular functions, including motility, sensing, and signaling. The base of the cilium contains a selective barrier that regulates the entry of large intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains, which carry cargo proteins required for ciliary assembly and maintenance. However, the native architecture of the ciliary base and the process of IFT train assembly remain unresolved. In this work, we used in situ cryo\u2013electron tomography to reveal native structures of the transition zone region and assembling IFT trains at the ciliary base in Chlamydomonas . We combined this direct cellular visualization with ultrastructure expansion microscopy to describe the front-to-back stepwise assembly of IFT trains: IFT-B forms the backbone, onto which bind IFT-A, dynein-1b, and finally kinesin-2 before entry into the cilium.",

We found that NUMA (nuclear mitotic apparatus protein)\u2013mediated clustering of microtubule minus ends focused the spindle poles in human, bovine, and porcine oocytes and in mouse oocytes depleted of acentriolar microtubule-organizing centers (aMTOCs). However, unlike human oocytes, bovine, porcine, and aMTOC-free mouse oocytes have stable spindles. We identified the molecular motor KIFC1 (kinesin superfamily protein C1) as a spindle-stabilizing protein that is deficient in human oocytes. Depletion of KIFC1 recapitulated spindle instability in bovine and aMTOC-free mouse oocytes, and the introduction of exogenous KIFC1 rescued spindle instability in human oocytes. Thus, the deficiency of KIFC1 contributes to spindle instability in human oocytes.",

The cloned gene is named TaCOL-B5 and encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that is orthologous to COL5 in plant species. Constitutive overexpression of the dominant TaCol-B5 allele but without the region encoding B-boxes in a common wheat cultivar increases the number of spikelet nodes per spike and produces more tillers and spikes, thereby enhancing grain yield in transgenic plants under field conditions. Allelic variation in TaCOL-B5 results in amino acid substitutions leading to differential protein phosphorylation by the protein kinase Ta K4.

Preserving this efficiency in scale-up from cell to stack level poses challenges to the distribution of heat and gas flows and electric current throughout a robust functional design. Here, we demonstrate a 36-cell well-balanced reactor stack enabled by a new interconnect that achieves complete conversion of methane with more than 99% recovery to pressurized hydrogen, leaving a concentrated stream of carbon dioxide. Comparable cell performance was also achieved with ammonia, and the operation was confirmed at pressures exceeding 140 bars. The stacking of proton ceramic reactors into practical thermo-electrochemical devices demonstrates their potential in efficient hydrogen production.",

    "abstract": "Human NLRP1 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 1) is an innate immune sensor predominantly expressed in the skin and airway epithelium. Here, we report that human NLRP1 senses the ultraviolet B (UVB)- and toxin-induced ribotoxic stress response (RSR). Biochemically, RSR leads to the direct hyperphosphorylation of a human-specific disordered linker region of NLRP1 (NLRP1 DR ) by MAP3K20/ZAK\u03b1 kinase and its downstream effector, p38. Mutating a single ZAK\u03b1 phosphorylation site in NLRP1 DR abrogates UVB- and ribotoxin-driven pyroptosis in human keratinocytes. Moreover, fusing NLRP1 DR to CARD8, which is insensitive to RSR by itself, creates a minimal inflammasome sensor for UVB and ribotoxins. These results provide insight into UVB sensing by human skin keratinocytes, identify several ribotoxins as NLRP1 agonists, and establish inflammasome-driven pyroptosis as an integral component of the RSR.",

Conversely, restricting feeding to the active period mitigates metabolic syndrome through mechanisms that remain unknown. We found that genetic enhancement of adipocyte thermogenesis through ablation of the zinc finger protein 423 (ZFP423) attenuated obesity caused by consumption of a high-fat diet during the inactive (light) period by increasing futile creatine cycling in mice. Circadian control of adipocyte creatine metabolism underlies the timing of diet-induced thermogenesis, and enhancement of adipocyte circadian rhythms through overexpression of the clock activator brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1) ameliorated metabolic complications during diet-induced obesity. These findings uncover rhythmic creatine-mediated thermogenesis as an essential mechanism that drives metabolic benefits during time-restricted feeding.",

Here, we present the primary structures of ~30,000 unique proteoforms, nearly 10 times more than in previous studies, expressed from 1690 human genes across 21 cell types and plasma from human blood and bone marrow. The results, compiled in the Blood Proteoform Atlas (BPA), indicate that proteoforms better describe protein-level biology and are more specific indicators of differentiation than their corresponding proteins, which are more broadly expressed across cell types. We demonstrate the potential for clinical application, by interrogating the BPA in the context of liver transplantation and identifying cell and proteoform signatures that distinguish normal graft function from acute rejection and other causes of graft dysfunction.",

We developed an alternative strategy to isolate TCR mutants that exhibited high activation signals coupled with low-affinity pMHC binding through the acquisition of catch bonds. Engineered analogs of a tumor antigen MAGE-A3\u2013specific TCR maintained physiological affinities while exhibiting enhanced target killing potency and undetectable cross-reactivity, compared with a high-affinity clinically tested TCR that exhibited lethal cross-reactivity with a cardiac antigen.

    "abstract": "Large volcanic eruptions, although rare events, can influence the chemistry and the dynamics of the stratosphere for several years after the eruption. Here we show that the eruption of the submarine volcano Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai on 15 January 2022 injected at least 50 teragrams of water vapor directly into the stratosphere. This event raised the amount of water vapor in the developing stratospheric plume by several orders of magnitude and possibly increased the amount of global stratospheric water vapor by more than 5%. This extraordinary eruption may have initiated an atmospheric response different from that of previous well-studied large volcanic eruptions.",

    "abstract": "Flaring is widely used by the fossil fuel industry to dispose of natural gas. Industry and governments generally assume that flares remain lit and destroy methane, the predominant component of natural gas, with 98% efficiency. Neither assumption, however, is based on real-world observations. We calculate flare efficiency using airborne sampling across three basins responsible for >80% of US flaring and combine these observations with unlit flare prevalence surveys. We find that both unlit flares and inefficient combustion contribute comparably to ineffective methane destruction, with flares effectively destroying only 91.1% (90.2, 91.8; 95% confidence interval) of methane. This represents a fivefold increase in methane emissions above present assumptions and constitutes 4 to 10% of total US oil and gas methane emissions, highlighting a previously underappreciated methane source and mitigation opportunity.",

Elucidating this interplay is crucial for discerning and designing gene regulatory systems. We quantitatively characterized gene-specific and systemic factors that affect transcription and translation genome-wide for Escherichia coli across many conditions. The results revealed two design principles that make regulation of gene expression insulated from concentrations of shared machineries: RNA polymerase activity is fine-tuned to match translational output, and translational characteristics are similar across most messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Consequently, in bacteria, protein concentration is set primarily at the promoter level. A simple mathematical formula relates promoter activities and protein concentrations across growth conditions, enabling quantitative inference of gene regulation from omics data.",

    "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a critical host resistance factor against tuberculosis. However, excess TNF produces susceptibility by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS), which initiate a signaling cascade to cause pathogenic necrosis of mycobacterium-infected macrophages. In zebrafish, we identified the mechanism of TNF-induced mROS in tuberculosis. Excess TNF in mycobacterium-infected macrophages elevates mROS production by reverse electron transport (RET) through complex I. TNF-activated cellular glutamine uptake leads to an increased concentration of succinate, a Krebs cycle intermediate. Oxidation of this elevated succinate by complex II drives RET, thereby generating the mROS superoxide at complex I. The complex I inhibitor metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug, prevents TNF-induced mROS and necrosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis \u2013infected zebrafish and human macrophages; metformin may therefore be useful in tuberculosis therapy.",

At charge neutrality, we observed a field-tuned continuous quantum phase transition from a valley-polarized state to an intervalley coherent state, with a Kekul\u00e9 distortion of its electronic density. Mapping the valley texture extracted from STS measurements of the Kekul\u00e9 phase, we could visualize valley skyrmion excitations localized near charged defects.

In cells, glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with \u03b1-synuclein (aSyn). In induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived neurons, loss of GPNMB resulted in loss of ability to internalize aSyn fibrils and develop aSyn pathology. In 731 PD and 59 control biosamples, GPNMB was elevated in PD plasma, associating with disease severity. Thus, GPNMB represents a PD risk gene with potential for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting.",

However, where and how mammalian oocytes store maternal mRNAs is unclear. Here, we report that mammalian oocytes accumulate mRNAs in a mitochondria-associated ribonucleoprotein domain (MARDO). MARDO assembly around mitochondria was promoted by the RNA-binding protein ZAR1 and directed by an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential during oocyte growth. MARDO foci coalesced into hydrogel-like matrices that clustered mitochondria. Maternal mRNAs stored in the MARDO were translationally repressed. Loss of ZAR1 disrupted the MARDO, dispersed mitochondria, and caused a premature loss of MARDO-localized mRNAs. Thus, a mitochondria-associated membraneless compartment controls mitochondrial distribution and regulates maternal mRNA storage, translation, and decay to ensure fertility in mammals.",

Underground lateral roots initiate from prepatterned cells in the main root, but cells can also bypass the root-shoot trajectory separation and generate shoot-borne roots through an unknown mechanism. We mapped tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) shoot-borne root development at single-cell resolution and showed that these roots initiate from phloem-associated cells through a unique transition state. This state requires the activity of a transcription factor that we named SHOOTBORNE ROOTLESS ( SBRL ) . Evolutionary analysis reveals that SBRL \u2019s function and cis regulation are conserved in angiosperms and that it arose as an ancient duplication, with paralogs controlling wound-induced and lateral root initiation. We propose that the activation of a common transition state by context-specific regulators underlies the plasticity of plant root systems.",

Two Eigen cations could combine into one Zundel cation accompanied with a simultaneous proton transfer to the surface.

By applying this technique to the existing undersea communication cables, which have a repeater-to-repeater span length of 45 to 90 kilometers, the largely unmonitored ocean floor could be instrumented with thousands of permanent real-time environmental sensors without changes to the underwater infrastructure.",

As the number of layers increases, superconductivity emerges over an enhanced filling-factor range, and in the pentalayer it extends well beyond the filling of four electrons per moir\u00e9 unit cell. Our results highlight the role of the interplay between flat and more dispersive bands in extending superconducting regions in graphene moir\u00e9 superlattices.",

    "abstract": "Relaxor-lead titanate (PbTiO 3 ) crystals, which exhibit extremely high piezoelectricity, are believed to possess high electro-optic (EO) coefficients. However, the optical transparency of relaxor-PbTiO 3 crystals is severely reduced as a result of light scattering and reflection by domain walls, limiting electro-optic applications. Through synergistic design of a ferroelectric phase, crystal orientation, and poling technique, we successfully removed all light-scattering domain walls and achieved an extremely high transmittance of 99.6% in antireflection film\u2013coated crystals, with an ultrahigh EO coefficient r 33 of 900 picometers per volt (pm V \u22121 ), >30 times as high as that of conventionally used EO crystals. Using these crystals, we fabricated ultracompact EO Q-switches that require very low driving voltages, with superior performance to that of commercial Q-switches. Development of these materials is important for the portability and low driving voltage of EO devices.",

We show that v-cADPR (2\u2032cADPR) and v2-cADPR (3\u2032cADPR) isomers are cyclized by O-glycosidic bond formation between the ribose moieties in ADPR. Structures of 2\u2032cADPR-producing TIR domains reveal conformational changes that lead to an active assembly that resembles those of Toll-like receptor adaptor TIR domains. Mutagenesis reveals a conserved tryptophan that is essential for cyclization. We show that 3\u2032cADPR is an activator of ThsA effector proteins from the bacterial antiphage defense system termed Thoeris and a suppressor of plant immunity when produced by the effector HopAM1. Collectively, our results reveal the molecular basis of cADPR isomer production and establish 3\u2032cADPR in bacteria as an antiviral and plant immunity\u2013suppressing signaling molecule.",

    "abstract": "Life begins with a switch in genetic control from the maternal to the embryonic genome during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Despite its importance, the essential regulators of ZGA remain largely unknown in mammals. On the basis of de novo motif searches, we identified the orphan nuclear receptor Nr5a2 as a key activator of major ZGA in mouse two-cell embryos. Nr5a2 is required for progression beyond the two-cell stage. It binds to its motif within SINE B1/Alu retrotransposable elements found in cis-regulatory regions of ZGA genes. Chemical inhibition suggests that 72% of ZGA genes are regulated by Nr5a2 and potentially other orphan nuclear receptors. Nr5a2 promotes chromatin accessibility during ZGA and binds nucleosomal DNA in vitro. We conclude that Nr5a2 is an essential pioneer factor that regulates ZGA.",

In Arabidopsis thaliana , the block to polyspermy is facilitated by a mechanism that prevents polytubey (the arrival of multiple pollen tubes to one ovule). We show here that FERONIA, ANJEA, and HERCULES RECEPTOR KINASE 1 receptor-like kinases located at the septum interact with pollen tube\u2013specific RALF6, 7, 16, 36, and 37 peptide ligands to establish this polytubey block. The same combination of RALF (rapid alkalinization factor) peptides and receptor complexes controls pollen tube reception and rupture inside the targeted ovule. Pollen tube rupture releases the polytubey block at the septum, which allows the emergence of secondary pollen tubes upon fertilization failure. Thus, orchestrated steps in the fertilization process in Arabidopsis are coordinated by the same signaling components to guarantee and optimize reproductive success.",

We found that intestinal ILC3s persist for months in an activated state after exposure to Citrobacter rodentium . Upon rechallenge, these \u201ctrained\u201d ILC3s proliferate, display enhanced interleukin-22 (IL-22) responses, and have a superior capacity to control infection compared with na\u00efve ILC3s. Metabolic changes occur in C. rodentium \u2013exposed ILC3s, but only trained ILC3s have an enhanced proliferative capacity that contributes to increased IL-22 production. Accordingly, a limited encounter with a pathogen can promote durable phenotypic and functional changes in intestinal ILC3s that contribute to long-term mucosal defense.",

Real trilayer samples undergo a strong reconstruction of the moir\u00e9 lattice, which locks layers into near\u2013magic-angle, mirror symmetric domains comparable in size with the superconducting coherence length. This relaxation introduces an array of localized twist-angle faults, termed twistons and moir\u00e9 solitons, whose electronic structure deviates strongly from the background regions, leading to a doping-dependent, spatially granular electronic landscape. The Fermi-level density of states is maximally uniform at dopings for which superconductivity has been observed in transport measurements.",

Using forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice ( Peromyscus maniculatus ), we characterized the genetic basis of variation in two defining traits\u2014tail length and coat color\u2014and discovered a 41-megabase chromosomal inversion linked to both. The inversion frequency is 90% in the dark, long-tailed forest ecotype; decreases across a habitat transition; and is absent from the light, short-tailed prairie ecotype. We implicate divergent selection in maintaining the inversion at frequencies observed in the wild, despite high levels of gene flow, and explore fitness benefits that arise from suppressed recombination within the inversion. We uncover a key role for a large, previously uncharacterized inversion in the evolution and maintenance of classic mammalian ecotypes.",

Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we identified mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2), and its paralog MTCH1, and showed that it is required for insertion of biophysically diverse tail-anchored (TA), signal-anchored, and multipass proteins, but not outer membrane \u03b2-barrel proteins. Purified MTCH2 was sufficient to mediate insertion into reconstituted proteoliposomes. Functional and mutational studies suggested that MTCH2 has evolved from a solute carrier transporter. MTCH2 uses membrane-embedded hydrophilic residues to function as a gatekeeper for the outer membrane, controlling mislocalization of TAs into the endoplasmic reticulum and modulating the sensitivity of leukemia cells to apoptosis. Our identification of MTCH2 as an insertase provides a mechanistic explanation for the diverse phenotypes and disease states associated with MTCH2 dysfunction.",

We investigate a model of sex chromosome evolution that incorporates the coevolution of cis and trans regulators of gene expression. We show that the early emergence of dosage compensation favors the maintenance of Y-linked inversions by creating sex-antagonistic regulatory effects. This is followed by degeneration of these nonrecombining inversions caused by regulatory divergence between the X and Y chromosomes. In contrast to current theory, the whole process occurs without any selective pressure related to sexual dimorphism.",

The two sources with the highest \u03c3 RM , FRB\u00a020121102A and FRB\u00a020190520B, are associated with compact persistent radio sources. These properties indicate a complex environment near the repeating FRBs, such as a supernova remnant or a pulsar wind nebula, consistent with their having arisen from young stellar populations.",

    "abstract": "In cases of severe wildlife population decline, a key question is whether recovery efforts will be impeded by genetic factors, such as inbreeding depression. Decades of excess mortality from gillnet fishing have driven Mexico\u2019s vaquita porpoise ( Phocoena sinus ) to ~10 remaining individuals. We analyzed whole-genome sequences from 20 vaquitas and integrated genomic and demographic information into stochastic, individual-based simulations to quantify the species\u2019 recovery potential. Our analysis suggests that the vaquita\u2019s historical rarity has resulted in a low burden of segregating deleterious variation, reducing the risk of inbreeding depression. Similarly, genome-informed simulations suggest that the vaquita can recover if bycatch mortality is immediately halted. This study provides hope for vaquitas and other naturally rare endangered species and highlights the utility of genomics in predicting extinction risk.",

Analogous to atomic many-body systems, one of the crucial ingredients is the ability to precisely control the interactions between particles. However, the optical interactions studied thus far only provide conservative optical binding forces of limited tunability. In this work, we exploit the phase coherence between the optical fields that drive the light-induced dipole-dipole interaction to couple two nanoparticles. In addition, we effectively switch off the optical interaction and observe electrostatic coupling between charged particles. Our results provide a route to developing fully programmable many-body systems of interacting nanoparticles with tunable nonreciprocal interactions, which are instrumental for exploring entanglement and topological phases in arrays of levitated nanoparticles.",

Intracellular calcium release (ICR) from the endoplasmic reticulum has long been thought to shape these mechanisms. However, ICR has not been investigated in mammalian neurons in vivo. We combined electroporation of single CA1 pyramidal neurons, simultaneous imaging of dendritic and somatic activity during spatial navigation, optogenetic place field induction, and acute genetic augmentation of ICR cytosolic impact to reveal that ICR supports the establishment of dendritic feature selectivity and shapes integrative properties determining output-level receptive fields. This role for ICR was more prominent in apical than in basal dendrites. Thus, ICR cooperates with circuit-level architecture in vivo to promote the emergence of behaviorally relevant plasticity in a compartment-specific manner.",

Here, we present a protocol for highly regioselective meta -C\u2212H trifluoromethylation, perfluoroalkylation, chlorination, bromination, iodination, nitration, sulfanylation, and selenylation of pyridines through a redox-neutral dearomatization-rearomatization process.

Applying this method, we observed high-resolution 6mA deposition in two protozoa. We found that commensal or soil bacteria explained the vast majority of 6mA in insect and plant samples. We found no evidence of high abundance of 6mA in Drosophila , Arabidopsis , or humans. Plasmids used for genetic manipulation, even those from Dam methyltransferase mutant Escherichia coli , could carry abundant 6mA, confounding the evaluation of candidate 6mA methyltransferases and demethylases. On the basis of this work, we advocate for a reassessment of 6mA in eukaryotes.",

This in situ reconstruction provided high-resolution details of the interaction between nebulin and actin, demonstrating the stabilizing role of nebulin. Myosin bound to the thin filaments exhibited different conformations of the neck domain, highlighting its inherent structural variability in muscle. Unexpectedly, nebulin did not interact with myosin or tropomyosin, but it did interact with a troponin T linker through two potential binding motifs on nebulin, explaining its regulatory role. Our structures support the role of nebulin as a thin filament \u201cmolecular ruler\u201d and provide a molecular basis for studying nemaline myopathies.",

    "abstract": "Efficient waste heat dissipation has become increasingly challenging as transistor size has decreased to nanometers. As governed by universal Umklapp phonon scattering, the thermal conductivity of semiconductors decreases at higher temperatures and causes heat transfer deterioration under high-power conditions. In this study, we realized simultaneous electrical and thermal rectification (TR) in a monolayer MoSe 2 -WSe 2 lateral heterostructure. The atomically thin MoSe 2 -WSe 2 heterojunction forms an electrical diode with a high ON/OFF ratio up to 10 4 . Meanwhile, a preferred heat dissipation channel was formed from MoSe 2 to WSe 2 in the ON state of the heterojunction diode at high bias voltage with a TR factor as high as 96%. Higher thermal conductivity was achieved at higher temperatures owing to the TR effect caused by the local temperature gradient. Furthermore, the TR factor could be regulated from maximum to zero by rotating the angle of the monolayer heterojunction interface. This result opens a path for designing novel nanoelectronic devices with enhanced thermal dissipation.",

Designing synthetic multistable circuits would provide insight into natural cell fate control circuit architectures and would allow engineering of multicellular programs that require interactions among distinct cell types. We created MultiFate, a naturally inspired, synthetic circuit that supports long-term, controllable, and expandable multistability in mammalian cells. MultiFate uses engineered zinc finger transcription factors that transcriptionally self-activate as homodimers and mutually inhibit one another through heterodimerization. Using a model-based design, we engineered MultiFate circuits that generate as many as seven states, each stable for at least 18 days. MultiFate permits controlled state switching and modulation of state stability through external inputs and can be expanded with additional transcription factors. These results provide a foundation for engineering multicellular behaviors in mammalian cells.",

Because such excitons display weak electron-hole overlap, most studies have examined only the lowest-energy excitons through photoluminescence. We directly measured the dielectric response of interlayer excitons, which we accessed using their static electric dipole moment. We thereby determined an intrinsic radiative lifetime of 0.40 nanoseconds for the lowest direct-gap interlayer exciton in a tungsten diselenide/molybdenum diselenide heterostructure. We found that differences in electric field and twist angle induced trends in exciton transition strengths and energies, which could be related to wave function overlap, moir\u00e9 confinement, and atomic reconstruction. Through comparison with photoluminescence spectra, this study identifies a momentum-indirect emission mechanism. Characterization of the absorption is key for applications relying on light-matter interactions.",

Here, we report rapid acidification there, with rates three to four times higher than in other ocean basins, and attribute it to changing sea ice coverage on a decadal time scale. Sea ice melt exposes seawater to the atmosphere and promotes rapid uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide, lowering its alkalinity and buffer capacity and thus leading to sharp declines in pH and \u03a9 arag . We predict a further decrease in pH, particularly at higher latitudes where sea ice retreat is active, whereas Arctic warming may counteract decreases in \u03a9 arag in the future.",

In this work, we generated silicon-compatible nanoscale protonic programmable resistors with highly desirable characteristics under extreme electric fields. This operation regime enabled controlled shuttling and intercalation of protons in nanoseconds at room temperature in an energy-efficient manner. The devices showed symmetric, linear, and reversible modulation characteristics with many conductance states covering a 20\u00d7 dynamic range. Thus, the space-time-energy performance of the all\u2013solid-state artificial synapses can greatly exceed that of their biological counterparts.",

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors are the most commonly used but are the largest filtering components, limiting device miniaturization. The high areal and volumetric capacitance of electric double-layer capacitors should make them ideal miniaturized filter capacitors, but they are hindered by their slow frequency responses. We report the development of interconnected and structurally integrated carbon tube grid\u2013based electric double-layer capacitors with high areal capacitance and rapid frequency response. These capacitors exhibit excellent line filtering of 120-hertz voltage signal and volumetric advantages under low-voltage operations for digital circuits, portable electronics, and electrical appliances.

We report a reaction sequence of pyridyl ring opening, halogenation, and ring closing whereby the acyclic Zincke imine intermediates undergo highly regioselective halogenation reactions under mild conditions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the nature of the halogen electrophile can modify the selectivity-determining step. Using this method, we produced a diverse set of 3-halopyridines and demonstrated late-stage halogenation of complex pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.",

Steric interactions are often used to block sites adjacent to a given substituent, but they do not distinguish the remaining remote sites. We report a strategy based on remote steric control, whereby a roof-like ligand protects the distant para site in addition to the ortho sites, and thereby enables selective activation of meta carbon-hydrogen (C\u2013H) bonds in the absence of ortho or para substituents. We demonstrate this concept for iridium-catalyzed meta -selective borylation of various monosubstituted arenes, including complex drug molecules. This strategy has the potential to expand the toolbox of C\u2013H bond functionalization to previously nondifferentiable reaction sites.",

Perforin is a pore-forming toxin that creates a lesion in the plasma membrane of the target cell through which granzymes enter the cytosol and initiate apoptosis. Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins are involved in the repair of small membrane wounds. We found that ESCRT proteins were precisely recruited in target cells to sites of CTL engagement immediately after perforin release. Inhibition of ESCRT machinery in cancer-derived cells enhanced their susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing. Thus, repair of perforin pores by ESCRT machinery limits granzyme entry into the cytosol, potentially enabling target cells to resist cytolytic attack.",

If global warming continues, heatstroke might become a more prominent cause of mortality worldwide, but its pathogenic mechanism is not well understood. We found that Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), a Z\u2013nucleic acid receptor, mediated heatstroke by triggering receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)\u2013dependent cell death. Heat stress increased the expression of ZBP1 through heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and activated ZBP1 through a mechanism independent of the nucleic acid sensing action. Deletion of ZBP1, RIPK3, or both mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) and caspase-8 decreased heat stress\u2013induced circulatory failure, organ injury, and lethality. Thus, ZBP1 appears to have a second function that orchestrates host responses to heat stress.",

However, oxybenzone\u2019s toxicity mechanism(s) are not understood, hampering development of safer sunscreens. We found that oxybenzone caused high mortality of a sea anemone under simulated sunlight including ultraviolet (UV) radiation (290 to 370 nanometers). Although oxybenzone itself protected against UV-induced photo-oxidation, both the anemone and a mushroom coral formed oxybenzone\u2013glucoside conjugates that were strong photo-oxidants. Algal symbionts sequestered these conjugates, and mortality correlated with conjugate concentrations in animal cytoplasm. Higher mortality in anemones that lacked symbionts suggests an enhanced risk from oxybenzone to corals bleached by rising temperatures. Because many commercial sunscreens contain structurally related chemicals, understanding metabolite phototoxicity should facilitate the development of coral-safe products.",

We present experimental proof that, despite the lack of bulk bands, photonic lattices of helical waveguides support topologically protected chiral edge states. We show that light transport in our topological fractal system features increased velocities compared with the corresponding honeycomb lattice. By going beyond the confines of the bulk-boundary correspondence, our findings pave the way toward an expanded perception of topological insulators and open a new chapter of topological fractals.",

    "abstract": "Deadwood is a large global carbon store with its store size partially determined by biotic decay. Microbial wood decay rates are known to respond to changing temperature and precipitation. Termites are also important decomposers in the tropics but are less well studied. An understanding of their climate sensitivities is needed to estimate climate change effects on wood carbon pools. Using data from 133 sites spanning six continents, we found that termite wood discovery and consumption were highly sensitive to temperature (with decay increasing >6.8 times per 10\u00b0C increase in temperature)\u2014even more so than microbes. Termite decay effects were greatest in tropical seasonal forests, tropical savannas, and subtropical deserts. With tropicalization (i.e., warming shifts to tropical climates), termite wood decay will likely increase as termites access more of Earth\u2019s surface.",

    "abstract": "We introduce DeepNash, an autonomous agent that plays the imperfect information game Stratego at a human expert level. Stratego is one of the few iconic board games that artificial intelligence (AI) has not yet mastered. It is a game characterized by a twin challenge: It requires long-term strategic thinking as in chess, but it also requires dealing with imperfect information as in poker. The technique underpinning DeepNash uses a game-theoretic, model-free deep reinforcement learning method, without search, that learns to master Stratego through self-play from scratch. DeepNash beat existing state-of-the-art AI methods in Stratego and achieved a year-to-date (2022) and all-time top-three ranking on the Gravon games platform, competing with human expert players.",

    "abstract": "The biological bases of wanting have been characterized in mammals, but whether an equivalent wanting system exists in insects remains unknown. In this study, we focused on honey bees, which perform intensive foraging activities to satisfy colony needs, and sought to determine whether foragers leave the hive driven by specific expectations about reward and whether they recollect these expectations during their waggle dances. We monitored foraging and dance behavior and simultaneously quantified and interfered with biogenic amine signaling in the bee brain. We show that a dopamine-dependent wanting system is activated transiently in the bee brain by increased appetite and individual recollection of profitable food sources, both en route to the goal and during waggle dances. Our results show that insects share with mammals common neural mechanisms for encoding wanting of stimuli with positive hedonic value.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-tissue communication by endocrine factors is a vital mechanism for physiologic homeostasis. A systems genetics analysis of transcriptomic and functional data from a cohort of diverse, inbred strains of mice predicted that coagulation factor XI (FXI), a liver-derived protein, protects against diastolic dysfunction, a key trait of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This was confirmed using gain- and loss-of-function studies, and FXI was found to activate the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)\u2013SMAD1/5 pathway in the heart. The proteolytic activity of FXI is required for the cleavage and activation of extracellular matrix\u2013associated BMP7 in the heart, thus inhibiting genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Our results reveal a protective role of FXI in heart injury that is distinct from its role in coagulation.",

Targeted MED12 deletion enhanced antitumor activity and sustained the effector phenotype in CAR- and T cell receptor\u2013engineered T cells, and inhibition of CDK8/19 kinase activity increased expansion of nonengineered T cells. MED12 -deficient T cells manifested increased core Meditator chromatin occupancy at transcriptionally active enhancers\u2014most notably for STAT and AP-1 transcription factors\u2014and increased IL2RA expression and interleukin-2 sensitivity.

We report a versatile strategy to fabricate polytriazole membranes with 10-nanometer-thin selective layers containing subnanometer channels for the separation of hydrocarbons. The process involves the use of the classical nonsolvent-induced phase separation method and thermal cross-linking. The membrane selectivity can be tuned to the lower end of the typical nanofiltration range (200 to 1000 gram mole \u22121 ). The polytriazole membrane can enrich up to 80 to 95% of the hydrocarbon content with less than 10 carbon atoms (140 gram mole \u22121 ). These membranes preferentially separate paraffin over aromatic components, making them suitable for integration in hybrid distillation systems for crude oil fractionation.",

Longitudinal intersectional genetics and antibody-dependent strategies targeting murine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells enriched in the epithelium at steady state led to heightened tumor development, whereas targeting \u03b3\u03b4 subsets that accumulate during CRC resulted in reduced tumor growth.

In this work, we demonstrate a distinct reactivity mode enabled by quantum mechanical tunneling that uses the cyclohexadiene derivative \u03b3-terpinene as the abstractor under mild photochemical conditions. This protocol activates alkyl and aryl halides as well as several alcohol and thiol derivatives. Experimental and computational studies unveiled a noncanonical pathway whereby a cyclohexadienyl radical undergoes concerted aromatization and halogen-atom or group abstraction through the reactivity of an effective H atom. This activation mechanism is seemingly thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable but is rendered feasible through quantum tunneling.",

Here, we use phylogenetic deep mutational scanning to measure the functional effect of every possible amino acid mutation in a series of ancestral and extant steroid receptor DNA binding domains. Across 700 million years of evolution, epistatic interactions caused the effects of most mutations to become decorrelated from their initial effects and their windows of evolutionary accessibility to open and close transiently. Most effects changed gradually and without bias at rates that were largely constant across time, indicating a neutral process caused by many weak epistatic interactions. Our findings show that protein sequences drift inexorably into contingency and unpredictability, but that the process is statistically predictable, given sufficient phylogenetic and experimental data.",

In this study, we used massively parallel reporter assays to screen 5706 variants identified from genome-wide association studies for both Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), identifying 320 functional regulatory variants (frVars) across 27 loci, including the complex 17q21.31 region. We identified and validated multiple risk loci using CRISPR interference or excision, including complement 4 ( C4A ) and APOC1 in AD and PLEKHM1 and KANSL1 in PSP. Functional variants disrupt transcription factor binding sites converging on enhancers with cell type\u2013specific activity in PSP and AD, implicating a neuronal SP1-driven regulatory network in PSP pathogenesis. These analyses suggest that noncoding genetic risk is driven by common genetic variants through their aggregate activity on specific transcriptional programs.",

Mycenaean period elites in Greece did not differ from the general population and included both people with some steppe ancestry and others, like the Griffin Warrior, without it. Similarly, people in the central area of the Urartian Kingdom around Lake Van lacked the steppe ancestry characteristic of the kingdom\u2019s northern provinces. Anatolia exhibited extraordinary continuity down to the Roman and Byzantine periods, with its people serving as the demographic core of much of the Roman Empire, including the city of Rome itself.

We present a strategy for fabricating arbitrary 3D nanostructures with a library of materials including metals, metal alloys, 2D materials, oxides, diamond, upconversion materials, semiconductors, polymers, biomaterials, molecular crystals, and inks. Specifically, hydrogels patterned by femtosecond light sheets are used as templates that allow for direct assembly of materials to form designed nanostructures. By fine-tuning the exposure strategy and features of the patterned gel, 2D and 3D structures of 20- to 200-nm resolution are realized. We fabricated nanodevices, including encrypted optical storage and microelectrodes, to demonstrate their designed functionality and precision. These results show that our method provides a systematic solution for nanofabrication across different classes of materials and opens up further possibilities for the design of sophisticated nanodevices.",

It is unknown how performance monitoring can be both flexible, to support different tasks, and specialized, to perform each task well. We recorded single neurons in the human medial frontal cortex while subjects performed two tasks that involve three types of cognitive conflict. Neurons encoding conflict probability, conflict, and error in one or both tasks were intermixed, forming a representational geometry that simultaneously allowed task specialization and generalization. Neurons encoding conflict retrospectively served to update internal estimates of conflict probability. Population representations of conflict were compositional. These findings reveal how representations of evaluative signals can be both abstract and task-specific and suggest a neuronal mechanism for estimating control demand.",

    "abstract": "DNA viruses are increasingly recognized as influencing marine microbes and microbe-mediated biogeochemical cycling. However, little is known about global marine RNA virus diversity, ecology, and ecosystem roles. In this study, we uncover patterns and predictors of marine RNA virus community- and \u201cspecies\u201d-level diversity and contextualize their ecological impacts from pole to pole. Our analyses revealed four ecological zones, latitudinal and depth diversity patterns, and environmental correlates for RNA viruses. Our findings only partially parallel those of cosampled plankton and show unexpectedly high polar ecological interactions. The influence of RNA viruses on ecosystems appears to be large, as predicted hosts are ecologically important. Moreover, the occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes indicates that RNA viruses cause reprogramming of diverse host metabolisms, including photosynthesis and carbon cycling, and that RNA virus abundances predict ocean carbon export.",

    "abstract": "Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes structure genomes by extruding DNA loops, but the molecular mechanism that underlies their activity has remained unknown. We show that the active condensin complex entraps the bases of a DNA loop transiently in two separate chambers. Single-molecule imaging and cryo\u2013electron microscopy suggest a putative power-stroke movement at the first chamber that feeds DNA into the SMC\u2013kleisin ring upon adenosine triphosphate binding, whereas the second chamber holds on upstream of the same DNA double helix. Unlocking the strict separation of \u201cmotor\u201d and \u201canchor\u201d chambers turns condensin from a one-sided into a bidirectional DNA loop extruder. We conclude that the orientation of two topologically bound DNA segments during the SMC reaction cycle determines the directionality of DNA loop extrusion.",

To study the information processing capacity of human cells, we conducted multiplexed quantification of signaling responses and markers of the cellular state. Signaling nodes in a network displayed adaptive information processing, which led to heterogeneous growth factor responses and enabled nodes to capture partially nonredundant information about the cellular state. Collectively, as a multimodal percept this gives individual cells a large information processing capacity to accurately place growth factor concentration within the context of their cellular state and make cellular state\u2013dependent decisions. Heterogeneity and complexity in signaling networks may have coevolved to enable specific and context-aware cellular decision-making in a multicellular setting.",

We combine multiplexed CRISPRi screening with machine learning to define quantitative enhancer-enhancer interactions. We find that the ultralong distance enhancer network has a nested multilayer architecture that confers functional robustness of gene expression. Experimental characterization reveals that enhancer epistasis is maintained by three-dimensional chromosomal interactions and BRD4 condensation. Machine learning prediction of synergistic enhancers provides an effective strategy to identify noncoding variant pairs associated with pathogenic genes in diseases beyond genome-wide association studies analysis. Our work unveils nested epistasis enhancer networks, which can better explain enhancer functions within cells and in diseases.",

Using multispectral images and x-ray fluorescence data, acquired by the Perseverance rover, we performed a petrographic analysis of the Bastide and Brac outcrops within this unit. We found that these outcrops are composed of igneous rock, moderately altered by aqueous fluid. The igneous rocks are mainly made of coarse-grained olivine, similar to some martian meteorites.

This virtual growth program imposes a set of local rules on a limited number of basic elements. It generates materials that exhibit a large variation in functional properties starting from very limited initial resources, which echoes the diversity of biological systems. We identify basic rules to control mechanical properties by independently varying the microstructure\u2019s topology and geometry in a general, graph-based representation of irregular materials.",

We observed viscoelastic displacements over micrometers within minutes in response to near-piconewton forces, which are consistent with a Rouse polymer model. Our results highlight the fluidity of chromatin, with a moderate contribution of the surrounding material, revealing minor roles for cross-links and topological effects and challenging the view that interphase chromatin is a gel-like material.

    "abstract": "Studies of the proteome would benefit greatly from methods to directly sequence and digitally quantify proteins and detect posttranslational modifications with single-molecule sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate single-molecule protein sequencing using a dynamic approach in which single peptides are probed in real time by a mixture of dye-labeled N-terminal amino acid recognizers and simultaneously cleaved by aminopeptidases. We annotate amino acids and identify the peptide sequence by measuring fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and binding kinetics on an integrated semiconductor chip. Our results demonstrate the kinetic principles that allow recognizers to identify multiple amino acids in an information-rich manner that enables discrimination of single amino acid substitutions and posttranslational modifications. With further development, we anticipate that this approach will offer a sensitive, scalable, and accessible platform for single-molecule proteomic studies and applications.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes coordinate cellular metabolism and growth upon sensing of essential nutrients, including cholesterol. Through bioinformatic analysis of lysosomal proteomes, we identified lysosomal cholesterol signaling (LYCHOS, previously annotated as G protein\u2013coupled receptor 155), a multidomain transmembrane protein that enables cholesterol-dependent activation of the master growth regulator, the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Cholesterol bound to the amino-terminal permease-like region of LYCHOS, and mutating this site impaired mTORC1 activation. At high cholesterol concentrations, LYCHOS bound to the GATOR1 complex, a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)\u2013activating protein for the Rag GTPases, through a conserved cytoplasm-facing loop. By sequestering GATOR1, LYCHOS promotes cholesterol- and Rag-dependent recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomes. Thus, LYCHOS functions in a lysosomal pathway for cholesterol sensing and couples cholesterol concentrations to mTORC1-dependent anabolic signaling.",

Using the optical transient grating technique, we experimentally measured thermal conductivity of 1200 watts per meter per kelvin and ambipolar mobility of 1600 centimeters squared per volt per second at the same locations on c-BAs samples at room temperature despite spatial variations.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION In eukaryotic cells, the selective bidirectional transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Embedded in nuclear envelope pores, the ~110-MDa human NPC is an ~1200-\u00c5-wide and ~750-\u00c5-tall assembly of ~1000 proteins, collectively termed nucleoporins. Because of the NPC\u2019s eightfold rotational symmetry along the nucleocytoplasmic axis, each of the ~34 different nucleoporins occurs in multiples of eight. Architecturally, the NPC\u2019s symmetric core is composed of an inner ring encircling the central transport channel and two outer rings anchored on both sides of the nuclear envelope. Because of its central role in the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein, the NPC is commonly targeted in viral infections and its nucleoporin constituents are associated with a plethora of diseases. RATIONALE Although the arrangement of most scaffold nucleoporins in the NPC\u2019s symmetric core was determined by quantitative docking of crystal structures into cryo\u2013electron tomographic (cryo-ET) maps of intact NPCs, the topology and molecular details of their cohesion by multivalent linker nucleoporins have remained elusive. Recently, in situ cryo-ET reconstructions of NPCs from various species have indicated that the NPC\u2019s inner ring is capable of reversible constriction and dilation in response to variations in nuclear envelope membrane tension, thereby modulating the diameter of the central transport channel by ~200 \u00c5. We combined biochemical reconstitution, high-resolution crystal and single-particle cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination, docking into cryo-ET maps, and physiological validation to elucidate the molecular architecture of the linker-scaffold interaction network that not only is essential for the NPC\u2019s integrity but also confers the plasticity and robustness necessary to allow and withstand such large-scale conformational changes. RESULTS By biochemically mapping scaffold-binding regions of all fungal and human linker nucleoporins and determining crystal and single-particle cryo-EM structures of linker-scaffold complexes, we completed the characterization of the biochemically tractable linker-scaffold network and established its evolutionary conservation, despite considerable sequence divergence. We determined a series of crystal and single-particle cryo-EM structures of the intact Nup188 and Nup192 scaffold hubs bound to their Nic96, Nup145N, and Nup53 linker nucleoporin binding regions, revealing that both proteins form distinct question mark\u2013shaped keystones of two evolutionarily conserved hetero\u2011octameric inner ring complexes. Linkers bind to scaffold surface pockets through short defined motifs, with flanking regions commonly forming additional disperse interactions that reinforce the binding. Using a structure\u2011guided functional analysis in Saccharomyces\u00a0cerevisiae , we confirmed the robustness of linker\u2011scaffold interactions and established the physiological relevance of our biochemical and structural findings. The near-atomic composite structures resulting from quantitative docking of experimental structures into human and S.\u00a0cerevisiae cryo-ET maps of constricted and dilated NPCs structurally disambiguated the positioning of the Nup188 and Nup192 hubs in the intact fungal and human NPC and revealed the topology of the linker-scaffold network. The linker-scaffold gives rise to eight relatively rigid inner ring spokes that are flexibly interconnected to allow for the formation of lateral channels. Unexpectedly, we uncovered that linker\u2011scaffold interactions play an opposing role in the outer rings by forming tight cross-link staples between the eight nuclear and cytoplasmic outer ring spokes, thereby limiting the dilatory movements to the inner ring. CONCLUSION We have substantially advanced the structural and biochemical characterization of the symmetric core of the S.\u00a0cerevisiae and human NPCs and determined near-atomic composite structures. The composite structures uncover the molecular mechanism by which the evolutionarily conserved linker\u2011scaffold establishes the NPC\u2019s integrity while simultaneously allowing for the observed plasticity of the central transport channel. The composite structures are roadmaps for the mechanistic dissection of NPC assembly and disassembly, the etiology of NPC\u2011associated diseases, the role of NPC dilation in nucleocytoplasmic transport of soluble and integral membrane protein cargos, and the anchoring of asymmetric nucleoporins.

Testing this possibility is difficult, however, because it is challenging to reproduce the fine spatial features and complex structures of the heart\u2019s musculature using current techniques. Here we report focused rotary jet spinning (FRJS), an additive manufacturing approach that enables rapid fabrication of micro/nanofiber scaffolds with programmable alignments in three-dimensional geometries. Seeding these scaffolds with cardiomyocytes enabled the biofabrication of tissue-engineered ventricles, with helically aligned models displaying more uniform deformations, greater apical shortening, and increased ejection fractions compared with circumferential alignments. The ability of FRJS to control fiber arrangements in three dimensions offers a streamlined approach to fabricating tissues and organs, with this work demonstrating how helical architectures contribute to cardiac performance.",

In vivo spike recording and optogenetics confirmed the high correlation of the observed MRI signal with neural activity. It also captured the sequential and laminar-specific propagation of neuronal activity along the thalamocortical pathway. This high-resolution, direct imaging of neuronal activity will open up new avenues in brain science by providing a deeper understanding of the brain\u2019s functional organization, including the temporospatial dynamics of neural networks.",

Using cryo\u2013electron microscopy and single\u2013molecule imaging, we investigated how MAP7 binds MTs and facilitates kinesin-1 motility. The MT-binding domain (MTBD) of MAP7 bound MTs as an extended \u03b1 helix between the protofilament ridge and the site of lateral contact. Unexpectedly, the MTBD partially overlapped with the binding site of kinesin-1 and inhibited its motility. However, by tethering kinesin-1 to the MT, the projection domain of MAP7 prevented dissociation of the motor and facilitated its binding to available neighboring sites. The inhibitory effect of the MTBD dominated as MTs became saturated with MAP7. Our results reveal biphasic regulation of kinesin-1 by MAP7 in the context of their competitive binding to MTs.",

Catalytic, enantioselective methods for the synthesis of synthetically versatile stereogenic P(V) building blocks offer an alternative approach to stereogenic-at-P(V) targets without requiring stoichiometric quantities of chiral control elements. Here, we report an enantioselective hydrogen-bond-donor\u2013catalyzed synthesis of aryl chlorophosphonamidates and the development of these products as versatile chiral P(V) building blocks.

Neural networks trained to decode the combinatorial grammar of CAR signaling motifs allowed extraction of key design rules. For example, non-native combinations of motifs that bind tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2013associated factors (TRAFs) and phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC\u03b31) enhanced cytotoxicity and stemness associated with effective tumor killing. Thus, libraries built from minimal building blocks of signaling, combined with machine learning, can efficiently guide engineering of receptors with desired phenotypes.",

From these patients, we isolated Beta-specific and cross-reactive receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies. The Beta-specificity results from recruitment of VOC-specific clonotypes and accommodation of mutations present in Beta and Omicron into a major antibody class that is normally sensitive to these mutations. The Beta-elicited cross-reactive antibodies share genetic and structural features with wild type\u2013elicited antibodies, including a public VH1-58 clonotype that targets the RBD ridge.

    "abstract": "Plant roots exhibit plasticity in their branching patterns to forage efficiently for heterogeneously distributed resources, such as soil water. The xerobranching response represses lateral root formation when roots lose contact with water. Here, we show that xerobranching is regulated by radial movement of the phloem-derived hormone abscisic acid, which disrupts intercellular communication between inner and outer cell layers through plasmodesmata. Closure of these intercellular pores disrupts the inward movement of the hormone signal auxin, blocking lateral root branching. Once root tips regain contact with moisture, the abscisic acid response rapidly attenuates. Our study reveals how roots adapt their branching pattern to heterogeneous soil water conditions by linking changes in hydraulic flux with dynamic hormone redistribution.",

By contrast, layer 5 M1 neurons connect with specific cell populations in zona incerta and periaqueductal gray to suppress sensory hypersensitivity without altering pain affect. Thus, the M1 employs distinct, layer-specific pathways to attune sensory and aversive-emotional components of neuropathic pain, which can be exploited for purposes of pain relief.",

This decoupling reflects a shift of inhibitory balance between parvalbumin neuron\u2013mediated somatic inhibition and vasoactive intestinal peptide\u2013mediated dendritic disinhibition, mostly driven by neurons from the central medial thalamus. REM-specific optogenetic suppression of dendritic activity led to a loss of danger-versus-safety discrimination during associative learning and a lack of synaptic plasticity, whereas optogenetic release of somatic inhibition resulted in enhanced discrimination and synaptic potentiation. Somatodendritic decoupling during REM sleep promotes opposite synaptic plasticity mechanisms that optimize emotional responses to future behavioral stressors.",

Viral tracing, microendoscopic calcium imaging, and multitetrode recordings in freely moving mice showed that low-SNR sounds inhibited glutamatergic inputs from the auditory cortex (ACx Glu ) to the thalamic posterior (PO) and ventral posterior (VP) nuclei. Optogenetic or chemogenetic inhibition of the ACx Glu \u2192PO and ACx Glu \u2192VP circuits mimicked the low-SNR sound\u2013induced analgesia in inflamed hindpaws and forepaws, respectively.

We identified changes to terrestrial mammal food webs globally over the past ~130,000 years using extinct and extant mammal traits, geographic ranges, observed predator-prey interactions, and deep learning models. Food webs underwent steep regional declines in complexity through loss of food web links after the arrival and expansion of human populations. We estimate that defaunation has caused a 53% decline in food web links globally. Although extinctions explain much of this effect, range losses for extant species degraded food webs to a similar extent, highlighting the potential for food web restoration via extant species recovery.",

To understand speech evolution, we examined a wide range of primates, combining observations of phonation with mathematical modeling. We found that source stability relies upon simplifications in laryngeal anatomy, specifically the loss of air sacs and vocal membranes. We conclude that the evolutionary loss of vocal membranes allows human speech to mostly avoid the spontaneous nonlinear phenomena and acoustic chaos common in other primate vocalizations. This loss allows our larynx to produce stable, harmonic-rich phonation, ideally highlighting formant changes that convey most phonetic information. Paradoxically, the increased complexity of human spoken language thus followed simplification of our laryngeal anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Salamanders are tetrapod models to study brain organization and regeneration; however, the identity and evolutionary conservation of brain cell types are largely unknown. We delineated the cell populations in the axolotl telencephalon during homeostasis and regeneration using single-cell genomic profiling. We identified glutamatergic neurons with similarities to amniote neurons of hippocampus, dorsal and lateral cortex, and conserved \u03b3-aminobutyric acid\u2013releasing (GABAergic) neuron classes. We inferred transcriptional dynamics and gene regulatory relationships of postembryonic, region-specific neurogenesis and unraveled conserved differentiation signatures. After brain injury, ependymoglia activate an injury-specific state before reestablishing lost neuron populations and axonal connections. Together, our analyses yield insights into the organization, evolution, and regeneration of a tetrapod nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Creep, the time-dependent deformation of materials stressed below the yield strength, is responsible for a great number of component failures at high temperatures. Because grain boundaries (GBs) in materials usually facilitate diffusional processes in creep, eliminating GBs is a primary approach to resisting high-temperature creep in metals, such as in single-crystal superalloy turbo blades. We report a different strategy to inhibiting creep by use of stable GB networks. Plastic deformation triggered structural relaxation of high-density GBs in nanograined single-phased nickel-cobalt-chromium alloys, forming networks of stable GBs interlocked with abundant twin boundaries. The stable GB networks effectively inhibit diffusional creep processes at high temperatures. We obtained an unprecedented creep resistance, with creep rates of ~10 \u20137 per second under gigapascal stress at 700\u00b0C (~61% melting point), outperforming that of conventional superalloys.",

How NAC antagonizes SRP and how this is overcome by ER targeting signals are unknown. Here, we found that NAC uses two domains with opposing effects to control SRP access. The core globular domain prevented SRP from binding to signal-less ribosomes, whereas a flexibly attached domain transiently captured SRP to permit scanning of nascent chains. The emergence of an ER-targeting signal destabilized NAC\u2019s globular domain and facilitated SRP access to the nascent chain. These findings elucidate how NAC hands over the signal sequence to SRP and imparts specificity of protein localization.",

Here, we report the cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of human TAS2R46 complexed with chimeric mini\u2013G protein gustducin, in both strychnine-bound and apo forms. Several features of TAS2R46 are disclosed, including distinct receptor structures that compare with known GPCRs, a new \u201ctoggle switch,\u201d activation-related motifs, and precoupling with mini\u2013G protein gustducin. Furthermore, the dynamic extracellular and more-static intracellular parts of TAS2R46 suggest possible diverse ligand-recognition and activation processes.

    "abstract": "Neurons harbor high levels of single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs) that are targeted to neuronal enhancers, but the source of this endogenous damage remains unclear. Using two systems of postmitotic lineage specification\u2014induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived neurons and transdifferentiated macrophages\u2014we show that thymidine DNA glycosylase (TDG)\u2013driven excision of methylcytosines oxidized with ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET) is a source of SSBs. Although macrophage differentiation favors short-patch base excision repair to fill in single-nucleotide gaps, neurons also frequently use the long-patch subpathway. Disrupting this gap-filling process using anti-neoplastic cytosine analogs triggers a DNA damage response and neuronal cell death, which is dependent on TDG. Thus, TET-mediated active DNA demethylation promotes endogenous DNA damage, a process that normally safeguards cell identity but can also provoke neurotoxicity after anticancer treatments.",

Here, we determined the holoenzyme structure in complex with DNA using cryo\u2013electron microscopy at the global resolution of ~2.8 angstroms. The holoenzyme possesses an architecture that suggests a \u201cforward sliding clamp\u201d processivity mechanism for viral DNA replication. MPXV polymerase has a DNA binding mode similar to that of other B-family DNA polymerases from different species.

We investigated the impact of glyphosate, the most commonly used herbicide worldwide, on bumblebees. Bumblebee colonies maintain their brood at high temperatures via active thermogenesis, a prerequisite for colony growth and reproduction. Using a within-colony comparative approach to examine the effects of long-term glyphosate exposure on both individual and collective thermoregulation, we found that whereas effects are weak at the level of the individual, the collective ability to maintain the necessary high brood temperatures is decreased by more than 25% during periods of resource limitation. For pollinators in our heavily stressed ecosystems, glyphosate exposure carries hidden costs that have so far been largely overlooked.",

By contrast, we show that the SP in determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is quantitatively linked to quantum critical behavior. We demonstrate this through simulations of several models with critical properties that are relatively well understood. We propose a reinterpretation of the low average sign for the Hubbard model on the square lattice away from half filling in terms of the onset of pseudogap behavior and exotic superconductivity. Our study charts a path for exploiting the average sign in QMC simulations to understand quantum critical behavior.",

Nevertheless, proteins with these sequences assist in many aspects of cell organization, including assembly of nuclear and cytoplasmic structures not surrounded by membranes. The dynamic nature of these cellular assemblies is caused by the ability of low-complexity domains (LCDs) to transiently self-associate through labile, cross-\u03b2 structures. Mechanistic studies useful for the study of LCD self-association have evolved over the past decade in the form of simple assays of phase separation. Here, we have used such assays to demonstrate that the interactions responsible for LCD self-association can be dictated by labile protein structures poised close to equilibrium between the folded and unfolded states. Furthermore, missense mutations causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease manifest their pathophysiology in vitro and in cultured cell systems by enhancing the stability of otherwise labile molecular structures formed upon LCD self-association.",

    "abstract": "In quantum systems, coherent superpositions of electronic states evolve on ultrafast time scales (few femtoseconds to attoseconds; 1 attosecond = 0.001 femtoseconds = 10 \u221218 seconds), leading to a time-dependent charge density. Here we performed time-resolved measurements using attosecond soft x-ray pulses produced by a free-electron laser, to track the evolution of a coherent core-hole excitation in nitric oxide. Using an additional circularly polarized infrared laser pulse, we created a clock to time-resolve the electron dynamics and demonstrated control of the coherent electron motion by tuning the photon energy of the x-ray pulse. Core-excited states offer a fundamental test bed for studying coherent electron dynamics in highly excited and strongly correlated matter.",

    "abstract": "Effective tissue repair after myocardial infarction entails a vigorous angiogenic response, guided by incompletely defined immune cell\u2013endothelial cell interactions. We identify the monocyte- and macrophage-derived cytokine METRNL (meteorin-like) as a driver of postinfarction angiogenesis and high-affinity ligand for the stem cell factor receptor KIT (KIT receptor tyrosine kinase). METRNL mediated angiogenic effects in cultured human endothelial cells through KIT-dependent signaling pathways. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, METRNL promoted infarct repair by selectively expanding the KIT-expressing endothelial cell population in the infarct border zone. Metrnl -deficient mice failed to mount this KIT-dependent angiogenic response and developed severe postinfarction heart failure. Our data establish METRNL as a KIT receptor ligand in the context of ischemic tissue repair.",

We show that three leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) act as direct ligand-perceiving receptors for PLANT PEPTIDE CONTAINING SULFATED TYROSINE (PSY)-family peptides and mediate switching between two opposing pathways. By contrast to known LRR-RKs, which activate signaling upon ligand binding, PSY receptors (PSYRs) activate the expression of various genes encoding stress response transcription factors upon depletion of the ligands. Loss of PSYRs results in defects in plant tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. This ligand-deprivation\u2013dependent activation system potentially enables plants to exert tuned regulation of stress responses in the tissues proximal to metabolically dysfunctional damaged sites where ligand production is impaired.",

Here, we evaluate the consequences of further viral evolution. We demonstrate mechanisms through which the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) can tolerate large numbers of simultaneous antibody escape mutations and show that pseudotypes containing up to seven mutations, as opposed to the one to three found in previously studied variants of concern, are more resistant to neutralization by therapeutic antibodies and serum from vaccine recipients. We identify an antibody that binds the RBD core to neutralize pseudotypes for all tested variants but show that the RBD can acquire an N-linked glycan to escape neutralization. Our findings portend continued emergence of escape variants as SARS-CoV-2 adapts to humans.",

We present a study of aging rates and longevity across wild tetrapod ectotherms, using data from 107 populations (77 species) of nonavian reptiles and amphibians. We test hypotheses of how thermoregulatory mode, environmental temperature, protective phenotypes, and pace of life history contribute to demographic aging. Controlling for phylogeny and body size, ectotherms display a higher diversity of aging rates compared with endotherms and include phylogenetically widespread evidence of negligible aging. Protective phenotypes and life-history strategies further explain macroevolutionary patterns of aging. Analyzing ectothermic tetrapods in a comparative context enhances our understanding of the evolution of aging.",

The rules and constraints underlying the evolution of neuron types, however, remain poorly understood. To compare neuron types across brain regions and species, we generated a cell type atlas of the brain of a bearded dragon and compared it with mouse datasets. Conserved classes of neurons could be identified from the expression of hundreds of genes, including homeodomain-type transcription factors and genes involved in connectivity. Within these classes, however, there are both conserved and divergent neuron types, precluding a simple categorization of the brain into ancestral and novel areas. In the thalamus, neuronal diversification correlates with the evolution of the cortex, suggesting that developmental origin and circuit allocation are drivers of neuronal identity and evolution.",

Although VSC is reported to alter thermally activated chemical reactions, its mechanisms remain opaque. To elucidate this problem, we followed ultrafast dynamics of a simple unimolecular vibrational energy exchange in iron pentacarbonyl [Fe(CO) 5 ] under VSC, which showed two competing channels: pseudorotation and intramolecular vibrational-energy redistribution (IVR). We found that under polariton excitation, energy exchange was overall accelerated, with IVR becoming faster and pseudorotation being slowed down. However, dark-mode excitation revealed unchanged dynamics compared with those outside of the cavity, with pseudorotation dominating. Thus, despite controversies around thermally activated VSC modified chemistry, our work shows that VSC can indeed alter chemistry through a nonequilibrium preparation of polaritons.",

In our experiments, RNA sequencing of sciatic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) revealed significant aging-dependent enrichment in T cell signaling both before and after sciatic nerve injury (SNI) in mice. Lymphotoxin activated the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which induced expression of the chemokine CXCL13 by neurons. This in turn recruited CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells to injured DRG neurons overexpressing major histocompatibility complex class I. CD8 + T cells repressed the axonal regeneration of DRG neurons via caspase 3 activation. CXCL13 neutralization prevented CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell recruitment to the DRG and reversed aging-dependent regenerative decline, thereby promoting neurological recovery after SNI. Thus, axonal regeneration can be facilitated by antagonizing cross-talk between immune cells and neurons.",

The state at the filling of \u03bd = 5/2, predicted to host non-abelian anyons, supports a variety of edge modes (integer, fractional, neutral). To ensure thermal equilibration between the edge modes and thus accurately determine the state\u2019s nature, it is advantageous to isolate the fractional channel (1/2 and neutral modes). In this study, we gapped out the integer modes by interfacing the \u03bd = 5/2 state with integer states \u03bd = 2 and \u03bd = 3 and measured the thermal conductance of the isolated-interface channel. Our measured half-quantized thermal conductance confirms the non-abelian nature of the \u03bd = 5/2 state and its particle-hole Pfaffian topological order. Such an isolated channel may be more amenable to braiding experiments.",

    "abstract": "Chloride transport by microbial rhodopsins is an essential process for which molecular details such as the mechanisms that convert light energy to drive ion pumping and ensure the unidirectionality of the transport have remained elusive. We combined time-resolved serial crystallography with time-resolved spectroscopy and multiscale simulations to elucidate the molecular mechanism of a chloride-pumping rhodopsin and the structural dynamics throughout the transport cycle. We traced transient anion-binding sites, obtained evidence for how light energy is used in the pumping mechanism, and identified steric and electrostatic molecular gates ensuring unidirectional transport. An interaction with the \u03c0-electron system of the retinal supports transient chloride ion binding across a major bottleneck in the transport pathway. These results allow us to propose key mechanistic features enabling finely controlled chloride transport across the cell membrane in this light-powered chloride ion pump.",

    "abstract": "Kinetochores assemble onto specialized centromeric CENP-A (centromere protein A) nucleosomes (CENP-A Nuc ) to mediate attachments between chromosomes and the mitotic spindle. We describe cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of the human inner kinetochore constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) complex bound to CENP-A Nuc reconstituted onto \u03b1-satellite DNA. CCAN forms edge-on contacts with CENP-A Nuc , and a linker DNA segment of the \u03b1-satellite repeat emerges from the fully wrapped end of the nucleosome to thread through the central CENP-LN channel that tightly grips the DNA. The CENP-TWSX histone-fold module further augments DNA binding and partially wraps the linker DNA in a manner reminiscent of canonical nucleosomes. Our study suggests that the topological entrapment of the linker DNA by CCAN provides a robust mechanism by which kinetochores withstand both pushing and pulling forces exerted by the mitotic spindle.",

The bulk density of the displaced subsurface material was 500 to 700 kilograms per cubic meter, which is about half that of the whole asteroid.

KynA can bind to multiple receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, the a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a7nAChR), multiple ionotropic glutamate receptors, and the orphan G protein\u2013coupled receptor GPR35. Here, we show that GPR35 activation was necessary and sufficient for ischemic protection by KynA. When bound by KynA, GPR35 activated G i - and G 12/13 -coupled signaling and trafficked to the outer mitochondria membrane, where it bound, apparently indirectly, to ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1 (ATPIF1). Activated GPR35, in an ATPIF1-dependent and pertussis toxin\u2013sensitive manner, induced ATP synthase dimerization, which prevented ATP loss upon ischemia. These findings provide a rationale for the development of specific GPR35 agonists for the treatment of ischemic diseases.",

Clinical bioelectrodes with established electrochemical functionalities are rigid and mechanically mismatched with tissue. Whereas conductive materials with tissue-like softness and stretchability are demonstrated, when applied to electrochemically probe tissue, their performance is distorted by strain and corrosion. We devise a layered architectural composite design that couples strain-induced cracked films with a strain-isolated out-of-plane conductive pathway and in-plane nanowire networks to eliminate strain effects on device electrochemical performance. Accordingly, we developed a library of stretchable, highly conductive, and strain-insensitive bioelectrodes featuring clinically established brittle interfacial materials (iridium-oxide, gold, platinum, and carbon). We paired these bioelectrodes with different electrochemical probing methods (amperometry, voltammetry, and potentiometry) and demonstrated strain-insensitive sensing of multiple biomarkers and in vivo neuromodulation.",

SPOT formation required the parasite effector TgMAF1 and its interaction with the host mitochondrial receptor TOM70 and translocase SAM50. TOM70-dependent SPOT formation mediated a depletion of mitochondrial proteins and optimal parasite growth. SPOT-like structures also formed after OMM perturbations independently of infection.

We show that the intensity and phase of terahertz pulses can be controlled by a gate voltage, which drives the device across the EP. Our electrically tunable system allows reconstruction of the Riemann surface associated with the complex energy landscape and provides topological control of light by tuning the loss imbalance and frequency detuning of interacting modes.

In this work, we demonstrate reversible and selective bond formation and dissociation promoted by tip-induced reduction-oxidation reactions on a surface. Molecular rearrangements leading to different constitutional isomers are selected by the polarity and magnitude of applied voltage pulses from the tip of a combined scanning tunneling and atomic force microscope. Characterization of voltage dependence of the reactions and determination of reaction rates demonstrate selectivity in constitutional isomerization reactions and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms. With support of density functional theory calculations, we find that the energy landscape of the isomers in different charge states is important to rationalize the selectivity. Tip-induced selective single-molecule reactions increase our understanding of redox chemistry and could lead to novel molecular machines.",

Here, we use cryo\u2013electron microscopy snapshots of Craspase to explain its target RNA cleavage and protease activation mechanisms. Target-guide pairing extending into the 5\u2032 region of the guide RNA displaces a gating loop in gRAMP, which triggers an extensive conformational relay that allosterically aligns the protease catalytic dyad and opens an amino acid side-chain\u2013binding pocket. We further define Csx30 as the endogenous protein substrate that is site-specifically proteolyzed by RNA-activated Craspase. This protease activity is switched off by target RNA cleavage by gRAMP and is not activated by RNA targets containing a matching protospacer flanking sequence. We thus conclude that Craspase is a target RNA\u2013activated protease with self-regulatory capacity.",

Augmentation of SERT-nNOS interactions in the DRN caused a depression-like phenotype and accounted for the CMS-induced depressive behaviors. Disrupting the SERT-nNOS interaction produced a fast-onset antidepressant effect by enhancing serotonin signaling in forebrain circuits. We discovered a small-molecule compound, ZZL-7, that elicited an antidepressant effect 2 hours after treatment without undesirable side effects.

Ureolytic gut microbes incorporate urea nitrogen into metabolites that are absorbed by the host, with the nitrogen reincorporated into the squirrel\u2019s protein pool. Urea nitrogen recycling is greatest after prolonged fasting in late winter, when urea transporter abundance in gut tissue and urease gene abundance in the microbiome are highest. These results reveal a functional role for the gut microbiome during hibernation and suggest mechanisms by which urea nitrogen recycling may contribute to protein balance in other monogastric animals.",

We describe a gene therapy strategy that down-regulates the excitability of overactive neurons in closed loop, which we tested in models of epilepsy. We used an immediate early gene promoter to drive the expression of Kv1.1 potassium channels specifically in hyperactive neurons, and only for as long as they exhibit abnormal activity. Neuronal excitability was reduced by seizure-related activity, leading to a persistent antiepileptic effect without interfering with normal behaviors. Activity-dependent gene therapy is a promising on-demand cell-autonomous treatment for brain circuit disorders.",

Below active arc volcanoes, observed magma storage depths vary widely (~0 to 20 kilometers) and are commonly assumed to represent levels of neutral buoyancy. Here we show that geophysically observed magma depths (6 \u00b1 3 kilometers) are greater than depths of neutral buoyancy, ruling out this commonly assumed control. Observed depths are instead consistent with predicted depths of water degassing. Intrinsically wetter magmas degas water and crystallize deeper than dry magmas, resulting in viscosity increases that lead to deeper stalling of ascending magma. The water\u2013depth relationship provides a critical constraint for forecasting models by connecting depth of eruption initiation to its volatile fuel.",

We show that despite continued dormancy, spores can integrate environmental signals over time through a preexisting electrochemical potential. Specifically, we studied thousands of individual Bacillus subtilis spores that remain dormant when exposed to transient nutrient pulses. Guided by a mathematical model of bacterial electrophysiology, we modulated the decision to exit dormancy by genetically and chemically targeting potassium ion flux. We confirmed that short nutrient pulses result in step-like changes in the electrochemical potential of persistent spores. During dormancy, spores thus gradually release their stored electrochemical potential to integrate extracellular information over time. These findings reveal a decision-making mechanism that operates in physiologically inactive cells.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The nuclear pore complex (NPC) resides on the nuclear envelope (NE) and mediates nucleocytoplasmic cargo transport. As one of the largest cellular machineries, a vertebrate NPC consists of cytoplasmic filaments, a cytoplasmic ring (CR), an inner ring, a nuclear ring, a nuclear basket, and a luminal ring. Each NPC has eight repeating subunits. Structure determination of NPC is a prerequisite for understanding its functional mechanism. In the past two decades, integrative modeling, which combines x-ray structures of individual nucleoporins and subcomplexes with cryo\u2013electron tomography reconstructions, has played a crucial role in advancing our knowledge about the NPC. The CR has been a major focus of structural investigation. The CR subunit of human NPC was reconstructed by cryo\u2013electron tomography through subtomogram averaging to an overall resolution of ~20 \u00c5, with local resolution up to ~15 \u00c5. Each CR subunit comprises two Y-shaped multicomponent complexes known as the inner and outer Y complexes. Eight inner and eight outer Y complexes assemble in a head-to-tail fashion to form the proximal and distal rings, respectively, constituting the CR scaffold. To achieve higher resolution of the CR, we used single-particle cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to image the intact NPC from the NE of Xenopus laevis oocytes. Reconstructions of the core region and the Nup358 region of the X. laevis CR subunit had been achieved at average resolutions of 5 to 8 \u00c5, allowing identification of secondary structural elements. RATIONALE Packing interactions among the components of the CR subunit were poorly defined by all previous EM maps. Additional components of the CR subunit are strongly suggested by the EM maps of 5- to 8-\u00c5 resolution but remain to be identified. Addressing these issues requires improved resolution of the cryo-EM reconstruction. Therefore, we may need to enhance sample preparation, optimize image acquisition, and develop an effective data-processing strategy. RESULTS To reduce conformational heterogeneity of the sample, we spread the opened NE onto the grids with minimal force and used the chemical cross-linker glutaraldehyde to stabilize the NPC. To alleviate orientation bias of the NPC, we tilted sample grids and imaged the sample with higher electron dose at higher angles. We improved the image-processing protocol. With these efforts, the average resolutions for the core and the Nup358 regions have been improved to 3.7 and 4.7 \u00c5, respectively. The highest local resolution of the core region reaches 3.3 \u00c5. In addition, a cryo-EM structure of the N-terminal \u03b1-helical domain of Nup358 has been resolved at 3.0-\u00c5 resolution. These EM maps allow the identification of five copies of Nup358, two copies of Nup93, two copies of Nup205, and two copies of Y complexes in each CR subunit. Relying on the EM maps and facilitated by AlphaFold prediction, we have generated a final model for the CR of the X. laevis NPC. Our model of the CR subunit includes 19,037 amino acids in 30 nucleoporins. A previously unknown C-terminal fragment of Nup160 was found to constitute a key part of the vertex, in which the short arm, long arm, and stem of the Y complex meet. The Nup160 C-terminal fragment directly binds the \u03b2-propeller proteins Seh1 and Sec13. Two Nup205 molecules, which do not contact each other, bind the inner and outer Y complexes through distinct interfaces. Conformational elasticity of the two Nup205 molecules may underlie their versatility in binding to different nucleoporins in the proximal and distal CR rings. Two Nup93 molecules, each comprising an N-terminal extended helix and an ACE1 domain, bridge the Y complexes and Nup205. Nup93 and Nup205 together play a critical role in mediating the contacts between neighboring CR subunits. Five Nup358 molecules, each in the shape of a shrimp tail and named \u201cthe clamp,\u201d hold the stems of both Y complexes. The innate conformational elasticity allows each Nup358 clamp to adapt to a distinct local environment for optimal interactions with neighboring nucleoporins. In each CR subunit, the \u03b1-helical nucleoporins appear to provide the conformational elasticity; the 12 \u03b2-propellers may strengthen the scaffold. CONCLUSION Our EM map\u2013based model of the X. laevis CR subunit substantially expands the molecular mass over the reported composite models of vertebrate CR subunit. In addition to the Y complexes, five Nup358, two Nup205, and two Nup93 molecules constitute the key components of the CR. The improved EM maps reveal insights into the interfaces among the nucleoporins of the CR. Cryo-EM structure of the double-layered CR of the X. laevis NPC. The X. laevis CR, containing eight repeating subunits, is modeled on the basis of cryo-EM reconstructions (top left panel). One CR subunit is shown in two different views to highlight nucleoporins of key interest (bottom left and right panels). The inner and outer Y complexes are colored dark and light gray, respectively. Two Nup205, two Nup93, and five Nup358 molecules are colored blue, red, and purple, respectively.",

We used contrastive deep learning to disentangle ASD-specific neuroanatomical variation from variation shared with typical control participants. ASD-specific variation correlated with individual differences in symptoms. The structure of this ASD-specific variation also addresses a long-standing debate about the nature of ASD: At least in terms of neuroanatomy, individuals do not cluster into distinct subtypes; instead, they are organized along continuous dimensions that affect distinct sets of regions.",

We report the development of agents that overcome this resistance mechanism by inducing MMR-independent cell killing selectively in MGMT-silenced tumors. These agents deposit a dynamic DNA lesion that can be reversed by MGMT but slowly evolves into an interstrand cross-link in MGMT-deficient settings, resulting in MMR-independent cell death with low toxicity in vitro and in vivo. This discovery may lead to new treatments for gliomas and may represent a new paradigm for designing chemotherapeutics that exploit specific DNA repair defects.",

By measuring group velocity dispersion along the impact-lander path, we obtained a direct constraint on crustal structure away from the InSight lander. The crust north of the equatorial dichotomy had a shear wave velocity of approximately 3.2 kilometers per second in the 5- to 30-kilometer depth range, with little depth variation. This implies a higher crustal density than inferred beneath the lander, suggesting either compositional differences or reduced porosity in the volcanic areas traversed by the surface waves. The lower velocities and the crustal layering observed beneath the landing site down to a 10-kilometer depth are not a global feature.

In a typical lasing arrangement, the transverse spatial profile of a laser mode tends to remain self-similar throughout the entire cavity. Going beyond this paradigm, we demonstrate here how to shape a spatially evolving mode such that it faithfully settles into a pair of bi-orthogonal states at the two opposing facets of a laser cavity. This was achieved by purposely designing a structure that allows the lasing mode to encircle a non-Hermitian exceptional point while deliberately avoiding non-adiabatic jumps. The resulting state transfer reflects the unique topology of the associated Riemann surfaces associated with this singularity. Our approach provides a route to developing versatile mode-selective active devices and sheds light on the interesting topological features of exceptional points.",

Generally, larval \u201csinks\u201d contained twice as much fish biomass as \u201csources\u201d and exhibited greater resilience to human pressure when protected. Despite their potential to support biodiversity persistence and sustainable fisheries, up to 70% of important dispersal corridors, sinks, and source reefs remain unprotected, emphasizing the need for increased protection of networks of well-connected reefs.",

    "abstract": "The Xinjiang region in northwest China is a historically important geographical passage between East and West Eurasia. By sequencing 201 ancient genomes from 39 archaeological sites, we clarify the complex demographic history of this region. Bronze Age Xinjiang populations are characterized by four major ancestries related to Early Bronze Age cultures from the central and eastern Steppe, Central Asian, and Tarim Basin regions. Admixtures between Middle and Late Bronze Age Steppe cultures continued during the Late Bronze and Iron Ages, along with an inflow of East and Central Asian ancestry. Historical era populations show similar admixed and diverse ancestries as those of present-day Xinjiang populations. These results document the influence that East and West Eurasian populations have had over time in the different regions of Xinjiang.",

A synthesis of marine paleotemperature records shows that the MCO was a local maximum in global sea surface temperature superimposed on a period from at least 19 Ma to 10 Ma, during which global temperatures were on the order of 10\u00b0C warmer than at present. Our high-resolution global reconstruction of ocean crustal production, a proxy for tectonic degassing of carbon, suggests that crustal production rates were ~35% higher than modern rates until ~14 Ma, when production began to decline steeply along with global temperatures. The magnitude and timing of the inferred changes in tectonic degassing can account for the majority of long-term ice sheet and global temperature evolution since 20 Ma.",

Many of these fires burned in permafrost peatlands within the Arctic Circle. We show that early snowmelt together with an anomalous Arctic front jet over northeastern Siberia promoted unusually warm and dry surface conditions, followed by anomalously high lightning and fire activity. Since 1966, spring snowmelt has started 1.7 days earlier each decade. Moreover, Arctic front jet occurrences in summer have more than tripled in frequency over the last 40 years. These interconnected climatological drivers promote extreme fire activity in eastern Siberia, including a northward shift of fires, which may accelerate the degradation of carbon-rich permafrost peatlands.",

Using iconic and well-studied fish species such as tunas, billfishes, and sharks, we calculate a continuous Red List Index of yearly changes in extinction risk over 70 years to track progress toward global sustainability and biodiversity targets. We show that this well-established biodiversity indicator is highly sensitive and responsive to fishing mortality. After ~58 years of increasing risk of extinction, effective fisheries management has shifted the biodiversity loss curve for tunas and billfishes, whereas the curve continues to worsen for sharks, which are highly undermanaged. While populations of highly valuable commercial species are being rebuilt, the next management challenge is to halt and reverse the harm afflicted by these same fisheries to broad oceanic biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase maintains genome stability by extending the 3\u2032 telomeric repeats at eukaryotic chromosome ends, thereby counterbalancing progressive loss caused by incomplete genome replication. In mammals, telomerase recruitment to telomeres is mediated by TPP1, which assembles as a heterodimer with POT1. We report structures of DNA-bound telomerase in complex with TPP1 and with TPP1-POT1 at 3.2- and 3.9-angstrom resolution, respectively. Our structures define interactions between telomerase and TPP1-POT1 that are crucial for telomerase recruitment to telomeres. The presence of TPP1-POT1 stabilizes the DNA, revealing an unexpected path by which DNA exits the telomerase active site and a DNA anchor site on telomerase that is important for telomerase processivity. Our findings rationalize extensive prior genetic and biochemical findings and provide a framework for future mechanistic work on telomerase regulation.",

It endows Bloch electrons with transverse anomalous velocities to produce Hall-like currents even in the absence of a magnetic field. We report the direct observation of in situ tunable valley-selective Hall effect (VSHE), where inversion symmetry, and thus the geometric phase of electrons, is controllable by an out-of-plane electric field. We use high-quality bilayer graphene with an intrinsic and tunable bandgap, illuminated by circularly polarized midinfrared light, and confirm that the observed Hall voltage arises from an optically induced valley population. Compared with molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), we find orders of magnitude larger VSHE, attributed to the inverse scaling of the Berry curvature with bandgap. By monitoring the valley-selective Hall conductivity, we study the Berry curvature\u2019s evolution with bandgap. This in situ manipulation of VSHE paves the way for topological and quantum geometric optoelectronic devices, such as more robust switches and detectors.",

    "abstract": "Early naturalists suggested that predation intensity increases toward the tropics, affecting fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes by latitude, but empirical support is still limited. Several studies have measured consumption rates across latitude at large scales, with variable results. Moreover, how predation affects prey community composition at such geographic scales remains unknown. Using standardized experiments that spanned 115\u00b0 of latitude, at 36 nearshore sites along both coasts of the Americas, we found that marine predators have both higher consumption rates and consistently stronger impacts on biomass and species composition of marine invertebrate communities in warmer tropical waters, likely owing to fish predators. Our results provide robust support for a temperature-dependent gradient in interaction strength and have potential implications for how marine ecosystems will respond to ocean warming.",

Of these syntheses, more than 50 entries from the database have been downloaded and robotically run in seven modular chemputers with yields and purities comparable to those achieved by an expert chemist. We also demonstrate the automatic purification of a range of compounds using a chromatography module seamlessly coupled to the platform and programmed with the same language.",

Traditionally, this is accomplished with surface-modifying chemical agents. Using experiment and theory, we studied how mechanical activity shapes soft interfaces that separate an active and a passive fluid. Chaotic flows in the active fluid give rise to giant interfacial fluctuations and noninertial propagating active waves. At high activities, stresses disrupt interface continuity and drive droplet generation, producing an emulsion-like active state composed of finite-sized droplets. When in contact with a solid boundary, active interfaces exhibit nonequilibrium wetting transitions, in which the fluid climbs the wall against gravity. These results demonstrate the promise of mechanically driven interfaces for creating a new class of soft active matter.",

In several mammals, the envelope proteins encoded by these elements protect against exogenous viruses, but this activity has not been documented with endogenously expressed envelopes in humans. We report that the human genome harbors a large pool of envelope-derived sequences with the potential to restrict retroviral infection. To test this, we characterized an envelope-derived protein, Suppressyn. We found that Suppressyn is expressed in human preimplantation embryos and developing placenta using its ancestral retroviral promoter. Cell culture assays showed that Suppressyn , and its hominoid orthologs, could restrict infection by extant mammalian type D retroviruses. Our data support a generalizable model of retroviral envelope co-option for host immunity and genome defense.",

Leveraging such protection requires testing its robustness against uncontrolled environmental interactions. Using 47 superconducting qubits, we implement the one-dimensional kicked Ising model, which exhibits nonlocal Majorana edge modes (MEMs) with \u2124 2 parity symmetry. We find that any multiqubit Pauli operator overlapping with the MEMs exhibits a uniform late-time decay rate comparable to single-qubit relaxation rates, irrespective of its size or composition. This characteristic allows us to accurately reconstruct the exponentially localized spatial profiles of the MEMs. Furthermore, the MEMs are found to be resilient against certain symmetry-breaking noise owing to a prethermalization mechanism. Our work elucidates the complex interplay between noise and symmetry-protected edge modes in a solid-state environment.",

    "abstract": "Heterologous prime-boost immunization strategies have the potential to augment COVID-19 vaccine efficacy. We longitudinally profiled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S)\u2013specific serological and memory B cell (MBC) responses in individuals who received either homologous (ChAdOx1:ChAdOx1) or heterologous (ChAdOx1:mRNA-1273) prime-boost vaccination. Heterologous messenger RNA (mRNA) booster immunization induced higher serum neutralizing antibody and MBC responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) compared with that of homologous ChAdOx1 boosting. Specificity mapping of circulating B cells revealed that mRNA-1273 boost immunofocused ChAdOx1-primed responses onto epitopes expressed on prefusion-stabilized S. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from mRNA-1273\u2013boosted participants displayed overall higher binding affinities and increased breadth of reactivity against VOCs relative to those isolated from ChAdOx1-boosted individuals. Overall, the results provide molecular insight into the enhanced quality of the B cell response induced after heterologous mRNA booster vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Quantum walks provide a framework for designing quantum algorithms that is both intuitive and universal. To leverage the computational power of these walks, it is important to be able to programmably modify the graph a walker traverses while maintaining coherence. We do this by combining the fast, programmable control provided by optical tweezers with the scalable, homogeneous environment of an optical lattice. With these tools we study continuous-time quantum walks of single atoms on a square lattice and perform proof-of-principle demonstrations of spatial search with these walks. When scaled to more particles, the capabilities demonstrated can be extended to study a variety of problems in quantum information science, including performing more effective versions of spatial search using a larger graph with increased connectivity.",

In this study, high concentrations of OH radicals were found when people were exposed to ozone in a climate-controlled chamber. OH concentrations calculated by two methods using measurements of total OH reactivity, speciated alkenes, and oxidation products were consistent with those obtained from a chemically explicit model. Key to establishing this human-induced oxidation field is 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO), which forms when ozone reacts with the skin-oil squalene and subsequently generates OH efficiently through gas-phase reaction with ozone. A dynamic model was used to show the spatial extent of the human-generated OH oxidation field and its dependency on ozone influx through ventilation. This finding has implications for the oxidation, lifetime, and perception of chemicals indoors and, ultimately, human health.",

We show in a DS model (Ts65Dn mice) that these progressive nonreproductive neurological symptoms closely parallel a postpubertal decrease in hypothalamic as well as extrahypothalamic expression of a master molecule that controls reproduction\u2014gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)\u2014and appear related to an imbalance in a microRNA-gene network known to regulate GnRH neuron maturation together with altered hippocampal synaptic transmission. Epigenetic, cellular, chemogenetic, and pharmacological interventions that restore physiological GnRH levels abolish olfactory and cognitive defects in Ts65Dn mice, whereas pulsatile GnRH therapy improves cognition and brain connectivity in adult DS patients. GnRH thus plays a crucial role in olfaction and cognition, and pulsatile GnRH therapy holds promise to improve cognitive deficits in DS.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian cells can generate amino acids through macropinocytosis and lysosomal breakdown of extracellular proteins, which is exploited by cancer cells to grow in nutrient-poor tumors. Through genetic screens in defined nutrient conditions, we characterized LYSET, a transmembrane protein (TMEM251) selectively required when cells consume extracellular proteins. LYSET was found to associate in the Golgi with GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, which targets catabolic enzymes to lysosomes through mannose-6-phosphate modification. Without LYSET, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase was unstable because of a hydrophilic transmembrane domain. Consequently, LYSET-deficient cells were depleted of lysosomal enzymes and impaired in turnover of macropinocytic and autophagic cargoes. Thus, LYSET represents a core component of the lysosomal enzyme trafficking pathway, underlies the pathomechanism for hereditary lysosomal storage disorders, and may represent a target to suppress metabolic adaptations in cancer.",

At depths of 36 to 43 kilometers, we resolve a 15-kilometers-long collection of near-horizontal sheeted structures that we identify as a sill complex. These sills connect to the lower depths of K\u012blauea\u2019s plumbing by a 25-kilometers-long belt of seismicity. Additionally, a column of seismicity links the sill complex to a shallow d\u00e9collement near Mauna Loa. These findings implicate the mantle sill complex as a nexus for magma transport beneath Hawai\u2018i and furthermore indicate widespread magmatic connectivity in the volcanic system.",

Although we know that innate immune cells infiltrate the niche in response to injury, it remains unclear how MuSCs adapt to this altered environment for initiating repair. Here, we demonstrate that inflammatory cytokine signaling from the regenerative niche impairs the ability of quiescent MuSCs to reenter the cell cycle. The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase JMJD3, but not UTX, allowed MuSCs to overcome inhibitory inflammation signaling by removing trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) marks at the Has2 locus to initiate production of hyaluronic acid, which in turn established an extracellular matrix competent for integrating signals that direct MuSCs to exit quiescence. Thus, JMJD3-driven hyaluronic acid synthesis plays a proregenerative role that allows MuSC adaptation to inflammation and the initiation of muscle repair.",

During the first postnatal week, HD mice have less cortical layer 2/3 excitatory synaptic activity than wild-type mice, express fewer glutamatergic receptors, and show sensorimotor deficits. The circuit self-normalizes in the second postnatal week but the mice nonetheless develop HD. Pharmacologically enhancing glutamatergic transmission during the neonatal period, however, rescues these deficits and preserves sensorimotor function, cognition, and spine and synapse density as well as brain region volume in HD adult mice.",

To track cell-cell contacts in vivo, we developed an intercellular genetic technology to monitor cell-cell contact and to trace cell contact histories by permanently marking contacts between cells. In mice, we engineered an artificial Notch ligand into one cell (the sender cell) and an artificial receptor into another cell (the receiver cell). Contact between the sender and receiver cells triggered a synthetic Notch signaling that activated downstream transcriptional programs in the receiver cell, thereby transiently or permanently labeling it. In vivo cell-cell contact was observed during development, tissue homeostasis, and tumor growth. This technology may be useful for studying dynamic in vivo cell-cell contacts and cell fate plasticity.",

Here, we show that relatively few allopatric pairs of birds, mammals, or amphibians exhibit trait differences consistent with models of divergent adaptation in each of many ecologically relevant traits. By fitting new evolutionary models to numerous sets of sister-pair trait differences, we find that speciating and recently speciated allopatric taxa seem to overwhelmingly evolve under similar rather than divergent macro\u2013selective pressures. This contradicts the classical view of divergent adaptation as a prominent driver of the early stages of speciation and helps synthesize two historical controversies regarding the ecology and geography of species formation.",

We refer to this phenotype as antibiotic resilience. ResR acts in a regulatory cascade with other transcription factors controlling cell growth and division, which are also under positive selection in clinical isolates of Mtb .

The India-Asia collision further facilitated the dispersal of dipterocarps from India to similar climatic zones in Southeast Asia, which supports their out-of-India migration. The dispersal pathway suggested for Dipterocarpaceae may provide a framework for an alternative biogeographic hypothesis for several megathermal angiosperm families that are presently widely distributed in Southeast Asia.",

    "abstract": "We discovered a highly virulent variant of subtype-B HIV-1 in the Netherlands. One hundred nine individuals with this variant had a 0.54 to 0.74 log 10 increase (i.e., a ~3.5-fold to 5.5-fold increase) in viral load compared with, and exhibited CD4 cell decline twice as fast as, 6604 individuals with other subtype-B strains. Without treatment, advanced HIV\u2014CD4 cell counts below 350 cells per cubic millimeter, with long-term clinical consequences\u2014is expected to be reached, on average, 9 months after diagnosis for individuals in their thirties with this variant. Age, sex, suspected mode of transmission, and place of birth for the aforementioned 109 individuals were typical for HIV-positive people in the Netherlands, which suggests that the increased virulence is attributable to the viral strain. Genetic sequence analysis suggests that this variant arose in the 1990s from de novo mutation, not recombination, with increased transmissibility and an unfamiliar molecular mechanism of virulence.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcribes chromatin and must move past nucleosomes, often resulting in nucleosome displacement. How Pol II unwraps the DNA from nucleosomes to allow transcription and how DNA rewraps to retain nucleosomes has been unclear. Here, we report the 3.0-angstrom cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of a mammalian Pol II-DSIF-SPT6-PAF1c-TFIIS-nucleosome complex stalled 54 base pairs within the nucleosome. The structure provides a mechanistic basis for nucleosome retention during transcription elongation where upstream DNA emerging from the Pol II cleft has rewrapped the proximal side of the nucleosome. The structure uncovers a direct role for Pol II and transcription elongation factors in nucleosome retention and explains how nucleosomes are retained to prevent the disruption of chromatin structure across actively transcribed genes.",

Despite extensive research, the mechanistic details of ATP-dependent energy transduction and dinitrogen reduction by nitrogenase are not well understood, requiring new strategies to monitor its structural dynamics during catalytic action. Here, we report cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of the nitrogenase complex prepared under enzymatic turnover conditions. We observe that asymmetry governs all aspects of the nitrogenase mechanism, including ATP hydrolysis, protein-protein interactions, and catalysis. Conformational changes near the catalytic iron-molybdenum cofactor are correlated with the nucleotide-hydrolysis state of the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Genetic admixture is central to primate evolution. We combined 50 years of field observations of immigration and group demography with genomic data from ~9 generations of hybrid baboons to investigate the consequences of admixture in the wild. Despite no obvious fitness costs to hybrids, we found signatures of selection against admixture similar to those described for archaic hominins. These patterns were concentrated near genes where ancestry is strongly associated with gene expression. Our analyses also show that introgression is partially predictable across the genome. This study demonstrates the value of integrating genomic and field data for revealing how \u201cgenomic signatures of selection\u201d (e.g., reduced introgression in low-recombination regions) manifest in nature; moreover, it underscores the importance of other primates as living models for human evolution.",

Do they reveal gaze shifts in the virtual environment of dreams or simply reflect random brainstem activity? We harnessed the head direction (HD) system of the mouse thalamus, a neuronal population whose activity reports, in awake mice, their actual HD as they explore their environment and, in sleeping mice, their virtual HD. We discovered that the direction and amplitude of rapid eye movements during REM sleep reveal the direction and amplitude of the ongoing changes in virtual HD. Thus, rapid eye movements disclose gaze shifts in the virtual world of REM sleep, thereby providing a window into the cognitive processes of the sleeping brain.",

In this work, we describe a complementary paradigm for the synthesis of chiral molecules and their isomers, which tunes the three-dimensional structure of a molecule at a late stage. Key to the success of this strategy is the development of a mild and highly general photocatalytic method composed of decatungstate polyanion and disulfide cocatalysts, which enable the interconversion of unactivated tertiary stereogenic centers that were previously configurationally fixed. We showcase the versatility of this method\u2014and the implementation of stereoediting logic\u2014by the rapid construction of chiral scaffolds that would be challenging to access using existing tools and by the late-stage stereoediting of complex targets.",

We show that endosomal signaling lipid turnover by MTM1, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] 3-phosphatase mutated in X-linked centronuclear myopathy in humans, controls mitochondrial morphology and function by reshaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Starvation-induced endosomal recruitment of MTM1 impairs PI(3)P-dependent contact formation between tubular ER membranes and early endosomes, resulting in the conversion of ER tubules into sheets, the inhibition of mitochondrial fission, and sustained oxidative metabolism. Our results unravel an important role for early endosomal lipid signaling in controlling ER shape and, thereby, mitochondrial form and function to enable cells to adapt to fluctuating nutrient environments.",

We describe the trogocytic acquisition of these molecules from conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Complement component 3 (C3) binds to murine and human MHC II on cDCs. MZ B cells recognize C3 with complement receptor 2 (CR2) and trogocytose the MHC II\u2013C3 complexes, which become exposed on their cell surface. The ubiquitin ligase MARCH1 limits the number of MHC II\u2013C3 complexes displayed on cDCs to prevent their elimination through excessive trogocytosis.

The designs are stable, folded, and soluble in isolation and rapidly assemble upon mixing, and crystal structures are close to the computational models. We construct linearly arranged hetero-oligomers with up to six different components, branched hetero-oligomers, closed C4-symmetric two-component rings, and hetero-oligomers assembled on a cyclic homo-oligomeric central hub and demonstrate that such complexes can readily reconfigure through subunit exchange.

In contrast to this \u201cnegative gain,\u201d optogenetic probing showed increased within-field excitability in place cells by weakening I and unmasked stable place fields in initially non\u2013place cells.

CD97 function required its autoproteolytic cleavage. CD55 is a CD97 ligand, and cDC2 interaction with CD55-expressing red blood cells (RBCs) under shear stress conditions caused extraction of the regulatory CD97 N-terminal fragment. Deficiency in CD55-CD97 signaling led to loss of splenic cDC2s into the circulation and defective lymphocyte responses to blood-borne antigens. Thus, CD97 mechanosensing of RBCs establishes a migration and gene expression program that optimizes the antigen capture and presentation functions of splenic cDC2s.",

Yet, discrepancies between molecular divergence estimates and the fossil record fuel ongoing debate around the timing, tempo, and drivers of this radiation. Analysis of a three-dimensional skull dataset for living and extinct placental mammals demonstrates that evolutionary rates peak early and attenuate quickly. This long-term decline in tempo is punctuated by bursts of innovation that decreased in amplitude over the past 66 million years. Social, precocial, aquatic, and herbivorous species evolve fastest, especially whales, elephants, sirenians, and extinct ungulates. Slow rates in rodents and bats indicate dissociation of taxonomic and morphological diversification. Frustratingly, highly similar ancestral shape estimates for placental mammal superorders suggest that their earliest representatives may continue to elude unequivocal identification.",

Recently, additional genes with non-nuclease functions have been found in genetic association with CRISPR systems, suggesting that there may be other RNA-guided non-nucleolytic enzymes. One such gene from Desulfonema ishimotonii encodes the TPR-CHAT protease Csx29, which is associated with the CRISPR effector Cas7-11. Here, we demonstrate that this CRISPR-associated protease (CASP) exhibits programmable RNA-activated endopeptidase activity against a sigma factor inhibitor to regulate a transcriptional response. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy of an active and substrate-bound CASP complex reveals an allosteric activation mechanism that reorganizes Csx29 catalytic residues upon target RNA binding.

We investigated the determinants of human WT in 5604 people from the ages of 8 days to 96 years from 23 countries using isotope-tracking ( 2 H) methods. Age, body size, and composition were significantly associated with WT, as were physical activity, athletic status, pregnancy, socioeconomic status, and environmental characteristics (latitude, altitude, air temperature, and humidity). People who lived in countries with a low human development index (HDI) had higher WT than people in high-HDI countries. On the basis of this extensive dataset, we provide equations to predict human WT in relation to anthropometric, economic, and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "In thermodynamic equilibrium, current in metallic systems is carried by electronic states near the Fermi energy, whereas the filled bands underneath contribute little to conduction. Here, we describe a very different regime in which carrier distribution in graphene and its superlattices is shifted so far from equilibrium that the filled bands start playing an essential role, leading to a critical-current behavior. The criticalities develop upon the velocity of electron flow reaching the Fermi velocity. Key signatures of the out-of-equilibrium state are current-voltage characteristics that resemble those of superconductors, sharp peaks in differential resistance, sign reversal of the Hall effect, and a marked anomaly caused by the Schwinger-like production of hot electron-hole plasma. The observed behavior is expected to be common to all graphene-based superlattices.",

Here, we developed protein-based motors that move on DNA nanotubes by combining a biomolecular motor dynein and DNA binding proteins. The new motors and DNA-based nanoarchitectures enabled us to arrange the binding sites on the track, locally control the direction of movement, and achieve multiplexed cargo transport by different motors. The integration of these technologies realized microscale cargo sorters and integrators that automatically transport molecules as programmed in DNA sequences on a branched DNA nanotube.

We found that cancer cells maintain viability during irradiation by reversibly increasing genome-wide DNA breaks, thereby limiting premature mitotic progression. We identify caspase-activated DNase (CAD) as the nuclease inflicting these de novo DNA lesions at defined loci, which are in proximity to chromatin-modifying CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites. CAD nuclease activity is governed through phosphorylation by DNA damage response kinases, independent of caspase activity. In turn, loss of CAD activity impairs cell fate decisions, rendering cancer cells vulnerable to radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Our observations highlight a cancer-selective survival adaptation, whereby tumor cells deploy regulated DNA breaks to delimit the detrimental effects of therapy-evoked DNA damage.",

Herein, we report a general strategy for the modular synthesis of disubstituted cyclohexanes with excellent kinetic stereocontrol from readily accessible substituted methylenecyclohexanes by the implementation of chain-walking catalysis. Mechanistically, the initial introduction of a sterically demanding boron ester group adjacent to the cyclohexane is key to guiding the stereochemical outcome.

In this work, we identified a component of immune evasion that involves frequent up-regulation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in solid tumors. FMRP represses immune attack, as revealed by cancer cells engineered to lack its expression. FMRP-deficient tumors were infiltrated by activated T cells that impaired tumor growth and enhanced survival in mice. Mechanistically, FMRP\u2019s immunosuppression was multifactorial, involving repression of the chemoattractant C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) concomitant with up-regulation of three immunomodulators\u2014interleukin-33 (IL-33), tumor-secreted protein S (PROS1), and extracellular vesicles. Gene signatures associate FMRP\u2019s cancer network with poor prognosis and response to therapy in cancer patients. Collectively, FMRP is implicated as a regulator that orchestrates a multifaceted barrier to antitumor immune responses.",

We used haploid genetic screens to identify an unannotated protein, microtubule associated tyrosine carboxypeptidase (MATCAP), as a remaining detyrosinating enzyme. X-ray crystallography and cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures established MATCAP\u2019s cleaving mechanism, substrate specificity, and microtubule recognition. Paradoxically, whereas abrogation of tyrosine religation is lethal in mice, codeletion of MATCAP and SVBP is not.

Contrary to this model, we show here that removing Hippo transcriptional output did not impair the ability of the mouse liver and Drosophila eyes to grow to their normal size. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of the Hippo pathway effectors Yap/Taz/Yki did not correlate with cell proliferation, and hyperactivation of these effectors induced gene expression programs that did not recapitulate normal development. Concordantly, a functional screen in Drosophila identified several Hippo pathway target genes that were required for ectopic overgrowth but not normal growth. Thus, Hippo signaling does not instruct normal growth, and the Hippo-induced overgrowth phenotypes are caused by the activation of abnormal genetic programs.",

We used three-dimensional high-resolution imaging of more than 2000 human oocytes to identify a structure that we named the human oocyte microtubule organizing center (huoMTOC). The proteins TACC3, CCP110, CKAP5, and DISC1 were found to be essential components of the huoMTOC. The huoMTOC arises beneath the oocyte cortex and migrates adjacent to the nuclear envelope before nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). After NEBD, the huoMTOC fragments and relocates on the kinetochores to initiate microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly. Disrupting the huoMTOC led to spindle assembly defects and oocyte maturation arrest. These results reveal a physiological mechanism of huoMTOC-regulated spindle assembly in human oocytes.",

Most peroxisomal proteins are imported from the cytosol in a folded state by the soluble receptor PEX5. How folded cargo crosses the membrane is unknown. Here, we show that peroxisomal import is similar to nuclear transport. The peroxisomal membrane protein PEX13 contains a conserved tyrosine (Y)\u2013 and glycine (G)\u2013rich YG domain, which forms a selective phase resembling that formed by phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats within nuclear pores. PEX13 resides in the membrane in two orientations that oligomerize and suspend the YG meshwork within the lipid bilayer. Purified YG domains form hydrogels into which PEX5 selectively partitions, by using conserved aromatic amino acid motifs, bringing cargo along. The YG meshwork thus forms an aqueous conduit through which PEX5 delivers folded proteins into peroxisomes.",

We report that metalated phosphorus ylides provide facile access to ketenyl anions ([RC=C=O] \u2013 ) by phosphine displacement with CO.

    "abstract": "Isoprene is emitted mainly by terrestrial vegetation and is the dominant volatile organic compound (VOC) in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. It plays key roles in determining the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere and the formation of organic aerosol. Daytime infrared satellite observations of isoprene reported here broadly agree with emission inventories, but we found substantial differences in the locations and magnitudes of isoprene hotspots, consistent with a recent study. The corresponding nighttime infrared observations reveal unexpected hotspots over tropical South America, the Congo basin, and Southeast Asia. We used an atmospheric chemistry model to link these nighttime isoprene measurements to low-NO x regions with high biogenic VOC emissions; at sunrise the remaining isoprene can lead to the production of epoxydiols and subsequently to the widespread seasonal production of organic aerosol in the tropical upper troposphere.",

    "abstract": "Bivalent genes are ready for activation upon the arrival of developmental cues. Here, we report that BEND3 is a CpG island (CGI)\u2013binding protein that is enriched at regulatory elements. The cocrystal structure of BEND3 in complex with its target DNA reveals the structural basis for its DNA methylation\u2013sensitive binding property. Mouse embryos ablated of Bend3 died at the pregastrulation stage. Bend3 null embryonic stem cells (ESCs) exhibited severe defects in differentiation, during which hundreds of CGI-containing bivalent genes were prematurely activated. BEND3 is required for the stable association of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) at bivalent genes that are highly occupied by BEND3, which suggests a reining function of BEND3 in maintaining high levels of H3K27me3 at these bivalent genes in ESCs to prevent their premature activation in the forthcoming developmental stage.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to nutrient scarcity involves an orchestrated response of metabolic and signaling pathways to maintain homeostasis. We find that in the fat body of fasting Drosophila , lysosomal export of cystine coordinates remobilization of internal nutrient stores with reactivation of the growth regulator target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). Mechanistically, cystine was reduced to cysteine and metabolized to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by promoting CoA metabolism. In turn, acetyl-CoA retained carbons from alternative amino acids in the form of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and restricted the availability of building blocks required for growth. This process limited TORC1 reactivation to maintain autophagy and allowed animals to cope with starvation periods. We propose that cysteine metabolism mediates a communication between lysosomes and mitochondria, highlighting how changes in diet divert the fate of an amino acid into a growth suppressive program.",

The shock generated when ejected material slams into the companion star\u2019s wind can accelerate particles. We report very-high-energy (VHE; \u2273 100 giga\u2013electron volts ) gamma rays from the recurrent nova RS\u00a0Ophiuchi, up to 1 month after its 2021 outburst, observed using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). The temporal profile of VHE emission is similar to that of lower-energy giga\u2013electron volt emission, indicating a common origin, with a 2-day delay in peak flux. These observations constrain models of time-dependent particle energization, favoring a hadronic emission scenario over the leptonic alternative. Shocks in dense winds provide favorable environments for efficient acceleration of cosmic rays to very high energies.",

Selective AMYR agonists and dual AMYR/CTR agonists are being developed as obesity treatments; however, the molecular basis for peptide binding and selectivity is unknown. We determined the structure and dynamics of active AMYRs with amylin, AMY 1 R with salmon CT (sCT), AMY 2 R with sCT or human CT (hCT), and CTR with amylin, sCT, or hCT. The conformation of amylin-bound complexes was similar for all AMYRs, constrained by the RAMP, and an ordered midpeptide motif that we call the bypass motif. The CT-bound AMYR complexes were distinct, overlapping the CT-bound CTR complexes. Our findings indicate that activation of AMYRs by CT-based peptides is distinct from their activation by amylin-based peptides. This has important implications for the development of AMYR therapeutics.",

Assembly of both BCR complexes involves their extracellular domains, membrane-proximal connection peptides, and transmembrane (TM) helices. The TM helices of mIgG and mIgM share a conserved set of hydrophobic and polar interactions with Ig\u03b1/\u03b2 TM helices. By contrast, the IgG-C\u03b33 and IgM-C\u03bc4 domains interact with extracellular Ig-like domains of Ig\u03b1/\u03b2 through head-to-tail and side-by-side modes, respectively.

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are key degradative compartments of the cell. Transport to lysosomes relies on GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase\u2013mediated tagging of soluble enzymes with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P). GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase deficiency leads to the severe lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis II (MLII). Several viruses require lysosomal cathepsins to cleave structural proteins and thus depend on functional GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. We used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor (LYSET, also named TMEM251) as essential for infection by cathepsin-dependent viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). LYSET deficiency resulted in global loss of M6P tagging and mislocalization of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase from the Golgi complex to lysosomes. Lyset knockout mice exhibited MLII-like phenotypes, and human pathogenic LYSET alleles failed to restore lysosomal sorting defects. Thus, LYSET is required for correct functioning of the M6P trafficking machinery and mutations in LYSET can explain the phenotype of the associated disorder.",

    "abstract": "There has been substantial research on adult COVID-19 and how to treat it. But how do severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections afflict children? The COVID-19 pandemic has yielded many surprises, not least that children generally develop less severe disease than older adults, which is unusual for a respiratory disease. However, some children can develop serious complications from COVID-19, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and Long Covid, even after mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. Why this occurs in some and not others is an important question. Moreover, when children do contract COVID-19, understanding their role in transmission, especially in schools and at home, is crucial to ensuring effective mitigation measures. Therefore, in addition to nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as improved ventilation, there is a strong case to vaccinate children so as to reduce possible long-term effects from infection and to decrease transmission. But questions remain about whether vaccination might skew immune responses to variants in the long term. As the experts discuss below, more is being learned about these important issues, but much more research is needed to understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 in children.",

Fabrication of such complex systems is currently challenging because high-quality three-dimensional (3D) nanoprinting is mostly limited to simple, homogeneous materials. We report a strategy for the rapid nanoprinting of complex structural nanocomposites using metal nanoclusters. These ultrasmall, quantum-confined nanoclusters function as highly sensitive two-photon activators and simultaneously serve as precursors for mechanical reinforcements and nanoscale porogens. Nanocomposites with complex 3D architectures are printed, as well as structures with tunable, hierarchical, and anisotropic nanoporosity. Nanocluster-polymer nanolattices exhibit high specific strength, energy absorption, deformability, and recoverability. This framework provides a generalizable, versatile approach for the use of photoactive nanomaterials in additive manufacturing of complex systems with emergent mechanical properties.",

Through genome analysis of present-day and historical samples spanning environments over the past two centuries, we studied the effect of these changes in farming on the extent and tempo of evolution across the native range of the common waterhemp ( Amaranthus tuberculatus ), a now pervasive agricultural weed. Modern agriculture has imposed strengths of selection rarely observed in the wild, with notable shifts in allele frequency trajectories since agricultural intensification in the 1960s. An evolutionary response to this extreme selection was facilitated by a concurrent human-mediated range shift. By reshaping genome-wide diversity across the landscape, agriculture has driven the success of this weed in the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "Superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) are competitive, yet coexisting, orders in cuprate superconductors. To understand their microscopic interdependence, a probe capable of discerning their interaction on its natural length and time scale is necessary. We use ultrafast resonant soft x-ray scattering to track the transient evolution of CDW correlations in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x after the quench of superconductivity by an infrared laser pulse. We observe a nonthermal response of the CDW order characterized by a near doubling of the correlation length within \u22481 picosecond of the superconducting quench. Our results are consistent with a model in which the interaction between superconductivity and CDWs manifests inhomogeneously through disruption of spatial coherence, with superconductivity playing the dominant role in stabilizing CDW topological defects, such as discommensurations.",

    "abstract": "In most organisms, reproduction is correlated with shorter life span. However, the reproductive queen in eusocial insects exhibits a much longer life span than that of workers. In Harpegnathos ants, when the queen dies, workers can undergo an adult caste switch to reproductive pseudo-queens (gamergates), exhibiting a five-times prolonged life span. To explore the relation between reproduction and longevity, we compared gene expression during caste switching. Insulin expression is increased in the gamergate brain that correlates with increased lipid synthesis and production of vitellogenin in the fat body, both transported to the egg. This results from activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) branch of the insulin signaling pathway. By contrast, the production in the gamergate developing ovary of anti-insulin Imp-L2 leads to decreased signaling of the AKT/forkhead box O (FOXO) branch in the fat body, which is consistent with their extended longevity.",

Through analyses in the UM-HET3 mice of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), we detected a sex-independent quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 12 and identified sex-specific QTLs, some of which we detected only in older mice. Similar relations between life history and longevity were uncovered in mice and humans, underscoring the importance of early access to nutrients and early growth. We identified common age- and sex-specific genetic effects on gene expression that we integrated with model organism and human data to create a hypothesis-building interactive resource of prioritized longevity and body weight genes. Finally, we validated Hipk1 , Ddost , Hspg2 , Fgd6 , and Pdk1 as conserved longevity genes using Caenorhabditis elegans life-span experiments.",

Noble gas concentrations are higher than those in Ivuna-type carbonaceous (CI) chondrite meteorites. Several host phases of isotopically distinct nitrogen have different abundances among the samples. Our measurements support a close relationship between Ryugu and CI chondrites.

    "abstract": "Lead poisoning occurs worldwide in populations of predatory birds, but exposure rates and population impacts are known only from regional studies. We evaluated the lead exposure of 1210 bald and golden eagles from 38 US states across North America, including 620 live eagles. We detected unexpectedly high frequencies of lead poisoning of eagles, both chronic (46 to 47% of bald and golden eagles, as measured in bone) and acute (27 to 33% of bald eagles and 7 to 35% of golden eagles, as measured in liver, blood, and feathers). Frequency of lead poisoning was influenced by age and, for bald eagles, by region and season. Continent-wide demographic modeling suggests that poisoning at this level suppresses population growth rates for bald eagles by 3.8% (95% confidence interval: 2.5%, 5.4%) and for golden eagles by 0.8% (0.7%, 0.9%). Lead poisoning is an underappreciated but important constraint on continent-wide populations of these iconic protected species.",

At half-filling of the valence flat band, a broad absorption peak emerges at ~18 milli\u2013electron volts, indicating direct optical excitation across an emerging Mott gap.

Although conceptually appealing, such CPAs are limited so far to a single, judiciously shaped wavefront or mode. Here, we demonstrate how this limitation can be overcome by time-reversing a degenerate cavity laser based on a unique cavity that self-images any incident light field onto itself. Placing a weak, critically coupled absorber into this cavity, any incoming wavefront, even a complex and dynamically varying speckle pattern, is absorbed with close to perfect efficiency in a massively parallel interference process. These characteristics open up interesting new possibilities for applications in light harvesting, energy delivery, light control, and imaging.",

Previous studies of climate impacts on extreme precipitation have focused mainly on daily rain totals. Subdaily extremes are often generated in small areas that can be missed by gauge networks or satellites and are not resolved by climate models. Here, we show a robust positive trend of at least 20% per decade in subhourly extreme rainfall near Sydney, Australia, over 20 years, despite no evidence of trends at hourly or daily scales. This trend is seen consistently in storms tracked using multiple independent ground radars, is consistent with rain-gauge data, and does not appear to be associated with known natural variations. This finding suggests that subhourly rainfall extremes may be increasing substantially faster than those on more widely reported time scales.",

In most molecular collisions, particles react or are lost near short range with unity probability, leading to the so-called universal rate. By contrast, the Na + NaLi system was shown to have only ~4% loss probability in a fully spin-polarized state. By controlling the phase of the scattering wave function via a Feshbach resonance, we modified the loss rate by more than a factor of 100, from far below to far above the universal limit. The results are explained in analogy with an optical Fabry-Perot resonator by interference of reflections at short and long range. Our work demonstrates quantum control of chemistry by magnetic fields with the full dynamic range predicted by our models.",

Placental mammals have particularly enlarged brains, with expanded neocortices for sensory integration, the origins of which are unclear. We used computed tomography scans of newly discovered Paleocene fossils to show that contrary to the convention that mammal brains have steadily enlarged over time, early placentals initially decreased their relative brain sizes because body mass increased at a faster rate. Later in the Eocene, multiple crown lineages independently acquired highly encephalized brains through marked growth in sensory regions. We argue that the placental radiation initially emphasized increases in body size as extinction survivors filled vacant niches. Brains eventually became larger as ecosystems saturated and competition intensified.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis of cells and their subsequent removal through efferocytosis occurs in nearly all tissues during development, homeostasis, and disease. However, it has been difficult to track cell death and subsequent corpse removal in vivo. We developed a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, CharON (Caspase and pH Activated Reporter, Fluorescence ON), that could track emerging apoptotic cells and their efferocytic clearance by phagocytes. Using Drosophila expressing CharON, we uncovered multiple qualitative and quantitative features of coordinated clearance of apoptotic corpses during embryonic development. When confronted with high rates of emerging apoptotic corpses, the macrophages displayed heterogeneity in engulfment behaviors, leading to some efferocytic macrophages carrying high corpse burden. Overburdened macrophages were compromised in clearing wound debris. These findings reveal known and unexpected features of apoptosis and macrophage efferocytosis in vivo.",

We combined a robotic platform with machine learning to experimentally measure and theoretically model CD8 + T cell activation. High-dimensional cytokine dynamics could be compressed onto a low-dimensional latent space in an antigen-specific manner (so-called \u201cantigen encoding\u201d). We used antigen encoding to model and reconstruct patterns of T cell immune activation. The model delineated six classes of antigens eliciting distinct T cell responses. We generalized antigen encoding to multiple immune settings, including drug perturbations and activation of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Such universal antigen encoding for T cell activation may enable further modeling of immune responses and their rational manipulation to optimize immunotherapies.",

However, keeping modification sites in registration with a nanotube lattice is challenging. We report a solution using DNA-directed, guanine (G)-specific cross-linking chemistry. Through DNA screening we identify a sequence, C 3 GC 7 GC 3 , whose reaction with an (8,3) enantiomer yields minimum disorder-induced Raman mode intensities and photoluminescence Stokes shift, suggesting ordered defect array formation. Single-particle cryo\u2013electron microscopy shows that the C 3 GC 7 GC 3 functionalized (8,3) has an ordered helical structure with a 6.5 angstroms periodicity. Reaction mechanism analysis suggests that the helical periodicity arises from an array of G-modified carbon-carbon bonds separated by a fixed distance along an armchair helical line. Our findings may be used to remodel nanotube lattices for novel electronic properties.",

Despite their importance, there are no described quality assurance mechanisms for newly formed stem cells. We observed intimate and specific interactions between macrophages and nascent blood stem cells in zebrafish embryos. Macrophage interactions frequently led to either removal of cytoplasmic material and stem cell division or complete engulfment and stem cell death. Stressed stem cells were marked by surface Calreticulin, which stimulated macrophage interactions. Using cellular barcoding, we found that Calreticulin knock-down or embryonic macrophage depletion reduced the number of stem cell clones that established adult hematopoiesis. Our work supports a model in which embryonic macrophages determine hematopoietic clonality by monitoring stem cell quality.",

We found that TONSOKU (TSK/TONSL), which rescues broken replication forks, specifically interacts with H3.1 via recognition of alanine 31 by its tetratricopeptide repeat domain. Our results indicate that genomic instability in the absence of ATXR5/ATXR6-catalyzed histone H3 lysine 27 monomethylation in plants depends on H3.1, TSK, and DNA polymerase theta (Pol \u03b8). This work reveals an H3.1-specific function during replication and a common strategy used in multicellular eukaryotes for regulating post-replicative chromatin maturation and TSK, which relies on histone monomethyltransferases and reading of the H3.1 variant.",

Typically, brains had 20 to 60 detectable single-nucleotide mutations, but ~6% of brains harbored hundreds of somatic mutations. Hypermutability was associated with age and damaging mutations in genes implicated in cancers and, in some brains, reflected in vivo clonal expansions. Somatic duplications, likely arising during development, were found in ~5% of normal and diseased brains, reflecting background mutagenesis. Brains with autism were associated with mutations creating putative transcription factor binding motifs in enhancer-like regions in the developing brain. The top-ranked affected motifs corresponded to MEIS (myeloid ectopic viral integration site) transcription factors, suggesting a potential link between their involvement in gene regulation and autism.",

We identify a signaling pathway that regulates the local synthesis of proteins required to form excitatory synapses on parvalbumin-expressing (PV + ) interneurons in the mouse cerebral cortex. This process involves regulation of the TSC subunit 2 (Tsc2) by the Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4), which enables local control of messenger RNA {mRNA} translation in a cell type\u2013specific and synapse type\u2013specific manner. Ribosome-associated mRNA profiling reveals a molecular program of synaptic proteins downstream of ErbB4 signaling required to form excitatory inputs on PV + interneurons. Thus, specific connections use local protein synthesis to control synapse formation in the nervous system.",

Because capelin are harvested as an aquaculture feed protein source, we hereby determine an indirect path by which salmon aquaculture may influence wild salmon populations.",

A network of citizen seismometers installed in 2019 provided near-field data critical to rapidly understand the mechanism of the mainshock and monitor its aftershock sequence. Their real-time data defined two aftershock clusters that coincide with two areas of coseismic slip derived from inversions of conventional seismological and geodetic data. Machine learning applied to data from the citizen seismometer closest to the mainshock allows us to forecast aftershocks as accurately as with the network-derived catalog. This shows the utility of citizen science contributing to our understanding of a major earthquake.",

Although theorized, the OC-induced spatial structuring has so far defied experimental observation. Here, x-ray spectromicroscopic imaging complemented by modeling provides direct evidence for OC-induced patterning inside photoactive particles. Single iron(III)\u2013citrate particles were probed using the iron oxidation state as a photochemical marker. Based on these results, we predict an overall acceleration of photochemical reactions by a factor of two to three for most classes of atmospheric aerosol particles. Rotation of free aerosol particles and intraparticle molecular transport generally accelerate the photochemistry. Given the prevalence of OC effects, their influence on aerosol particle photochemistry should be considered by atmospheric models.",

The excitation spectra are in quantitative agreement with the exact solution of the Yang-Gaudin model and the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory.

Using a fluid-solid model that treats the solvent and membrane matrix as separate phases, we show both classical models to be valid, to represent complementary approaches to the same phenomenon, and to make identical predictions. The fluid-solid model clarifies recent reverse osmosis measurements; provides a predictive and mechanistic basis for empirical high-pressure limiting flux phenomena, in quantitative agreement with classic measurements; and gives a framework to treat nonporous but mechanically heterogeneous membrane materials.",

Subcutaneous implantation of tumors induced hypothalamus activation and pituitary \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) production in mice. \u03b1-MSH acted on bone marrow progenitors to promote myelopoiesis, myeloid cell accumulation, immunosuppression, and tumor growth through its melanocortin receptor MC5R. MC5R peptide antagonist boosted antitumor immunity and anti\u2013programmed cell death protein 1 (anti\u2013PD-1) immunotherapy. Serum \u03b1-MSH concentration was elevated and correlated with circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer patients. Our results reveal a neuroendocrine pathway that suppresses tumor immunity and suggest MC5R as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.",

However, syngas pressures of 100 to 400 bar with reaction temperatures of 100\u00b0 to 250\u00b0C are typically applied. We report here that unmodified cobalt carbonyl is a stable hydroformylation catalyst at 140\u00b0C under 30 bar of syngas. The activity was comparable to that of recently reported bisphosphine-coordinated cobalt(II) catalysts, which we could not reproduce under the reported conditions. Kinetic and in situ infrared spectroscopic studies confirmed the stability of the unmodified cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride [HCo(CO) 4 ]. Branched internal olefins were converted to aldehydes with high regioselectivity under low syngas pressures without phosphorus ligands. Bisphosphines had a small promotional effect on the catalyst at phosphorus-to-cobalt loading ratios below 0.6.",

However, it is unclear how leaders emerge from an apparently homogeneous epithelial cell population. We characterized leaders emerging from epithelial monolayers in cell culture and found that they activated the stress sensor p53, which was sufficient to initiate leader cell behavior. p53 activated the cell cycle inhibitor p21 WAF1/CIP1 , which in turn induced leader behavior through inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity. p53 also induced crowding hypersensitivity in leader cells such that, upon epithelial closure, they were eliminated by cell competition. Thus, mechanically induced p53 directs emergence of a transient population of leader cells that drive migration and ensures their clearance upon epithelial repair.",

We found that TBK1 is phosphorylated in response to C9orf72 poly(Gly-Ala) [poly(GA)] aggregation and sequestered into inclusions, which leads to a loss of TBK1 activity and contributes to neurodegeneration. When we reduced TBK1 activity using a TBK1-R228H (Arg 228 \u2192His) mutation in mice, poly(GA)-induced phenotypes were exacerbated. These phenotypes included an increase in TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology and the accumulation of defective endosomes in poly(GA)-positive neurons. Inhibiting the endosomal pathway induced TDP-43 aggregation, which highlights the importance of this pathway and TBK1 activity in pathogenesis. This interplay between C9orf72 , TBK1 , and TDP-43 connects three different facets of FTD-ALS into one coherent pathway.",

Here, we demonstrate the direct identification of the charge state of individual platinum nanoparticles (NPs) supported on titanium dioxide using ultrahigh sensitivity and precision electron holography. Sophisticated phase-shift analysis for the part of the NPs protruding into the vacuum visualized slight potential changes around individual platinum NPs. The analysis revealed the number (only one to six electrons) and sense (positive or negative) of the charge per platinum NP. The underlying mechanism of platinum charging is explained by the work function differences between platinum and titanium dioxide (depending on the orientation relationship and lattice distortion) and by first-principles calculations in terms of the charge transfer processes.",

Here, we identified two soybean ( Glycine max ) cystathionine \u03b2-synthase domain\u2013containing proteins, nodule AMP sensor 1 (GmNAS1) and NAS1-associated protein 1 (GmNAP1). In the high\u2013nodule energy state, GmNAS1 and GmNAP1 form homodimers that interact with the nuclear factor-Y C (NF-YC) subunit (GmNFYC10a) on mitochondria and reduce its nuclear accumulation. Less nuclear GmNFYC10a leads to lower expression of glycolytic genes involved in pyruvate production, which modulates phosphoenolpyruvate allocation to favor nitrogen fixation. Insight into these pathways may help in the design of leguminous crops that have improved carbon use, nitrogen fixation, and growth.",

Here we implement experiments on topological states of quantized light in a superconducting circuit, with which one- and two-dimensional Fock-state lattices are constructed. We realize rich topological physics including topological zero-energy states of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, strain-induced pseudo-Landau levels, valley Hall effect, and Haldane chiral edge currents. Our study extends the topological states of light to the quantum regime, bridging topological phases of condensed-matter physics with circuit quantum electrodynamics, and offers a freedom in controlling the quantum states of multiple resonators.",

We sequentially introduced mutations into healthy human melanocytes in up to five genes spanning six commonly disrupted melanoma pathways, forming nine genetically distinct cellular models of melanoma. We connected mutant melanocyte genotypes to malignant cell expression programs in vitro and in vivo, replicative immortality, malignancy, rapid tumor growth, pigmentation, metastasis, and histopathology. Mutations in malignant cells also affected tumor microenvironment composition and cell states. Our melanoma models shared genotype-associated expression programs with patient melanomas, and a deep learning model showed that these models partially recapitulated genotype-associated histopathological features as well. Thus, a progressive series of genome-edited human cancer models can causally connect genotypes carrying multiple mutations to phenotype.",

Using a record of North Atlantic ice rafting spanning the past 1.7 million years, we find that the onset of ice rafting within a given glacial cycle (reflecting ice sheet expansion) consistently occurred during times of decreasing obliquity whereas mass ice wasting (ablation) events were consistently tied to minima in precession. Furthermore, our results suggest that the ubiquitous association between precession-driven mass wasting events and glacial termination is a distinct feature of the mid to late Pleistocene. Before then, (increasing) obliquity alone was sufficient to end a glacial cycle, before losing its dominant grip on deglaciation with the southward extension of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets since ~1 Ma.",

TH10785 controls the catalytic activity mediated by a nitrogen base within its molecular structure. In cells, TH10785 increases OGG1 recruitment to and repair of oxidative DNA damage. This alters the repair process, which no longer requires APE1 but instead is dependent on polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP1) activity.

Although evidence generally supports this hypothesis, it has been proposed that certain species, such as turtles and tortoises, may exhibit slow or even negligible senescence\u2014i.e., avoiding the increasing risk of death from gradual deterioration with age. In an extensive comparative study of turtles and tortoises living in zoos and aquariums, we show that ~75% of 52 species exhibit slow or negligible senescence. For ~80% of species, aging rates are lower than those in modern humans. We find that body weight positively relates to adult life expectancy in both sexes, and sexual size dimorphism explains sex differences in longevity.

    "abstract": "An organized combination of stiff and elastic domains within a single material can synergistically tailor bulk mechanical properties. However, synthetic methods to achieve such sophisticated architectures remain elusive. We report a rapid, facile, and environmentally benign method to pattern strong and stiff semicrystalline phases within soft and elastic matrices using stereo-controlled ring-opening metathesis polymerization of an industrial monomer, cis -cyclooctene. Dual polymerization catalysis dictates polyolefin backbone chemistry, which enables patterning of compositionally uniform materials with seamless stiff and elastic interfaces. Visible light\u2013induced activation of a metathesis catalyst results in the formation of semicrystalline trans polyoctenamer rubber, outcompeting the formation of cis polyoctenamer rubber, which occurs at room temperature. This bottom-up approach provides a method for manufacturing polymeric materials with promising applications in soft optoelectronics and robotics.",

Mishra et al . build on previous work that identified a combination of two Gc-targeting antibodies that gave postexposure protection in an animal model. The authors determined the structure of the antigen-binding fragments of the two antibodies bound to a prefusion form of Gc and also the structure of Gc after the conformational change into the trimeric postfusion form.

We uncovered 440 genome-wide significant loci in the discovery cohort and 800 from a post hoc combined meta-analysis. Loci in adulthood were largely captured in childhood, showing signatures of negative selection, and were linked to early neurodevelopment and pathways associated with neuropsychiatric risk. Opposing gradations of decreased surface area and increased thickness were associated with common inversion polymorphisms. Inferior frontal regions, encompassing Broca\u2019s area, which is important for speech, were enriched for human-specific genomic elements. Thus, a mixed genetic landscape of conserved and human-specific features is concordant with brain hierarchy and morphogenetic gradients.",

We present the first evidence for a genetically distinct and functionally isolated group of polar bears in Southeast Greenland. These bears occupy sea-ice conditions resembling those projected for the High Arctic in the late 21st century, with an annual ice-free period that is >100 days longer than the estimated fasting threshold for the species. Whereas polar bears in most of the Arctic depend on annual sea ice to catch seals, Southeast Greenland bears have a year-round hunting platform in the form of freshwater glacial m\u00e9lange. This suggests that marine-terminating glaciers, although of limited availability, may serve as previously unrecognized climate refugia. Conservation of Southeast Greenland polar bears, which meet criteria for recognition as the world\u2019s 20th polar bear subpopulation, is necessary to preserve the genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of the species.",

These movements are relatively well understood at a population level, but how individual insects achieve them remains elusive. Behavioral responses to conditions en route are little studied, primarily owing to the challenges of tracking individual insects. Using a light aircraft and individual radio tracking, we show that nocturnally migrating death\u2019s-head hawkmoths maintain control of their flight trajectories over long distances. The moths did not just fly with favorable tailwinds; during a given night, they also adjusted for head and crosswinds to precisely hold course. This behavior indicates that the moths use a sophisticated internal compass to maintain seasonally beneficial migratory trajectories independent of wind conditions, illuminating how insects traverse long distances to take advantage of seasonal resources.",

We isolated a female-to-male sex transition mutant in melon and identified the causal gene as the carpel identity gene CRABS CLAW (CRC) . We show that the master regulator of sex determination in cucurbits, the transcription factor WIP1 whose expression orchestrates male flower development, recruits the corepressor TOPLESS to the CRC promoter to suppress its expression through histone deacetylation. Impairing TOPLESS-WIP1 physical interaction leads to CRC expression, carpel determination, and consequently the expression of the stamina inhibitor, the aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase 7 ( CmACS7 ), leading to female flower development. Our findings suggest that sex genes evolved to interfere with flower meristematic function, leading to unisexual flower development.",

Cortical plate astrocytes emerge from VZ progenitors and proliferate locally, while putative white matter astrocytes are morphologically heterogeneous and emerge from both VZ and OSVZ progenitors. Furthermore, via single-cell sequencing of morphologically defined astrocyte subtypes using Patch-seq, we identify molecular distinctions between VZ-derived cortical plate astrocytes and OSVZ-derived white matter astrocytes that persist into adulthood. Together, our study highlights a complex role for cell lineage in the diversification of human neocortical astrocytes.",

However, many locations have the same inclination angle.

Strands composed of different numbers of tridentate 2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide groups fold around nine-coordinate lanthanide (III) ions to generate strand-entangled complexes with the lowest common multiple of coordination sites for the ligand strands and metal ions. Ring-closing olefin metathesis then completes the knots. A 3:2 (ditopic strand:metal) Vernier assembly produces +3 1 #+3 1 and \u22123 1 #\u22123 1 granny knots. Vernier complexes of 3:4 (tetratopic strand:metal) stoichiometry selectively form a 378-atom-long trefoil-of-trefoils triskelion knot with 12 alternating strand crossings or, by using opposing stereochemistry at the terminus of the strand, an inverted-core triskelion knot with six alternating and six nonalternating strand crossings.",

In cultured cells, mTORC1 senses leucine through the leucine-binding Sestrin proteins, but the physiological functions and distribution of Sestrin-mediated leucine sensing in mammals are unknown. We find that mice lacking Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 cannot inhibit mTORC1 upon dietary leucine deprivation and suffer a rapid loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle. The WAT loss is driven by aberrant mTORC1 activity and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) production in the liver. Sestrin expression in the liver lobule is zonated, accounting for zone-specific regulation of mTORC1 activity and FGF21 induction by leucine. These results establish the mammalian Sestrins as physiological leucine sensors and reveal a spatial organization to nutrient sensing by the mTORC1 pathway.",

We found a strong phylogeographic structure in modern donkeys that supports a single domestication in Africa ~5000 BCE, followed by further expansions in this continent and Eurasia and ultimately returning to Africa. We uncover a previously unknown genetic lineage in the Levant ~200 BCE, which contributed increasing ancestry toward Asia. Donkey management involved inbreeding and the production of giant bloodlines at a time when mules were essential to the Roman economy and military.",

    "abstract": "Not your typical GPCR Among the large family of G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) are many orphans, so called because their signaling reactions remain poorly understood. Among these is GPR158 which is highly expressed in the nervous system and implicated in processes from cognition to memory to mood. Patil et al . determined a high-resolution structure of GPR158 alone and bound to a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) complex. GPR158 has an unusual dimerization mode with an extensive interaction interface that locks it in a conformation that likely prevents G protein activation. RGS binds to the homodimer at a site that substantially overlaps the surface that binds G proteins, again preventing canonical G protein signaling. Binding of a ligand to the extracellular domain may regulate signaling through the RGS complex. \u2014VV",

    "abstract": "Intron recognition in the spotlight Excision of noncoding introns from pre\u2013messenger RNAs is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a large RNA-protein complex that recognizes specific sequences at the exon-intron boundaries (splice sites). These sequences are highly degenerate in humans, and it has remained elusive how they are recognized by the spliceosome. Tholen et al . report a series of high-resolution structures of the human U2 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein, the component of the spliceosome that recognizes branch sites. The structures explain how SF3B6 helps to stabilize the branch helix in the absence of extensive sequence complementarity. A newly identified spliceosome assembly intermediate suggests a mechanism for fidelity control of branch site recognition. \u2014DJ",

A decade ago, in vitro gametogenesis was established in the mouse. However, induction of primordial germ cell\u2013like cells (PGCLCs) to produce gametes has not been achieved in any other species. Here, we demonstrate the induction of functional PGCLCs from rat PSCs. We show that epiblast-like cells in floating aggregates form rat PGCLCs. The gonadal somatic cells support maturation and epigenetic reprogramming of the PGCLCs. When rat PGCLCs are transplanted into the seminiferous tubules of germline-less rats, functional spermatids\u2014that is, those capable of siring viable offspring\u2014are generated. Insights from our rat model will elucidate conserved and divergent mechanisms essential for the broad applicability of in vitro gametogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The centrosome provides an intracellular anchor for the cytoskeleton, regulating cell division, cell migration, and cilia formation. We used spatial proteomics to elucidate protein interaction networks at the centrosome of human induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons. Centrosome-associated proteins were largely cell type\u2013specific, with protein hubs involved in RNA dynamics. Analysis of neurodevelopmental disease cohorts identified a significant overrepresentation of NSC centrosome proteins with variants in patients with periventricular heterotopia (PH). Expressing the PH-associated mutant pre-mRNA-processing factor 6 (PRPF6) reproduced the periventricular misplacement in the developing mouse brain, highlighting missplicing of transcripts of a microtubule-associated kinase with centrosomal location as essential for the phenotype. Collectively, cell type\u2013specific centrosome interactomes explain how genetic variants in ubiquitous proteins may convey brain-specific phenotypes.",

The +1 nucleosome is well positioned about 40 base pairs downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and is commonly known as a barrier of transcription. The +1 nucleosome\u2013bound PIC-Mediator structures show that PIC-Mediator prefers binding to T40N nucleosome located 40 base pairs downstream of TSS and contacts T50N but not the T70N nucleosome. The nucleosome facilitates the organization of PIC-Mediator on the promoter by binding TFIIH subunit p52 and Mediator subunits MED19 and MED26 and may contribute to transcription initiation. PIC-Mediator exhibits multiple nucleosome-binding patterns, supporting a structural role of the +1 nucleosome in the coordination of PIC-Mediator assembly. Our study reveals the molecular mechanism of PIC-Mediator organization on chromatin and underscores the significance of the +1 nucleosome in regulating transcription initiation.",

Moreover, we showed that locking refactored codes into synthetic organisms completely blocks invasion by mobile genetic elements, including viruses, which carry their own translation factors and successfully invade organisms with canonical and compressed genetic codes.",

Structural-functional mapping of the tuft tree from the motor cortex during motor tasks revealed two morphologically distinct populations of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) that exhibit specific tuft computational properties. Early bifurcating and large nexus PTNs showed marked tuft functional compartmentalization, representing different motor variable combinations within and between their two tuft hemi-trees. By contrast, late bifurcating and smaller nexus PTNs showed synchronous tuft activation. Dendritic structure and dynamic recruitment of the N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA)\u2013spiking mechanism explained the differential compartmentalization patterns. Our findings support a morphologically dependent framework for motor computations, in which independent amplification units can be combinatorically recruited to represent different motor sequences within the same tree.",

ML901 exerts whole-life-cycle\u2013killing activity with low nanomolar potency and single-dose efficacy in a mouse model of malaria.

Here, we focus on the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs55705857, which confers a sixfold greater risk of isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH) \u2013mutant low-grade glioma (LGG). We reveal that rs55705857 itself is the causal variant and is associated with molecular pathways that drive LGG. Mechanistically, we show that rs55705857 resides within a brain-specific enhancer, where the risk allele disrupts OCT2/4 binding, allowing increased interaction with the Myc promoter and increased Myc expression. Mutating the orthologous mouse rs55705857 locus accelerated tumor development in an Idh1 R132H -driven LGG mouse model from 472 to 172 days and increased penetrance from 30% to 75%. Our work reveals mechanisms of the heritable predisposition to lethal glioma in ~40% of LGG patients.",

Using two complementary methods, we characterized the tensor monopole by measuring its quantized topological charge and its emanating Kalb-Ramond field. By introducing a fictitious external field that breaks chiral symmetry, we further observed an intriguing spectral transition, characterized by spectral rings protected by mirror symmetries. Our work demonstrates the possibility of emulating exotic topological structures inspired by string theory.",

    "abstract": "The molecular basis of interindividual clinical variability upon infection with Staphylococcus aureus is unclear. We describe patients with haploinsufficiency for the linear deubiquitinase OTULIN, encoded by a gene on chromosome 5p. Patients suffer from episodes of life-threatening necrosis, typically triggered by S. aureus infection. The disorder is phenocopied in patients with the 5p\u2212 (Cri-du-Chat) chromosomal deletion syndrome. OTULIN haploinsufficiency causes an accumulation of linear ubiquitin in dermal fibroblasts, but tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2013mediated nuclear factor \u03baB signaling remains intact. Blood leukocyte subsets are unaffected. The OTULIN-dependent accumulation of caveolin-1 in dermal fibroblasts, but not leukocytes, facilitates the cytotoxic damage inflicted by the staphylococcal virulence factor \u03b1-toxin. Naturally elicited antibodies against \u03b1-toxin contribute to incomplete clinical penetrance. Human OTULIN haploinsufficiency underlies life-threatening staphylococcal disease by disrupting cell-intrinsic immunity to \u03b1-toxin in nonleukocytic cells.",

    "abstract": "Rivers can abruptly shift pathways in rare events called avulsions, which cause devastating floods. The controls on avulsion locations are poorly understood as a result of sparse data on such features. We analyzed nearly 50 years of satellite imagery and documented 113 avulsions across the globe that indicate three distinct controls on avulsion location. Avulsions on fans coincide with valley-confinement change, whereas avulsions on deltas are primarily clustered within the backwater zone, indicating a control by spatial flow deceleration or acceleration during floods. However, 38% of avulsions on deltas occurred upstream of backwater effects. These events occurred in steep, sediment-rich rivers in tropical and desert environments. Our results indicate that avulsion location on deltas is set by the upstream extent of flood-driven erosion, which is typically limited to the backwater zone but can extend far upstream in steep, sediment-laden rivers. Our findings elucidate how avulsion hazards might respond to land use and climate change.",

It is poorly understood how gene regulatory architectures can accommodate both deep homology and adaptive change. To address this, we characterized the cis-regulatory evolution of the color pattern gene WntA in nymphalid butterflies. Comparative assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and in vivo deletions spanning 46 cis-regulatory elements across five species revealed deep homology of ground plan\u2013determining sequences, except in monarch butterflies. Furthermore, noncoding deletions displayed both positive and negative regulatory effects that were often broad in nature. Our results provide little support for models predicting rapid enhancer turnover and suggest that deeply ancestral, multifunctional noncoding elements can underlie rapidly evolving trait systems.",

The polarization angle also changes by 90\u00b0 at ~4 to 5 kilo\u2013electron volts.

Although these reactive intermediates are engaged in stereoselective processes in nature, exerting enantiocontrol over carbocations with synthetic catalysts remains challenging. Many resonance-stabilized tricoordinated carbocations, such as iminium and oxocarbenium ions, have been applied in catalytic enantioselective reactions. However, their dicoordinated counterparts (aryl and vinyl carbocations) have not, despite their emerging utility in chemical synthesis. We report the discovery of a highly enantioselective vinyl carbocation carbon\u2013hydrogen (C\u2013H) insertion reaction enabled by imidodiphosphorimidate organocatalysts. Active site confinement featured in this catalyst class not only enables effective enantiocontrol but also expands the scope of vinyl cation C\u2013H insertion chemistry, which broadens the utility of this transition metal\u2013free C(sp 3 )\u2013H functionalization platform.",

Designing such mechanically constrained nanoscale protein architectures with internal degrees of freedom is an outstanding challenge for computational protein design. Here we explore the de novo construction of protein machinery from designed axle and rotor components with internal cyclic or dihedral symmetry. We find that the axle-rotor systems assemble in vitro and in vivo as designed. Using cryo\u2013electron microscopy, we find that these systems populate conformationally variable relative orientations reflecting the symmetry of the coupled components and the computationally designed interface energy landscape. These mechanical systems with internal degrees of freedom are a step toward the design of genetically encodable nanomachines.",

Pollen actively transcribes its haploid genome, providing phenotypic diversity even among pollen grains from a single plant. In this study, we used allele-specific RNA sequencing of single pollen precursors to follow the shift to haploid expression in maize pollen. We observed widespread biallelic expression for 11 days after meiosis, indicating that transcripts synthesized by the diploid sporophyte persist long into the haploid phase. Subsequently, there was a rapid and global conversion to monoallelic expression at pollen mitosis I, driven by active new transcription from the haploid genome. Genes showed evidence of increased purifying selection if they were expressed after (but not before) pollen mitosis I. This work establishes the timing during which haploid selection may act in pollen.",

However, many organisms form crystals with intricate morphologies, as exemplified by coccoliths, microscopic calcite crystal arrays produced by unicellular algae. The complex morphologies of the coccolith crystals were hypothesized to materialize from numerous crystallographic facets, stabilized by fine-tuned interactions between organic molecules and the growing crystals. Using electron tomography, we examined multiple stages of coccolith development in three dimensions. We found that the crystals express only one set of symmetry-related crystallographic facets, which grow differentially to yield highly anisotropic shapes. Morphological chirality arises from positioning the crystals along specific edges of these same facets. Our findings suggest that growth rate manipulations are sufficient to yield complex crystalline morphologies.",

However, precise analyses of glycan ligands binding with heavily modified pathogen proteins can be confounded by overlapping sugar signals and/or compounded with known experimental constraints. Universal saturation transfer analysis (uSTA) builds on existing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to provide an automated workflow for quantitating protein-ligand interactions. uSTA reveals that early-pandemic, B-origin-lineage severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike trimer binds sialoside sugars in an \u201cend-on\u201d manner. uSTA-guided modeling and a high-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure implicate the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) and confirm end-on binding. This finding rationalizes the effect of NTD mutations that abolish sugar binding in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Together with genetic variance analyses in early pandemic patient cohorts, this binding implicates a sialylated polylactosamine motif found on tetraantennary N-linked glycoproteins deep in the human lung as potentially relevant to virulence and/or zoonosis.",

Upon drop-casting of a heated ethanol solution onto a quartz substrate, the molecules spontaneously assemble into standing vessel-shaped single crystals uniaxially and synchronously over the wide area of the substrate, with small size polydispersity. The crystal edge is active even after consumption of the molecules and resumes stereoselective growth with successive feeding. The resultant morphology can be packed into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon\u2013like microarchitectures and behaves as a microscopic container.",

Children expect saliva sharing to happen in nuclear families. Toddlers and infants expect that people who share saliva will respond to one another in distress. Parents confirm that saliva sharing is a valid cue of relationship thickness in their children\u2019s social environments. The ability to use distinctive interactions to infer categories of relationships thus emerges early in life, without explicit teaching; this enables young humans to rapidly identify close relationships, both within and beyond families.",

Although we have a detailed understanding of synaptic and dendritic plasticity in vitro, little is known about the functional and plastic properties of active dendrites in behaving animals. Using deep brain two-photon Ca 2+ imaging, we investigated how sensory responses in amygdala principal neurons develop upon classical fear conditioning, a form of associative learning. Fear conditioning induced differential plasticity in dendrites and somas regulated by compartment-specific inhibition. Our results indicate that learning-induced plasticity can be uncoupled between soma and dendrites, reflecting distinct synaptic and microcircuit-level mechanisms that increase the computational capacity of amygdala circuits.",

    "abstract": "Antarctica\u2019s fast-flowing ice streams drain the ice sheet, with their velocity modulated by subglacial water systems. Current knowledge of these water systems is limited to the shallow portions near the ice-bed interface, but hypothesized deeper groundwater could also influence ice streaming. Here, we use magnetotelluric and passive seismic data from Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, to provide the first observations of deep sub\u2013ice stream groundwater. Our data reveal a volume of groundwater within a >1-kilometer-thick sedimentary basin that is more than an order of magnitude larger than the known subglacial system. A vertical salinity gradient indicates exchange between paleo seawater at depth and contemporary basal meltwater above. Our results provide new constraints for subglacial water systems that affect ice streaming and subglacial biogeochemical processes.",

    "abstract": "Parasites impose fitness costs on their hosts. Biologists often assume that natural selection favors infection-resistant hosts. Yet, when the immune response itself is costly, theory suggests that selection may sometimes favor loss of resistance, which may result in alternative stable states where some populations are resistant and others are tolerant. Intraspecific variation in immune costs is rarely surveyed in a manner that tests evolutionary patterns, and there are few examples of adaptive loss of resistance. Here, we show that when marine threespine stickleback colonized freshwater lakes, they gained resistance to the freshwater-associated cestode Schistocephalus solidus . Extensive peritoneal fibrosis and inflammation are a commonly observed phenotype that contributes to suppression of cestode growth and viability but also imposes a substantial cost on fecundity. Combining genetic mapping and population genomics, we find that opposing selection generates immune system differences between tolerant and resistant populations, consistent with divergent optimization.",

ACE inhibition enhanced \u00b5-opioid receptor activation by Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, causing a cell type\u2013specific long-term depression of glutamate release onto medium spiny projection neurons expressing the Drd1 dopamine receptor. Systemic ACE inhibition was not intrinsically rewarding, but it led to a decrease in conditioned place preference caused by fentanyl administration and an enhancement of reciprocal social interaction. Our results raise the enticing prospect that central ACE inhibition can boost endogenous opioid signaling for clinical benefit while mitigating the risk of addiction.",

Using a pleasant touch\u2013conditioned place preference (PT-CPP) test, we show that genetic ablation of spinal excitatory interneurons expressing prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR2), or its ligand PROK2 in sensory neurons, abolishes PT-CPP without impairing pain and itch behaviors in mice. Mutant mice display profound impairments in stress response and prosocial behaviors. Moreover, PROKR2 neurons respond most vigorously to gentle stroking and encode reward value. Collectively, we identify PROK2 as a long-sought neuropeptide that encodes and transmits pleasant touch to spinal PROKR2 neurons. These findings may have important implications for elucidating mechanisms by which pleasant touch deprivation contributes to social avoidance behavior and mental disorders.",

By using its Lys-rich and carboxyl-terminal segments, the ribosomal protein eS31 simultaneously interacts with Sec-specific transfer RNA (tRNA Sec ) and SBP2, which further stabilizes the assembly. eEFSec is indiscriminate toward l -serine and facilitates its misincorporation at Sec UGA codons. Our results support a fundamentally distinct mechanism of Sec UGA recoding in eukaryotes from that in bacteria.",

In this study, we show that sex-dependent hepatic gene programs confer a robust (~300%) survival advantage for male mice during lethal bacterial infection. The transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), which masculinizes hepatic gene expression at puberty, is essential for this advantage. However, protection by BCL6 protein comes at a cost during conditions of dietary excess, which result in overt fatty liver and glucose intolerance in males. Deleting hepatic BCL6 reverses these phenotypes but markedly lowers male survival during infection, thus establishing a sex-dependent trade-off between host defense and metabolic systems. Our findings offer strong evidence that some current sex-biased diseases are rooted in ancient evolutionary trade-offs between immunity and metabolism.",

Csx30 binds Csx31 and the associated sigma factor RpoE (RNA polymerase, extracytoplasmic E), suggesting that Csx30-mediated RpoE inhibition modulates the cellular response to infection.

The first ethylene molecule forms a 4-ethyl branch and the second a new terminal carbon-carbon double bond (C2 elongation). The key to this reaction is the development of a highly active and stable molecular titanium catalyst that undergoes extremely fast \u03b2-hydride elimination and transfer.",

The rotational coherence was maximized by rotating the electric field relative to the light polarization for state-insensitive trapping. Spatially separated molecules in adjacent layers interact through dipolar spin exchange of rotational angular momentum; by adjusting these interactions, we regulated the local chemical reaction rate. The resonance width of the exchange process vastly exceeded the dipolar interaction energy, an effect attributed to thermal energy. This work realized precise control of interacting molecules, enabling electric field microscopy on subwavelength scales and allowing access to unexplored physics in two-dimensional systems.",

The popular Cossee-Arlman mechanism hypothesizes that the ethylene be directly inserted into the metal\u2013carbon bond during chain growth, which has been awaiting microscopic and spatiotemporal experimental confirmation. Here, we report an in situ visualization of ethylene polymerization by scanning tunneling microscopy on a carburized iron single-crystal surface. We observed that ethylene polymerization proceeds on a specific triangular iron site at the boundary between two carbide domains. Without an activator, an intermediate, attributed to surface-anchored ethylidene (CHCH 3 ), serves as the chain initiator (self-initiation), which subsequently grows by ethylene insertion. Our finding provides direct experimental evidence of the ethylene polymerization pathway at the molecular level.",

We found that loss of the deubiquitinase USP8 gene in Drosophila can transform incomplete divisions of germline cells into complete divisions. Conversely, overexpression of USP8 in germline stem cells is sufficient for the reverse transformation from complete to incomplete cytokinesis. The ESCRT-III proteins CHMP2B and Shrub/CHMP4 are targets of USP8 deubiquitinating activity. In Usp8 mutant sister cells, ectopic recruitment of ESCRT proteins at intercellular bridges causes cysts to break apart. A Shrub/CHMP4 variant that cannot be ubiquitinated does not localize at abscission bridges and cannot complete abscission. Our results uncover ubiquitination of ESCRT-III as a major switch between two types of cell division.",

We used polarized inelastic neutron scattering to investigate the propagation of magnons (i.e., bosonic collective spin excitations) in a lattice of skyrmion tubes in manganese silicide. For wave vectors perpendicular to the skyrmion tubes, the magnon spectra are consistent with the formation of finely spaced emergent Landau levels that are characteristic of the fictitious magnetic field used to account for the nontrivial topological winding of the skyrmion lattice. This provides evidence of a topological magnon band structure in reciprocal space, which is borne out of the nontrivial real-space topology of a magnetic order.",

This cilium provides a cable system for the bouquet machinery and extends throughout the germline cyst. Using zebrafish mutants and live manipulations, we demonstrate that the cilium anchors the centrosome to counterbalance telomere pulling.

    "abstract": "In Arabia, the first half of the sixth century CE was marked by the demise of Himyar, the dominant power in Arabia until 525 CE. Important social and political changes followed, which promoted the disintegration of the major Arabian polities. Here, we present hydroclimate records from around Southern Arabia, including a new high-resolution stalagmite record from northern Oman. These records clearly indicate unprecedented droughts during the sixth century CE, with the most severe aridity persisting between ~500 and 530 CE. We suggest that such droughts undermined the resilience of Himyar and thereby contributed to the societal changes from which Islam emerged.",

We compare the impacts on gene expression and fitness resulting from cis- and trans-regulatory mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , with a focus on the TDH3 gene. We use the effects of cis-regulatory mutations to infer effects of trans-regulatory mutations attributable to impacts beyond the focal gene, revealing a distribution of pleiotropic effects. Cis- and trans-regulatory mutations had different effects on gene expression with pleiotropic effects of trans-regulatory mutants affecting expression of genes both in parallel to and downstream of the focal gene. The more widespread and deleterious effects of trans-regulatory mutations we observed are consistent with their decreasing relative contribution to expression differences over evolutionary time.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations result from the joining of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and frequently cause cancer. However, the steps linking DSB formation to DSB ligation remain undeciphered. We report that DNA replication timing (RT) directly regulates lymphomagenic Myc translocations during antibody maturation in B cells downstream of DSBs and independently of DSB frequency. Depletion of minichromosome maintenance complexes alters replication origin activity, decreases translocations, and deregulates global RT. Ablating a single origin at Myc causes an early-to-late RT switch, loss of translocations, and reduced proximity with the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( Igh ) gene, its major translocation partner. These phenotypes were reversed by restoring early RT. Disruption of early RT also reduced tumorigenic translocations in human leukemic cells. Thus, RT constitutes a general mechanism in translocation biogenesis linking DSB formation to DSB ligation.",

However, an increased 142 Nd/ 144 Nd in modern terrestrial rocks relative to chondrite meteorites has been proposed to be caused by nucleosynthetic anomalies, obscuring early Earth\u2019s differentiation history. We use stepwise dissolution of primitive chondrites to quantify nucleosynthetic contributions on the composition of chondrites. After correction for nucleosynthetic anomalies, Earth and the silicate parts of differentiated planetesimals contain resolved excesses of 142 Nd relative to chondrites. We conclude that only collisional erosion of primordial crusts can explain such compositions. This process associated with planetary accretion must have produced substantial loss of incompatible elements, including long-term heat-producing elements such as uranium, thorium, and potassium.",

We successfully obtained the temperature dependence of second sound diffusivity D 2 and thermal conductivity \u03ba. Furthermore, we observed a sudden rise\u2014a precursor of critical divergence\u2014in both D 2 and \u03ba at a temperature of about 0.95 superfluid transition temperature T c .

However, genetic context\u2014including the adjacent transcriptional environment\u2014also influences transcript isoform expression levels and boundaries. We used synthetic yeast strains with stochastically repositioned genes to systematically disentangle the effects of sequence and context. Profiling 120 million full-length transcript molecules across 612 genomic perturbations, we observed sequence-independent alterations to gene expression levels and transcript isoform boundaries that were influenced by neighboring transcription. We identified features of transcriptional context that could predict these alterations and used these features to engineer a synthetic circuit where transcript length was controlled by neighboring transcription. This demonstrates how positional context can be leveraged in synthetic genome engineering.",

Here, we report direct observation of ROOOH formation from several atmospherically relevant RO 2 radicals. Kinetic analysis confirmed rapid RO 2 + OH reactions forming ROOOH, with rate coefficients close to the collision limit. For the OH-initiated degradation of isoprene, global modeling predicts molar hydrotrioxide formation yields of up to 1%, which represents an annual ROOOH formation of about 10 million metric tons. The atmospheric lifetime of ROOOH is estimated to be minutes to hours. Hydrotrioxides represent a previously omitted substance class in the atmosphere, the impact of which needs to be examined.",

Typically, the magnetic field is measured by averaging sequential measurements of single NV centers, or by spatial averaging over ensembles of many NV centers, which provides mean values that contain no nonlocal information about the relationship between two points separated in space or time. Here, we propose and implement a sensing modality whereby two or more NV centers are measured simultaneously, and we extract temporal and spatial correlations in their signals that would otherwise be inaccessible. We demonstrate measurements of correlated applied noise using spin-to-charge readout of two NV centers and implement a spectral reconstruction protocol for disentangling local and nonlocal noise sources.",

We tested the model for thousands of different lac operator sequences with a protein binding microarray and by observing kinetics for individual lac repressor molecules in single-molecule experiments. We found that sequence specificity is mainly governed by the efficiency with which the protein recognizes different targets. The variation in probability of recognizing different targets is at least 1.7 times as large as the variation in microscopic dissociation rates. Modulating the rate of binding instead of the rate of dissociation effectively reduces the risk of the protein being retained on nontarget sequences while searching.",

Tumor necrosis factor signaling can eliminate clonal malignancies from Drosophila imaginal epithelia, but why this pathway is activated in tumor cells but not normal tissue is unknown. We show that the ligand that drives elimination is present in basolateral circulation but remains latent because it is spatially segregated from its apically localized receptor. Polarity defects associated with malignant transformation cause receptor mislocalization, allowing ligand binding and subsequent apoptotic signaling. This process occurs irrespective of the neighboring cells\u2019 genotype and is thus distinct from cell competition. Related phenomena at epithelial wound sites are required for efficient repair. This mechanism of polarized compartmentalization of ligand and receptor can generally monitor epithelial integrity to promote tissue homeostasis.",

We engineered penicillin G acylases to distinguish among free amino moieties of insulin (two at amino termini and an internal lysine) and manipulate cleavable phenylacetamide groups in a programmable manner to form protected insulin derivatives. This enables selective and specific chemical ligation to synthesize homogeneous bioconjugates, improving yield and purity compared to the existing methods, and generally opens avenues in the functionalization of native proteins to access biological probes or drugs.",

The fracture modeling identified micro- and nanostructure-based toughening mechanisms as the critical factor. Under wet conditions, capillarity-assisted energy dissipation pertaining to liquid-filled microgaps and nanopores further increased the adhesion performance. This research presents insights on lizard tail autotomy and provides new biomimetic ideas to solve adhesion problems.",

    "abstract": "Translational symmetry breaking is antagonistic to static fluidity but can be realized in superconductors, which host a quantum-mechanical coherent fluid formed by electron pairs. A peculiar example of such a state is the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, induced by a time-reversal symmetry\u2013breaking magnetic field applied to spin-singlet superconductors. This state is intrinsically accompanied by the superconducting spin smecticity, spin density\u2013modulated fluidity with spontaneous translational-symmetry breaking. Detection of such spin smecticity provides unambiguous evidence for the FFLO state, but its observation has been challenging. Here, we report the characteristic \u201cdouble-horn\u201d nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum in the layered superconductor Sr 2 RuO 4 near its upper critical field, indicating the spatial sinusoidal modulation of spin density that is consistent with superconducting spin smecticity. Our work reveals that Sr 2 RuO 4 provides a versatile platform for studying FFLO physics.",

    "abstract": "How acute pathogens persist and what curtails their epidemic growth in the absence of acquired immunity remains unknown. Canine rabies is a fatal zoonosis that circulates endemically at low prevalence among domestic dogs in low- and middle-income countries. We traced rabies transmission in a population of 50,000 dogs in Tanzania from 2002 to 2016 and applied individual-based models to these spatially resolved data to investigate the mechanisms modulating transmission and the scale over which they operate. Although rabies prevalence never exceeded 0.15%, the best-fitting models demonstrated appreciable depletion of susceptible animals that occurred at local scales because of clusters of deaths and dogs already incubating infection. Individual variation in rabid dog behavior facilitated virus dispersal and cocirculation of virus lineages, enabling metapopulation persistence. These mechanisms have important implications for prediction and control of pathogens that circulate in spatially structured populations.",

Here, we show that the ceramide Phytophthora infestans \u2013ceramide D (Pi-Cer D) from the plant pathogenic oomycete P. infestans triggers defense responses in Arabidopsis . Pi-Cer D is cleaved by an Arabidopsis apoplastic ceramidase, NEUTRAL CERAMIDASE 2 (NCER2), and the resulting 9-methyl\u2013branched sphingoid base is recognized by a plasma membrane lectin receptor\u2013like kinase, RESISTANT TO DFPM-INHIBITION OF ABSCISIC ACID SIGNALING 2 (RDA2). 9-Methyl\u2013branched sphingoid base is specific to microbes and induces plant immune responses by physically interacting with RDA2. Loss of RDA2 or NCER2 function compromised Arabidopsis resistance against an oomycete pathogen. Thus, we elucidated the recognition mechanisms of pathogen-derived lipid molecules in plants.",

We explore this issue in India, a country with alarming rates of GBV and limited police capacity, by studying the impact of Women\u2019s Help Desks (WHDs): dedicated spaces for women in local police stations, staffed by trained officers. Drawing on the largest randomized controlled trial of a police reform to date (180 police stations serving 23.4 million people), we find that officers in stations with WHDs are more likely to register cases of GBV, particularly where female officers run the desks. This suggests that even in resource-constrained and patriarchal environments, police responsiveness can be improved by focusing and mainstreaming attention to women\u2019s cases and by greater gender representation within the police.",

We empirically quantified this nature-based solution to seasonal freshwater storage capture described as the \u201cBengal Water Machine,\u201d revealing its potential and limitations. On the basis of a million piezometric observations from 465 monitoring wells, we show that the collective operation of ~16 million smallholder farmers in the Bengal Basin of Bangladesh from 1988 to 2018 has induced cumulative freshwater capture that volumetrically (75 to 90 cubic kilometers) is equivalent to twice the reservoir capacity of the Three Gorges Dam.",

Cultural accumulation of innovative algorithms is hard to explain because complex concepts are difficult to pass on. We found that selective social learning preserved rare discoveries of exceptional algorithms in a large experimental simulation of cultural evolution. Participants ( N = 3450) faced a difficult sequential decision problem (sorting an unknown sequence of numbers) and transmitted solutions across 12 generations in 20 populations. Several known sorting algorithms were discovered. Complex algorithms persisted when participants could choose who to learn from but frequently became extinct in populations lacking this selection process, converging on highly transmissible lower-performance algorithms. These results provide experimental evidence for hypothesized links between sociality and cognitive function in humans.",

We synthesized and delivered variant rat HoxA clusters (130 to 170 kilobases) to an ectopic location in the mouse genome. We found that a minimal HoxA cluster recapitulated correct patterns of chromatin remodeling and transcription in response to patterning signals, whereas the addition of distal enhancers was needed for full transcriptional output. Synthetic regulatory reconstitution could provide a generalizable strategy for deciphering the regulatory logic of gene expression in complex genomes.",

    "abstract": "G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) recruit \u03b2-arrestins to coordinate diverse cellular processes, but the structural dynamics driving this process are poorly understood. Atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) are intrinsically biased GPCRs that engage \u03b2-arrestins but not G proteins, making them a model system for investigating the structural basis of \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. Here, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on 13 CH 3 -\u03b5\u2013methionine\u2013labeled ACKR3, revealing that \u03b2-arrestin recruitment is associated with conformational exchange at key regions of the extracellular ligand-binding pocket and intracellular \u03b2-arrestin\u2013coupling region. NMR studies of ACKR3 mutants defective in \u03b2-arrestin recruitment identified an allosteric hub in the receptor core that coordinates transitions among heterogeneously populated and selected conformational states. Our data suggest that conformational selection guides \u03b2-arrestin recruitment by tuning receptor dynamics at intracellular and extracellular regions.",

We show that these and neighboring populations were formed through admixture of pre-Neolithic sources related to Anatolian, Caucasus, and Levantine hunter-gatherers, forming a Neolithic continuum of ancestry mirroring the geography of West Asia. By analyzing Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic populations of Anatolia, we show that the former were derived from admixture between Mesopotamian-related and local Epipaleolithic-related sources, but the latter experienced additional Levantine-related gene flow, thus documenting at least two pulses of migration from the Fertile Crescent heartland to the early farmers of Anatolia.",

Here, we tested in the mouse whether these populations interact during embryogenesis while migrating. By coupling histological analysis of genetic models with live imaging, we show that although they are both attracted by the chemokine Cxcl12, vOPCs and cortical interneurons occupy mutually exclusive forebrain territories enriched in this chemokine. Moreover, first-wave vOPC depletion selectively disrupts the migration and distribution of cortical interneurons. At the cellular level, we found that by promoting unidirectional contact repulsion, first-wave vOPCs steered the migration of cortical interneurons away from the blood vessels to which they were both attracted, thereby allowing interneurons to reach their proper cortical territories.",

The distinctive morphology and our finite element analyses indicate an adaptation for fierce head-butting behavior. Tooth enamel isotope data suggest that D. xiezhi occupied a niche different from that of other herbivores, comparable to the characteristic high-level browsing niche of modern giraffes. The study shows that giraffoids exhibit a higher headgear diversity than other ruminants and that living in specific ecological niches may have fostered various intraspecific combat behaviors that resulted in extreme head-neck morphologies in different giraffoid lineages.",

The triatomic molecules were created by adiabatic magneto-association through an atom\u2013diatomic molecule Feshbach resonance. We obtained clear evidence for the creation of triatomic molecules by directly detecting them using radio-frequency dissociation. Approximately 4000 triatomic molecules with a high-peak phase-space density of 0.05 could be created. The ultracold triatomic molecules can serve as a launchpad to probe the three-body potential energy surface and may be used to prepare quantum degenerate triatomic molecular gases.",

How this germinal zone generates sufficient interneurons for the human brain remains unclear. We found that the human MGE (hMGE) contains nests of proliferative neuroblasts with ultrastructural and transcriptomic features that distinguish them from other progenitors in the hMGE. When dissociated hMGE cells are transplanted into the neonatal mouse brain, they reform into nests containing proliferating neuroblasts that generate young neurons that migrate extensively into the mouse forebrain and mature into different subtypes of functional interneurons. Together, these results indicate that the nest organization and sustained proliferation of neuroblasts in the hMGE provide a mechanism for the extended production of interneurons for the human forebrain.",

We present a global record of imprint\u2014or \u201cghost\u201d\u2014nannofossils that contradicts this view, revealing exquisitely preserved nannoplankton throughout an inferred Jurassic biocalcification crisis. Imprints from two further Cretaceous warming events confirm that the fossil records of these intervals have been strongly distorted by CaCO 3 dissolution. Although the rapidity of present-day climate change exceeds the temporal resolution of most fossil records, complicating direct comparison with past warming events, our findings demonstrate that nannoplankton were more resilient to past events than traditional fossil evidence suggests.",

In this work, we identify an emergent dynamical fractal in a disorder-free, stoichiometric, and three-dimensional magnetic crystal in thermodynamic equilibrium. The phenomenon is born from constraints on the dynamics of the magnetic monopole excitations in spin ice, which restrict them to move on the fractal. This observation explains the anomalous exponent found in magnetic noise experiments in the spin ice compound Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 , and it resolves a long-standing puzzle about its rapidly diverging relaxation time. The capacity of spin ice to exhibit such notable phenomena suggests that there will be further unexpected discoveries in the cooperative dynamics of even simple topological many-body systems.",

In vertebrates, attaining transparency is difficult because their circulatory system is full of red blood cells (RBCs) that strongly attenuate light. Here, we document how glassfrogs overcome this challenge by concealing these cells from view. Using photoacoustic imaging to track RBCs in vivo, we show that resting glassfrogs increase transparency two- to threefold by removing ~89% of their RBCs from circulation and packing them within their liver. Vertebrate transparency thus requires both see-through tissues and active mechanisms that \u201cclear\u201d respiratory pigments from these tissues. Furthermore, glassfrogs\u2019 ability to regulate the location, density, and packing of RBCs without clotting offers insight in metabolic, hemodynamic, and blood-clot research.",

Although migration through pores and tracks in the extracellular matrix (ECM) has been well studied, little is known about cellular traversal into confining cell-dense tissues. We find that embryonic tissue invasion by Drosophila macrophages requires division of an epithelial ectodermal cell at the site of entry. Dividing ectodermal cells disassemble ECM attachment formed by integrin-mediated focal adhesions next to mesodermal cells, allowing macrophages to move their nuclei ahead and invade between two immediately adjacent tissues. Invasion efficiency depends on division frequency, but reduction of adhesion strength allows macrophage entry independently of division. This work demonstrates that tissue dynamics can regulate cellular infiltration.",

The estimates obtained are compatible with the scant historic evidence. In addition to events such as library fires, we identified the original evenness of cultural populations as an overlooked factor in these assemblages\u2019 stability in the face of immaterial loss.

We introduce a route to quantum-correlation\u2013preserving frequency conversion using hydrogen-filled antiresonant-reflecting photonic crystal fibers. Transient optical phonons generated by stimulated Raman scattering enable selective frequency up-conversion by 125 terahertz of the idler photon of an entangled pair, with efficiencies up to 70%. This threshold-less molecular modulation process preserves quantum correlations, making it ideal for applications in quantum information.",

Neurogliaform cells (NGFCs)\u2014which provide GABA ergic inhibition to distal dendrites of pyramidal cells\u2014strongly coupled their firing to those gamma oscillations synchronizing local networks with cortical inputs. Rather than strengthening such synchrony, action potentials of NGFCs decoupled pyramidal cell activity from cortical gamma oscillations but did not reduce their firing nor affect local oscillations.

This sparse activation results from widespread synaptic inhibition in conjunction with neuron-specific synaptic excitation. We report the selective recruitment of hippocampal pyramidal cells into patterned network activity. During ripple oscillations in awake mice, spiking is much more likely in cells in which the axon originates from a basal dendrite rather than from the soma. High-resolution recordings in vitro and computer modeling indicate that these spikes are elicited by synaptic input to the axon-carrying dendrite and thus escape perisomatic inhibition. Pyramidal cells with somatic axon origin can be activated during ripple oscillations by blocking their somatic inhibition. The recruitment of neurons into active ensembles is thus determined by axonal morphological features.",

We present new tomographic images of the shear wave speed of the Yellowstone magmatic system based on full waveform inversion of ambient noise correlations, which illuminates shear wave speed reductions of greater than 30% associated with Yellowstone\u2019s silicic magma reservoir. The slowest seismic wave speeds (shear wave speed less than 2.3 kilometers per second) are present at depths between 3 and 8 kilometers, overlapping with petrological estimates of the assembly depth of erupted rhyolite bodies. Assuming that Yellowstone\u2019s magmatic system is a crystal mush with broadly distributed melt, we estimate a partial melt fraction of 16 to 20%.",

    "abstract": "We experimentally discovered and theoretically analyzed a photochemical mechanism, which we term proton-coupled energy transfer (PCEnT). A series of anthracene-phenol-pyridine triads formed a local excited anthracene state after light excitation at a wavelength of ~400 nanometers (nm), which led to \ufb02uorescence around 550 nm from the phenol-pyridine unit. Direct excitation of phenol-pyridine would have required ~330-nm light, but the coupled proton transfer within the phenol-pyridine unit lowered its excited-state energy so that it could accept excitation energy from anthracene. Singlet-singlet energy transfer thus occurred despite the lack of spectral overlap between the anthracene \ufb02uorescence and the phenol-pyridine absorption. Moreover, theoretical calculations indicated negligible charge transfer between the anthracene and phenol-pyridine units. We construe PCEnT as an elementary reaction of possible relevance to biological systems and future photonic devices.",

Using experiments with the isopod Idotea balthica and the red alga Gracilaria gracilis , we demonstrate that biotic interactions dramatically increase the fertilization success of the alga through animal transport of spermatia on their body. This discovery suggests that animal-mediated fertilization could have evolved independently in terrestrial and marine environments and raises the possibility of its emergence in the sea before plants moved ashore.",

We demonstrated that somatosensory and visual circuits are not by default segregated but require the earliest retinal activity to do so. In the embryo, somatosensory and visual circuits are intermingled in the superior colliculus, leading to cortical multimodal responses to whisker pad stimulation. At birth, these circuits segregate, and responses switch to unimodal. Blocking stage I retinal waves prolongs the multimodal configuration into postnatal life, with the superior colliculus retaining a mixed somato-visual molecular identity and defects arising in the spatial organization of the visual system. Hence, the superior colliculus mediates the timely segregation of sensory modalities in an input-dependent manner, channeling specific sensory cues to their appropriate sensory pathway.",

Our results show that rates of introgression between species decrease with time since divergence and suggest that species must attain a threshold of evolutionary divergence before hybridization results in transitions to unisexuality. Rates of hybridization also predict genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity in whiptail lizards. These results distinguish among models for hybridization that have not previously been tested and suggest that the evolutionary outcomes can be predictable.",

TERT promoter mutations are acquired in about 75% of melanomas but are not sufficient to maintain telomeres, suggesting that additional mutations are required. We identified a cluster of variants in the promoter of ACD encoding the shelterin component TPP1. ACD promoter variants are present in about 5% of cutaneous melanoma and co-occur with TERT promoter mutations. The two most common somatic variants create or modify binding sites for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors, similar to mutations in the TERT promoter. The variants increase the expression of TPP1 and function together with TERT to synergistically lengthen telomeres. Our findings suggest that TPP1 promoter variants collaborate with TERT activation to enhance telomere maintenance and immortalization in melanoma.",

It has long been hypothesized that the pharyngeal (branchial) arch evolved from an unjointed cartilaginous rod in vertebrate ancestors such as that in the nonvertebrate chordate amphioxus, but whether such ancestral anatomy existed remains unknown. The pharyngeal skeleton of controversial Cambrian animals called yunnanozoans may contain the oldest fossil evidence constraining the early evolution of the arches, yet its correlation with that of vertebrates is still disputed. By examining additional specimens in previously unexplored techniques (for example, x-ray microtomography, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectrometry element mapping), we found evidence that yunnanozoan branchial arches consist of cellular cartilage with an extracellular matrix dominated by microfibrils, a feature hitherto considered specific to vertebrates. Our phylogenetic analysis provides further support that yunnanozoans are stem vertebrates.",

The central cyclohexane ring of TTX and its \u03b1-tertiary amine moiety were established by the intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a nitrile oxide, followed by alkynyl addition to the resultant isoxazoline. A ruthenium-catalyzed hydroxylactonization set the stage for the formation of the dioxa-adamantane core. Installation of the guanidine, oxidation of a primary alcohol, and a late-stage epimerization gave a mixture of TTX and anhydro-TTX. This synthetic approach could give ready access to biologically active derivatives.",

We found Nodal to be dispensable for Pitx2 expression during mesentery deformation. Intestinal rotation instead required a mechanosensitive latent transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), tuning a second wave of Pitx2 that induced reciprocal tissue stiffness in the left mesentery as mechanical feedback with the right side.

We devised additional linked inhibitors targeting BCR-ABL1 (DasatiLink-1, MW: 1518 g/mol) and EIF4A1 (BisRoc-1, MW: 1466 g/mol), uptake of which was facilitated by IFITMs. We also found that IFITMs moderately assisted some proteolysis-targeting chimeras and examined the physicochemical requirements for involvement of this uptake pathway.",

Skeletal transformations can be examined directly by studying fossil stem gnathostomes; however, preservation of soft anatomy is rare. We describe the only known example of a three-dimensionally mineralized heart, thick-walled stomach, and bilobed liver from arthrodire placoderms, stem gnathostomes from the Late Devonian Gogo Formation in Western Australia. The application of synchrotron and neutron microtomography to this material shows evidence of a flat S-shaped heart, which is well separated from the liver and other abdominal organs, and the absence of lungs. Arthrodires thus show the earliest phylogenetic evidence for repositioning of the gnathostome heart associated with the evolution of the complex neck region in jawed vertebrates.",

This diversification is understood to coincide with increases in plant body size and branching; however, no selection pressure favoring xylem strand-shape complexity is known. We show that incremental changes in xylem network organization that diverge from the cylindrical ancestral form lead to progressively greater drought resistance by reducing the risk of hydraulic failure. As xylem strand complexity increases, independent pathways for embolism spread become fewer and increasingly concentrated in more centrally located conduits, thus limiting the systemic spread of embolism during drought. Selection by drought may thus explain observed trajectories of xylem strand evolution in the fossil record and the diversity of extant forms.",

    "abstract": "Cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can be beneficial during infection by helping to mount proper immune responses. However, TNF-induced death can also drive a variety of inflammatory pathologies. Protectives brakes, or cell-death checkpoints, normally repress TNF cytotoxicity to protect the organism from its potential detrimental consequences. Thus, although TNF can kill, this only occurs when one of the checkpoints is inactivated. Here, we describe a checkpoint that prevents apoptosis through the detoxification of the cytotoxic complex IIa that forms upon TNF sensing. We found that autophagy-related 9A (ATG9A) and 200kD FAK family kinase-interacting protein (FIP200) promote the degradation of this complex through a light chain 3 (LC3)\u2013independent lysosomal targeting pathway. This detoxification mechanism was found to counteract TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)\u2013mediated embryonic lethality and inflammatory skin disease in mouse models.",

For gases of material particles, studies of the mechanical response are well established, in fields from classical thermodynamics to cold atomic quantum gases. We demonstrate a measurement of the compressibility of a two-dimensional quantum gas of light in a box potential and obtain the equation of state for the optical medium. The experiment was carried out in a nanostructured dye-filled optical microcavity. We observed signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation at high phase-space densities in the finite-size system. Upon entering the quantum degenerate regime, the measured density response to an external force sharply increases, hinting at the peculiar prediction of an infinite compressibility of the deeply degenerate Bose gas.",

    "abstract": "There is wide interest in developing accurate theories for predicting rates of chemical reactions that occur at metal surfaces, especially for applications in industrial catalysis. Conventional methods contain many approximations that lack experimental validation. In practice, there are few reactions where sufficiently accurate experimental data exist to even allow meaningful comparisons to theory. Here, we present experimentally derived thermal rate constants for hydrogen atom recombination on platinum single-crystal surfaces, which are accurate enough to test established theoretical approximations. A quantum rate model is also presented, making possible a direct evaluation of the accuracy of commonly used approximations to adsorbate entropy. We find that neglecting the wave nature of adsorbed hydrogen atoms and their electronic spin degeneracy leads to a 10\u00d7 to 1000\u00d7 overestimation of the rate constant for temperatures relevant to heterogeneous catalysis. These quantum effects are also found to be important for nanoparticle catalysts.",

We solved cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of an intact group IIC intron-maturase retroelement that was poised for integration into a DNA stem-loop motif. By visualizing the RNP before and after DNA targeting, we show that it is primed for attack and fits perfectly with its DNA target.

We propose using the ionocaloric effect and the accompanying thermodynamic cycle as a caloric-based, all\u2013condensed-phase cooling technology. Theoretical and experimental results show higher adiabatic temperature change and entropy change per unit mass and volume compared with other caloric effects under low applied field strengths. We demonstrated the viability of a practical system using an ionocaloric Stirling refrigeration cycle.

We tested this hypothesis using cross-sectional data from wolf populations across North America that vary in the prevalence of CDV and the allele that makes coats black, longitudinal data from Yellowstone National Park, and modeling. We found that the frequency of CDV outbreaks generates fluctuating selection that results in heterozygote advantage that in turn affects the frequency of the black allele, optimal mating behavior, and black wolf cline across the continent.",

Ecological success is often proposed to derive from hybridization through enhanced genetic diversity from repetitive origins or enhanced phenotypic breadth from heterosis. Here, we tested and rejected both hypotheses in a classic parthenogen, the diploid grasshopper Warramaba virgo . Genetic data revealed a single hybrid mating origin at least 0.25 million years ago, and comparative analyses of 14 physiological and life history traits showed no evidence for altered fitness relative to its sexual progenitors. Our findings imply that the rarity of parthenogenesis is due to constraints on origin rather than to rapid extinction.",

This posttranslocational cleavage synergizes with ER-associated degradation to sustain membrane protein homeostasis and contributes to cellular fitness. Cryptic SPC cleavage sites thus serve as predetermined breaking points that, when exposed, help to target misfolded or surplus proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining a healthy membrane proteome.",

Their recovery mechanisms involve complex interactions among the physical senses, muscles, body, and wings, and they must obey the laws of flight. We sought to understand the key mechanisms involved in dragonfly righting reflexes and to develop physics-based models for understanding the control strategies of flight maneuvers. Using kinematic analyses, physical modeling, and three-dimensional flight simulations, we found that a dragonfly uses left-right wing pitch asymmetry to roll its body 180 degrees to recover from falling upside down in ~200 milliseconds. Experiments of dragonflies with blocked vision further revealed that this rolling maneuver is initiated by their ocelli and compound eyes. These results suggest a pathway from the dragonfly\u2019s visual system to the muscles regulating wing pitch that underly the recovery. The methods developed here offer quantitative tools for inferring insects\u2019 internal actions from their acrobatics, and are applicable to a broad class of natural and robotic flying systems.",

Its ablation resulted in viable mice in which the cytoskeleton was composed of immature actin molecules across all tissues. However, in skeletal muscle, the lengths of sarcomeric actin filaments were shorter, muscle function was decreased, and centralized nuclei, a common hallmark of myopathies, progressively accumulated. Thus, ACTMAP encodes the missing factor required for the synthesis of mature actin and regulates specific actin-dependent traits in vivo.",

However, global estimation of biosphere productivity remains a challenge. Using the ancient air enclosed in polar ice cores, we present the first 800,000-year record of triple isotopic ratios of atmospheric oxygen, which reflects past global biosphere productivity. We observe that global biosphere productivity in the past eight glacial intervals was lower than that in the preindustrial era and that, in most cases, it starts to increase millennia before deglaciations. Both variations occur concomitantly with CO 2 changes, implying a dominant control of CO 2 on global biosphere productivity that supports a pervasive negative feedback under the glacial climate.",

    "abstract": "Despite quantum electrodynamics (QED) being one of the most stringently tested theories underpinning modern physics, recent precision atomic spectroscopy measurements have uncovered several small discrepancies between experiment and theory. One particularly powerful experimental observable that tests QED independently of traditional energy level measurements is the \u201ctune-out\u201d frequency, where the dynamic polarizability vanishes and the atom does not interact with applied laser light. In this work, we measure the tune-out frequency for the 2 3 S 1 state of helium between transitions to the 2 3 P and 3 3 P manifolds and compare it with new theoretical QED calculations. The experimentally determined value of 725,736,700(260) megahertz differs from theory [725,736,252(9) megahertz] by 1.7 times the measurement uncertainty and resolves both the QED contributions and retardation corrections.",

We show here that CD8\u03b1 is critical for the maintenance of CD8 + T cells in a physiologically quiescent state in peripheral lymphoid organs. Upon inducible deletion of CD8\u03b1, both na\u00efve and memory CD8 + T cells spontaneously acquired activation phenotypes and subsequently died without exposure to specific antigens. PILR\u03b1 was identified as a ligand for CD8\u03b1 in both mice and humans, and disruption of this interaction was able to break CD8 + T cell quiescence. Thus, peripheral T cell pool size is actively maintained by the CD8\u03b1\u2013PILR\u03b1 interaction in the absence of antigen exposure.",

For multiferroics, which exhibit several types of ferroic order at once, it is also relevant how the domains of the coexisting ferroic states couple and what kind of functionality this might involve. In this work, we demonstrate the reversible transfer of a domain pattern between magnetization and electric-polarization space in the multiferroic Dy 0.7 Tb 0.3 FeO 3 . A magnetic field transfers a ferromagnetic domain pattern into an identical ferroelectric domain pattern while erasing it at its magnetic origin. Reverse transfer completes the cycle. To assess the generality of our experiment, we elaborate on its conceptual origin and aspects of application.",

We measured krypton isotopes in the martian meteorite Chassigny, representative of the planet\u2019s interior. We found chondritic krypton isotope ratios, which imply early incorporation of chondritic volatiles. The atmosphere of Mars has different (solar-type) krypton isotope ratios, indicating that it is not a product of magma ocean outgassing or fractionation of interior volatiles. Atmospheric krypton instead originates from accretion of solar nebula gas after formation of the mantle but before nebular dissipation. Our observations contradict the common hypothesis that during planet formation, chondritic volatile delivery occurred after solar gas acquisition.",

Although acetylene has well-documented coordination chemistry with mononuclear transition metals, coordination complexes that feature P 2 bound to a single metal center have remained elusive.

We measured precise line wavelengths from observations of 17 stars, selected to have almost identical atmospheric properties to those of the Sun (solar twins), which reduces those systematic effects. We found that \u03b1 varies by \u2272 50 parts per billion within 50 parsecs from Earth. Combining the results from all 17 stars provides an empirical local reference for stellar measurements of \u03b1, with an ensemble precision of 12 parts per billion.",

We propose that cetaceans have evolved a pulse-transfer mechanism that minimizes pulsatility in cerebral arterial-to-venous pressure differentials without dampening the pressure pulses themselves. We tested this hypothesis using a computational model based on morphology from 11 species and found that the large arterial capacitance in the retia, coupled with the small extravascular capacitance in the cranium and vertebral canal, could protect the cerebral vasculature from 97% of systemic pulsatility. Evolution of the retial complex in cetaceans\u2014likely linked to the development of dorsoventral fluking\u2014offers a distinctive solution to adverse locomotion-generated vascular pulsatility.",

In this work, we show that combinations of organic acids and glucose trigger phenotypes that are associated with the late stage of biotrophy for the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis . These phenotypes include the expression of a set of effectors normally observed only during biotrophic development, as well as the formation of melanin associated with sporulation in plant tumors. U. maydis and other hemibiotrophic fungi also respond to a combination of carbon sources with enhanced proliferation. Thus, the response to combinations of nutrients from the host may be a conserved feature of fungal biotrophy.",

Here, we statistically reconstructed changes in woody biomass across the upper Midwestern region of the United States over the past 10,000 years using a Bayesian model calibrated to preindustrial forest biomass estimates and fossil pollen records. After an initial postglacial decline, woody biomass nearly doubled during the past 8000 years, sequestering 1800 teragrams. This steady accumulation of carbon was driven by two separate ecological responses to regionally changing climate: the spread of forested biomes and the population expansion of high-biomass tree species within forests. What took millennia to accumulate took less than two centuries to remove: Industrial-era logging and agriculture have erased this carbon accumulation.",

We tested 13,097 COVID-19 patients sampled between mid-2021 to early 2022 from 22 African countries for BA.1 by real-time RT-PCR. By November-December 2021, BA.1 had replaced the Delta variant in all African sub-regions following a South-North gradient, with a peak Rt of 4.1. Polymerase chain reaction and near-full genome sequencing data revealed genetically diverse Omicron ancestors already existed across Africa by August 2021. Mutations, altering viral tropism, replication and immune escape, gradually accumulated in the spike gene. Omicron ancestors were therefore present in several African countries months before Omicron dominated transmission. These data also indicate that travel bans are ineffective in the face of undetected and widespread infection.",

Here, we probed the tunneling properties of spin-momentum-locked relativistic fermions by designing and implementing a tunneling geometry that uses nanowires of the topological Kondo insulator candidate samarium hexaboride. The nanowires are attached to the end of scanning tunneling microscope tips and used to image the bicollinear stripe spin order in the antiferromagnet Fe 1.03 Te with a Neel temperature of about 50 kelvin. The antiferromagnetic stripes become invisible above 10 kelvin concomitant with the suppression of the topological surface states in the tip. We further demonstrate that the direction of spin polarization is tied to the tunneling direction. Our technique establishes samarium hexaboride nanowires as ideal conduits for spin-polarized currents.",
