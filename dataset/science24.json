    "abstract": "Inverted (pin) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) afford improved operating stability in comparison to their nip counterparts but have lagged in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The energetic losses responsible for this PCE deficit in pin PSCs occur primarily at the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge-transport layers. Additive and surface treatments that use passivating ligands usually bind to a single active binding site: This dense packing of electrically resistive passivants perpendicular to the surface may limit the fill factor in pin PSCs. We identified ligands that bind two neighboring lead(II) ion (Pb 2+ ) defect sites in a planar ligand orientation on the perovskite. We fabricated pin PSCs and report a certified quasi\u2013steady state PCE of 26.15 and 24.74% for 0.05\u2013 and 1.04\u2013square centimeter illuminated areas, respectively. The devices retain 95% of their initial PCE after 1200 hours of continuous 1 sun maximum power point operation at 65\u00b0C.",

We describe RoseTTAFold All-Atom (RFAA), which combines a residue-based representation of amino acids and DNA bases with an atomic representation of all other groups to model assemblies that contain proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, metals, and covalent modifications, given their sequences and chemical structures. By fine-tuning on denoising tasks, we developed RFdiffusion All-Atom (RFdiffusionAA), which builds protein structures around small molecules. Starting from random distributions of amino acid residues surrounding target small molecules, we designed and experimentally validated, through crystallography and binding measurements, proteins that bind the cardiac disease therapeutic digoxigenin, the enzymatic cofactor heme, and the light-harvesting molecule bilin.",

    "abstract": "Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been improved by the use of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) hole transport layer. Long-term stability of PSCs requires keeping the SAM compact under the perovskite layer during operation. We found that strong polar solvents in the perovskite precursor desorb the SAM if it is anchored on substrates by hydrogen-bonded, rather than covalently bonded, hydroxyl groups. We used atomic-layer deposition to create an indium tin oxide substrate with a fully covalent hydroxyl-covered surface for SAM anchoring, as well as a SAM with a trimethoxysilane group that exhibited strong tridentate anchoring to the substrate. The resulting PSCs achieved PCEs of 24.8 (certified 24.6) and 23.2% with aperture areas of 0.08 and 1.01 square centimeters, respectively. The devices retained 98.9 and 98.2% of the initial PCE after 1000 hours damp-heat test and operation in maximum power point tracking at 85\u00b0C for 1200 hours under standard illumination, respectively.",

Pore size has long been considered the main lever to improve capacitance. However, our evaluation of a large series of commercial nanoporous carbons finds a lack of correlation between pore size and capacitance. Instead, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements and simulations reveal a strong correlation between structural disorder in the electrodes and capacitance. More disordered carbons with smaller graphene-like domains show higher capacitances owing to the more efficient storage of ions in their nanopores. Our findings suggest ways to understand and exploit disorder to achieve highly energy-dense supercapacitors.",

    "abstract": "Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells offer a promising route to increase the power conversion efficiency of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells beyond the theoretical single-junction limitations at an affordable cost. In the past decade, progress has been made toward the fabrication of highly efficient laboratory-scale tandems through a range of vacuum- and solution-based perovskite processing technologies onto various types of c-Si bottom cells. However, to become a commercial reality, the transition from laboratory to industrial fabrication will require appropriate, scalable input materials and manufacturing processes. In addition, perovskite/silicon tandem research needs to increasingly focus on stability, reliability, throughput of cell production and characterization, cell-to-module integration, and accurate field-performance prediction and evaluation. This Review discusses these aspects in view of contemporary solar cell manufacturing, offers insights into the possible pathways toward commercial perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics, and highlights research opportunities to realize this goal.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are increasingly recognized as key players in the tumor immune response and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite recent advances characterizing the diversity of neutrophil states in cancer, common trajectories and mechanisms governing the ontogeny and relationship between these neutrophil states remain undefined. Here, we demonstrate that immature and mature neutrophils that enter tumors undergo irreversible epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic modifications to converge into a distinct, terminally differentiated dcTRAIL-R1 + state. Reprogrammed dcTRAIL-R1 + neutrophils predominantly localize to a glycolytic and hypoxic niche at the tumor core and exert pro-angiogenic function that favors tumor growth. We found similar trajectories in neutrophils across multiple tumor types and in humans, suggesting that targeting this program may provide a means of enhancing certain cancer immunotherapies.",

We propose a high-entropy design in barium titanate (BaTiO 3 )\u2013based lead-free MLCCs with polymorphic relaxor phase. This strategy effectively minimizes hysteresis loss by lowering the domain-switching barriers and enhances the breakdown strength by the high atomic disorder with lattice distortion and grain refining. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, we achieved a high energy density of 20.8 joules per cubic centimeter with an ultrahigh efficiency of 97.5% in the MLCCs. This approach should be universally applicable to designing high-performance dielectrics for energy storage and other related functionalities.",

These impacts include changes in groundwater recharge, discharge, flow, storage, and distribution. Climate-induced shifts are evident in altered recharge rates, greater groundwater contribution to streamflow in glacierized catchments, and enhanced groundwater flow in permafrost areas. Direct anthropogenic changes include groundwater withdrawal and injection, regional flow regime modification, water table and storage alterations, and redistribution of embedded groundwater in foods globally. Notably, groundwater extraction contributes to sea level rise, increasing the risk of groundwater inundation in coastal areas. The role of groundwater in the global water cycle is becoming more dynamic and complex. Quantifying these changes is essential to ensure sustainable supply of fresh groundwater resources for people and ecosystems.",

The Ir VI - ado was synthesized by oxidatively substituting the ligands of potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) (K 2 IrCl 6 ) with manganese oxide (MnO 2 ). The mass-specific activity (1.7 \u00d7 10 5 amperes per gram of iridium) and turnover number (1.5 \u00d7 10 8 ) exceeded those of benchmark iridium oxides, and in situ x-ray analysis during PEM operations manifested the durability of Ir VI at current densities up to 2.3 amperes per square centimeter. The high activity and stability of Ir VI - ado showcase its promise as an anode material for PEM electrolysis.",

We report a three-dimensionally (3D) architected electronic skin (denoted as 3DAE-Skin) with force and strain sensing components arranged in a 3D layout that mimics that of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings in human skin. This 3DAE-Skin shows excellent decoupled sensing performances of normal force, shear force, and strain and enables development of a tactile system for simultaneous modulus/curvature measurements of an object through touch. Demonstrations include rapid modulus measurements of fruits, bread, and cake with various shapes and degrees of freshness.",

In this study, we present aqueous synthesized perovskite microcrystals as precursor materials for PSCs. Our approach enables kilogram-scale mass production and synthesizes formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) microcrystals with up to 99.996% purity, with an average value of 99.994 \u00b1 0.0015%, from inexpensive, low-purity raw materials. The reduction in calcium ions, which made up the largest impurity in the aqueous solution, led to the greatest reduction in carrier trap states, and its deliberate introduction was shown to decrease device performance. With these purified precursors, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.6% (25.3% certified) in inverted PSCs and retained 94% of the initial PCE after 1000 hours of continuous simulated solar illumination at 50\u00b0C.",

The bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3 )\u2013based coolers currently in use are limited by the scarcity of Te and less-than-ideal cooling capability. We demonstrate how removing lattice vacancies through a grid-design strategy switched PbSe from being useful as a medium-temperature power generator to a thermoelectric cooler. At room temperature, the seven-pair device based on n-type PbSe and p-type SnSe produced a maximum cooling temperature difference of ~73 kelvin, with a single-leg power generation efficiency approaching 11.2%. We attribute our results to a power factor of >52 microwatts per centimeter per square kelvin, which was achieved by boosting carrier mobility. Our demonstration suggests a path for commercial applications of thermoelectric cooling based on Earth-abundant Te-free selenide-based compounds.",

We scrutinized this optimism by examining how well a machine learning model performed across several independent clinical trials of antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia. Models predicted patient outcomes with high accuracy within the trial in which the model was developed but performed no better than chance when applied out-of-sample. Pooling data across trials to predict outcomes in the trial left out did not improve predictions. These results suggest that models predicting treatment outcomes in schizophrenia are highly context-dependent and may have limited generalizability.",

This catalyst demonstrates exceptional stability against coke formation for 5500 hours in continuous pure propane dehydrogenation with 99% propylene selectivity and propane conversions close to the thermodynamic equilibrium value at 550\u00b0C.

Using nanoconfined water-induced basal-plane alignment and covalent and \u03c0-\u03c0 interplatelet bridging, we fabricated Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene-bridged graphene sheets at room temperature with isotropic in-plane tensile strength of 1.87 gigapascals and moduli of 98.7 gigapascals. The in-plane room temperature electrical conductivity reached 1423 siemens per centimeter, and volumetric specific capacity reached 828 coulombs per cubic centimeter.

We developed a CF 3 COOH/CF 3 CH 2 NH 2 protocol to harvest single-crystal COFs within 1 to 2 days with crystal sizes of up to 150 microns.

The structures obtained included uncommon interpenetration of networks, and the details of the structural evolution of conformational isomers and host-guest interaction could be determined at the atomic level.",

We discovered that DNA and gelatin aggregation into an ordered layered aerogel achieves a solar-weighted reflectance of 104.0% in visible light regions through fluorescence and phosphorescence. The cooling effect can reduce ambient temperatures by 16.0\u00b0C under high solar irradiance. In addition, the aerogel, efficiently produced at scale through water-welding, displays high reparability, recyclability, and biodegradability, completing an environmentally conscious life cycle.

We performed device simulation and carrier dynamics analysis to design a p-MPSC with mesoporous layers of semiconducting titanium dioxide, insulating zirconium dioxide, and conducting carbon infiltrated with perovskite that enabled three-dimensional injection of photoexcited electrons into titanium dioxide for collection at a transparent conductor layer. Holes underwent long-distance diffusion toward the carbon back electrode, and this carrier separation reduced recombination at the back contact. Nonradiative recombination at the bulk titanium dioxide/perovskite interface was reduced by ammonium phosphate modification. The resulting p-MPSCs achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.2% and maintained 97% of their initial efficiency after 750 hours of maximum power point tracking at 55 \u00b1 5\u00b0C.",

    "abstract": "Based on an extensive model intercomparison, we assessed trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services from historical reconstructions and future scenarios of land-use and climate change. During the 20th century, biodiversity declined globally by 2 to 11%, as estimated by a range of indicators. Provisioning ecosystem services increased several fold, and regulating services decreased moderately. Going forward, policies toward sustainability have the potential to slow biodiversity loss resulting from land-use change and the demand for provisioning services while reducing or reversing declines in regulating services. However, negative impacts on biodiversity due to climate change appear poised to increase, particularly in the higher-emissions scenarios. Our assessment identifies remaining modeling uncertainties but also robustly shows that renewed policy efforts are needed to meet the goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity.",

    "abstract": "Radiative cooling textiles hold promise for achieving personal thermal comfort under increasing global temperature. However, urban areas have heat island effects that largely diminish the effectiveness of cooling textiles as wearable fabrics because they absorb emitted radiation from the ground and nearby buildings. We developed a mid-infrared spectrally selective hierarchical fabric (SSHF) with emissivity greatly dominant in the atmospheric transmission window through molecular design, minimizing the net heat gain from the surroundings. The SSHF features a high solar spectrum reflectivity of 0.97 owing to strong Mie scattering from the nano-micro hybrid fibrous structure. The SSHF is 2.3\u00b0C cooler than a solar-reflecting broadband emitter when placed vertically in simulated outdoor urban scenarios during the day and also has excellent wearable properties.",

Lack of inclusion must be addressed at-scale to identify causal disease factors and understand the genetic causes of health disparities. We present genome-wide associations for 2068 traits from 635,969 participants in the Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program, a longitudinal study of diverse United States Veterans. Systematic analysis revealed 13,672 genomic risk loci; 1608 were only significant after including non-European populations. Fine-mapping identified causal variants at 6318 signals across 613 traits. One-third ( n = 2069) were identified in participants from non-European populations. This reveals a broadly similar genetic architecture across populations, highlights genetic insights gained from underrepresented groups, and presents an extensive atlas of genetic associations.",

Our approach integrates a comprehensive climate policy database with a machine learning\u2013based extension of the common difference-in-differences approach. We identified 63 successful policy interventions with total emission reductions between 0.6 billion and 1.8 billion metric tonnes CO 2 . Our insights on effective but rarely studied policy combinations highlight the important role of price-based instruments in well-designed policy mixes and the policy efforts necessary for closing the emissions gap.",

Yet previous failures in correcting conspiracy beliefs may be due to counterevidence being insufficiently compelling and tailored. To evaluate this possibility, we leveraged developments in generative artificial intelligence and engaged 2190 conspiracy believers in personalized evidence-based dialogues with GPT-4 Turbo. The intervention reduced conspiracy belief by ~20%. The effect remained 2 months later, generalized across a wide range of conspiracy theories, and occurred even among participants with deeply entrenched beliefs. Although the dialogues focused on a single conspiracy, they nonetheless diminished belief in unrelated conspiracies and shifted conspiracy-related behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that many conspiracy theory believers can revise their views if presented with sufficiently compelling evidence.",

We discovered high piezoelectricity in a molecular crystal HOCH 2 (CF 2 ) 3 CH 2 OH [2,2,3,3,4,4-hexafluoropentane-1,5-diol (HFPD)] with a large piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of ~138 picocoulombs per newton and piezoelectric voltage constant g 33 of ~2450 \u00d7 10 \u22123 volt-meters per newton under no poling conditions, which also exhibits good biocompatibility toward biological cells and desirable biodegradation and biosafety in physiological environments. HFPD can be composite with polyvinyl alcohol to form flexible piezoelectric films with a d 33 of 34.3 picocoulombs per newton. Our material demonstrates the ability for molecular crystals to have attractive piezoelectric properties and should be of interest for applications in transient implantable electromechanical devices.",

Polyamide films offer excellent water permeability and salt rejection but also suffer from poor chlorine resistance, high fouling propensity, and low boron rejection. We addressed these issues by molecularly designing a polyester thin-film composite reverse osmosis membrane using co-solvent\u2013assisted interfacial polymerization to react 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methylbenzoic acid with trimesoyl chloride. This polyester membrane exhibits substantial water permeability, high rejection for sodium chloride and boron, and complete resistance toward chlorine. The ultrasmooth, low-energy surface of the membrane also prevents fouling and mineral scaling compared with polyamide membranes. These membranes could increasingly challenge polyamide membranes by further optimizing water-salt selectivity, offering a path to considerably reducing pretreatment steps in desalination.",

To decode the functions of tumor-infiltrating B cells, we generated a B cell blueprint encompassing single-cell transcriptome, B cell\u2013receptor repertoire, and chromatin accessibility data across 20 different cancer types (477 samples, 269 patients). B cells harbored extraordinary heterogeneity and comprised 15 subsets, which could be grouped into two independent developmental paths (extrafollicular versus germinal center). Tumor types grouped into the extrafollicular pathway were linked with worse clinical outcomes and resistance to immunotherapy. The dysfunctional extrafollicular program was associated with glutamine-derived metabolites through epigenetic-metabolic cross-talk, which promoted a T cell\u2013driven immunosuppressive program. These data suggest an intratumor B cell balance between extrafollicular and germinal-center responses and suggest that humoral immunity could possibly be harnessed for B cell\u2013targeting immunotherapy.",

In this work, we report the dislocation cutting of B2 (ordered body-centered cubic) nanoprecipitates, typically considered nonshearable intermetallics, in a lightweight compositionally complex steel during cryogenic tensile loading. Shearing is enabled by the high strength level for dislocation glide within the austenitic matrix, attributed to the substantial strengthening from subnanoscale local chemical ordering zones and the pronounced solid solution strengthening from the multiprincipal elements in the matrix. This mechanism not only harnesses the intense strengthening and strain hardening provided by otherwise impenetrable brittle nanoprecipitates but also introduces ductility through their sequential shearing with ongoing deformation. Our steel thus showcases ultrahigh cryogenic tensile strength up to 2 gigapascal at a remarkable tensile elongation of 34%. This study reveals a new strategy for designing high-performance structural materials.",

Using Ti\u22125Al\u22125Mo\u22125V\u22123Cr as a model alloy, we show that adding molybdenum (Mo) nanoparticles promotes grain refinement during solidification and suppresses the formation of phase heterogeneities during solid-state thermal cycling.

We demonstrate how this alloy can be modified by a single component to address unfavorable microstructures, providing a pathway to achieve desirable mechanical characteristics directly from 3D printing.",

    "abstract": "Assembling titanium carbide (Ti 3 C 2 T x ) MXene nanosheets into macroscopic films presents challenges, including voids, low orientation degree, and weak interfacial interactions, which reduce mechanical performance. We demonstrate an ultrastrong macroscopic MXene film using liquid metal (LM) and bacterial cellulose (BC) to sequentially bridge MXene nanosheets (an LBM film), achieving a tensile strength of 908.4 megapascals. A layer-by-layer approach using repeated cycles of blade coating improves the orientation degree to 0.935 in the LBM film, while a LM with good deformability reduces voids into porosity of 5.4%. The interfacial interactions are enhanced by the hydrogen bonding from BC and the coordination bonding with LM, which improves the stress-transfer efficiency. Sequential bridging provides an avenue for assembling other two-dimensional nanosheets into high-performance materials.",

    "abstract": "Air sensitivity remains a substantial barrier to the commercialization of sodium (Na)\u2013layered oxides (NLOs). This problem has puzzled the community for decades because of the complexity of interactions between air components and their impact on both bulk and surfaces of NLOs. We show here that water vapor plays a pivotal role in initiating destructive acid and oxidative degradations of NLOs only when coupled with carbon dioxide or oxygen, respectively. Quantification analysis revealed that reducing the defined cation competition coefficient (\u03b7), which integrates the effects of ionic potential and sodium content, and increasing the particle size can enhance the resistance to acid attack, whereas using high-potential redox couples can eliminate oxidative degradation. These findings elucidate the underlying air deterioration mechanisms and rationalize the design of air-stable NLOs.",

To overcome this dilemma, we propose a microcapacitor-structure model comprising conductive fillers as polar plates and intermediate polymer as a dielectric layer to develop insulating electromagnetic interference\u2013shielding polymer composites. The electron oscillation in plates and dipole polarization in dielectric layers contribute to the reflection and absorption of electromagnetic waves. Guided by this, the synergistic nonpercolation densification and dielectric enhancement enable our composite to combine high resistivity, shielding performance, and thermal conductivity. Its insulating feature allows for direct potting into the crevices among assembled components to address electromagnetic compatibility and heat-accumulation issues.",

Based on experimental \u200edata, interpretable machine learning, theoretical derivation, and first-principles simulations, we established a \u200egeneral theory of metal-oxide interactions grounded in \u200emetal-metal and metal-oxygen interactions. The theory applies to metal nanoparticles and atoms on oxide supports and oxide films on metal supports. We found that for late-transition metal catalysts, metal-metal interactions dominated the oxide support effects and suboxide encapsulation over metal nanoparticles. A principle of strong metal-metal interactions for encapsulation occurrence is formulated and substantiated by extensive \u200eexperiments including 10 metals and 16 \u200eoxides. The valuable insights revealed on (strong) metal-support interaction advance the interfacial design of supported metal catalysts.",

Its biosynthesis involves the formation of a highly functionalized diterpenoid core skeleton (baccatin III) and the subsequent assembly of a phenylisoserinoyl side chain. Despite intensive investigation for half a century, the complete biosynthetic pathway of baccatin III remains unknown. In this work, we identified a bifunctional cytochrome P450 enzyme [taxane oxetanase 1 (TOT1)] in Taxus mairei that catalyzes an oxidative rearrangement in paclitaxel oxetane formation, which represents a previously unknown enzyme mechanism for oxetane ring formation. We created a screening strategy based on the taxusin biosynthesis pathway and uncovered the enzyme responsible for the taxane oxidation of the C9 position (T9\u03b1H1). Finally, we artificially reconstituted a biosynthetic pathway for the production of baccatin III in tobacco.",

Here we identify inhibitor resistance mutations in BTK with distinct enzymatic activities, including some that impair BTK enzymatic activity while imparting novel protein-protein interactions that sustain B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Furthermore, we describe a clinical-stage BTK and IKZF1/3 degrader, NX-2127, that can bind and proteasomally degrade each mutant BTK proteoform, resulting in potent blockade of BCR signaling. Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with NX-2127 achieves >80% degradation of BTK in patients and demonstrates proof-of-concept therapeutic benefit. These data reveal an oncogenic scaffold function of mutant BTK that confers resistance across clinically approved BTK inhibitors but is overcome by BTK degradation in patients.",

However, inevitable fatigue hinders practical applications of these materials. Fatigue-free ferroelectric switching could dramatically improve the endurance of such devices. We report a fatigue-free ferroelectric system based on the sliding ferroelectricity of bilayer 3R molybdenum disulfide (3R-MoS 2 ). The memory performance of this ferroelectric device does not show the wake-up effect at low cycles or a substantial fatigue effect after 10 6 switching cycles under different pulse widths. The total stress time of the device under an electric field is up to 10 5 s, which is long relative to other devices. Our theoretical calculations reveal that the fatigue-free feature of sliding ferroelectricity is due to the immobile charge defects in sliding ferroelectricity.",

We show that nanocrystalline cubic molybdenum carbide (\u03b1-Mo 2 C), prepared through a facile and scalable route, offers 100% selectivity for CO 2 reduction to CO while maintaining its initial equilibrium conversion at high space velocity after more than 500 hours of exposure to harsh reaction conditions at 600\u00b0C. The combination of operando and postreaction characterization of the catalyst revealed that its high activity, selectivity, and stability are attributable to crystallographic phase purity, weak CO-Mo 2 C interactions, and interstitial oxygen atoms, respectively. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided evidence that the reaction proceeds through an H 2 -aided redox mechanism.",

We report two intravenous priming agents given 1 to 2 hours before a blood draw to recover more ctDNA. Our priming agents consist of nanoparticles that act on the cells responsible for cfDNA clearance and DNA-binding antibodies that protect cfDNA. In tumor-bearing mice, they greatly increase the recovery of ctDNA and improve the sensitivity for detecting small tumors.",

However, cathodes with high nickel content (>70%) suffer from substantial capacity degradation, which poses a challenge to their commercial viability. Leveraging multiscale spatial resolution diffraction and imaging techniques, we observe that lattice rotations occur universally in single-crystalline cathodes and play a pivotal role in the structure degradation. These lattice rotations prove unrecoverable and govern the accumulation of adverse lattice distortions over repeated cycles, contributing to structural and mechanical degradation and fast capacity fade. These findings bridge the previous knowledge gap that exists in the mechanistic link between fast performance failure and atomic-scale structure degradation.",

We developed single- and multiple-network hydrogels based on a water-soluble n-type semiconducting polymer, endowing conventional hydrogels with semiconducting capabilities. These hydrogels show good electron mobilities and high on/off ratios, enabling the fabrication of complementary logic circuits and signal amplifiers with low power consumption and high gains.

We show that administration of the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor itacitinib after anti\u2013PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) immunotherapy improves immune function and antitumor responses in mice and results in high response rates (67%) in a phase 2 clinical trial for metastatic non\u2013small cell lung cancer. Patients who failed to respond to initial anti\u2013PD-1 immunotherapy but responded after addition of itacitinib had multiple features of poor immune function to anti\u2013PD-1 alone that improved after JAK inhibition.

We examined the strength and fracture toughness of a bcc refractory alloy, NbTaTiHf, from 77 to 1473 kelvin. This alloy\u2019s behavior differed from that of comparable systems by having fracture toughness over 253 MPa\u00b7m 1/2 , which we attribute to a dynamic competition between screw and edge dislocations in controlling the plasticity at a crack tip. Whereas the glide and intersection of screw and mixed dislocations promotes strain hardening controlling uniform deformation, the coordinated slip of <111> edge dislocations with {110} and {112} glide planes prolongs nonuniform strain through formation of kink bands. These bands suppress strain hardening by reorienting microscale bands of the crystal along directions of higher resolved shear stress and continually nucleate to accommodate localized strain and distribute damage away from a crack tip.",

To investigate the rupture process over multiple fault segments, we performed a comprehensive analysis of local seismic and geodetic data and determined supershear ruptures on the initial branch and the Pazarc\u0131k and Erkenek segments and subshear ruptures on the Amanos segment of event 1. The bilateral rupture of event 2 also presents distinct sub- and supershear velocities. The dynamic stress of the branch fault rupture triggered the Pazarc\u0131k segment initial rupture at a point 9 kilometers west of the junction of these two faults, boosting the supershear rupture of the Pazarc\u0131k segment of the main fault. The geometry and prestress level of multiple segments controlled the rupture behaviors and influenced the ground shaking intensity.",

We developed a hyperelastic hydrogel that possesses a broader elastic range by introducing a reversible pearl-necklace structure, in which beads are connected by strings. The subnanometric beads can efficiently unfold and refold under cyclic mechanical strains; thus, the hydrogel can rapidly recover after being stretched to an areal strain of more than 10,000%. Additionally, the hydrogel can quickly heal from minor mechanical damages such as needle punctures and cuts. These advancements make our ionic hydrogels ideal for multifunctional pneumatic gripper materials; they simultaneously offer an ultralarge gripping range, self-sensing capabilities, and fast healing abilities.",

The cyclic nature of the THTZ-H + cation enables a strong interaction with the lead octahedra of the perovskite lattice through the formation of hydrogen bonds with iodide in multiple directions. This structure improves the device power conversion efficiency (PCE) and phase stability of 1.68 electron volts perovskites under prolonged light and heat exposure under 1-sun illumination at 85\u00b0C.

We report the counterintuitive observation that strongly absorbing molecules can achieve optical transparency in live animals. We explored the physics behind this observation and found that when strongly absorbing molecules dissolve in water, they can modify the refractive index of the aqueous medium through the Kramers-Kronig relations to match that of high-index tissue components such as lipids. We have demonstrated that our straightforward approach can reversibly render a live mouse body transparent to allow visualization of a wide range of deep-seated structures and activities. This work suggests that the search for high-performance optical clearing agents should focus on strongly absorbing molecules.",

Annual greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic system are projected to grow by 37% to 3.35 billion tonnes CO 2 equivalent (3.09 to 3.54) over the same period. The United Nations plastic pollution treaty presents an opportunity to reshape these outcomes. We simulate eight candidate treaty policies and find that just four could together reduce mismanaged plastic waste by 91% (86 to 98%) and gross plastic\u2013related greenhouse gas emissions by one-third.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, there has been growing interest in developing catalysts to enable Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis under milder conditions than currently pertain. Rational catalyst design requires theoretical guidance and clear mechanistic understanding. Recently, a spin-mediated promotion mechanism was proposed to activate traditionally unreactive magnetic materials such as cobalt (Co) for ammonia synthesis by introducing hetero metal atoms bound to the active site of the catalyst surface. We combined theory and experiment to validate this promotion mechanism on a lanthanum (La)/Co system. By conducting model catalyst studies on Co single crystals and mass-selected Co nanoparticles at ambient pressure, we identified the active site for ammonia synthesis as the B 5 site of Co steps with La adsorption. The turnover frequency of 0.47 \u00b1 0.03 per second achieved on the La/Co system at 350\u00b0C and 1 bar surpasses those of other model catalysts tested under identical conditions.",

Precipitation variability should also increase, producing larger wet-dry swings, but that is yet to be confirmed observationally. Here we show that precipitation variability has already grown globally (over 75% of land area) over the past century, as a result of accumulated anthropogenic warming. The increased variability is seen across daily to intraseasonal timescales, with daily variability increased by 1.2% per 10 years globally, and is particularly prominent over Europe, Australia, and eastern North America. Increased precipitation variability is driven mainly by thermodynamics linked to atmospheric moistening, modulated at decadal timescales by circulation changes. Amplified precipitation variability poses new challenges for weather and climate predictions, as well as for resilience and adaptation by societies and ecosystems.",

To date, however, GKP qubits have been demonstrated only at mechanical and microwave frequencies. We realized a GKP state in propagating light at telecommunication wavelength and verified it through homodyne measurements without loss corrections. The generation is based on interference of cat states, followed by homodyne measurements. Our final states exhibit nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity, including the trident shape of faint instances of GKP states.

    "abstract": "We present a design strategy for fabricating ultrastable phase-pure films of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) by lattice templating using specific two-dimensional (2D) perovskites with FA as the cage cation. When a pure FAPbI 3 precursor solution is brought in contact with the 2D perovskite, the black phase forms preferentially at 100\u00b0C, much lower than the standard FAPbI 3 annealing temperature of 150\u00b0C. X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy suggest that the resulting FAPbI 3 film compresses slightly to acquire the (011) interplanar distances of the 2D perovskite seed. The 2D-templated bulk FAPbI 3 films exhibited an efficiency of 24.1% in a p-i-n architecture with 0.5\u2013square centimeter active area and an exceptional durability, retaining 97% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours under 85\u00b0C and maximum power point tracking.",

    "abstract": "Lithium mining is energy intensive and environmentally costly. This is because lithium ions are typically present in brines as a minor component mixed with physiochemically similar cations that are difficult to separate. Inspired by nature\u2019s ability to selectively extract species in transpiration, we report a solar transpiration\u2013powered lithium extraction and storage (STLES) device that can extract and store lithium from brines using natural sunlight. Specifically, the device uses a hierarchically structured solar transpirational evaporator to create a pressure gradient, which allows for the extraction of lithium from brines through a membrane and its storage in a vascular storage layer. Long-term experiments, various membrane tests, and different size assessments demonstrate the stability, compatibility, and scalability of STLES. This solar-powered mining technology provides an alternative developing pathway toward the sustainable extraction of critical resources.",

    "abstract": "Deep crustal production of hydrogen (H 2 ) is a potential source of primary energy if recoverable accumulations in geological formations are sufficiently large. We report direct measurements of an elevated outgassing rate of 84% (by volume) of H 2 from the deep underground Bulqiz\u00eb chromite mine in Albania. A minimum of 200 tons of H 2 is vented annually from the mine\u2019s galleries, making it one of the largest recorded H 2 flow rates to date. We cannot attribute the flux solely to the release of paleo-fluids trapped within the rocks or to present-day active and pervasive serpentinization of ultramafic rocks; rather, our results demonstrate the presence of a faulted reservoir deeply rooted in the Jurassic ophiolite massif. This discovery suggests that certain ophiolites may host economically useful accumulations of H 2 gas.",

We discovered that arterial pressure pulsations can directly modulate central neuronal activity. In a semi-intact rat brain preparation, vascular pressure pulsations elicited correlated local field oscillations in the olfactory bulb mitral cell layer. These oscillations did not require synaptic transmission but reflected baroreceptive transduction in mitral cells. This transduction was mediated by a fast excitatory mechanosensitive ion channel and modulated neuronal spiking activity. In awake animals, the heartbeat entrained the activity of a subset of olfactory bulb neurons within ~20 milliseconds. Thus, we propose that this fast, intrinsic interoceptive mechanism can modulate perception\u2014for example, during arousal\u2014within the olfactory bulb and possibly across various other brain areas.",

The combination yielded a best overall response rate of 53% (10/19).

Ruxolitinib rescued the function of exhausted T cells and enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in preclinical solid tumor and lymphoma models. This synergy was characterized by a switch from suppressive to immunostimulatory myeloid cells, which enhanced T cell division.",

PhanDA exhibits a large range of GMST, spanning 11\u00b0 to 36\u00b0C. Partitioning the reconstruction into climate states indicates that more time was spent in warmer rather than colder climates and reveals consistent latitudinal temperature gradients within each state. There is a strong correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and GMST, identifying CO 2 as the dominant control on variations in Phanerozoic global climate and suggesting an apparent Earth system sensitivity of ~8\u00b0C.",

However, small-molecule concepts that address oncogenic KRAS alleles remain elusive beyond replacing glycine at position 12 with cysteine (G12C), which is clinically drugged through covalent inhibitors. Guided by biophysical and structural studies of ternary complexes, we designed a heterobifunctional small molecule that potently degrades 13 out of 17 of the most prevalent oncogenic KRAS alleles. Compared with inhibition, KRAS degradation results in more profound and sustained pathway modulation across a broad range of KRAS mutant cell lines, killing cancer cells while sparing models without genetic KRAS aberrations. Pharmacological degradation of oncogenic KRAS was tolerated and led to tumor regression in vivo. Together, these findings unveil a new path toward addressing KRAS-driven cancers with small-molecule degraders.",

However, evidence suggesting that climate change has already impacted magnitudes of river flow seasonality is limited to local studies, mainly focusing on changes of mean or extreme flows. This study introduces the use of apportionment entropy as a robust measure to assess flow-volume nonuniformity across seasons, enabling a global analysis. We found that ~21% of long-term river gauging stations exhibit significant alterations in seasonal flow distributions, but two-thirds of these are unrelated to trends in annual mean discharge. By combining a data-driven runoff reconstruction with state-of-the-art hydrological simulations, we identified a discernible weakening of river flow seasonality in northern high latitudes (above 50\u00b0N), a phenomenon directly linked to anthropogenic climate forcing.",

In this work, we report that mice with increased availability of vitamin D display greater immune-dependent resistance to transplantable cancers and augmented responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Similarly, in humans, vitamin D\u2013induced genes correlate with improved responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment as well as with immunity to cancer and increased overall survival. In mice, resistance is attributable to the activity of vitamin D on intestinal epithelial cells, which alters microbiome composition in favor of Bacteroides fragilis , which positively regulates cancer immunity. Our findings indicate a previously unappreciated connection between vitamin D, microbial commensal communities, and immune responses to cancer. Collectively, they highlight vitamin D levels as a potential determinant of cancer immunity and immunotherapy success.",

Sliding ferroelectricity represents a different form of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics, characterized by the switching of out-of-plane polarization through interlayer sliding motion. We examined the FeFET device employing monolayer graphene as the channel layer, which demonstrated ultrafast switching speeds on the nanosecond scale and high endurance exceeding 10 11 switching cycles, comparable to state-of-the-art FeFET devices.

Activation of astrocytic IDO1 by amyloid \u03b2 and tau oligomers increases KYN and suppresses glycolysis in an aryl hydrocarbon receptor\u2013dependent manner. In amyloid and tau models, IDO1 inhibition improves hippocampal glucose metabolism and rescues hippocampal long-term potentiation in a monocarboxylate transporter\u2013dependent manner. In astrocytic and neuronal cocultures from AD subjects, IDO1 inhibition improved astrocytic production of lactate and uptake by neurons.

    "abstract": "The industrial catalysts utilized for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene, an important alternative to petroleum-based cracking processes, either use expensive metals or metal oxides that are environmentally unbenign. We report that a typically less-active oxide, titanium oxide (TiO 2 ), can be combined with earth-abundant metallic nickel (Ni) to form an unconventional Ni@TiO x catalyst for efficient PDH. The catalyst demonstrates a 94% propylene selectivity at 40% propane conversion and superior stability under industrially relevant conditions. Complete encapsulation of Ni nanoparticles was allowed at elevated temperatures (>550\u00b0C). A mechanistic study suggested that the defective TiO x overlayer consisting of tetracoordinated Ti sites with oxygen vacancies is catalytically active. Subsurface metallic Ni acts as an electronic promoter to accelerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation and hydrogen (H 2 ) desorption on the TiO x overlayer.",

In this work, we demonstrate a vapor-based amino-silane passivation that reduces photovoltage deficits to around 100 millivolts (>90% of the thermodynamic limit) in perovskite solar cells of bandgaps between 1.6 and 1.8 electron volts, which is crucial for tandem applications. A primary-, secondary-, or tertiary-amino\u2013silane alone negatively or barely affected perovskite crystallinity and charge transport, but amino-silanes that incorporate primary and secondary amines yield up to a 60-fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield and preserve long-range conduction. Amino-silane\u2013treated devices retained 95% power conversion efficiency for more than 1500 hours under full-spectrum sunlight at 85\u00b0C and open-circuit conditions in ambient air with a relative humidity of 50 to 60%.",

We engineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid, BI-hTFR1, that binds human transferrin receptor (TfR1), a protein expressed on the blood-brain barrier. BI-hTFR1 was actively transported across human brain endothelial cells and, relative to AAV9, provided 40 to 50 times greater reporter expression in the CNS of human TFRC knockin mice. The enhanced tropism was CNS-specific and absent in wild-type mice. When used to deliver GBA1 , mutations of which cause Gaucher disease and are linked to Parkinson\u2019s disease, BI-hTFR1 substantially increased brain and cerebrospinal fluid glucocerebrosidase activity compared with AAV9. These findings establish BI-hTFR1 as a potential vector for human CNS gene therapy.",

In this study, we screened for transcription factors driving ABC formation and found that zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is required for human and mouse ABC differentiation in vitro. ABCs are reduced in ZEB2 haploinsufficient individuals and in mice lacking Zeb2 in B cells. In mice with toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)\u2013driven lupus, ZEB2 is essential for ABC formation and autoimmune pathology. ZEB2 binds to +20-kb myocyte enhancer factor 2b ( Mef2b )\u2019s intronic enhancer, repressing MEF2B-mediated germinal center B cell differentiation and promoting ABC formation. ZEB2 also targets genes important for ABC specification and function, including Itgax . ZEB2-driven ABC differentiation requires JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription), and treatment with JAK1/3 inhibitor reduces ABC accumulation in autoimmune mice and patients. Thus, ZEB2 emerges as a driver of B cell autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of molecularly woven three-dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) crystals into polymers of varying types invokes different forms of contact between filler and polymer. Whereas the combination of woven COFs with amorphous and brittle polymethyl methacrylate results in surface interactions, the use of the liquid-crystalline polymer polyimide induces the formation of polymer-COF junctions. These junctions are generated by the threading of polymer chains through the pores of the nanocrystals, thus allowing for spatial arrangement of polymer strands. This offers a programmable pathway for unthreading polymer strands under stress and leads to the in situ formation of high-aspect-ratio nanofibrils, which dissipate energy during the fracture. Polymer-COF junctions also strengthen the filler-matrix interfaces and lower the percolation thresholds of the composites, enhancing strength, ductility, and toughness of the composites by adding small amounts (~1 weight %) of woven COF nanocrystals. The ability of the polymer strands to closely interact with the woven framework is highlighted as the main parameter to forming these junctions, thus affecting polymer chain penetration and conformation.",

However, owing to their highly cross-linked nature, they suffer from poor recyclability, which contributes to an unacceptable level of environmental pollution. There is a clear need for the design of inherently recyclable ERTs that are based on renewable resources. We present the synthesis and closed-loop recycling of a fully lignocellulose-derivable epoxy resin (DGF/MBCA), prepared from dimethyl ester of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (DMFD), 4,4\u2032-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (MBCA), and glycidol, which displays excellent thermomechanical properties (a glass transition temperature of 170\u00b0C, and a storage modulus at 25\u00b0C of 1.2 gigapascals). Notably, the material undergoes methanolysis in the absence of any catalyst, regenerating 90% of the original DMFD. The diamine MBCA and glycidol can subsequently be reformed by acetolysis. Application and recycling of DGF/MBCA in glass and plant fiber composites are demonstrated.",

Here, we introduce EBCare, a mask-based device for real-time in situ monitoring of EBC biomarkers. Using a tandem cooling strategy, automated microfluidics, highly selective electrochemical biosensors, and a wireless reading circuit, EBCare enables continuous multimodal monitoring of EBC analytes across real-life indoor and outdoor activities. We validated EBCare\u2019s usability in assessing metabolic conditions and respiratory airway inflammation in healthy participants, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and patients after COVID-19 infection.",

Here, we demonstrate subambient daytime radiative cooling of vertical surfaces under peak sunlight using a hierarchically designed, angularly asymmetric, spectrally selective thermal emitter. Under peak sunlight of about 920 watts per square meter, our emitter reaches a temperature that is about 2.5\u00b0C below ambient temperature, corresponding to a temperature reduction of about 4.3\u00b0 and 8.9\u00b0C compared with a silica-polymer hybrid radiative cooler and commercial white paint, respectively.",

Combining the complementary capabilities of two computational methods, we found superconductivity in both the electron- and hole-doped regimes of the two-dimensional Hubbard model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. In the electron-doped regime, superconductivity was weaker and was accompanied by antiferromagnetic N\u00e9el correlations at low doping. The strong superconductivity on the hole-doped side coexisted with stripe order, which persisted into the overdoped region with weaker hole-density modulation. These stripe orders varied in fillings between 0.6 and 0.8. Our results suggest the applicability of the Hubbard model with next-nearest hopping for describing cuprate high\u2013transition temperature ( T c ) superconductivity.",

Hit rates were high and similar for the experimental and AF2 structures, as were affinities. Success in docking against the AF2 models was achieved despite differences between orthosteric residue conformations in the AF2 models and the experimental structures. Determination of the cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure for one of the more potent 5-HT2A ligands from the AF2 docking revealed residue accommodations that resembled the AF2 prediction. AF2 models may sample conformations that differ from experimental structures but remain low energy and relevant for ligand discovery, extending the domain of structure-based drug design.",

    "abstract": "Robust contact schemes that boost stability and simplify the production process are needed for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We codeposited perovskite and hole-selective contact while protecting the perovskite to enable deposition of SnO x /Ag without the use of a fullerene. The SnO x , prepared through atomic layer deposition, serves as a durable inorganic electron transport layer. Tailoring the oxygen vacancy defects in the SnO x layer led to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >25%. Our devices exhibit superior stability over conventional p-i-n PSCs, successfully meeting several benchmark stability tests. They retained >95% PCE after 2000 hours of continuous operation at their maximum power point under simulated AM1.5 illumination at 65\u00b0C. Additionally, they boast a certified T 97 lifetime exceeding 1000 hours.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide loss of species diversity brings urgency to understanding how diverse ecosystems maintain stability. Whereas early ecological ideas and classic observations suggested that stability increases with diversity, ecological theory makes the opposite prediction, leading to the long-standing \u201cdiversity-stability debate.\u201d Here, we show that this puzzle can be resolved if growth scales as a sublinear power law with biomass (exponent <1), exhibiting a form of population self-regulation analogous to models of individual ontogeny. We show that competitive interactions among populations with sublinear growth do not lead to exclusion, as occurs with logistic growth, but instead promote stability at higher diversity. Our model realigns theory with classic observations and predicts large-scale macroecological patterns. However, it makes an unsettling prediction: Biodiversity loss may accelerate the destabilization of ecosystems.",

However, this measurement reflects a combined signal of global temperature and sea level, thus preventing a clear understanding of the interactions and feedbacks of the climate system in causing global temperature change. Our new reconstruction of temperature change over the past 4.5 million years includes two phases of long-term cooling, with the second phase of accelerated cooling during the Middle Pleistocene Transition (1.5 to 0.9 million years ago) being accompanied by a transition from dominant 41,000-year low-amplitude periodicity to dominant 100,000-year high-amplitude periodicity. Changes in the rates of long-term cooling and variability are consistent with changes in the carbon cycle driven initially by geologic processes, followed by additional changes in the Southern Ocean carbon cycle.",

Using a spaceborne synthetic aperture radar interferometry technique, we provided a systematic assessment of land subsidence in all of China\u2019s major cities from 2015 to 2022. Of the examined urban lands, 45% are subsiding faster than 3 millimeters per year, and 16% are subsiding faster than 10 millimeters per year, affecting 29 and 7% of the urban population, respectively. The subsidence appears to be associated with a range of factors such as groundwater withdrawal and the weight of buildings. By 2120, 22 to 26% of China\u2019s coastal lands will have a relative elevation lower than sea level, hosting 9 to 11% of the coastal population, because of the combined effect of city subsidence and sea-level rise. Our results underscore the necessity of enhancing protective measures to mitigate potential damages from subsidence.",

This has challenged conventional understanding of the sources of their volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors. Using airborne flux measurements to map emissions of a wide range of VOCs, we demonstrate that biogenic terpenoid emissions contribute ~60% of emitted VOC OH reactivity, ozone, and secondary organic aerosol formation potential in summertime Los Angeles and that this contribution strongly increases with temperature. This implies that control of nitrogen oxides is key to reducing ozone formation in Los Angeles. We also show some anthropogenic VOC emissions increase with temperature, which is an effect not represented in current inventories. Air pollution mitigation efforts must consider that climate warming will strongly change emission amounts and composition.",

We implemented a partitioning polar-slush strategy in RFEs to push the boundary of U e . Guided by phase-field simulations, we designed and fabricated high-performance Bi(Mg 0.5 Ti 0.5 )O 3 -SrTiO 3 \u2013based RFE films with isolated slush-like polar clusters, which were realized through suppression of the nonpolar cubic matrix and introduction of highly insulating networks. The simultaneous enhancement of the reversible polarization and breakdown strength leads to a U e of 202 joules per cubic centimeter with a high efficiency of ~79%. The proposed strategy provides a design freedom for next-generation high-performance dielectrics.",

This characteristic hinders dislocation nucleation in ceramics, thereby impeding the enhancement of plasticity through a dislocation-engineering strategy commonly used in metals. Finding a strategy that continuously generates dislocations within ceramics may enhance plasticity. Here, we propose a \u201cborrowing-dislocations\u201d strategy that uses a tailored interfacial structure with well-ordered bonds. Such an approach enables ceramics to have greatly improved tensile ductility by mobilizing a considerable number of dislocations in ceramic borrowed from metal through the interface, thereby overcoming the challenge associated with direct dislocation nucleation within ceramics. This strategy provides a way to enhance tensile ductility in ceramics.",

This generalizable approach reaches high monomer conversion at room temperature without the need for additional stimuli, such as light or heat after printing, and enables additive manufacturing of highly entangled hydrogels and elastomers that exhibit fourfold- to sevenfold-higher extension energies in comparison to that of traditional DLP. We used this method to print high-resolution and multimaterial structures with features such as spatially programmed adhesion to wet tissues.",

The QAH states emerge at charge neutrality and feature Chern numbers C = \u00b15 at temperatures of up to about 1.5 kelvin. This large QAHE arises from the synergy of the electron correlation in intrinsic flat bands of pentalayer graphene, the gate-tuning effect, and the proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of crystalline two-dimensional materials for intertwined electron correlation and band topology physics and may enable a route for engineering chiral Majorana edge states.",

Here, we present evidence of rice phytoliths sampled from two archaeological sites in China, Shangshan and Hehuashan, near the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. We demonstrate the growth of wild rice at least 100,000 years before present, its initial exploitation as a gathered resource at about 24,000 years before present, its predomestication cultivation at about 13,000 years before present, and eventually its domestication at about 11,000 years before present. These developmental stages illuminate a protracted process of rice domestication in East Asia and extend the continuous records of cereal evolution beyond the Fertile Crescent.",

We use a weighted sum of multiple devices to represent one number, in which subsequently programmed devices are used to compensate for preceding programming errors.

Two general paradigms have been proposed to explain this variation: (i) trade-offs between performance efficiency and breadth and (ii) the joint influence of extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic (genomic) factors. We assembled genomic, metabolic, and ecological data from nearly all known species of the ancient fungal subphylum Saccharomycotina (1154 yeast strains from 1051 species), grown in 24 different environmental conditions, to examine niche breadth evolution. We found that large differences in the breadth of carbon utilization traits between yeasts stem from intrinsic differences in genes encoding specific metabolic pathways, but we found limited evidence for trade-offs. These comprehensive data argue that intrinsic factors shape niche breadth variation in microbes.",

Our material shows high stability both thermally and temporally. We then assembled an all-Zintl single-stage module, nontoxic and free of tellurium, that demonstrates an exceptional heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency exceeding 10% at a temperature difference of 475 kelvin.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell genomics is a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous tissues such as the brain. Yet little is understood about how genetic variants influence cell-level gene expression. Addressing this, we uniformly processed single-nuclei, multiomics datasets into a resource comprising >2.8 million nuclei from the prefrontal cortex across 388 individuals. For 28 cell types, we assessed population-level variation in expression and chromatin across gene families and drug targets. We identified >550,000 cell type\u2013specific regulatory elements and >1.4 million single-cell expression quantitative trait loci, which we used to build cell-type regulatory and cell-to-cell communication networks. These networks manifest cellular changes in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders. We further constructed an integrative model accurately imputing single-cell expression and simulating perturbations; the model prioritized ~250 disease-risk genes and drug targets with associated cell types.",

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has illuminated the future of the photovoltaic industry, but the development of commercial devices is hampered by their poor stability. In this study, we report a scalable stabilization method using vapor-phase fluoride treatment, which achieves 18.1%-efficient solar modules (228 square centimeters) with accelerated aging\u2013projected T 80 lifetimes (time to 80% of efficiency remaining) of 43,000 \u00b1 9000 hours under 1-sun illumination at 30\u00b0C. The high stability results from vapor-enabled homogeneous fluorine passivation over large-area perovskite surfaces, suppressing defect formation energy and ion diffusion. The extracted degradation activation energy of 0.61 electron volts for solar modules is comparable to that of most reported stable cells, which indicates that modules are not inherently less stable than cells and closes the cell-to-module stability gap.",

In this study, analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) from the first-reported human-infecting bovine H5N1 virus (A/Texas/37/2024, Texas) revealed avian-type receptor binding preference. Notably, a Gln 226 Leu substitution switched Texas HA binding specificity to human-type receptors, which was enhanced when combined with an Asn 224 Lys mutation. Crystal structures of the Texas HA with avian receptor analog LSTa and its Gln 226 Leu mutant with human receptor analog LSTc elucidated the structural basis for this preferential receptor recognition. These findings highlight the need for continuous surveillance of emerging mutations in avian and bovine clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses.",

We assessed these responses using two Earth system models by comparing a scenario with extensive global forest expansion in suitable regions to other plausible futures. We found that forestation increased aerosol scattering and the greenhouse gases methane and ozone following increased biogenic organic emissions. Additionally, forestation decreased surface albedo, which yielded a positive radiative forcing (i.e., warming). This offset up to a third of the negative forcing from the additional CO 2 removal under a 4\u00b0C warming scenario. However, when forestation was pursued alongside other strategies that achieve the 2\u00b0C Paris Agreement target, the offsetting positive forcing was smaller, highlighting the urgency for simultaneous emission reductions.",

    "abstract": "In response to excessive DNA damage, human cells can activate p53 to induce apoptosis. Cells lacking p53 can still undergo apoptosis upon DNA damage, yet the responsible pathways are unknown. We observed that p53-independent apoptosis in response to DNA damage coincided with translation inhibition, which was characterized by ribosome stalling on rare leucine-encoding UUA codons and globally curtailed translation initiation. A genetic screen identified the transfer RNAse SLFN11 and the kinase GCN2 as factors required for UUA stalling and global translation inhibition, respectively. Stalled ribosomes activated a ribotoxic stress signal conveyed by the ribosome sensor ZAK\u03b1 to the apoptosis machinery. These results provide an explanation for the frequent inactivation of SLFN11 in chemotherapy-unresponsive tumors and highlight ribosome stalling as a signaling event affecting cell fate in response to DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary materials discovery requires intricate sequences of synthesis, formulation, and characterization that often span multiple locations with specialized expertise or instrumentation. To accelerate these workflows, we present a cloud-based strategy that enabled delocalized and asynchronous design-make-test-analyze cycles. We showcased this approach through the exploration of molecular gain materials for organic solid-state lasers as a frontier application in molecular optoelectronics. Distributed robotic synthesis and in-line property characterization, orchestrated by a cloud-based artificial intelligence experiment planner, resulted in the discovery of 21 new state-of-the-art materials. Gram-scale synthesis ultimately allowed for the verification of best-in-class stimulated emission in a thin-film device. Demonstrating the asynchronous integration of five laboratories across the globe, this workflow provides a blueprint for delocalizing\u2014and democratizing\u2014scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "The complexity and heterogeneity of schizophrenia have hindered mechanistic elucidation and the development of more effective therapies. Here, we performed single-cell dissection of schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic changes in the human prefrontal cortex across 140 individuals in two independent cohorts. Excitatory neurons were the most affected cell group, with transcriptional changes converging on neurodevelopment and synapse-related molecular pathways. Transcriptional alterations included known genetic risk factors, suggesting convergence of rare and common genomic variants on neuronal population-specific alterations in schizophrenia. Based on the magnitude of schizophrenia-associated transcriptional change, we identified two populations of individuals with schizophrenia marked by expression of specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal cell states. This single-cell atlas links transcriptomic changes to etiological genetic risk factors, contextualizing established knowledge within the human cortical cytoarchitecture and facilitating mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia pathophysiology and heterogeneity.",

We performed deep single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to examine cell composition and transcriptomics, identifying dysregulation of cell type\u2013specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which we corroborated using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics. Transcriptomic changes were primarily cell type specific, involving multiple cell types, most prominently interhemispheric and callosal-projecting neurons, interneurons within superficial laminae, and distinct glial reactive states involving oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. Autism-associated GRN drivers and their targets were enriched in rare and common genetic risk variants, connecting autism genetic susceptibility and cellular and circuit alterations in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a prevalent reproductive disorder in women of reproductive age, features androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Despite its high prevalence, specific pharmacologic intervention for PCOS is challenging. In this study, we identified artemisinins as anti-PCOS agents. Our finding demonstrated the efficacy of artemisinin derivatives in alleviating PCOS symptoms in both rodent models and human patients, curbing hyperandrogenemia through suppression of ovarian androgen synthesis. Artemisinins promoted cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1) protein degradation to block androgen overproduction. Mechanistically, artemisinins directly targeted lon peptidase 1 (LONP1), enhanced LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction, and facilitated LONP1-catalyzed CYP11A1 degradation. Overexpression of LONP1 replicated the androgen-lowering effect of artemisinins. Our data suggest that artemisinin application is a promising approach for treating PCOS and highlight the crucial role of the LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction in controlling hyperandrogenism and PCOS occurrence.",

Carbon nanotube fibers are one of the most promising candidates. Using a strategy to optimize hierarchical structures, we fabricated carbon nanotube fibers with a dynamic strength of 14 gigapascals (GPa) and excellent energy absorption. The dynamic performance of the fibers is attributed to the simultaneous breakage of individual nanotubes and delocalization of impact energy that occurs during the high\u2013strain rate loading process; these behaviors are due to improvements in interfacial interactions, nanotube alignment, and densification therein. This work presents an effective strategy to utilize the strength of individual carbon nanotubes at the macroscale and provides fresh mechanism insights.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are effective antiobesity drugs. However, the precise central mechanisms of GLP-1RAs remain elusive. We administered GLP-1RAs to patients with obesity and observed a heightened sense of preingestive satiation. Analysis of human and mouse brain samples pinpointed GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) as candidates for encoding preingestive satiation. Optogenetic manipulation of DMH GLP-1R neurons caused satiation. Calcium imaging demonstrated that these neurons are actively involved in encoding preingestive satiation. GLP-1RA administration increased the activity of DMH GLP-1R neurons selectively during eating behavior. We further identified that an intricate interplay between DMH GLP-1R neurons and neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARC NPY/AgRP neurons) occurs to regulate food intake. Our findings reveal a hypothalamic mechanism through which GLP-1RAs control preingestive satiation, offering previously unexplored neural targets for obesity and metabolic diseases.",

However, beyond sequence, the three-dimensional structures of proteins determine their specific function, activity, and evolvability. Here, we show that a general protein language model augmented with protein structure backbone coordinates can guide evolution for diverse proteins without the need to model individual functional tasks. We also demonstrate that ESM-IF1, which was only trained on single-chain structures, can be extended to engineer protein complexes. Using this approach, we screened about 30 variants of two therapeutic clinical antibodies used to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We achieved up to 25-fold improvement in neutralization and 37-fold improvement in affinity against antibody-escaped viral variants of concern BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5, respectively. These findings highlight the advantage of integrating structural information to identify efficient protein evolution trajectories without requiring any task-specific training data.",

We control WBG film growth insensitive to compositions by nucleating the 3C phase before any formation of bromine-rich aggregates and 2H phases. The resultant WBG absorbers show improved crystallinity and strong texture with suppressed nonradiative recombination and enhanced resistance to various aging stresses.

Therefore, we established a systemwide portrait of KRAS- and extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinase (ERK)\u2013dependent gene transcription in KRAS-mutant cancer to delineate the molecular mechanisms of growth and of inhibitor resistance. Unexpectedly, our KRAS-dependent gene signature diverges substantially from the frequently cited Hallmark KRAS signaling gene signature, is driven predominantly through the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and accurately reflects KRAS- and ERK-regulated gene transcription in KRAS-mutant cancer patients. Integration with our ERK-regulated phospho- and total proteome highlights ERK deregulation of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and other components of the cell cycle machinery as key processes that drive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) growth. Our findings elucidate mechanistically the critical role of ERK in driving KRAS-mutant tumor growth and in resistance to KRAS-ERK MAPK targeted therapies.",

However, surface epitaxial growth of large multilayer 3R-TMD single crystals is difficult. We report an interfacial epitaxy methodology for their growth of several compositions, including molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), molybdenum diselenide, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, niobium disulfide, niobium diselenide, and molybdenum sulfoselenide. Feeding of metals and chalcogens continuously to the interface between a single-crystal Ni substrate and grown layers ensured consistent 3R stacking sequence and controlled thickness from a few to 15,000 layers. Comprehensive characterizations confirmed the large-scale uniformity, high crystallinity, and phase purity of these films. The as-grown 3R-MoS 2 exhibited room-temperature mobilities up to 155 and 190 square centimeters per volt second for bi- and trilayers, respectively. Optical difference frequency generation with thick 3R-MoS 2 showed markedly enhanced nonlinear response under a quasi\u2013phase matching condition (five orders of magnitude greater than monolayers).",

Polymers of \u03b1-lipoic acid (\u03b1LA) have the potential to fulfill the need for versatile and environmentally friendly adhesives, but their performance is plagued by spontaneous depolymerization. We report a family of stabilized \u03b1LA polymer adhesives that can be tailored for a variety of medical or nonmedical uses and sustainably sourced and recycled in a closed-loop manner. Minor changes in monomer composition afforded a pressure-sensitive adhesive that functions well in dry and wet conditions, as well as a structural adhesive with strength equivalent to that of conventional epoxies. \u03b1LA surgical superglue successfully sealed murine amniotic sac ruptures, increasing fetal survival from 0 to 100%.",

    "abstract": "Age is a major risk factor for cancer, but how aging impacts tumor control remains unclear. In this study, we establish that aging of the immune system, regardless of the age of the stroma and tumor, drives lung cancer progression. Hematopoietic aging enhances emergency myelopoiesis, resulting in the local accumulation of myeloid progenitor\u2013like cells in lung tumors. These cells are a major source of interleukin (IL)\u20131\u237a, which drives the enhanced myeloid response. The age-associated decline of DNA methyltransferase 3A enhances IL-1\u237a production, and disrupting IL-1 receptor 1 signaling early during tumor development normalized myelopoiesis and slowed the growth of lung, colonic, and pancreatic tumors. In human tumors, we identified an enrichment for IL-1\u237a\u2013expressing monocyte-derived macrophages linked to age, poorer survival, and recurrence, unraveling how aging promotes cancer and offering actionable therapeutic strategies.",

Although in silico methods that use protein language models (PLMs) can provide modeled fitness landscape guidance, they struggle to generalize across diverse protein families and map to protein activity. We present EVOLVEpro, a few-shot active learning framework that combines PLMs and regression models to rapidly improve protein activity. EVOLVEpro surpasses current methods, yielding up to 100-fold improvements in desired properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness across six proteins in RNA production, genome editing, and antibody binding applications. These results highlight the advantages of few-shot active learning with minimal experimental data over zero-shot predictions. EVOLVEpro opens new possibilities for artificial intelligence\u2013guided protein engineering in biology and medicine.",

Leads inhibited PL pro with the inhibitory constant K i values from 13.2 to 88.2 nanomolar. The co-crystal structures of PL pro with eight leads revealed their interaction modes. The in vivo lead Jun12682 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, including nirmatrelvir-resistant strains with EC 50 from 0.44 to 2.02 micromolar. Oral treatment with Jun12682 improved survival and reduced lung viral loads and lesions in a SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model, suggesting that PL pro inhibitors are promising oral SARS-CoV-2 antiviral candidates.",

In this study, we conducted local electronic compressibility measurements of twisted bilayer WSe 2 (tWSe 2 ) at small twist angles. We demonstrated multiple topological bands that host a series of Chern insulators at zero magnetic field near a \u201cmagic angle\u201d around 1.23\u00b0. Using a locally applied electric field, we induced a topological quantum-phase transition at one hole per moir\u00e9 unit cell.

This simplification, for example, in the form of intensively managed monocultures, poses a risk to keeping the world within safe and just Earth system boundaries. Here, we estimated how agricultural diversification simultaneously affects social and environmental outcomes. Drawing from 24 studies in 11 countries across 2655 farms, we show how five diversification strategies focusing on livestock, crops, soils, noncrop plantings, and water conservation benefit social (e.g., human well-being, yields, and food security) and environmental (e.g., biodiversity, ecosystem services, and reduced environmental externalities) outcomes. We found that applying multiple diversification strategies creates more positive outcomes than individual management strategies alone. To realize these benefits, well-designed policies are needed to incentivize the adoption of multiple diversification strategies in unison.",

Using satellite and reanalysis data, we identified a record-low planetary albedo as the primary factor bridging this gap. The decline is apparently caused largely by a reduced low-cloud cover in the northern mid-latitudes and tropics, in continuation of a multiannual trend. Further exploring the low-cloud trend and understanding how much of it is due to internal variability, reduced aerosol concentrations, or a possibly emerging low-cloud feedback will be crucial for assessing the present and expected future warming.",

Yet, the effect of protective regulations on shark fishing mortality has not been evaluated at a global scale. Here we estimate that total fishing mortality increased from at least 76 to 80 million sharks between 2012 and 2019, ~25 million of which were threatened species. Mortality increased by 4% in coastal waters but decreased by 7% in pelagic fisheries, especially across the Atlantic and Western Pacific. By linking fishing mortality data to the global regulatory landscape, we show that widespread legislation designed to prevent shark finning did not reduce mortality but that regional shark fishing or retention bans had some success. These analyses, combined with expert interviews, highlight evidence-based solutions to reverse the continued overexploitation of sharks.",

In these structures, three Ap Orco subunits serve as scaffold components that cannot bind the ligand and remain relatively unchanged. Upon ligand binding, the pore-forming helix S7b of Ap OR5 shifts outward from the central pore axis, causing an asymmetrical pore opening for ion influx. Our study provides insights into odorant recognition and channel gating of the OR-Orco heterocomplex and offers structural resources to support development of innovative insecticides and repellents for pest control.",

In this work, we used a chemical library of 1024 molecules\u2014covering insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and plant growth inhibitors\u2014to assess the impact of sublethal pesticide doses on insects. In Drosophila melanogaster , 57% of chemicals affected larval behavior, and a higher proportion compromised long-term survivability. Exposure to sublethal doses also induced widespread changes in the phosphoproteome and changes in development and reproduction. The negative effects of agrochemicals were amplified when the temperature was increased. We observed similar behavioral changes across multiple insect species, including mosquitoes and butterflies. These findings suggest that widespread sublethal pesticide exposure can alter insect behavior and physiology, threatening long-term population survival.",

However, the evolutionary drivers of this radiation remain poorly known. We infer potential causes and ultimate consequences of squamate macroevolution by combining individual-based natural history observations (>60,000 animals) with a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny that we anchored with genomic data (5400 loci) from 1018 species. Due to shifts in the dynamics of speciation and phenotypic evolution, snakes have transformed the trophic structure of animal communities through the recurrent origin and diversification of specialized predatory strategies. Squamate biodiversity reflects a legacy of singular events that occurred during the early history of snakes and reveals the impact of historical contingency on vertebrate biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Brassinosteroids are steroidal phytohormones that regulate plant development and physiology, including adaptation to environmental stresses. Brassinosteroids are synthesized in the cell interior but bind receptors at the cell surface, necessitating a yet to be identified export mechanism. Here, we show that a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, ABCB19, functions as a brassinosteroid exporter. We present its structure in both the substrate-unbound and the brassinosteroid-bound states. Bioactive brassinosteroids are potent activators of ABCB19 ATP hydrolysis activity, and transport assays showed that ABCB19 transports brassinosteroids. In Arabidopsis thaliana , ABCB19 and its close homolog, ABCB1, positively regulate brassinosteroid responses. Our results uncover an elusive export mechanism for bioactive brassinosteroids that is tightly coordinated with brassinosteroid signaling.",

    "abstract": "Methane emissions from solid waste may represent a substantial fraction of the global anthropogenic budget, but few comprehensive studies exist to assess inventory assumptions. We quantified emissions at hundreds of large landfills across 18 states in the United States between 2016 and 2022 using airborne imaging spectrometers. Spanning 20% of open United States landfills, this represents the most systematic measurement-based study of methane point sources of the waste sector. We detected significant point source emissions at a majority (52%) of these sites, many with emissions persisting over multiple revisits (weeks to years). We compared these against independent contemporaneous in situ airborne observations at 15 landfills and established good agreement. Our findings indicate a need for long-term, synoptic-scale monitoring of landfill emissions in the context of climate change mitigation policy.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors can stimulate antitumor immunity but can also induce toxicities termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Colitis is a common and severe irAE that can lead to treatment discontinuation. Mechanistic understanding of gut irAEs has been hampered because robust colitis is not observed in laboratory mice treated with checkpoint inhibitors. We report here that this limitation can be overcome by using mice harboring the microbiota of wild-caught mice, which develop overt colitis following treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Intestinal inflammation is driven by unrestrained activation of IFN\u03b3-producing CD4 + T cells and depletion of peripherally induced regulatory T cells through Fc\u03b3 receptor signaling. Accordingly, anti-CTLA-4 nanobodies that lack an Fc domain can promote antitumor responses without triggering colitis. This work suggests a strategy for mitigating gut irAEs while preserving antitumor stimulating effects of CTLA-4 blockade.",

Here, we reconstructed 10,100 single-neuron projectomes of mouse HIP and classified 43 projectome subtypes with distinct projection patterns. The number of projection targets and axon-tip distribution depended on the soma location along HIP longitudinal and transverse axes. Many projectome subtypes were enriched in specific HIP subdomains defined by spatial transcriptomic profiles. Furthermore, we delineated comprehensive wiring diagrams for HIP neurons projecting exclusively within the HIP formation (HPF) and for those projecting to both intra- and extra-HPF targets. Bihemispheric projecting neurons generally projected to one pair of homologous targets with ipsilateral preference. These organization principles of single-neuron projectomes provide a structural basis for understanding the function of HIP neurons.",

However, the factors responsible for sex differences in tissue immunity remain poorly understood. Here, we uncovered a dominant role for type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in shaping sexual immune dimorphism within the skin. Mechanistically, negative regulation of ILC2s by androgens leads to a reduction in dendritic cell accumulation and activation in males, along with reduced tissue immunity. Collectively, our results reveal a role for the androgen-ILC2-dendritic cell axis in controlling sexual immune dimorphism. Moreover, this work proposes that tissue immune set points are defined by the dual action of sex hormones and the microbiota, with sex hormones controlling the strength of local immunity and microbiota calibrating its tone.",

As a basis for understanding how odorants activate these heteromeric receptors, we report here cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of two different heteromeric odorant receptor complexes containing ORs from disease-vector mosquitos Aedes aegypti or Anopheles gambiae . These structures reveal an unexpected stoichiometry of one OR to three Orco subunits. Comparison of structures in odorant-bound and unbound states indicates that odorant binding to the sole OR subunit is sufficient to open the channel pore, suggesting a mechanism of OR activation and a conceptual framework for understanding evolution of insect odorant receptor sensitivity.",

We show that replication fork collapse at leading-strand nicks generates resected single-ended double-strand breaks (seDSBs) that are repaired by homologous recombination (HR). If these seDSBs are not promptly repaired, arrival of adjacent forks creates double-ended DSBs (deDSBs), which could drive genomic scarring in HR-deficient cancers. deDSBs can also be generated directly when the replication fork bypasses lagging-strand nicks. Unlike deDSBs produced independently of replication, end resection at nick-induced seDSBs and deDSBs is BRCA1-independent. Nevertheless, BRCA1 antagonizes 53BP1 suppression of RAD51 filament formation. These results highlight distinctive mechanisms that maintain replication fork stability.",

We designed mutant O-DNAPs that selectively increase the mutation rate of the orthogonal replicon by two to four orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the utility of our system for accelerated continuous evolution by evolving a 150-fold increase in resistance to tigecycline in 12 days.

Intriguingly, LUAD can histologically transform into SCLC after treatment with targeted therapies. In this study, we designed models to follow the conversion of LUAD to SCLC and found that the barrier to histological transformation converges on tolerance to Myc, which we implicate as a lineage-specific driver of the pulmonary neuroendocrine cell. Histological transformations are frequently accompanied by activation of the Akt pathway. Manipulating this pathway permitted tolerance to Myc as an oncogenic driver, producing rare, stem-like cells that transcriptionally resemble the pulmonary basal lineage. These findings suggest that histological transformation may require the plasticity inherent to the basal stem cell, enabling tolerance to previously incompatible oncogenic driver programs.",

Collections of small bioresorbable metal disks distributed within thin, pH-responsive hydrogels, deployed by surgical implantation or syringe injection, allow ultrasound-based measurements of spatiotemporal changes in pH for early assessments of anastomotic leaks after gastrointestinal surgeries, and their bioresorption after a recovery period eliminates the need for surgical extraction.

Despite bearing resemblance to the heliconical twist-bend nematic phase, this chiral ferroelectric nematic phase arises from electrical interactions that induce a noncollinear orientation of electric dipoles.",

Our findings indicate general concordance between utilized and total plant diversity, supporting the potential for simultaneously conserving species diversity and its contributions to people. Although Indigenous lands across Mesoamerica, the Horn of Africa, and Southern Asia harbor a disproportionate diversity of utilized plants, the incidence of protected areas is negatively correlated with utilized species richness.

    "abstract": "Starting around 6 to 9 months of age, children begin acquiring their first words, linking spoken words to their visual counterparts. How much of this knowledge is learnable from sensory input with relatively generic learning mechanisms, and how much requires stronger inductive biases? Using longitudinal head-mounted camera recordings from one child aged 6 to 25 months, we trained a relatively generic neural network on 61 hours of correlated visual-linguistic data streams, learning feature-based representations and cross-modal associations. Our model acquires many word-referent mappings present in the child\u2019s everyday experience, enables zero-shot generalization to new visual referents, and aligns its visual and linguistic conceptual systems. These results show how critical aspects of grounded word meaning are learnable through joint representation and associative learning from one child\u2019s input.",

    "abstract": "The steps governing healing with or without fibrosis within the same microenvironment are unclear. After acute kidney injury (AKI), injured proximal tubular epithelial cells activate SOX9 for self-restoration. Using a multimodal approach for a head-to-head comparison of injury-induced SOX9 lineages, we identified a dynamic SOX9 switch in repairing epithelia. Lineages that regenerated epithelia silenced SOX9 and healed without fibrosis (SOX9 on-off ). By contrast, lineages with unrestored apicobasal polarity maintained SOX9 activity in sustained efforts to regenerate, which were identified as a SOX9 on-on Cadherin6 pos cell state. These reprogrammed cells generated substantial single-cell WNT activity to provoke a fibroproliferative response in adjacent fibroblasts, driving AKI to chronic kidney disease. Transplanted human kidneys displayed similar SOX9/CDH6/WNT2B responses. Thus, we have uncovered a sensor of epithelial repair status, the activity of which determines regeneration with or without fibrosis.",

However, in all these examples the liquid transport for a specific liquid is completely restricted in a fixed direction. We demonstrate that Crassula muscosa shoot surfaces have the ability to transport a specific liquid unidirectionally in either direction. This is accomplished through the presence of asymmetric reentrant leaves with varying reentrant angles, which yields the variation in liquid meniscus heterogeneity. These findings enable engineered biomimetic structures capable of selective directional liquid transport, with functions such as intelligent flow direction switching, liquid distribution, and mixing.",

We use machine learning to systematically group forest ecoregions into 12 global forest pyromes, with each showing distinct sensitivities to climatic, human, and vegetation controls. This delineation revealed that rapidly increasing forest fire emissions in extratropical pyromes, linked to climate change, offset declining emissions in tropical pyromes during 2001 to 2023. Annual emissions tripled in one extratropical pyrome due to increases in fire-favorable weather, compounded by increased forest cover and productivity. This contributed to a 60% increase in forest fire carbon emissions from forest ecoregions globally. Our results highlight the increasing vulnerability of forests and their carbon stocks to fire disturbance under climate change.",

We present a Janus channel of membranes (JCM) that features a confined architecture constructed of a pair of hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes, which allows for concurrent, highly efficient recovery of oil and water from surfactant-stabilized emulsions. The confined Janus channel can amplify the interplay of the membrane pair through a feedback loop that involves enrichment and demulsification. Our JCM achieves exceptional oil and water recoveries of up to 97 and 75%, respectively, with near 99.9% purities. Moreover, its versatility in handling diverse emulsions may enable near-zero liquid discharge for a range of separations.",

The Chang\u2019e-6 (CE-6) spacecraft collected samples from the South Pole\u2013Aitken (SPA) basin on the farside and brought them to Earth. We used lead-lead and rubidium-strontium isotope systems to date low-titanium basalt in a CE-6 sample, finding a consistent age of 2830 (\u00b15) million years. We interpret this as the date of volcanism in SPA and incorporate it into lunar crater chronology. Strontium, neodymium, and lead isotopes indicate that the volcanic magma was from a lunar mantle source depleted in incompatible elements and containing almost no KREEP component.",

Using up to 49 superconducting qubits, we prepared low-energy states of the transverse-field Ising model through coupling to dissipative auxiliary qubits. In one dimension, we observed long-range quantum correlations and a ground-state fidelity of 0.86 for 18 qubits at the critical point. In two dimensions, we found mutual information that extends beyond nearest neighbors. Lastly, by coupling the system to auxiliaries emulating reservoirs with different chemical potentials, we explored transport in the quantum Heisenberg model. Our results establish engineered dissipation as a scalable alternative to unitary evolution for preparing entangled many-body states on noisy quantum processors.",

Initially, MRI development focused on low fields around 0.05 Tesla, but progress halted after the introduction of the 1.5 Tesla whole-body superconducting scanner in 1983. Using a permanent 0.05 Tesla magnet and deep learning for electromagnetic interference elimination, we developed a whole-body scanner that operates using a standard wall power outlet and without radiofrequency and magnetic shielding. We demonstrated its wide-ranging applicability for imaging various anatomical structures. Furthermore, we developed three-dimensional deep learning reconstruction to boost image quality by harnessing extensive high-field MRI data.

Distinct immune perturbations followed neuronal activation: Nitrergic neurons regulated T helper 17 (T H 17)\u2013like cells, and cholinergic neurons regulated neutrophils. Nociceptor neurons, expressing Trpv1, elicited the broadest immunomodulation, inducing changes in innate lymphocytes, macrophages, and ROR\u03b3 + regulatory T (T reg ) cells. Neuroanatomical, genetic, and pharmacological follow-up showed that Trpv1 + neurons in dorsal root ganglia decreased T reg cell numbers via the neuropeptide calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide (CGRP). Given the role of these neurons in nociception, these data potentially link pain signaling with gut T reg cell function.",

We established an interfacial synthesis confined and controlled by a polymer topcoat and achieved multiple Turing motifs in the wrinkled thin films. These films have complete MOF surface coverage and exhibit strain tolerance up to 53.2%. The enhanced mechanical properties allow film transfer onto various substrates. We obtained membranes with large H 2 /CO 2 selectivity (41.2) and high H 2 permeance (8.46 \u00d7 10 3 gas permeation units), showcasing negligible defects after transfer. We also achieved soft humidity sensors on delicate electrodes by avoiding exposure to harsh MOF synthesis conditions.

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy can lead to long-term survival for some cancer patients, yet generalized success has been hampered by insufficient antigen presentation and exclusion of immunogenic cells from the tumor microenvironment. Here, we developed an approach to reprogram tumor cells in vivo by adenoviral delivery of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3, which enabled them to present antigens as type 1 conventional dendritic cells. Reprogrammed tumor cells remodeled their tumor microenvironment, recruited, and expanded polyclonal cytotoxic T cells; induced tumor regressions; and established long-term systemic immunity in multiple mouse melanoma models. In human tumor spheroids and xenografts, reprogramming to immunogenic dendritic-like cells progressed independently of immunosuppression, which usually limits immunotherapy. Our study paves the way for human clinical trials of in vivo immune cell reprogramming for cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Identifying a suitable water-soluble sacrificial layer is crucial to fabricating large-scale freestanding oxide membranes, which offer attractive functionalities and integrations with advanced semiconductor technologies. Here, we introduce a water-soluble sacrificial layer, \u201csuper-tetragonal\u201d Sr 4 Al 2 O 7 (SAO T ). The low-symmetric crystal structure enables a superior capability to sustain epitaxial strain, allowing for broad tunability in lattice constants. The resultant structural coherency and defect-free interface in perovskite ABO 3 /SAO T heterostructures effectively restrain crack formation during the water release of freestanding oxide membranes. For a variety of nonferroelectric oxide membranes, the crack-free areas can span up to a millimeter in scale. This compelling feature, combined with the inherent high water solubility, makes SAO T a versatile and feasible sacrificial layer for producing high-quality freestanding oxide membranes, thereby boosting their potential for innovative device applications.",

Inspired by this concept, we report synthetic polymers that act as a single \u201cpluripotent\u201d feedstock and can be differentiated into a range of materials that exhibit different mechanical properties, from hard and brittle to soft and extensible. To achieve this, we have exploited dynamic covalent networks that contain labile, dynamic thia-Michael bonds, whose extent of bonding can be thermally modulated and retained through tempering, akin to the process used in metallurgy. In addition, we show that the shape memory behavior of these materials can be tailored through tempering and that these materials can be patterned to spatially control mechanical properties.",

However, current room-temperature plastic inorganic semiconductors are still very rare, and their performance is inferior to that of classic brittle semiconductors. Taking classic bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3 )\u2013based thermoelectric semiconductors as an example, we show that antisite defects can lead to high-density, diverse microstructures that substantially affect mechanical properties and thus successfully transform these bulk semiconductors from brittle to plastic, leading to a high figure of merit of up to 1.05 at 300 kelvin compared with other plastic semiconductors, similar to the best brittle semiconductors. We provide an effective strategy to plastify brittle semiconductors to display good plasticity and excellent functionality simultaneously.",

In synthesis, dioxygen should be able to undergo oxygen atom transfer to two organic molecules with perfect atom economy, but such reactivity is rare. Monooxygenase enzymes commonly reductively activate dioxygen by sacrificing one of the oxygen atoms to generate a more reactive oxidant. Here, we used a manganese-tetraphenylporphyrin catalyst to pair electrochemical oxygen reduction and water oxidation, generating a reactive manganese-oxo at both electrodes. This process supports dioxygen atom transfer to two thioether substrate molecules, generating two equivalents of sulfoxide with a single equivalent of dioxygen. This net dioxygenase reactivity consumes no electrons but uses electrochemical energy to overcome kinetic barriers.",

Mutations in SYNGAP1 in humans result in intellectual disability, autistic-like behaviors, and epilepsy. Heterozygous Syngap1 -knockout mice display deficits in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory and exhibit seizures. It is unclear whether SynGAP imparts structural properties at synapses independently of its GAP activity. Here, we report that inactivating mutations within the GAP domain do not inhibit synaptic plasticity or cause behavioral deficits. Instead, SynGAP modulates synaptic strength by physically competing with the AMPA-receptor-TARP excitatory receptor complex in the formation of molecular condensates with synaptic scaffolding proteins. These results have major implications for developing therapeutic treatments for SYNGAP1 -related neurodevelopmental disorders.",

We investigated the antibacterial activity of 200 drugs using genetic screens with thousands of barcoded Escherichia coli knockouts. We analyzed 2 million gene-drug interactions underlying drug-specific toxicity. Network-based analysis of drug-drug similarities revealed that antibiotics clustered into modules that are consistent with the mode of action of their established classes, whereas nonantibiotics remained unconnected. Half of the nonantibiotics clustered into separate modules, potentially revealing shared and unexploited targets for new antimicrobials. Analysis of efflux systems revealed that they widely affect antibiotics and nonantibiotics alike, suggesting that the impact of nonantibiotics on antibiotic cross-resistance should be investigated closely in vivo.",

We applied this platform to profile neighborhoods of the oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor and orthogonally validated more than 20 neighbors using immunoassays and AlphaFold-Multimer prediction. We further profiled the protein neighborhoods of cell-cell synapses induced by bispecific T cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. This integrated multiscale PLP platform maps local and distal protein networks on and between cell surfaces, which will aid in the systematic construction of the cell surface interactome, revealing horizontal signaling partners and reveal new immunotherapeutic opportunities.",

The nature of these mass gap objects is unknown, as is the formation of their host binary systems. We report pulsar timing observations made with the Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT) of PSR J0514\u22124002E, an eccentric binary millisecond pulsar in the globular cluster NGC 1851. We found a total binary mass of 3.887 \u00b1 0.004 solar masses ( M \u2299 ), and multiwavelength observations show that the pulsar\u2019s binary companion is also a compact object. The companion\u2019s mass (2.09 to 2.71 M \u2299 , 95% confidence interval) is in the mass gap, indicating either a very massive NS or a low-mass BH. We propose that the companion formed in a merger between two earlier NSs.",

In particular, the spin dynamics of the one-dimensional Heisenberg model were conjectured as to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class based on the scaling of the infinite-temperature spin-spin correlation function. In a chain of 46 superconducting qubits, we studied the probability distribution of the magnetization transferred across the chain\u2019s center, P M . The first two moments of P M show superdiffusive behavior, a hallmark of KPZ universality. However, the third and fourth moments ruled out the KPZ conjecture and allow for evaluating other theories. Our results highlight the importance of studying higher moments in determining dynamic universality classes and provide insights into universal behavior in quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "The major human bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes multidrug-resistant infections in people with underlying immunodeficiencies or structural lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). We show that a few environmental isolates, driven by horizontal gene acquisition, have become dominant epidemic clones that have sequentially emerged and spread through global transmission networks over the past 200 years. These clones demonstrate varying intrinsic propensities for infecting CF or non-CF individuals (linked to specific transcriptional changes enabling survival within macrophages); have undergone multiple rounds of convergent, host-specific adaptation; and have eventually lost their ability to transmit between different patient groups. Our findings thus explain the pathogenic evolution of P. aeruginosa and highlight the importance of global surveillance and cross-infection prevention in averting the emergence of future epidemic clones.",

We estimate that only one in three people used SMDWS in LMICs in 2020 and identified fecal contamination as the primary limiting factor affecting almost half of the population of LMICs. Our results are relevant for raising awareness about the challenges and limitations of current global monitoring approaches and demonstrating how globally available geospatial data can be leveraged to fill data gaps and identify priority areas in LMICs.",

In this study, we trained an artificial intelligence (AI) to mediate human deliberation.

Participants ( N = 5734) preferred AI-generated statements to those written by human mediators, rating them as more informative, clear, and unbiased. Discussants often updated their views after the deliberation, converging on a shared perspective. Text embeddings revealed that successful group statements incorporated dissenting voices while respecting the majority position.

Solute-chemistry datasets from mountain streams in different orogens isolate the impact of erosion on silicate weathering\u2014a carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sink\u2014and coupled sulfide and carbonate weathering\u2014a CO 2 source. Contrasting erosion sensitivities of these reactions produce a CO 2 -drawdown maximum at erosion rates of ~0.07 millimeters per year. Thus, landscapes with moderate uplift rates bolster Earth\u2019s inorganic CO 2 sink, whereas more rapid uplift decreases or even reverses CO 2 sequestration. This concept of an \u201cerosion optimum\u201d for CO 2 drawdown reconciles conflicting views on the impact of mountain building on the carbon cycle and permits estimates of geologic CO 2 fluxes dependent upon tectonic changes.",

Brassinosteroids (BRs) promote grain size, yet their role in regulating grain number is unclear. By deciphering the clustered-spikelet rice germplasm, we show that activation of the BR catabolic gene BRASSINOSTEROID-DEFICIENT DWARF3 ( BRD3 ) markedly increases grain number. We establish a molecular pathway in which the BR signaling inhibitor GSK3/SHAGGY-LIKE KINASE2 phosphorylates and stabilizes OsMADS1 transcriptional factor, which targets TERMINAL FLOWER1 -like gene RICE CENTRORADIALIS2 . The tissue-specific activation of BRD3 in the secondary branch meristems enhances panicle branching, minimizing negative effects on grain size, and improves grain yield. Our study showcases the power of tissue-specific hormonal manipulation in dismantling the trade-offs among various traits and thus unleashing crop yield potential in rice.",

The active hydrogen atoms in the reactants engage in hydrogen bonds with water, thereby accelerating photochemical reactions.

We show that CRM is highly preorganized for ribosomal binding by determining its density functional theory\u2013calculated, solution-state, solid-state, and (wild-type) ribosome-bound structures, which all align identically within the macrobicyclic subunits. Lastly, we report two additional x-ray crystal structures of CRM in complex with bacterial ribosomes separately modified by the ribosomal RNA methylases, chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance (Cfr) and erythromycin-resistance ribosomal RNA methylase (Erm), revealing concessive adjustments by the target and antibiotic that permit CRM to maintain binding where other antibiotics fail.",

We demonstrate that the ground state of a flat slab of a ferroelectric nematic unconstrained by externally imposed alignment directions is chiral, with left- and right-handed twists of polarization. Although the helicoidal deformations and defect walls that separate domains of opposite handedness increase the elastic energy, the twists reduce the electrostatic energy and become weaker when the material is doped with ions. This work shows that the polar orientational order of molecules could trigger chirality in soft matter with no chemically induced chiral centers.",

Although room-temperature ferromagnetic skyrmions and their current-induced manipulation have been demonstrated, their velocity has been limited to about 100 meters per second. In addition, their dynamics are perturbed by the skyrmion Hall effect, a motion transverse to the current direction caused by the skyrmion topological charge. Here, we show that skyrmions in compensated synthetic antiferromagnets can be moved by current along the current direction at velocities of up to 900 meters per second. This can be explained by the cancellation of the net topological charge leading to a vanishing skyrmion Hall effect. Our results open an important path toward the realization of logic and memory devices based on the fast manipulation of skyrmions in tracks.",

We developed a catalyst-membrane system that removes the hydrogen by-product and can thus achieve propane conversions that exceed equilibrium limits. In this codesigned system, a silica/alumina (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ) hollow-fiber hydrogen membrane was packed with a selective platinum-tin (Pt 1 Sn 1 /SiO 2 ) PDH catalyst on the tube side with hydrogen diffusing from the tube to the shell side. We demonstrate that the catalyst-membrane system can achieve propane conversions >140% of the nominal equilibrium conversion with a propylene selectivity >98% without deactivation of the system components. We also show that by introducing oxygen on the shell side of the catalyst-membrane system, we can couple the endothermic PDH reaction on the tube side with exothermic hydrogen oxidation on the shell side. This coupling results in higher rates of hydrogen transport, leading to further enhancements in the propane conversion as well as desired thermoneutral system operation.",

In this work, we introduce a protocol for programmed AC (pAC) electrosynthesis that systematically adjusts currents, frequencies, and duty ratios. The application of representative pAC waveforms facilitates copper-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage in cross-coupling and difunctionalization reactions that exhibit suboptimal performance under DC and chemical oxidation conditions.

    "abstract": "The selective conversion of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and mixtures of these two polymers to form products with high volume demand is urgently needed because current methods suffer from low selectivity, produce large quantities of greenhouse gases, or rely on expensive, single-use catalysts. The isomerizing ethenolysis of unsaturated polyolefins could be an energetically and environmentally viable route to propylene and isobutylene; however, noble-metal homogeneous catalysts and an unsaturated polyolefin are currently required and the process has been limited to PE. We show that the simple combination of tungsten oxide on silica and sodium on gamma-alumina transforms PE, PP, or a mixture of the two, including postconsumer forms of these materials, to propylene or a mixture of propylene and isobutylene in greater than 90% yield at 320\u00b0C without the need for dehydrogenation of the starting polyolefins.",

    "abstract": "Many devices, including touchscreens and robotic hands, involve frictional contacts. Optimizing these devices requires fine control of the interface\u2019s friction law. We lack systematic methods to create dry contact interfaces whose frictional behavior satisfies preset specifications. We propose a generic surface design strategy to prepare dry rough interfaces that have predefined relationships between normal and friction forces. Such metainterfaces circumvent the usual multiscale challenge of tribology by considering simplified surface topographies as assemblies of spherical asperities. Optimizing the individual asperities\u2019 heights enables specific friction laws to be targeted. Through various centimeter-scaled elastomer-glass metainterfaces, we illustrate three types of achievable friction laws, including linear laws with a specified friction coefficient and unusual nonlinear laws. This design strategy represents a scale- and material-independent, chemical-free pathway toward energy-saving and adaptable smart interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are functionally heterogeneous cells essential for apoptotic cell clearance. Apoptotic cells are defined by homogeneous characteristics, ignoring their original cell lineage identity. We found that in an interleukin-4 (IL-4)\u2013enriched environment, the sensing of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages triggered their tissue remodeling signature. Engulfment of apoptotic hepatocytes promoted a tolerogenic phenotype, whereas phagocytosis of T cells had little effect on IL-4\u2013induced gene expression. In a mouse model of parasite-induced pathology, the transfer of macrophages conditioned with IL-4 and apoptotic neutrophils promoted parasitic egg clearance. Knockout of phagocytic receptors required for the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils and partially T cells, but not hepatocytes, exacerbated helminth infection. These findings suggest that the identity of apoptotic cells may contribute to the development of distinct IL-4\u2013driven immune programs in macrophages.",

We identify key sequence patterns that contribute to human promoter activity, each activating transcription with distinct position-specific effects. Furthermore, we explain the sequence basis of bidirectional transcription at promoters, identify the links between promoter sequence and gene expression variation across cell types, and explore the conservation of sequence determinants of transcription initiation across mammalian species.",

However, attempts so far have mostly only been successful in silico and often fail in experiment because of unpredicted traps associated with kinetic slowing down (gelation, glass transition) and competing ordered structures. Theoretical predictions also face the difficulty of encoding the desired interparticle interaction potential with the experimentally available nano- and micrometer-sized particles. To overcome these issues, we combine SAT assembly (a patchy-particle interaction design algorithm based on constrained optimization) with coarse-grained simulations of DNA nanotechnology to experimentally realize trap-free self-assembly pathways. We use this approach to assemble a pyrochlore three-dimensional lattice, coveted for its promise in the construction of optical metamaterials, and characterize it with small-angle x-ray scattering and scanning electron microscopy visualization.",

However, it is challenging to tune the pore size of a single material continuously and to reversibly distinguish small molecules (below 4 angstroms). We synthesized a series of ionic covalent organic frameworks using a tetraphenoxyborate linkage that maintains meticulous synergy between structural rigidity and local flexibility to achieve continuous and reversible (100 thermal cycles) tunability of \u201cdynamic pores\u201d between 2.9 and 4.0 angstroms, with resolution below 0.2 angstroms. This results from temperature-regulated, gradual amplitude change of high-frequency linker oscillations. These thermoelastic apertures selectively block larger molecules over marginally smaller ones, demonstrating size-based molecular recognition and the potential for separating challenging gas mixtures such as oxygen/nitrogen and nitrogen/methane.",

It is not currently understood how a pathological event in cortex can affect peripheral sensory neurons. In this study, we show that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows into the trigeminal ganglion, establishing nonsynaptic signaling between brain and trigeminal cells. After CSD, ~11% of the CSF proteome is altered, with up-regulation of proteins that directly activate receptors in the trigeminal ganglion. CSF collected from animals exposed to CSD activates trigeminal neurons in na\u00efve mice in part by CSF-borne calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide (CGRP). We identify a communication pathway between the central and peripheral nervous system that might explain the relationship between migrainous aura and headache.",

It functions as a ~4-megadalton complex containing its cofactor dynactin and a cargo-specific coiled-coil adaptor. However, how dynein and dynactin recognize diverse adaptors, how they interact with each other during complex formation, and the role of critical regulators such as lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) protein (LIS1) remain unclear. In this study, we determined the cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of dynein-dynactin on microtubules with LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor JIP3. This structure reveals the molecular basis of interactions occurring during dynein activation. We show how JIP3 activates dynein despite its atypical architecture. Unexpectedly, LIS1 binds dynactin\u2019s p150 subunit, tethering it along the length of dynein. Our data suggest that LIS1 and p150 constrain dynein-dynactin to ensure efficient complex formation.",

This is largely a consequence of conventional polar-bond retrosynthetic disconnections that in turn require multiple functional group interconversions, redox manipulations, and protecting group chemistry. Here, we report a simple catalyst and reductant combination that converts two types of feedstock chemicals, carboxylic acids and olefins, into tetrasubstituted carbons through quaternization of radical intermediates. An iron porphyrin catalyst activates each substrate by electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer, and then combines the fragments using a bimolecular homolytic substitution (S H 2) reaction. This cross-coupling reduces the synthetic burden to procure numerous quaternary carbon\u2013\u00ad\u00adcontaining products from simple chemical feedstocks.",

To corroborate the method, we chose a material distinctly different from MAX phases, in terms of structure and chemical composition, for experimental verification.

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms that regulate breast cancer cell (BCC) metastasis and proliferation within the leptomeninges (LM) are poorly understood, which limits the development of effective therapies. In this work, we show that BCCs in mice can invade the LM by abluminal migration along blood vessels that connect vertebral or calvarial bone marrow and meninges, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. This process is dependent on BCC engagement with vascular basement membrane laminin through expression of the neuronal pathfinding molecule integrin \u03b16. Once in the LM, BCCs colocalize with perivascular meningeal macrophages and induce their expression of the prosurvival neurotrophin glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Intrathecal GDNF blockade, macrophage-specific GDNF ablation, or deletion of the GDNF receptor neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) from BCCs inhibits breast cancer growth within the LM. These data suggest integrin \u03b16 and the GDNF signaling axis as new therapeutic targets against breast cancer LM metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Scholars warn that partisan divisions in the mass public threaten the health of American democracy. We conducted a megastudy ( n = 32,059 participants) testing 25 treatments designed by academics and practitioners to reduce Americans\u2019 partisan animosity and antidemocratic attitudes. We find that many treatments reduced partisan animosity, most strongly by highlighting relatable sympathetic individuals with different political beliefs or by emphasizing common identities shared by rival partisans. We also identify several treatments that reduced support for undemocratic practices\u2014most strongly by correcting misperceptions of rival partisans\u2019 views or highlighting the threat of democratic collapse\u2014which shows that antidemocratic attitudes are not intractable. Taken together, the study\u2019s findings identify promising general strategies for reducing partisan division and improving democratic attitudes, shedding theoretical light on challenges facing American democracy.",

Here we show that interaction between Phaseolus vulgaris PGIP2 (PvPGIP2) and Fusarium phyllophilum polygalacturonase (FpPG) enhances substrate binding, resulting in inhibition of the enzyme activity of FpPG. This interaction promotes FpPG-catalyzed production of long-chain immunoactive oligogalacturonides, while diminishing immunosuppressive short oligogalacturonides. PvPGIP2 binding creates a substrate binding site on PvPGIP2-FpPG, forming a new polygalacturonase with boosted substrate binding activity and altered substrate preference. Structure-based engineering converts a putative PGIP that initially lacks FpPG-binding activity into an effective FpPG-interacting protein. These findings unveil a mechanism for plants to transform pathogen virulence activity into a defense trigger and provide proof of principle for engineering PGIPs with broader specificity.",

Materials design has focused on structures that can define transport pathways with minimal cation coordination change, restricting attention to a small part of chemical space. Motivated by the greater structural diversity of binary intermetallics than that of the metallic elements, we used two anions to build a pathway for three-dimensional superionic lithium ion conductivity that exploits multiple cation coordination environments. Li 7 Si 2 S 7 I is a pure lithium ion conductor created by an ordering of sulphide and iodide that combines elements of hexagonal and cubic close-packing analogously to the structure of NiZr. The resulting diverse network of lithium positions with distinct geometries and anion coordination chemistries affords low barriers to transport, opening a large structural space for high cation conductivity.",

Single-molecule techniques have revealed bond strength by measuring \u201crupture force,\u201d but it has long been recognized that rupture force is dependent on loading rate\u2014how quickly force is ramped up. Thus, the physiological loading rate needs to be measured to reveal the mechanical strength of individual bonds in their functional context. We have developed an overstretching tension sensor (OTS) to allow more accurate force measurement in physiological conditions with single-molecule detection sensitivity even in mechanically active regions. We used serially connected OTSs to show that the integrin loading rate ranged from 0.5 to 4 piconewtons per second and was about three times higher in leukocytes than in epithelial cells.",

We developed a nanopore-based method, which we call Telomere Profiling, to determine telomere length at nearly single-nucleotide resolution. Mapping telomere reads to chromosome ends showed chromosome end\u2013specific length distributions that could differ by more than six kilobases. Examination of telomere lengths in 147 individuals revealed that certain chromosome ends were consistently longer or shorter. The same rank order was found in newborn cord blood, suggesting that telomere length is determined at birth and that chromosome end\u2013specific telomere length differences are maintained as telomeres shorten with age. Telomere Profiling makes precision investigation of telomere length widely accessible for laboratory, clinical, and drug discovery efforts and will allow deeper insights into telomere biology.",

We evaluate and reject several hypotheses to explain this relationship and propose that an effect of evolvability on population and species divergence can be explained by the influence of genetic constraints on the ability of populations to track rapid, stationary environmental fluctuations.",

We found that hydroxide (OH \u2212 ) donated ~8% more negative charge to the H bond network of water, and hydronium (H 3 O + ) accepted ~4% less negative charge from the H bond network of water.

The in situ formation of [MTTZ] + cation increased the formation energy of iodine vacancies and enhanced the migration energy barrier of iodide and cesium ions, which suppressed nonradiative recombination, thermal decomposition, and phase segregation processes. The optimized PSMs achieved a record (certified) PCE of 23.2% with an aperture area of 27.2 cm 2 , with a stabilized PCE of 23.0%. The encapsulated PSM retained 87.0% of its initial PCE after ~1900 hours of maximum power point tracking at 85\u00b0C and 85% relative humidity under 1.0-sun illumination.",

By possessing internal degrees of freedom such as polarization, light and sound can be subjected to various manipulations, including constituent materials, structured environments, and tailored source conditions. These manipulations enable the creation of a great variety of Hamiltonians, through which rich non-Abelian phenomena can be explored and observed. Recent developments have constituted a versatile testbed for exploring non-Abelian physics at the intersection of atomic, molecular, and optical physics; condensed matter physics; and mathematical physics. These fundamental endeavors could enable photonic and acoustic devices with multiplexing functionalities. Our review aims to provide a timely and comprehensive account of this emerging topic. Starting from the foundation of matrix-valued geometric phases, we address non-Abelian topological charges, non-Abelian gauge fields, non-Abelian braiding, non-Hermitian non-Abelian phenomena, and their realizations with photonics and acoustics and conclude with future prospects.",

We found that pyrimidines, but not purines, maintain pyruvate oxidation and the tricarboxylic citric acid (TCA) cycle by regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. PDH activity requires sufficient substrates and cofactors, including thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Depletion of cellular pyrimidines decreased TPP synthesis, a reaction carried out by TPP kinase 1 (TPK1), which reportedly uses ATP to phosphorylate thiamine (vitamin B1). We found that uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate (UTP) acts as the preferred substrate for TPK1, enabling cellular TPP synthesis, PDH activity, TCA-cycle activity, lipogenesis, and adipocyte differentiation. Thus, UTP is required for vitamin B1 utilization to maintain pyruvate oxidation and lipogenesis.",

In this study, we identified a bacterium from the gut of field Aedes albopictus mosquitoes named Rosenbergiella sp. YN46 ( Rosenbergiella_ YN46) that rendered mosquitoes refractory to infection with dengue and Zika viruses. Inoculation of 1.6 \u00d7 10 3 colony forming units (CFUs) of Rosenbergiella_ YN46 into A. albopictus mosquitoes effectively prevents viral infection. Mechanistically, this bacterium secretes glucose dehydrogenase ( Ry GDH), which acidifies the gut lumen of fed mosquitoes, causing irreversible conformational changes in the flavivirus envelope protein that prevent viral entry into cells. In semifield conditions, Rosenbergiella_ YN46 exhibits effective transstadial transmission in field mosquitoes, which blocks transmission of dengue virus by newly emerged adult mosquitoes. The prevalence of Rosenbergiella_ YN46 is greater in mosquitoes from low-dengue areas (52.9 to ~91.7%) than in those from dengue-endemic regions (0 to ~6.7%). Rosenbergiella_ YN46 may offer an effective and safe lead for flavivirus biocontrol.",

Our brain multiregion, multiomic study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) included the central nucleus of the amygdala, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Genes and exons within the mPFC carried most disease signals replicated across two independent cohorts. Pathways pointed to immune function, neuronal and synaptic regulation, and stress hormones. Multiomic factor and gene network analyses provided the underlying genomic structure. Single nucleus RNA sequencing in dorsolateral PFC revealed dysregulated (stress-related) signals in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Analyses of brain-blood intersections in >50,000 UK Biobank participants were conducted along with fine-mapping of the results of PTSD and MDD genome-wide association studies to distinguish risk from disease processes. Our data suggest shared and distinct molecular pathology in both disorders and propose potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "The 2024 moment magnitude 7.5 Noto Peninsula (Japan) earthquake caused devastation to communities and was generated by a complex rupture process. Using space geodetic and seismic observations, we have shown that the event deformed the peninsula with a peak uplift reaching 5 meters at the west coast. Shallow slip exceeded 10 meters on an offshore fault. Peak stress drop was greater than 10 megapascals. This devastating event began with a slow rupture propagation lasting 15 to 20 seconds near its hypocenter, where seismic swarms had surged since 2020 because of lower-crust fluid supply. The slow start was accompanied by intense high-frequency seismic radiation. These observations suggest a distinct coseismic slip mode reflecting high heterogeneity in fault properties within a fluid-rich fault zone.",

The direct carbonylative coupling of alkenes and amines holds promise as a perfectly atom-economical approach to amide synthesis, but general methods remain underdeveloped. Herein, we report an alkene hydroaminocarbonylation catalyzed by unmodified, inexpensive cobalt carbonyl under mild conditions and low pressure promoted by light. Silane addition after the reaction enables sequential cobalt-catalyzed amide reduction, constituting a formal alkene hydroaminomethylation. These methods exhibit exceptional scope across both alkene and amine components with high chemo- and regioselectivity and proceed efficiently even in the absence of solvent. The formation of a hydridocobalt through photodissociation of a carbonyl ligand is proposed to enable catalytic activity under mild conditions, which addresses a long-standing challenge in catalysis.",

Using Escherichia coli lineages spanning 50,000 generations of evolution, we quantify the fitness effects of insertion mutations in every gene. Macroscopically, the fraction of deleterious mutations changed little over time whereas the beneficial tail declined sharply, approaching an exponential distribution. Microscopically, changes in individual gene essentiality and deleterious effects often occurred in parallel; altered essentiality is only partly explained by structural variation. The identity and effect sizes of beneficial mutations changed rapidly over time, but many targets of selection remained predictable because of the importance of loss-of-function mutations. Taken together, these results reveal the dynamic\u2014but statistically predictable\u2014nature of mutational fitness effects.",

We report structures of Drosophila sweet taste receptors GR43a and GR64a in the apo and sugar-bound states. Both GRs form tetrameric sugar-gated cation channels composed of one central pore domain (PD) and four peripheral ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Whereas GR43a is specifically activated by the monosaccharide fructose that binds to a narrow pocket in LBDs, disaccharides sucrose and maltose selectively activate GR64a by binding to a larger and flatter pocket in LBDs. Sugar binding to LBDs induces local conformational changes, which are subsequently transferred to the PD to cause channel opening. Our studies reveal a structural basis for sugar recognition and activation of GRs.",

Although there has been much success with overlapped near-infrared femtosecond and extreme ultraviolet attosecond pulses combined with theory, true attosecond-pump/attosecond-probe experiments have been limited. We used a synchronized attosecond x-ray pulse pair from an x-ray free-electron laser to study the electronic response to valence ionization in liquid water through all x-ray attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AX-ATAS). Our analysis showed that the AX-ATAS response is confined to the subfemtosecond timescale, eliminating any hydrogen atom motion and demonstrating experimentally that the 1b 1 splitting in the x-ray emission spectrum is related to dynamics and is not evidence of two structural motifs in ambient liquid water.",

However, despite decades of research, 80% of the human proteome lacks functional ligands. Chemical proteomics has advanced fragment-based ligand discovery toward cellular systems, but throughput limitations have stymied the scalable identification of fragment-protein interactions. We report proteome-wide maps of protein-binding propensity for 407 structurally diverse small-molecule fragments. We verified that identified interactions can be advanced to active chemical probes of E3 ubiquitin ligases, transporters, and kinases. Integrating machine learning binary classifiers further enabled interpretable predictions of fragment behavior in cells. The resulting resource of fragment-protein interactions and predictive models will help to elucidate principles of molecular recognition and expedite ligand discovery efforts for hitherto undrugged proteins.",

Conventional electronic skins generate frames of tactile signals upon interaction with objects. Unfortunately, they are generally ill-suited for efficient coding of temporal information and rapid feature extraction. In this work, we report a neuromorphic tactile system that uses spike timing, especially the first-spike timing, to code dynamic tactile information about touch and grasp. This strategy enables the system to seamlessly code highly dynamic information with millisecond temporal resolution on par with the biological nervous system, yielding dynamic extraction of tactile features. Upon interaction with objects, the system rapidly classifies them in the initial phase of touch and grasp, thus paving the way to fast tactile feedback desired for neuro-robotics and neuro-prosthetics.",

Here, we report on the synthesis of a stable nitrene by photolysis of the arylazide M S FluindN 3 ( 1 ), which gave rise to the quantitative formation of the arylnitrene M S FluindN ( 2 ) (M S Fluind is dispiro[fluorene-9,3\u2032-(1\u2032,1\u2032,7\u2032,7\u2032-tetramethyl-s-hydrindacen-4\u2032-yl)-5\u2032,9\u2032\u2032-fluorene]) that remains unchanged for at least 3 days when stored under argon atmosphere at room temperature. The extraordinary life span permitted the full characterization of 2 by single-crystal x-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, which supported a triplet ground state. Theoretical simulations suggest that in addition to the kinetic stabilization conferred by the bulky M S Fluind aryl substituent, electron delocalization across the central aromatic ring contributes to the electron stabilization of 2 .",

    "abstract": "Qubits that can be efficiently controlled are essential for the development of scalable quantum hardware. Although resonant control is used to execute high-fidelity quantum gates, the scalability is challenged by the integration of high-frequency oscillating signals, qubit cross-talk, and heating. Here, we show that by engineering the hopping of spins between quantum dots with a site-dependent spin quantization axis, quantum control can be established with discrete signals. We demonstrate hopping-based quantum logic and obtain single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.97%, coherent shuttling fidelities of 99.992% per hop, and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.3%, corresponding to error rates that have been predicted to allow for quantum error correction. We also show that hopping spins constitute a tuning method by statistically mapping the coherence of a 10\u2013quantum dot system. Our results show that dense quantum dot arrays with sparse occupation could be developed for efficient and high-connectivity qubit registers.",

    "abstract": "Materials often fail prematurely or catastrophically under load while containing voids, posing a challenge to materials manufacturing. We found that a metal (gold) containing spherical voids with a fraction of up to 10% does not fracture prematurely in tension when the voids are shrunk to the submicron or nanometer scale. Instead, the dispersed nanovoids increase the strength and ductility of the material while simultaneously reducing its weight. Apart from the suppressed stress or strain concentration, such structure provides enormous surface area and promotes surface-dislocation interactions, which enable strengthening and additional strain hardening and thus toughening. Transforming voids from crack-like detrimental defects into a beneficial \u201cingredient\u201d provides an inexpensive and environmentally friendly approach for the development of a new class of lightweight, high-performance materials.",

    "abstract": "Ketamine has been found to have rapid and potent antidepressant activity. However, despite the ubiquitous brain expression of its molecular target, the N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor (NMDAR), it was not clear whether there is a selective, primary site for ketamine\u2019s antidepressant action. We found that ketamine injection in depressive-like mice specifically blocks NMDARs in lateral habenular (LHb) neurons, but not in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. This regional specificity depended on the use-dependent nature of ketamine as a channel blocker, local neural activity, and the extrasynaptic reservoir pool size of NMDARs. Activating hippocampal or inactivating LHb neurons swapped their ketamine sensitivity. Conditional knockout of NMDARs in the LHb occluded ketamine\u2019s antidepressant effects and blocked the systemic ketamine\u2013induced elevation of serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. This distinction of the primary versus secondary brain target(s) of ketamine should help with the design of more precise and efficient antidepressant treatments.",

For many years, the identity of the mobile signal and its direct transduction mechanism for systemic SA synthesis in initiating SAR have been debated. We found that in Arabidopsis thaliana , after a local infection, the conserved cysteine residue of the transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE) undergoes sulfenylation in systemic tissues, which enhances its binding to the promoter of the SA-synthesis gene ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 ( ICS1 ) and increases SA production. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) produced through NADPH oxidases is the mobile signal that sulfenylates CHE in a concentration-dependent manner. Accumulation of SA and the previously reported signal molecules, such as N -hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP), then form a signal amplification loop to establish SAR.",

The stability of the medial packing of polymer chain ends (plumber\u2019s nightmare structure) over skeletal aggregation (gyroid) is attributed to the interplay between the strength of the end-end interactions and the initial shape of the curvature.

About 65% of all species and 82% of endemic species are classified as threatened. We rediscovered five species classified as Extinct on the IUCN Red List and identified 13 endemics as possibly extinct. Uncertainties in species information had little influence on the assessments, but using fewer Red List criteria severely underestimated threat levels. We suggest that the conservation status of tropical forests worldwide is worse than previously reported.",

By using a mutant with defects in photoperiodic growth, we identified a seasonal growth regulation pathway that functions in long days in parallel to the canonical long-day photoperiod flowering mechanism. This is achieved by using distinct mechanisms to detect different photoperiods: The flowering pathway measures photoperiod as the duration of light intensity, whereas the growth pathway measures photoperiod as the duration of photosynthetic activity (photosynthetic period). Plants can then independently control expression of genes required for flowering or growth. This demonstrates that seasonal flowering and growth are dissociable, allowing them to be coordinated independently across seasons.",

We show that massive magma flow into dikes can be established with only modest overpressure in a magma body if a large enough pathway opens at its boundary and gradual buildup of high tensile stress has occurred along the dike pathway prior to the onset of diking. This explains rapid initial magma flow rates, modeled up to about 7400 cubic meters per second into a dike ~15-kilometers long, which propagated under the town of Grindav\u00edk, Southwest Iceland, in November 2023. Such high flow rates provide insight into the formation of major dikes and imply a serious hazard potential for high\u2013flow rate intrusions that propagate to the surface and transition into eruptions.",

In this work, we show that glycogenesis uses its intermediate metabolite uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG) to antagonize lipogenesis, thus steering both mouse and human hepatocytes toward storing glucose carbon as glycogen. The underlying mechanism involves transport of UDPG to the Golgi apparatus, where it binds to site-1 protease (S1P) and inhibits S1P-mediated cleavage of sterol regulatory element\u2013binding proteins (SREBPs), thereby inhibiting lipogenesis in hepatocytes. Consistent with this mechanism, UDPG administration is effective at treating NAFLD in a mouse model and human organoids. These findings indicate a potential opportunity to ameliorate disordered fat metabolism in the liver.",

We first illustrate it for directly measurable forces, such as an active Brownian particle in an optical trap. We then apply the VSR to flickering experiments in human red blood cells. We find that \u03c3 is spatially heterogeneous with a finite correlation length, and its average value agrees with calorimetry measurements. The VSR paves the way to derive \u03c3 using force spectroscopy and time-resolved imaging in living and active matter.",

We identified 4666 ERK-dependent phosphosites on 2123 proteins, of which 79 and 66%, respectively, were not previously associated with ERK, substantially expanding the depth and breadth of ERK-dependent phosphorylation events and revealing a considerably more complex function for ERK in cancer. We established that ERK controls a highly dynamic and complex phosphoproteome that converges on cyclin-dependent kinase regulation and RAS homolog guanosine triphosphatase function (RHO GTPase). Our findings establish the most comprehensive molecular portrait and mechanisms by which ERK drives KRAS-dependent pancreatic cancer growth.",

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a singular opportunity to evaluate how influenza circulation worldwide was perturbed by human behavioral changes. We combine molecular, epidemiological, and international travel data and find that the pandemic\u2019s onset led to a shift in the intensity and structure of international influenza lineage movement. During the pandemic, South Asia played an important role as a phylogenetic trunk location of influenza A viruses, whereas West Asia maintained the circulation of influenza B/Victoria. We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage. After a period of 3 years, the intensity of among-region influenza lineage movements returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the exception of B/Yamagata, after the recovery of global air traffic, highlighting the robustness of global lineage dispersal patterns to substantial perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Subangstrom resolution has long been limited to aberration-corrected electron microscopy, where it is a powerful tool for understanding the atomic structure and properties of matter. Here, we demonstrate electron ptychography in an uncorrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) with deep subangstrom spatial resolution down to 0.44 angstroms, exceeding the conventional resolution of aberration-corrected tools and rivaling their highest ptychographic resolutions\u200b. Our approach, which we demonstrate on twisted two-dimensional materials in a widely available commercial microscope, far surpasses prior ptychographic resolutions (1 to 5 angstroms) of uncorrected STEMs. We further show how geometric aberrations can create optimized, structured beams for dose-efficient electron ptychography. Our results demonstrate that expensive aberration correctors are no longer required for deep subangstrom resolution.",

Despite its importance in future projections, understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which climate mediates extinction remains limited. We present an integrated approach examining the role of intrinsic traits versus extrinsic climate change in mediating extinction risk for marine invertebrates over the past 485 million years. We found that a combination of physiological traits and the magnitude of climate change is necessary to explain marine invertebrate extinction patterns. Our results suggest that taxa previously identified as extinction resistant may still succumb to extinction if the magnitude of climate change is great enough.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) shape phenotypic variation is an important question in genetics. To address this, we established a permanent population of 18,421 (18K) rice lines with reduced population structure. We generated reference-level genome assemblies of the founders and genotyped all 18K-rice lines through whole-genome sequencing. Through high-resolution mapping, 96 high-quality candidate genes contributing to variation in 16 traits were identified, including OsMADS22 and OsFTL1 verified as causal genes for panicle number and heading date, respectively. We identified epistatic QTL pairs and constructed a genetic interaction network with 19 genes serving as hubs. Overall, 170 masking epistasis pairs were characterized, serving as an important factor contributing to genetic background effects across diverse varieties. The work provides a basis to guide grain yield and quality improvements in rice.",

Mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) generates the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, disrupting enzymes involved in epigenetics and other processes. A hallmark of IDH1 -mutant solid tumors is T cell exclusion, whereas mIDH1 inhibition in preclinical models restores antitumor immunity. Here, we define a cell-autonomous mechanism of mIDH1-driven immune evasion. IDH1 -mutant solid tumors show selective hypermethylation and silencing of the cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensor CGAS , compromising innate immune signaling. mIDH1 inhibition restores DNA demethylation, derepressing CGAS and transposable element (TE) subclasses. dsDNA produced by TE-reverse transcriptase (TE-RT) activates cGAS, triggering viral mimicry and stimulating antitumor immunity. In summary, we demonstrate that mIDH1 epigenetically suppresses innate immunity and link endogenous RT activity to the mechanism of action of a US Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved oncology drug.",

We printed native oxide films over large areas at ambient conditions by moving a molten metal meniscus across a target substrate. The oxide gently separates from the metal through fluid instabilities that occur in the meniscus, leading to uniform films free of liquid residue. The printed oxide has a metallic interlayer that renders the films highly conductive. The metallic character of the printed films promotes wetting of trace amounts of evaporated gold that would otherwise form disconnected islands on conventional oxide surfaces. The resulting ultrathin (<10 nanometers) conductors can be patterned into flexible circuits that are transparent, mechanically robust, and electrically stable, even at elevated temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome-containing micronuclei are a hallmark of aggressive cancers. Micronuclei frequently undergo irreversible collapse, exposing their enclosed chromatin to the cytosol. Micronuclear rupture catalyzes chromosomal rearrangements, epigenetic abnormalities, and inflammation, yet mechanisms safeguarding micronuclear integrity are poorly understood. In this study, we found that mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) disrupt micronuclei by promoting a noncanonical function of charged multivesicular body protein 7 (CHMP7), a scaffolding protein for the membrane repair complex known as endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III). ROS retained CHMP7 in micronuclei while disrupting its interaction with other ESCRT-III components. ROS-induced cysteine oxidation stimulated CHMP7 oligomerization and binding to the nuclear membrane protein LEMD2, disrupting micronuclear envelopes. Furthermore, this ROS-CHMP7 pathological axis engendered chromosome shattering known to result from micronuclear rupture. It also mediated micronuclear disintegrity under hypoxic conditions, linking tumor hypoxia with downstream processes driving cancer progression.",

However, isolated vertebrate \u03b3TuRC adopts an open conformation that deviates from the microtubule structure, raising the question of the nucleation mechanism. In this study, we determined cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of human \u03b3TuRC bound to a nascent microtubule. Structural changes of the complex into a closed conformation ensure that \u03b3TuRC templates the 13-protofilament microtubules that exist in human cells. Closure is mediated by a latch that interacts with incorporating tubulin, making it part of the closing mechanism. Further rearrangements involve all \u03b3TuRC subunits and the removal of the actin-containing luminal bridge. Our proposed mechanism of microtubule nucleation by human \u03b3TuRC relies on large-scale structural changes that are likely the target of regulation in cells.",

Diversification of polyketide structures can be achieved by engineering these enzymes. However, notwithstanding successes made with textbook cis -acyltransferase ( cis -AT) PKSs, tailoring such large assembly lines remains challenging. Unlike textbook PKSs, trans -AT PKSs feature an extraordinary diversity of PKS modules and commonly evolve to form hybrid PKSs. In this study, we analyzed amino acid coevolution to identify a common module site that yields functional PKSs. We used this site to insert and delete diverse PKS parts and create 22 engineered trans -AT PKSs from various pathways and in two bacterial producers. The high success rates of our engineering approach highlight the broader applicability to generate complex designer polyketides.",

Complexes assembled through a Polo-like kinase 1\u2013dependent mechanism during extended mitosis and elicited a p53 response in G 1 that prevented the proliferation of the progeny of cells that experienced an approximately threefold extended mitosis or successive less extended mitoses. The ability to monitor mitotic extension was lost in p53-mutant cancers and some p53\u2013wild-type (p53-WT) cancers, consistent with classification of TP53BP1 and USP28 as tumor suppressors.

Here, we describe an ion-shielding heterogeneous photoelectrocatalysis strategy to impose mass-transfer limitations that invert the thermodynamically determined order of electron transfer. This strategy is showcased to enable decarboxylative trifluoromethylation of sensitive (hetero)arenes by using trifluoroacetate, an inexpensive yet relatively inert trifluoromethyl group (CF 3 ) source. An ion-shielding layer, formed by trifluoroacetate anions electrostatically adsorbed on a positive molybdenum-doped tungsten trioxide (WO 3 ) photoanode, prevents undesired electron transfer between substrates and photogenerated holes. The practicality of the developed method was demonstrated with robust photoanode stability (approximately 380 hours), a good substrate scope, and scaling capability to achieve 100-gram synthesis by using photoelectrochemical flow cells.",

In the presynaptic neuron, the proton pumping vesicular- or vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase) powers neurotransmitter loading into synaptic vesicles (SVs), with the V 1 complex dissociating from the membrane region of the enzyme before exocytosis. We isolated SVs from rat brain using SidK, a V-ATPase\u2013binding bacterial effector protein. Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy allowed high-resolution structure determination of V-ATPase within the native SV membrane. In the structure, regularly spaced cholesterol molecules decorate the enzyme\u2019s rotor and the abundant SV protein synaptophysin binds the complex stoichiometrically. ATP hydrolysis during vesicle loading results in a loss of the V 1 region of V-ATPase from the SV membrane, suggesting that loading is sufficient to induce dissociation of the enzyme.",

Therapeutic induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate disease complications and has been intently pursued. However, safe and effective small-molecule inducers of HbF remain elusive. We report the discovery of dWIZ-1 and dWIZ-2, molecular glue degraders of the WIZ transcription factor that robustly induce HbF in erythroblasts. Phenotypic screening of a cereblon (CRBN)\u2013biased chemical library revealed WIZ as a previously unknown repressor of HbF. WIZ degradation is mediated by recruitment of WIZ(ZF7) to CRBN by dWIZ-1, as resolved by crystallography of the ternary complex. Pharmacological degradation of WIZ was well tolerated and induced HbF in humanized mice and cynomolgus monkeys. These findings establish WIZ degradation as a globally accessible therapeutic strategy for SCD.",

Alfv\u00e9n waves are perturbations of the interplanetary magnetic field that transport energy. We use in situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecraft to investigate a stream of solar wind as it traverses the inner heliosphere. The observations show heating and acceleration of the plasma between the outer edge of the corona and near the orbit of Venus, along with the presence of large-amplitude Alfv\u00e9n waves. We calculate that the damping and mechanical work performed by the Alfv\u00e9n waves are sufficient to power the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind in the inner heliosphere.",

We combined chemical analysis with a high-throughput in vitro assay for neurotoxicity to capture complex mixtures of organic chemicals in blood. Plasma samples of 624 pregnant women from the German LiNA cohort were extracted with a nonselective extraction method for organic chemicals. 294 of >1000 target analytes were detected and quantified. Many of the detected chemicals as well as the whole extracts interfered with neurite development. Experimental testing of simulated complex mixtures of detected chemicals in the neurotoxicity assay confirmed additive mixture effects at concentrations less than individual chemicals\u2019 effect thresholds. The use of high-throughput target screening combined with bioassays has the potential to improve human biomonitoring and provide a new approach to including mixture effects in epidemiological studies.",

    "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic molecules containing adjacent aromatic rings. Infrared emission bands show that PAHs are abundant in space, but only a few specific PAHs have been detected in the interstellar medium. We detected 1-cyanopyrene, a cyano-substituted derivative of the related four-ring PAH pyrene, in radio observations of the dense cloud TMC-1, using the Green Bank Telescope. The measured column density of 1-cyanopyrene is \u223c 1 .52\u00d710 12 cm \u22122 , from which we estimate that pyrene contains up to 0.1% of the carbon in TMC-1. This abundance indicates that interstellar PAH chemistry favors the production of pyrene. We suggest that some of the carbon supplied to young planetary systems is carried by PAHs that originate in cold molecular clouds.",

In this work, we investigated the roles of PIEZO mechanosensitive channels in the intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche. We used mouse genetics and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to assess the requirement for PIEZO channels in ISC maintenance. In vivo measurement of basement membrane stiffness showed that ISCs reside in a more rigid microenvironment at the bottom of the crypt. Three-dimensional and two-dimensional organoid systems combined with bioengineered substrates and a stretching device revealed that PIEZO channels sense extracellular mechanical stimuli to modulate ISC function. This study delineates the mechanistic cascade of PIEZO activation that coordinates ISC fate decision and maintenance.",

In this work, we show that prosaposin (pSAP) drives CD8 T cell\u2013mediated tumor immunity and that its hyperglycosylation in tumor dendritic cells (DCs) leads to cancer immune escape. We found that lysosomal pSAP and its single-saposin cognates mediated disintegration of tumor cell\u2013derived apoptotic bodies to facilitate presentation of membrane-associated antigen and T cell activation. In the tumor microenvironment, transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) induced hyperglycosylation of pSAP and its subsequent secretion, which ultimately caused depletion of lysosomal saposins. pSAP hyperglycosylation was also observed in tumor-associated DCs from melanoma patients, and reconstitution with pSAP rescued activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Targeting DCs with recombinant pSAP triggered tumor protection and enhanced immune checkpoint therapy. Our studies demonstrate a critical function of pSAP in tumor immunity and may support its role in immunotherapy.",

However, if the appropriate individual building blocks are selected (e.g., cubes), or multiple shapes of the appropriate dimensions are matched (e.g., octahedra and tetrahedra) and their pairing interactions are subsequently forced, space-filled architectures may be possible. With flexible molecular ligands (polyethylene glycol\u2013modified DNA), the shape of a polyhedral nanoparticle can be deliberately altered and used to realize geometries that favor space tessellation. In this work, 10 new colloidal crystals were synthesized from DNA-modified nanocrystal building blocks that differed in shapes and sizes, designed to form space-filling architectures with micron-scale dimensions. The insights and capabilities provided by this new strategy substantially expand the scope of colloidal crystals possible and provide an expanded tool kit for researchers interested in designing metamaterials.",

Deepwater sharks and rays are among the most sensitive marine vertebrates to overexploitation.

Steep population declines cannot be easily reversed owing to long generation lengths, low recovery potentials, and the near absence of management. Depth and spatial limits to fishing activity could improve conservation when implemented alongside catch regulations, bycatch mitigation, and international trade regulation. Deepwater sharks and rays require immediate trade and fishing regulations to prevent irreversible defaunation and promote recovery of this threatened megafauna group.",

Using about 14,000 field observations per year from 2013 to 2019 in Kern County, California, we postulate that organic crop producers benefit from surrounding organic fields decreasing overall pesticide use and, specifically, pesticides targeting insect pests. Conventional fields, by contrast, tend to increase pesticide use as the area of surrounding organic production increases. Our simulation suggests that spatially clustering organic cropland can entirely mitigate spillover effects that lead to an increase in net pesticide use.",

We developed a computational procedure to design a protein that recognizes a common pharmacophore in a series of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase\u20131 inhibitors. One of three designed proteins bound different inhibitors with affinities ranging from <5 nM to low micromolar. X-ray crystal structures confirmed the accuracy of the designed protein-drug interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations informed the role of water in binding. Binding free energy calculations performed directly on the designed models were in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured affinities. We conclude that de novo design of high-affinity small molecule\u2013binding proteins with tuned interaction energies is feasible entirely from computation.",

Most previous works are based on either memristor-based CIMs, which suffer from accuracy loss and do not support training as a result of limited endurance, or digital static random-access memory (SRAM)\u2013based CIMs, which suffer from large area requirements and volatile storage. We report an AI edge processor that uses a memristor-SRAM CIM-fusion scheme to simultaneously exploit the high accuracy of the digital SRAM CIM and the high energy-efficiency and storage density of the resistive random-access memory memristor CIM. This also enables adaptive local training to accommodate personalized characterization and user environment. The fusion processor achieved high CIM capacity, short wakeup-to-response latency (392 microseconds), high peak energy efficiency (77.64 teraoperations per second per watt), and robust accuracy (<0.5% accuracy loss). This work demonstrates that memristor technology has moved beyond in-lab development stages and now has manufacturability for AI edge processors.",

We deposited the droplets on a substrate, which allowed nanoparticle characterization. We determined through simulations that quartz undergoes proton-induced slip, especially when reduced in size and exposed to an electric field. This leads to particle scission and the formation of silicate fragments, which we confirmed with mass spectrometry. This rapid weathering process may be important for soil formation, given the prevalence of charged aerosols in the atmosphere.",

Capturing CO 2 at temperatures closer to those of many industrial exhaust streams (>200\u00b0C) is of interest, although metal oxide absorbents that operate at these temperatures typically exhibit sluggish CO 2 absorption kinetics and instability to cycling. Here, we report a porous metal\u2013organic framework featuring terminal zinc hydride sites that reversibly bind CO 2 at temperatures above 200\u00b0C\u2014conditions that are unprecedented for intrinsically porous materials. Gas adsorption, structural, spectroscopic, and computational analyses elucidate the rapid, reversible nature of this transformation. Extended cycling and breakthrough analyses reveal that the material is capable of deep carbon capture at low CO 2 concentrations and high temperatures relevant to postcombustion capture.",

    "abstract": "Madagascar exhibits high endemic biodiversity that has evolved with sustained and stable rates of speciation over the past several tens of millions of years. The topography of Madagascar is dominated by a mountainous continental rift escarpment, with the highest plant diversity and rarity found along the steep, eastern side of this geographic feature. Using a process-explicit model, we show that precipitation-driven erosion and landward retreat of this high-relief topography creates transient habitat organization through multiple mechanisms, including catchment expansion, isolation of highland remnants, and formation of topographic barriers. Habitat isolation and reconnection on a million-year timescale serves as an allopatric speciation pump creating the observed biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Overgeneralization of fear to harmless situations is a core feature of anxiety disorders resulting from acute stress, yet the mechanisms by which fear becomes generalized are poorly understood. In this study, we show that generalized fear in mice results from a transmitter switch from glutamate to \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in serotonergic neurons of the lateral wings of the dorsal raphe. Similar change in transmitter identity was found in the postmortem brains of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Overriding the transmitter switch in mice prevented the acquisition of generalized fear. Corticosterone release and activation of glucocorticoid receptors mediated the switch, and prompt antidepressant treatment blocked the cotransmitter switch and generalized fear. Our results provide important insight into the mechanisms involved in fear generalization.",

    "abstract": "A molecular clock network is crucial for daily physiology and maintaining organismal health. We examined the interactions and importance of intratissue clock networks in muscle tissue maintenance. In arrhythmic mice showing premature aging, we created a basic clock module involving a central and a peripheral (muscle) clock. Reconstituting the brain-muscle clock network is sufficient to preserve fundamental daily homeostatic functions and prevent premature muscle aging. However, achieving whole muscle physiology requires contributions from other peripheral clocks. Mechanistically, the muscle peripheral clock acts as a gatekeeper, selectively suppressing detrimental signals from the central clock while integrating important muscle homeostatic functions. Our research reveals the interplay between the central and peripheral clocks in daily muscle function and underscores the impact of eating patterns on these interactions.",

Systematically evaluating the effect of a single atom, however, poses synthetic challenges, primarily as a result of thermodynamic mismatches in atomic exchange processes. We present a photocatalytic strategy that swaps an oxygen atom of furan with a nitrogen group, directly converting the furan into a pyrrole analog in a single intermolecular reaction. High compatibility was observed with various furan derivatives and nitrogen nucleophiles commonly used in drug discovery, and the late-stage functionalization furnished otherwise difficult-to-access pyrroles from naturally occurring furans of high molecular complexity. Mechanistic analysis suggested that polarity inversion through single electron transfer initiates the redox-neutral atom exchange processes at room temperature.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic reinforcement of T cell exhaustion is known to be a major barrier limiting T cell responses during immunotherapy. However, the core epigenetic regulators restricting antitumor immunity during prolonged antigen exposure are not clear. We investigated three commonly mutated epigenetic regulators that promote clonal hematopoiesis to determine whether they affect T cell stemness and response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. CD8 T cells lacking Dnmt3a, Tet2, or Asxl1 preserved a progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) population for more than 1 year during chronic antigen exposure without undergoing malignant transformation. Asxl1 controlled the self-renewal capacity of T cells and reduced CD8 T cell differentiation through H2AK119 ubiquitination and epigenetic modification of the polycomb group\u2013repressive deubiquitinase pathway. Asxl1-deficient T cells synergized with anti\u2013PD-L1 immunotherapy to improve tumor control in experimental models and conferred a survival advantage to mutated T cells from treated patients.",

    "abstract": "Mutualisms often define ecosystems, but they are susceptible to human activities. Combining experiments, animal tracking, and mortality investigations, we show that the invasive big-headed ant ( Pheidole megacephala ) makes lions ( Panthera leo ) less effective at killing their primary prey, plains zebra ( Equus quagga ). Big-headed ants disrupted the mutualism between native ants ( Crematogaster spp.) and the dominant whistling-thorn tree ( Vachellia drepanolobium ), rendering trees vulnerable to elephant ( Loxodonta africana ) browsing and resulting in landscapes with higher visibility. Although zebra kills were significantly less likely to occur in higher-visibility, invaded areas, lion numbers did not decline since the onset of the invasion, likely because of prey-switching to African buffalo ( Syncerus caffer ). We show that by controlling biophysical structure across landscapes, a tiny invader reconfigured predator-prey dynamics among iconic species.",

Our results reveal a rise in seawater \u03b4 18 O and a temperate Proterozoic climate distinct to interpretations of a hot early Earth, indicating a strongly buffered climate system. Precambrian sediments are enriched in marine authigenic clay, with prominent reductions occurring in concert with Paleozoic and Cenozoic cooling, the expansion of siliceous life, and the radiation of land plants. These findings support the notion that shifts in the locus and extent of clay formation contributed to seawater 18 O enrichment, clement early Earth conditions, major climate transitions, and climate stability through the reverse weathering feedback.",

In this work, we probe the influence of catalyst potential and interfacial electric fields on heterogeneous Br\u00f8nsted acid catalysis. We observed that variations in applied potential of ~380 mV led to a 100,000-fold rate enhancement for 1-methylcyclopentanol dehydration, which was catalyzed by carbon-supported phosphotungstic acid. Mechanistic studies support a model in which the interfacial electrostatic potential drop drives quasi-equilibrated proton transfer to the adsorbed substrate prior to rate-limiting C\u2013O bond cleavage. Large increases in rate with potential were also observed for the same reaction catalyzed by Ti/TiO y H x and for the Friedel Crafts acylation of anisole with acetic anhydride by carbon-supported phosphotungstic acid.",

In this work, we presented a unifying mathematical mechanism, known as average gradient outer product (AGOP), that characterized feature learning in neural networks. We provided empirical evidence that AGOP captured features learned by various neural network architectures, including transformer-based language models, convolutional networks, multilayer perceptrons, and recurrent neural networks. Moreover, we demonstrated that AGOP, which is backpropagation-free, enabled feature learning in machine learning models, such as kernel machines, that a priori could not identify task-specific features. Overall, we established a fundamental mechanism that captured feature learning in neural networks and enabled feature learning in general machine learning models.",

    "abstract": "Pumping ions against a concentration gradient through protein-based transporters is a cornerstone of numerous biological processes. Mimicking this function by using artificial receptors remains a daunting challenge, mainly because of the difficulties in balancing between the requirement for high binding affinities and precise and on-demand ion capture and release properties. We report a trimeric hydrazone photoswitch-based receptor that converts light energy into work by actively transporting chloride anion against a gradient through a dichloromethane liquid membrane, functioning as a molecular pump. The system manifests ease of synthesis, bistability, excellent photoswitching properties, and superb ON-OFF binding properties (difference of up to six orders of magnitude).",

    "abstract": "An enduring question in evolutionary biology concerns the degree to which episodes of convergent trait evolution depend on the same genetic programs, particularly over long timescales. In this work, we genetically dissected repeated origins and losses of prickles\u2014sharp epidermal projections\u2014that convergently evolved in numerous plant lineages. Mutations in a cytokinin hormone biosynthetic gene caused at least 16 independent losses of prickles in eggplants and wild relatives in the genus Solanum . Homologs underlie prickle formation across angiosperms that collectively diverged more than 150 million years ago, including rice and roses. By developing new Solanum genetic systems, we leveraged this discovery to eliminate prickles in a wild species and an indigenously foraged berry. Our findings implicate a shared hormone activation genetic program underlying evolutionarily widespread and recurrent instances of plant morphological innovation.",

In this work, we developed a messenger RNA (mRNA)\u2013lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccine targeting C. difficile toxins and virulence factors. This multivalent vaccine elicited robust and long-lived systemic and mucosal antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across animal models, independent of changes to the intestinal microbiota. Vaccination protected mice from lethal CDI in both primary and recurrent infection models, and inclusion of non-toxin cellular and spore antigens improved decolonization of toxigenic C. difficile from the gastrointestinal tract.

    "abstract": "Asthma is deemed an inflammatory disease, yet the defining diagnostic feature is mechanical bronchoconstriction. We previously discovered a conserved process called cell extrusion that drives homeostatic epithelial cell death when cells become too crowded. In this work, we show that the pathological crowding of a bronchoconstrictive attack causes so much epithelial cell extrusion that it damages the airways, resulting in inflammation and mucus secretion in both mice and humans. Although relaxing the airways with the rescue treatment albuterol did not affect these responses, inhibiting live cell extrusion signaling during bronchoconstriction prevented all these features. Our findings show that bronchoconstriction causes epithelial damage and inflammation by excess crowding-induced cell extrusion and suggest that blocking epithelial extrusion, instead of the ensuing downstream inflammation, could prevent the feed-forward asthma inflammatory cycle.",

    "abstract": "Electrostatic capacitors are foundational components of advanced electronics and high-power electrical systems owing to their ultrafast charging-discharging capability. Ferroelectric materials offer high maximum polarization, but high remnant polarization has hindered their effective deployment in energy storage applications. Previous methodologies have encountered problems because of the deteriorated crystallinity of the ferroelectric materials. We introduce an approach to control the relaxation time using two-dimensional (2D) materials while minimizing energy loss by using 2D/3D/2D heterostructures and preserving the crystallinity of ferroelectric 3D materials. Using this approach, we were able to achieve an energy density of 191.7 joules per cubic centimeter with an efficiency greater than 90%. This precise control over relaxation time holds promise for a wide array of applications and has the potential to accelerate the development of highly efficient energy storage systems.",

We report the on-surface synthesis of cyclo[13]carbon, C 13 , by manipulation of decachlorofluorene with a scanning probe microscope tip. We elucidated the properties of C 13 by experiment and theoretical modeling. C 13 adopts an open-shell configuration with a triplet ground state and a kinked geometry, which shows different extents of distortion and carbene localization depending on the molecular environment. Moreover, we prepared and characterized the C 13 dimer, cyclo[26]carbon, demonstrating the potential of cyclocarbons and their precursors as building blocks for carbon allotropes.",

How excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic cytomatrices or densities (e/iPSDs) are segregated is not understood. Broadly, why membraneless organelles are naturally segregated in cellular subcompartments is unclear. Using biochemical reconstitutions in vitro and in cells, we demonstrate that ePSDs and iPSDs spontaneously segregate into distinct condensed molecular assemblies through phase separation. Tagging iPSD scaffold gephyrin with a PSD-95 intrabody (dissociation constant ~4 nM) leads to mistargeting of gephyrin to ePSD condensates. Unexpectedly, formation of iPSD condensates forces the intrabody-tagged gephyrin out of ePSD condensates. Thus, instead of diffusion-governed spontaneous mixing, demixing is a default process for biomolecules in condensates. Phase separation can generate biomolecular compartmentalization specificities that cannot occur in dilute solutions.",

We dock small molecules of interest into the most shape complementary of these pseudocycles, design the interaction surfaces for high binding affinity, and experimentally screen to identify designs with the highest affinity. We obtain binders to four diverse molecules, including the polar and flexible methotrexate and thyroxine.

Implantable sensors for monitoring small molecules such as glucose have been available for more than a decade. However, analysis of proteins remains an unmet need because the lower physiological levels require that sensors have high affinities, which are linked to long complexation half-lives ( t 1/2 ~20 hours) and slow equilibration when concentrations decrease. We report active-reset sensors by use of high-frequency oscillations to accelerate dissociation, which enables regeneration of the unbound form of the sensor within 1 minute. When implemented within implanted devices, these sensors allow for real-time, in vivo monitoring of proteins within interstitial fluid. Active-reset protein sensors track biomarker levels on a physiological timescale for inflammation monitoring in living animals.",

    "abstract": "All living organisms deploy cell-autonomous defenses to combat infection. In plants and animals, large supramolecular complexes often activate immune proteins for protection. In this work, we resolved the native structure of a massive host-defense complex that polymerizes 30,000 guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) over the surface of gram-negative bacteria inside human cells. Construction of this giant nanomachine took several minutes and remained stable for hours, required guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis, and recruited four GBPs plus caspase-4 and Gasdermin D as a cytokine and cell death immune signaling platform. Cryo\u2013electron tomography suggests that GBP1 can adopt an extended conformation for bacterial membrane insertion to establish this platform, triggering lipopolysaccharide release that activated coassembled caspase-4. Our \u201copen conformer\u201d model provides a dynamic view into how the human GBP1 defense complex mobilizes innate immunity to infection.",

In this work, we found that without resolving lineage plasticity, skin stem cells cannot effectively generate each lineage in vitro nor regrow hair and repair wounded epidermis in vivo. A small-molecule screen unearthed retinoic acid as a critical regulator. Combining high-throughput approaches, cell culture, and in vivo mouse genetics, we dissected its roles in tissue regeneration. We found that retinoic acid is made locally in hair follicle stem cell niches, where its levels determine identity and usage. Our findings have therapeutic implications for hair growth as well as chronic wounds and cancers, where lineage plasticity is unresolved.",

    "abstract": "Experiences need to be tagged during learning for further consolidation. However, neurophysiological mechanisms that select experiences for lasting memory are not known. By combining large-scale neural recordings in mice with dimensionality reduction techniques, we observed that successive maze traversals were tracked by continuously drifting populations of neurons, providing neuronal signatures of both places visited and events encountered. When the brain state changed during reward consumption, sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) occurred on some trials, and their specific spike content decoded the trial blocks that surrounded them. During postexperience sleep, SPW-Rs continued to replay those trial blocks that were reactivated most frequently during waking SPW-Rs. Replay content of awake SPW-Rs may thus provide a neurophysiological tagging mechanism to select aspects of experience that are preserved and consolidated for future use.",

Here, we report a ferromagnetic state in charge-neutral ABCA-tetralayer graphene driven by proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling from adjacent tungsten diselenide. The ferromagnetic state is identified as a Chern insulator with a Chern number of 4; its maximum Hall resistance reaches 78% quantization at zero magnetic field and is fully quantized at either 0.4 or \u20131.5 tesla. Three distinct broken-symmetry insulating states, layer-antiferromagnet, Chern insulator, and layer-polarized insulator, along with their transitions, can be continuously tuned by the vertical displacement field. In this system, the magnetic order of the Chern insulator can be switched by three knobs, including magnetic field, electrical doping, and vertical displacement field.",

Using topological quantum chemistry, we calculated the band representations, compatibility relations, and band topologies of each isolated set of phonon bands for the materials in the phonon databases. Additionally, we calculated the real-space invariants for all the topologically trivial bands and classified them as atomic or obstructed atomic bands.

However, antibody-antigen recognition is typically dominated by heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) interactions, and vaccine priming of HCDR3-dominant bnAbs by germline-targeting immunogens has not been demonstrated in humans or outbred animals. In this work, immunization with N332-GT5, an HIV envelope trimer designed to target precursors of the HCDR3-dominant bnAb BG18, primed bnAb-precursor B cells in eight of eight rhesus macaques to substantial frequencies and with diverse lineages in germinal center and memory B cells. We confirmed bnAb-mimicking, HCDR3-dominant, trimer-binding interactions with cryo\u2013electron microscopy. Our results demonstrate proof of principle for HCDR3-dominant bnAb-precursor priming in outbred animals and suggest that N332-GT5 holds promise for the induction of similar responses in humans.",

In primary cells, we identified 46,802 active enhancer sequences and 164 variants that alter enhancer activity. Activity was comparable in organoids and primary cells, suggesting that organoids provide an adequate model for the developing cortex. Using deep learning we decoded the sequence basis and upstream regulators of enhancer activity.

We report a molecular templating method that restricted crystal growth along all crystallographic directions except for [110] and promoted one-dimensional growth. Our approach is widely applicable to synthesize a range of high-quality layered perovskite nanowires with large aspect ratios and tunable organic-inorganic chemical compositions. These nanowires form exceptionally well-defined and flexible cavities that exhibited a wide range of unusual optical properties beyond those of conventional perovskite nanowires. We observed anisotropic emission polarization, low-loss waveguiding (below 3 decibels per millimeter), and efficient low-threshold light amplification (below 20 microjoules per square centimeter).",

This situation poses a challenge for the biosynthesis of fluorinated compounds used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. We developed a photoenzymatic hydrofluoroalkylation that integrates fluorinated motifs into olefins. The photoinduced promiscuity of flavin-dependent ene-reductases enables the generation of carbon-centered radicals from iodinated fluoroalkanes, which are directed by the photoenzyme to engage enantioselectively with olefins. This approach facilitates stereocontrol through interaction between a singular fluorinated unit and the enzyme, securing high enantioselectivity at \u03b2, \u03b3, or \u03b4 positions of fluorinated groups through enzymatic hydrogen atom transfer\u2014a process that is notably challenging with conventional chemocatalysis. This work advances enzymatic strategies for integrating fluorinated chemical feedstocks and opens avenues for asymmetric synthesis of fluorinated compounds.",

    "abstract": "The continued development of computational approaches to many-body ground-state problems in physics and chemistry calls for a consistent way to assess its overall progress. In this work, we introduce a metric of variational accuracy, the V-score, obtained from the variational energy and its variance. We provide an extensive curated dataset of variational calculations of many-body quantum systems, identifying cases where state-of-the-art numerical approaches show limited accuracy and future algorithms or computational platforms, such as quantum computing, could provide improved accuracy. The V-score can be used as a metric to assess the progress of quantum variational methods toward a quantum advantage for ground-state problems, especially in regimes where classical verifiability is impossible.",

Identifying domains can enable many functional and evolutionary analyses but has remained challenging because of the sheer scale of the data. Using deep learning methods, we have detected and classified every domain in the AFDB, producing The Encyclopedia of Domains. We detected nearly 365 million domains, over 100 million more than can be found by sequence methods, covering more than 1 million taxa. Reassuringly, 77% of the nonredundant domains are similar to known superfamilies, greatly expanding representation of their domain space. We uncovered more than 10,000 new structural interactions between superfamilies and thousands of new folds across the fold space continuum.",

Synthetic Notch receptors engineered to detect these antigens were used to program T cells to induce the expression of diverse payloads only in the brain. CNS-targeted T cells that induced chimeric antigen receptor expression efficiently cleared primary and secondary brain tumors without harming cross-reactive cells outside of the brain. Conversely, CNS-targeted cells that locally delivered the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 ameliorated symptoms in a mouse model of neuroinflammation.

We observed SS 433 in gamma rays using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and found an energy-dependent shift in the apparent position of the gamma-ray emission from the parsec-scale jets. These observations trace the energetic electron population and indicate that inverse Compton scattering is the emission mechanism of the gamma rays. Our modeling of the energy-dependent gamma-ray morphology constrains the location of particle acceleration and requires an abrupt deceleration of the jet flow. We infer the presence of shocks on either side of the binary system, at distances of 25 to 30 parsecs, and that self-collimation of the precessing jets forms the shocks, which then efficiently accelerate electrons.",

Here we report a technique to break the chiral symmetry and to differentiate enantiomers by inducing directional rotation of chiral gas-phase ions. Dual alternating current excitations were applied to manipulate the motions of trapped ions, including the rotation around the center of mass and macro movement around the center of the trap. Differences in collision cross section were induced, which could be measured by ion cloud profiling at high resolutions above 10,000. High-field ion mobility and tandem mass spectrometry analyses of the enantiomers were combined and implemented by using a miniature ion trap mass spectrometer. The effectiveness of the developed method was demonstrated with a variety of organic compounds including amino acids, sugars, and several drug molecules, as well as a proof-of-principle ligand optimization study for asymmetric hydrogenation.",

To address this, we introduce a method to record transient cellular events for later analysis. We designed proteins that become labeled in the presence of both a specific cellular activity and a fluorescent substrate. The recording period is set by the presence of the substrate, whereas the cellular activity controls the degree of the labeling. The use of distinguishable substrates enabled the recording of successive periods of activity. We recorded protein-protein interactions, G protein\u2013coupled receptor activation, and increases in intracellular calcium. Recordings of elevated calcium levels allowed selections of cells from heterogeneous populations for transcriptomic analysis and tracking of neuronal activities in flies and zebrafish.",

In label-free microscopes, however, conventional AO faces limitations because of the absence of a guide star and the need to select an optimization metric specific to the sample and imaging process. Here, we propose an AO approach leveraging correlations between entangled photons to directly correct the point spread function. This guide star\u2013free method is independent of the specimen and imaging modality. We demonstrate the imaging of biological samples in the presence of aberrations using a bright-field imaging setup operating with a source of spatially entangled photon pairs. Our approach performs better than conventional AO in correcting specific aberrations, particularly those involving substantial defocus. Our work improves AO for label-free microscopy and could play a major role in the development of quantum microscopes.",

BCG can also be used to protect livestock against M. bovis ; however, its effectiveness has not been quantified for this use. We performed a natural transmission experiment to directly estimate the rate of transmission to and from vaccinated and unvaccinated calves over a 1-year exposure period. The results show a higher indirect efficacy of BCG to reduce transmission from vaccinated animals that subsequently become infected [74%; 95% credible interval (CrI): 46 to 98%] compared with direct protection against infection (58%; 95% CrI: 34 to 73%) and an estimated total efficacy of 89% (95% CrI: 74 to 96%). A mechanistic transmission model of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) spread within the Ethiopian dairy sector was developed and showed how the prospects for elimination may be enabled by routine BCG vaccination of cattle.",

    "abstract": "Tubulin, one of the most abundant cytoskeletal building blocks, has numerous isotypes in metazoans encoded by different conserved genes. Whether these distinct isotypes form cell type\u2013 and context-specific microtubule structures is poorly understood. Based on a cohort of 12 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia as well as mouse mutants, we identified and characterized variants in the TUBB4B isotype that specifically perturbed centriole and cilium biogenesis. Distinct TUBB4B variants differentially affected microtubule dynamics and cilia formation in a dominant-negative manner. Structure-function studies revealed that different TUBB4B variants disrupted distinct tubulin interfaces, thereby enabling stratification of patients into three classes of ciliopathic diseases. These findings show that specific tubulin isotypes have distinct and nonredundant subcellular functions and establish a link between tubulinopathies and ciliopathies.",

    "abstract": "Reproduction includes two energy investments\u2014the energy in the offspring and the energy expended to make them. The former is well understood, whereas the latter is unquantified but often assumed to be small. Without understanding both investments, the true energy costs of reproduction are unknown. We present a framework for estimating the total energy costs of reproduction by combining data on the energy content of offspring (direct costs) and the metabolic load of bearing them (indirect costs). We find that direct costs typically represent the smaller fraction of the energy expended on reproduction. Mammals pay the highest reproductive costs (excluding lactation), ~90% of which are indirect. Ectotherms expend less on reproduction overall, and live-bearing ectotherms pay higher indirect costs compared with egg-layers. We show that the energy demands of reproduction exceed standard assumptions.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein binds the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and drives virus-host membrane fusion through refolding of its S2 domain. Whereas the S1 domain contains high sequence variability, the S2 domain is conserved and is a promising pan-betacoronavirus vaccine target. We applied cryo\u2013electron tomography to capture intermediates of S2 refolding and understand inhibition by antibodies to the S2 stem-helix. Subtomogram averaging revealed ACE2 dimers cross-linking spikes before transitioning into S2 intermediates, which were captured at various stages of refolding. Pan-betacoronavirus neutralizing antibodies targeting the S2 stem-helix bound to and inhibited refolding of spike prehairpin intermediates. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations, these structures elucidate the process of SARS-CoV-2 entry and reveal how pan-betacoronavirus S2-targeting antibodies neutralize infectivity by arresting prehairpin intermediates.",

    "abstract": "Wind energy is helping to decarbonize the electrical grid, but wind blades are not recyclable, and current end-of-life management strategies are not sustainable. To address the material recyclability challenges in sustainable energy infrastructure, we introduce scalable biomass-derivable polyester covalent adaptable networks and corresponding fiber-reinforced composites for recyclable wind blade fabrication. Through experimental and computational studies, including vacuum-assisted resin-transfer molding of a 9-meter wind blade prototype, we demonstrate drop-in technological readiness of this material with existing manufacture techniques, superior properties relative to incumbent materials, and practical end-of-life chemical recyclability. Most notable is the counterintuitive creep suppression, outperforming industry state-of-the-art thermosets despite the dynamic cross-link topology. Overall, this report details the many facets of wind blade manufacture, encompassing chemistry, engineering, safety, mechanical analyses, weathering, and chemical recyclability, enabling a realistic path toward biomass-derivable, recyclable wind blades.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) generates micronuclei\u2014aberrant extranuclear structures that catalyze the acquisition of complex chromosomal rearrangements present in cancer. Micronuclei are characterized by persistent DNA damage and catastrophic nuclear envelope collapse, which exposes DNA to the cytoplasm. We found that the autophagic receptor p62/SQSTM1 modulates micronuclear stability, influencing chromosome fragmentation and rearrangements. Mechanistically, proximity of micronuclei to mitochondria led to oxidation-driven homo-oligomerization of p62, limiting endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)\u2013dependent micronuclear envelope repair by triggering autophagic degradation. We also found that p62 levels correlate with increased chromothripsis across human cancer cell lines and with increased CIN in colorectal tumors. Thus, p62 acts as a regulator of micronuclei and may serve as a prognostic marker for tumors with high CIN.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is increasingly predisposing polar regions to large landslides. Tsunamigenic landslides have occurred recently in Greenland ( Kalaallit Nunaat ), but none have been reported from the eastern fjords. In September 2023, we detected the start of a 9-day-long, global 10.88-millihertz (92-second) monochromatic very-long-period (VLP) seismic signal, originating from East Greenland. In this study, we demonstrate how this event started with a glacial thinning\u2013induced rock-ice avalanche of 25 \u00d7 10 6 cubic meters plunging into Dickson Fjord, triggering a 200-meter-high tsunami. Simulations show that the tsunami stabilized into a 7-meter-high long-duration seiche with a frequency (11.45 millihertz) and slow amplitude decay that were nearly identical to the seismic signal. An oscillating, fjord-transverse single force with a maximum amplitude of 5 \u00d7 10 11 newtons reproduced the seismic amplitudes and their radiation pattern relative to the fjord, demonstrating how a seiche directly caused the 9-day-long seismic signal. Our findings highlight how climate change is causing cascading, hazardous feedbacks between the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere.",

In rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, self-discharge in cathodes causes voltage and capacity loss over time. The prevailing self-discharge model centers on the diffusion of lithium ions from the electrolyte into the cathode. We demonstrate an alternative pathway, where hydrogenation of layered transition metal oxide cathodes induces self-discharge through hydrogen transfer from carbonate solvents to delithiated oxides. In self-discharged cathodes, we further observe opposing proton and lithium ion concentration gradients, which contribute to chemical and structural heterogeneities within delithiated cathodes, accelerating degradation. Hydrogenation occurring in delithiated cathodes may affect the chemo-mechanical coupling of layered cathodes as well as the calendar life of lithium-ion batteries.",

We developed an approach to substantially recover the isolated active materials in silicon electrodes and used a voltage pulse to reconnect the isolated lithium-silicon (Li x Si) particles back to the conductive network. Using a 5-second pulse, we achieved >30% of capacity recovery in both Li-Si and Si\u2013lithium iron phosphate (Si-LFP) batteries. The recovered capacity sustains and replicates through multiple pulses, providing a constant capacity advantage. We validated the recovery mechanism as the movement of the neutral isolated Li x Si particles under a localized nonuniform electric field, a phenomenon known as dielectrophoresis.",

In this work, we report the noncovalent synthesis of unprecedented plastics that are mechanically strong yet metabolizable under biologically relevant conditions owing to their dissociative nature with electrolytes. Salt-bridging sodium hexametaphosphate with di- or tritopic guanidinium sulfate in water forms a cross-linked supramolecular network, which is stable unless electrolytes are resupplied. This unusual stability is caused by a liquid-liquid phase separation that expels sodium sulfate, generated upon salt bridging, into a water-rich phase. Drying the remaining condensed liquid phase yields glassy plastics that are thermally reshapable, such as thermoplastics, and usable even in aqueous media with hydrophobic parylene C coating. This approach can be extended to polysaccharide-based supramolecular plastics that are applicable for three-dimensional printing.",

The line emission is spatially unresolved and blueshifted in velocity relative to the supernova rest frame. We interpret the lines as gas illuminated by a source of ionizing photons located close to the center of the expanding ejecta. Photoionization models show that the line ratios are consistent with ionization by a cooling neutron star or a pulsar wind nebula. The velocity shift could be evidence for a neutron star natal kick.",

Mechanistic insights reveal flexibility on the order of bond-forming events, suggesting potential for expansion of the aminative cross-coupling concept to encompass diverse nucleophiles and electrophiles as well as four-component variants.",

    "abstract": "Phonation critically depends on precise controls of laryngeal muscles in coordination with ongoing respiration. However, the neural mechanisms governing these processes remain unclear. We identified excitatory vocalization-specific laryngeal premotor neurons located in the retroambiguus nucleus (RAm VOC ) in adult mice as being both necessary and sufficient for driving vocal cord closure and eliciting mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). The duration of RAm VOC activation can determine the lengths of both USV syllables and concurrent expiration periods, with the impact of RAm VOC activation depending on respiration phases. RAm VOC neurons receive inhibition from the preB\u00f6tzinger complex, and inspiration needs override RAm VOC -mediated vocal cord closure. Ablating inhibitory synapses in RAm VOC neurons compromised this inspiration gating of laryngeal adduction, resulting in discoordination of vocalization with respiration. Our study reveals the circuits for vocal production and vocal-respiratory coordination.",

    "abstract": "Visual preferences are important drivers of mate choice and sexual selection, but little is known of how they evolve at the genetic level. In this study, we took advantage of the diversity of bright warning patterns displayed by Heliconius butterflies, which are also used during mate choice. Combining behavioral, population genomic, and expression analyses, we show that two Heliconius species have evolved the same preferences for red patterns by exchanging genetic material through hybridization. Neural expression of regucalcin1 correlates with visual preference across populations, and disruption of regucalcin1 with CRISPR-Cas9 impairs courtship toward conspecific females, providing a direct link between gene and behavior. Our results support a role for hybridization during behavioral evolution and show how visually guided behaviors contributing to adaptation and speciation are encoded within the genome.",

We identify three homeodomain-leucine zipper IV (HD-Zip IV) genes that coordinately promote the formation of interlocking trichomes at the anther margin to unite neighboring anthers, generating a closed anther cone and cleistogamy (flower morphology necessitating strict self-pollination). These HD-Zip IV genes also control style length by regulating the transition from cell division to endoreduplication. The expression of these HD-Zip IV genes and their downstream gene, Style 2.1 , was sequentially modified to shape the cleistogamy morphology during tomato evolution and domestication. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of cleistogamy in modern tomato and suggest targets for improving fruit set and preventing pollen contamination in genetically modified crops.",

We chemically synthesized 18 macrocycles predicted to adopt single low-energy states and determined their x-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance structures; 15 of these were very close to the design models. We illustrate the therapeutic potential of these macrocycle designs by developing selective inhibitors of three protein targets of current interest. By opening up a vast space of readily synthesizable drug-like macrocycles, our results should considerably enhance structure-based drug design.",

Here, we describe the identification of a class of compounds called ReS19-T, which are able to restore calcium homeostasis in cell-based models of tau pathology. Aberrant tau accumulation leads to uncontrolled activation of store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs) by remodeling septin filaments at the cell cortex. Binding of ReS19-T to septins restores filament assembly in the disease state and restrains calcium entry through SOCCs. In amyloid-\u03b2 and tau-driven mouse models of disease, ReS19-T agents restored synaptic plasticity, normalized brain network activity, and attenuated the development of both amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathology. Our findings identify the septin cytoskeleton as a potential therapeutic target for the development of disease-modifying AD treatments.",

The compositions of those planets are largely unknown but are expected to relate to the protoplanetary disk in which they form. We used James Webb Space Telescope mid-infrared spectroscopy to investigate the chemical composition of the planet-forming disk around ISO-ChaI 147, a 0.11-solar-mass star. The inner disk has a carbon-rich chemistry; we identified emission from 13 carbon-bearing molecules, including ethane and benzene. The high column densities of hydrocarbons indicate that the observations probe deep into the disk. The high carbon-to-oxygen ratio indicates radial transport of material within the disk, which we predict would affect the bulk composition of any planets forming in the disk.",

Without any additives, the diazophosphorus ylide serves as a highly selective transfer reagent for fragments, including Ph 3 PC, to deliver phosphorus ylide\u2013terminated heterocumulenes and CN 2 to produce multisubstituted pyrazoles. Ultimately, even exclusive carbon-atom transfer is possible. In reactions with aldehydes and acyclic and cyclic ketones (R 2 C=O), the carbon-atom substitution forms a vinylidene (R 2 C=C:) en route to alkynes or butatrienes.",

The E3 ligase tripartite motif\u2013containing protein 21 (TRIM21) degrades antibody-bound proteins in an assembly state\u2013specific manner due to the requirement of TRIM21 RING domain clustering for activation, yet effective targeting of intracellular assemblies remains challenging. Here, we fused the RING domain of TRIM21 to a target-specific nanobody to create intracellularly expressed constructs capable of selectively degrading assembled proteins. We evaluated this approach against green fluorescent protein\u2013tagged histone 2B (H2B-GFP) and tau, a protein that undergoes pathological aggregation in Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurodegenerative diseases. RING-nanobody degraders prevented or reversed tau aggregation in culture and in vivo, with minimal impact on monomeric tau. This approach may have therapeutic potential for the many disorders driven by intracellular protein aggregation.",

These fires accounted for 78% of structures destroyed and 61% of suppression costs ($18.9 billion).

It catalyzes two chemical reactions: water oxidation to molecular oxygen and plastoquinone reduction. Coupling of electron and proton transfer is crucial for efficiency; however, the molecular basis of these processes remains speculative owing to uncertain water binding sites and the lack of experimentally determined hydrogen positions. We thus collected high-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy data of fully hydrated photosystem II from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vestitus to a final resolution of 1.71 angstroms. The structure reveals several previously undetected partially occupied water binding sites and more than half of the hydrogen and proton positions. This clarifies the pathways of substrate water binding and plastoquinone B protonation.",

Our results indicate substantial growth of the Antarctic Ice Sheets (AISs) at 2.0 to 1.25 million years ago, preceding the rapid expansion of Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheets after ~1.25 million years ago. Proxy-model comparisons suggest that AIS and associated Southern Ocean sea ice expansion can induce northern high-latitude cooling and enhanced moisture transport to the Northern Hemisphere, thus triggering the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The dynamic processes involved are crucial for assessing modern global warming that is already inducing asynchronous bipolar melting of ice sheets.",

However, the inability to surmount multiple functionality trade-offs limits the discovery of next-generation multifunctional materials. Departing from conventional alloying design philosophy, we present a hierarchical nanostructure (HNS) strategy to simultaneously break multiple performance trade-offs in a material. Using a praseodymium-cobalt (PrCo 5 ) ferromagnet as a proof of concept, the resulting HNS outperforms contemporary high-temperature ferromagnets with a 50 to 138% increase in electrical resistivity while achieving their highest energy density. Our strategy also enables an exceptional thermal stability of coercivity (\u22120.148%/\u00b0C)\u2014a key characteristic for device accuracy and reliability\u2014surpassing that of existing commercial rare-earth magnets. The multifunctionality stems from the deliberately introduced nanohierarchical structure, which activates multiple micromechanisms to resist domain wall movement and electron transport, offering an advanced design concept for multifunctional materials.",

Structural analysis of deep-sea ctenophore lipids shows that they form a nonbilayer phase at pressures under which the phase is not typically stable. Lipidomics and all-atom simulations identified phospholipids with strong negative spontaneous curvature, including plasmalogens, as a hallmark of deep-adapted membranes that causes this phase behavior. Synthesis of plasmalogens enhanced pressure tolerance in Escherichia coli , whereas low-curvature lipids had the opposite effect. Imaging of ctenophore tissues indicated that the disintegration of deep-sea animals when decompressed could be driven by a phase transition in their phospholipid membranes.",

By screening suppressors of rod1 mutants, we show that ROD1 governs immune homeostasis by surveilling the activation of a canonical immune pathway. Mutations in OsTIR ( TIR-only protein ), OsEDS1 ( enhanced disease susceptibility 1 ), OsPAD4 ( phytoalexin deficient 4 ), and OsADR1 ( activated disease resistance 1 ) all abolish enhanced disease resistance of rod1 plants. OsTIR catalyzes the production of second messengers 2\u2032-(5\u2033-phosphoribosyl)-5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate (pRib-AMP) and diphosphate (pRib-ADP), which trigger formation of an OsEDS1-OsPAD4-OsADR1 (EPA) immune complex. ROD1 interacts with OsTIR and inhibits its enzymatic activity, whereas mutation of ROD1 leads to constitutive activation of the EPA complex. Thus, we unveil an immune network that fine-tunes immune homeostasis and multipathogen resistance in rice.",

However, the molecular basis underlying secretory cavity development is unknown. Here, we reveal a molecular framework for Citrus oil gland formation. Using genetic mapping and genome editing, we demonstrated that this process requires LATE MERISTEM IDENTITY1 (LMI1), a key regulator of leaf serration. A conserved GCC box element of the LMI1 promoter recruits DORNROSCHEN-like (DRNL) for transcriptional activation. This DRNL-LMI1 cascade triggers MYC5 activation, facilitating the development of oil glands and the biosynthesis of essential oils. Our findings spotlight cis -regulatory divergence within leaf shape genes, propelling novel functional tissue formation.",

    "abstract": "In some mammals, notably humans, recombination occurs almost exclusively where the protein PRDM9 binds, whereas in vertebrates lacking an intact PRDM9 , such as birds and canids, recombination rates are elevated near promoter-like features. To determine whether PRDM9 directs recombination in nonmammalian vertebrates, we focused on an exemplar species with a single, intact PRDM9 ortholog, the corn snake ( Pantherophis guttatus ). Analyzing historical recombination rates along the genome and crossovers in pedigrees, we found evidence that PRDM9 specifies the location of recombination events, but we also detected a separable effect of promoter-like features. These findings reveal that the uses of PRDM9 and promoter-like features need not be mutually exclusive and instead reflect a tug-of-war that is more even in some species than others.",

Then, a second rupture initiated at the opposite edge of the asperity, and the asperity succumbed to double-pincer rupture fronts. The failure of this high-stress drop asperity drove the earthquake into a large-scale event. Our observations help unravel the crucial role of fault asperities in controlling swarm migration and rupture propagation and underscore the need for detailed seismological and interdisciplinary studies to assess seismic risk in swarm-prone regions.",

For island endemics, proportional losses have been even greater. Projected future extinctions of more than 1000 species over the next two centuries will incur further substantial reductions in functional and phylogenetic diversity.

    "abstract": "The innate immune system shapes brain development and is implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases. It is critical to define the relevant immune cells and signals and their impact on brain circuits. In this work, we found that group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and their cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaled directly to inhibitory interneurons to increase inhibitory synapse density in the developing mouse brain. ILC2s expanded and produced IL-13 in the developing brain meninges. Loss of ILC2s or IL-13 signaling to interneurons decreased inhibitory, but not excitatory, cortical synapses. Conversely, ILC2s and IL-13 were sufficient to increase inhibitory synapses. Loss of this signaling pathway led to selective impairments in social interaction. These data define a type 2 neuroimmune circuit in early life that shapes inhibitory synapse development and behavior.",

Rationing restricted sugar intake to levels within current dietary guidelines, and consumption nearly doubled immediately after rationing ended. Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced type 2 diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35 and 20% and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years, respectively. Protection was evident with in utero exposure and increased with postnatal sugar restriction, especially after 6 months, when eating of solid foods likely began. In utero sugar rationing alone accounted for about one-third of the risk reduction.",

We developed an oriented monolayer polyhedral (OMP) membrane that consists of a monolayer of ordered polyhedral particles and is anchored by hyperbranched polymers. It contains a high density of straight, selective nanochannels, enabling the preferential transport of aromatic molecules. Compared with traditional mixed-matrix membranes with random orientations, the OMP membrane improves the pervaporation separation index for aromatic-aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures with C 6 and C 7 compounds, surpassing the performance of existing membranes by 3 to 10 times. This high performance demonstrates the potential of OMP membranes for hydrocarbon molecular separation and their application in the value-added separation of naphtha feedstocks.",

However, the impact of nutrient metabolism on epigenetic modifications that control TEX differentiation remains unclear. We showed that TEX cells shifted from acetate to citrate metabolism by down-regulating acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) while maintaining ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) activity. This metabolic switch increased citrate-dependent histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferase KAT2A-ACLY interactions, at TEX signature genes while reducing acetate-dependent histone acetylation, dependent on p300-ACSS2 complexes, at effector and memory T cell genes. Nuclear ACSS2 overexpression or ACLY inhibition prevented TEX differentiation and enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses. These findings unveiled a nutrient-instructed histone code governing CD8 + T cell differentiation, with implications for metabolic- and epigenetic-based T cell therapies.",

Previous studies of cortical connectivity have mostly been carried out in rodents; whether the principles established therein also apply to the evolutionarily expanded human cortex is unclear. We studied network properties within the human temporal cortex using samples obtained from brain surgery. We analyzed multineuron patch-clamp recordings in layer 2-3 pyramidal neurons and identified substantial differences compared with rodents. Reciprocity showed random distribution, synaptic strength was independent from connection probability, and connectivity of the supragranular temporal cortex followed a directed and mostly acyclic graph topology. Application of these principles in neuronal models increased dimensionality of network dynamics, suggesting a critical role for cortical computation.",

We assessed 117 diverse knowledge, attitude, and practice outcomes. Friendship-nomination targeting reduced the number of households needed to attain specified levels of village-wide uptake. Knowledge spread more readily than behavior, and spillovers extended to two degrees of separation. Outcomes that were intrinsically easier to adopt also manifested greater spillovers.

We report that during liver regeneration, proliferation is suppressed in electron transport chain (ETC)\u2013dysfunctional hepatocytes due to an inability to generate acetyl-CoA from peripheral fatty acids through mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation. Alternative modes for acetyl-CoA production from pyruvate or acetate are suppressed in the setting of ETC dysfunction. This metabolic inflexibility forces a dependence on ETC-functional mitochondria and restoring acetyl-CoA production from pyruvate is sufficient to allow ETC-dysfunctional hepatocytes to proliferate. We propose that metabolic inflexibility within hepatocytes can be advantageous by limiting the expansion of ETC-dysfunctional cells.",

Despite the large number of observed earthquakes, the scaling of the earthquake energy budget remains enigmatic. We propose that fundamentally different fracture processes govern small and large earthquakes. We combined seismological observations with physics-based earthquake models, finding that both dynamic weakening and restrengthening effects are non-negligible in the energy budget of small earthquakes. We established a linear scaling relationship between fracture energy and fault size and a break in scaling with slip. We applied this scaling using supercomputing and unveiled large dynamic rupture earthquake cascades involving >700 multiscale fractures within a fault damage zone. We provide a simple explanation for seismicity across all scales with implications for comprehending earthquake genesis and multifault rupture cascades.",

Attempts to understand how localized stress leads to widespread repression have been limited by difficulties in resolving translation rates at the subcellular level. Here, using live-cell imaging of reporter mRNA translation, we unexpectedly found that during ER stress, active translation at mitochondria was significantly protected. The mitochondrial protein ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3A (ATAD3A) interacted with protein kinase RNA\u2013like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and mediated this effect on localized translation by competing for binding with PERK\u2019s target, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). PERK-ATAD3A interactions increased during ER stress, forming mitochondria-ER contact sites. Furthermore, ATAD3A binding attenuated local PERK signaling and rescued the expression of some mitochondrial proteins. Thus, PERK-ATAD3A interactions can control translational repression at a subcellular level, mitigating the impact of ER stress on the cell.",

Uranium-lead dating of the three volcanic glass beads shows that they formed 123 \u00b1 15 million years ago. We measured high abundances of rare earth elements and thorium in these volcanic glass beads, which could indicate that such recent volcanism was related to local enrichment of heat-generating elements in the mantle sources of the magma.",

However, there is marked variation across plant species in the number of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors, which form a cornerstone of defense. The growth\u2013defense trade-off hypothesis predicts costs associated with defense investment to generate variation in these traits. Our analysis comparing features of the intracellular immune-receptor repertoires with trait data of 187 species shows that in wild plants, the size of the molecular defense repertoire correlates negatively with growth. By contrast, we do not find evidence for a growth\u2013defense trade-off in agricultural plants.

A recent transition from egg-laying to live-bearing in marine snails ( Littorina spp.) provides the opportunity to study the genetic architecture of an innovation that has evolved repeatedly across animals. Individuals do not cluster by reproductive mode in a genome-wide phylogeny, but local genealogical analysis revealed numerous small genomic regions where all live-bearers carry the same core haplotype. Candidate regions show evidence for live-bearer\u2013specific positive selection and are enriched for genes that are differentially expressed between egg-laying and live-bearing reproductive systems. Ages of selective sweeps suggest that live-bearer\u2013specific alleles accumulated over more than 200,000 generations. Our results suggest that new functions evolve through the recruitment of many alleles rather than in a single evolutionary step.",

Cyclic tri\u2013adenosine monophosphate (AMP)\u2013induced oligomerization of SAVED-CHAT activates proteolytic activity of the CHAT domains, which specifically cleave and activate PCaspase. Subsequently, activated PCaspase cleaves a multitude of proteins, which results in a strong interference phenotype in vivo in Escherichia coli.

    "abstract": "Newly copied sister chromatids are tethered together by the cohesin complex, but how sister chromatid cohesion coordinates with DNA replication is poorly understood. Prevailing models suggest that cohesin complexes, bound to DNA before replication, remain behind the advancing replication fork to keep sister chromatids together. By visualizing single replication forks colliding with preloaded cohesin complexes, we find that the replisome instead pushes cohesin to where a converging replisome is met. Whereas the converging replisomes are removed during DNA replication termination, cohesin remains on nascent DNA and provides cohesion. Additionally, we show that CMG (CDC45\u2013MCM2-7\u2013GINS)  helicase disassembly during replication termination is vital for proper cohesion in budding yeast. Together, our results support a model wherein sister chromatid cohesion is established during DNA replication termination.",

    "abstract": "In polyolefins, long-chain branching is introduced through an energy-intensive, high-pressure radical process to form low-density polyethylene (LDPE). In the current work, we demonstrated a ladder-like polyethylene architecture through solution polymerization of ethylene and less than 1 mole % of \u03b1,\u03c9-dienes, using a dual-chain catalyst. The ladder-branching mechanism requires catalysts with two growing polymer chains on the same metal center, thus enchaining the diene without the requirement of a steady-state concentration of pendant vinyl groups. Molecular weight distributions lacking a high\u2013molecular weight tail, distinctive Mark-Houwink signatures, nuclear magnetic resonance characterization, and shear and extensional rheology consistent with highly branched polyethylene architectures are described. This approach represents an industrially viable solution-polymerization process capable of producing controlled long-chain branched polyethylene with rheological properties comparable to those of LDPE or its blends with linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).",

    "abstract": "Gasdermins (GSDMs) are pore-forming proteins that execute pyroptosis for immune defense. GSDMs are two-domain proteins activated by proteolytic removal of the inhibitory domain. In this work, we report two types of cleavage-independent GSDM activation. First, Tricho GSDM, a pore-forming domain\u2013only protein from the basal metazoan Trichoplax adhaerens , is a disulfides-linked autoinhibited dimer activated by reduction of the disulfides. The cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure illustrates the assembly mechanism for the 44-mer Tricho GSDM pore. Second, RCD-1-1 and RCD-1-2, encoded by the polymorphic regulator of cell death\u20131 ( rcd-1 ) gene in filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa , are also pore-forming domain\u2013only GSDMs. RCD-1-1 and RCD-1-2, when encountering each other, form pores and cause pyroptosis, underlying allorecognition in Neurospora . The cryo-EM structure reveals a pore of 11 RCD-1-1/RCD-1-2 heterodimers and a heterodimerization-triggered pore assembly mechanism. This study shows mechanistic diversities in GSDM activation and indicates versatile functions of GSDMs.",

By measuring devices with increasing characteristic size, we observed the disappearance of the current vortex and thus verified a prediction of the hydrodynamic model. We further observed that vortex flow is present for both hole- and electron-dominated transport regimes but disappears in the ambipolar regime. We attribute this effect to a reduction of the vorticity diffusion length near charge neutrality. Our work showcases the power of local imaging techniques for unveiling exotic mesoscopic transport phenomena.",

Here, we investigate climate indicators and worldwide dengue incidence from 1990 to 2019 using climate-driven mechanistic models. We identify a distinct indicator, the Indian Ocean basin-wide (IOBW) index, as representing the regional average of sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean. IOBW is closely associated with dengue epidemics for both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The ability of IOBW to predict dengue incidence likely arises as a result of its effect on local temperature anomalies through teleconnections. These findings indicate that the IOBW index can potentially enhance the lead time for dengue forecasts, leading to better-planned and more impactful outbreak responses.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric genome-wide association studies (GWASs), including those for autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, show strong enrichment for regulatory elements in the developing brain. However, prioritizing risk genes and mechanisms is challenging without a unified regulatory atlas. Across 672 diverse developing human brains, we identified 15,752 genes harboring gene, isoform, and/or splicing quantitative trait loci, mapping 3739 to cellular contexts. Gene expression heritability drops during development, likely reflecting both increasing cellular heterogeneity and the intrinsic properties of neuronal maturation. Isoform-level regulation, particularly in the second trimester, mediated the largest proportion of GWAS heritability. Through colocalization, we prioritized mechanisms for about 60% of GWAS loci across five disorders, exceeding adult brain findings. Finally, we contextualized results within gene and isoform coexpression networks, revealing the comprehensive landscape of transcriptome regulation in development and disease.",

To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we determined the atomic structures of human \u03b3-secretase bound individually to APP-C99, A\u03b249, A\u03b246, and A\u03b243. In all cases, the substrate displays the same structural features: a transmembrane \u03b1-helix, a three-residue linker, and a \u03b2-strand that forms a hybrid \u03b2-sheet with presenilin 1 (PS1). Proteolytic cleavage occurs just ahead of the substrate \u03b2-strand. Each cleavage is followed by unwinding and translocation of the substrate \u03b1-helix by one turn and the formation of a new \u03b2-strand. This mechanism is consistent with existing biochemical data and may explain the cleavages of other substrates by \u03b3-secretase.",

Conventional approaches to tailoring thermal emission using metamaterials are hampered both by the limited spatial resolution of the required subwavelength material structures and by the materials\u2019 strong absorption in the infrared. In this work, we demonstrate an approach based on the concept of topology. By changing a single parameter of a multilayer coating, we were able to control the reflection topology of a surface, with the critical point of zero reflection being topologically protected. The boundaries between subcritical and supercritical spatial domains host topological interface states with near-unity thermal emissivity. These topological concepts enable unconventional manipulation of thermal light for applications in thermal management and thermal camouflage.",

Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (iCBT) leads to cytotoxic CD8 + T cell activation and elimination of ptPDAC with restoration of life span even upon PDAC rechallenge. Using PDAC antigen-loaded cDC1s as a vaccine, immunotherapy-resistant PDAC was rendered sensitive to iCBT with elimination of tumors. cDC1 vaccination coupled with iCBT identified specific CDR3 sequences in the tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells with potential therapeutic importance. This study identifies a fundamental difference in the immune microenvironment in PDAC concurrent with, or without, pancreatitis and provides a rationale for combining cDC1 vaccination with iCBT as a potential treatment option.",

Despite the wealth of chiro-optical studies on these materials, their charge-to-spin conversion efficiency is unknown. We demonstrate highly efficient electrically driven charge-to-spin conversion in enantiopure chiral perovskites (R/S-MB) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 (\u2329 n \u232a = 4), where MB is 2-methylbutylamine, MA is methylamine, Pb is lead, and I is iodine. Using scanning photovoltage microscopy, we measured a spin Hall angle \u03b8 sh of 5% and a spin lifetime of ~75 picoseconds at room temperature in \u2329 n \u232a = 4 chiral perovskites, which is much larger than its racemic counterpart as well as the lower \u2329 n \u232a homologs. In addition to current-induced transverse spin current, the presence of a coexisting out-of-plane spin current confirms that both conventional and collinear spin Hall conductivities exist in these low-dimensional crystals.",

    "abstract": "Effective fisheries management requires accurate estimates of stock biomass and trends; yet, assumptions in stock assessment models generate high levels of uncertainty and error. For 230 fisheries worldwide, we contrasted stock biomass estimates at the time of assessment with updated hindcast estimates modeled for the same year in later assessments to evaluate systematic over- or underestimation. For stocks that were overfished, low value, or located in regions with rising temperatures, historical biomass estimates were generally overstated compared with updated assessments. Moreover, rising trends reported for overfished stocks were often inaccurate. With consideration of bias identified retrospectively, 85% more stocks than currently recognized have likely collapsed below 10% of maximum historical biomass. The high uncertainty and bias in modeled stock estimates warrants much greater precaution by managers.",

    "abstract": "Kinases are critical regulators of cellular function that are commonly implicated in the mechanisms underlying disease. Most drugs that target kinases are molecules that inhibit their catalytic activity, but here we used chemically induced proximity to convert kinase inhibitors into activators of therapeutic genes. We synthesized bivalent molecules that link ligands of the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These molecules relocalized CDK9 to BCL6-bound DNA and directed phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. The resulting expression of pro-apoptotic, BCL6-target genes caused killing of diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells and specific ablation of the BCL6-regulated germinal center response. Genomics and proteomics corroborated a gain-of-function mechanism in which global kinase activity was not inhibited but rather redirected. Thus, kinase inhibitors can be used to context-specifically activate transcription.",

We annealed nanometer-thick gold (Au) nanoparticles between two substrates of exfoliated hexagonal molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) with varying orientation of their basal planes with a mutual twist angle ranging from 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that Au aligns midway between the top and bottom MoS 2 when the twist angle of the bilayer is small (<~7\u00b0). For larger twist angles, Au has only a small misorientation with the bottom MoS 2 that varies approximately sinusoidally with twist angle of the bilayer MoS 2 . Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis further reveals a periodic strain variation (<|\u00b10.5%|) in the Au nanodisks associated with the twisted epitaxy, consistent with the Moir\u00e9 registry of the two MoS 2 twisted layers.",

We also report that once-daily oral ODV treatment of cynomolgus monkeys for 10 days beginning 24 hours after SUDV exposure confers 100% protection against lethal infection.

Sister replication forks progress bidirectionally, and replication terminates when two convergent forks encounter one another. To investigate the coordination of replication forks, we developed a replication-associated in situ HiC method to capture chromatin interactions involving nascent DNA. We identify more than 2000 fountain-like structures of chromatin contacts in human and mouse genomes, indicative of coupling of DNA replication forks. Replication fork interaction not only occurs between sister forks but also involves forks from two distinct origins to predetermine replication termination. Termination-associated chromatin fountains are sensitive to replication stress and lead to coupled forks\u2013associated genomic deletions in cancers. These findings reveal the spatial organization of DNA replication forks within the chromatin context.",

We leveraged 10 years of data collected on rhesus macaques before and after a category 4 hurricane caused persistent deforestation, exacerbating monkeys\u2019 exposure to intense heat. In response, macaques demonstrated persistently increased tolerance and decreased aggression toward other monkeys, facilitating access to scarce shade critical for thermoregulation.

We integrated the metabolism of the crotonyl-CoA/ethyl-malonyl-CoA/hydroxybutyryl-CoA cycle with cell-free protein synthesis using recombinant elements. Our network produces the amino acid glycine from CO 2 and incorporates it into target proteins following DNA-encoded instructions. By orchestrating ~50 enzymes we established a basic cell-free operating system in which genetically encoded inputs into a metabolic network are programmed to activate feedback loops allowing for self-integration and (partial) self-regeneration of the complete system.",

By contrast, de novo protein design can in principle create an unlimited number of new nanopores with any desired properties. Here we describe a general approach to designing transmembrane \u03b2-barrel pores with different diameters and pore geometries. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic characterization show that the designs are stably folded with structures resembling those of the design models. The designs have distinct conductances that correlate with their pore diameter, ranging from 110 picosiemens (~0.5 nanometer pore diameter) to 430 picosiemens (~1.1 nanometer pore diameter). Our approach opens the door to the custom design of transmembrane nanopores for sensing and sequencing applications.",

Although the drying influence of global warming is well established, the role of existing drylands in their own expansion is relatively unknown. In this work, by tracking the air flowing over drylands, we show that the warming and drying of that air contributes to dryland expansion in the downwind direction. As they dry, drylands contribute less moisture and more heat to downwind humid regions, reducing precipitation and increasing atmospheric water demand, which ultimately causes their aridification. In ~40% of the land area that recently transitioned from a humid region into a dryland, self-expansion accounted for >50% of the observed aridification. Our results corroborate the urgent need for climate change mitigation measures in drylands to decelerate their own expansion.",

We then combined >35 billion positions from 176,000 ships to produce a global estimate of whale-ship collision risk. Shipping occurs across 92% of whale ranges, and <7% of risk hotspots contain management strategies to reduce collisions.

In mice navigating a linear track, we observed location-specific eCB signaling in hippocampal CA1 place cells, and this was detected both in the postsynaptic membrane and the presynaptic inhibitory axons. All-optical in vivo investigation of synaptic responses revealed that postsynaptic depolarization was followed by a suppression of inhibitory synaptic potentials. Furthermore, interneuron-specific cannabinoid receptor deletion altered place cell tuning. Therefore, rapid, postsynaptic, activity-dependent eCB signaling modulates inhibitory synapses on a timescale of seconds during behavior.",

Using the hormone-like function of volatile terpenoids in reproductive organ development as a system with a visual marker for communication, we demonstrate that a petunia karrikin-insensitive receptor, PhKAI2ia, stereospecifically perceives the (\u2212)-germacrene D signal, triggering a KAI2-mediated signaling cascade and affecting plant fitness. This study uncovers the role(s) of the intermediate clade of KAI2 receptors, illuminates the involvement of a KAI2ia-dependent signaling pathway in volatile communication, and provides new insights into plant olfaction and the long-standing question about the nature of potential endogenous KAI2 ligand(s).",

    "abstract": "Despite an increasingly detailed picture of the molecular mechanisms of bacteriophage (phage)\u2013bacterial interactions, we lack an understanding of how these interactions evolve and impact disease within patients. In this work, we report a year-long, nationwide study of diarrheal disease patients in Bangladesh. Among cholera patients, we quantified Vibrio cholerae (prey) and its virulent phages (predators) using metagenomics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction while accounting for antibiotic exposure using quantitative mass spectrometry. Virulent phage (ICP1) and antibiotics suppressed V. cholerae to varying degrees and were inversely associated with severe dehydration depending on resistance mechanisms. In the absence of antiphage defenses, predation was \u201ceffective,\u201d with a high predator:prey ratio that correlated with increased genetic diversity among the prey. In the presence of antiphage defenses, predation was \u201cineffective,\u201d with a lower predator:prey ratio that correlated with increased genetic diversity among the predators. Phage-bacteria coevolution within patients should therefore be considered in the deployment of phage-based therapies and diagnostics.",

However, whether noise sound waves are intrinsically harmful for developing young\u2014or merely disturb parents\u2014and the fitness consequences of early exposure remain unknown. Here, by only manipulating the offspring, we show that sole exposure to noise in early life in zebra finches has fitness consequences and causes embryonic death during exposure. Exposure to pre- and postnatal traffic noise cumulatively impaired nestling growth and physiology and aggravated telomere shortening across life stages until adulthood. Consistent with a long-term somatic impact, early life noise exposure, especially prenatally, decreased individual offspring production throughout adulthood. Our findings suggest that the effects of noise pollution are more pervasive than previously realized.",

    "abstract": "After infection of B cells, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) engages host pathways that mediate cell proliferation and transformation, contributing to the propensity of the virus to drive immune dysregulation and lymphomagenesis. We found that the EBV protein EBNA2 initiates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo biosynthesis by driving expression of the metabolic enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in infected B cells. Virus-enforced NAD production sustained mitochondrial complex I activity, to match adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production with bioenergetic requirements of proliferation and transformation. In transplant patients, IDO1 expression in EBV-infected B cells, and a serum signature of increased IDO1 activity, preceded development of lymphoma. In humanized mice infected with EBV, IDO1 inhibition reduced both viremia and lymphomagenesis. Virus-orchestrated NAD biosynthesis is therefore a druggable metabolic vulnerability of EBV-driven B cell transformation, opening therapeutic possibilities for EBV-related diseases.",

In this study, we used cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the mechanistic basis for plasmid defense by DdmDE. The helicase-nuclease DdmD adopts an autoinhibited dimeric architecture. The prokaryotic Argonaute protein DdmE uses a DNA guide to target plasmid DNA. The structure of the DdmDE complex, validated by in vivo mutational studies, shows that DNA binding by DdmE triggers disassembly of the DdmD dimer and loading of monomeric DdmD onto the nontarget DNA strand. In vitro studies indicate that DdmD translocates in the 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 direction, while partially degrading the plasmid DNA. These findings provide critical insights into the mechanism of DdmDE systems in plasmid elimination.",

Previously unknown anatomy includes a soft-tissue labrum attached to the hypostome, a slit-like mouth, and distinctive cephalic feeding appendages. Our findings resolve controversy over whether the trilobite hypostome is the labrum or incorporates it and establish crown-group euarthropod homologies in trilobites.

We found that a neuron\u2019s eligibility to be recruited into the memory trace depends on its epigenetic state prior to encoding. Principal neurons in the mouse lateral amygdala display intrinsic chromatin plasticity, which when experimentally elevated favors neuronal allocation into the encoding ensemble. Such chromatin plasticity occurred at genomic regions underlying synaptic plasticity and was accompanied by increased neuronal excitability in single neurons in real time. Lastly, optogenetic silencing of the epigenetically altered neurons prevented memory expression, revealing a cell-autonomous relationship between chromatin plasticity and memory trace formation. These results identify the epigenetic state of a neuron as a key factor enabling information encoding.",

Programmed template jumping on the ncRNA generates a concatemeric cDNA, which becomes double-stranded upon viral infection. This DNA product constitutes a protein-coding, nearly endless open reading frame ( neo ) gene whose expression leads to potent cell growth arrest, restricting the viral infection.

We introduce upgraded orthogonal DNA replication (OrthoRep) systems that radically accelerate the evolution of chosen genes under selection in yeast. When applied to a maladapted biosynthetic enzyme, we obtained collections of extensively diverged sequences with patterns that revealed structural and environmental constraints shaping the enzyme\u2019s activity.

One feature thereof is the hyperutilization of codons that lack genome-encoded Watson-Crick transfer RNAs (tRNAs), instead relying on the posttranscriptional tRNA modification inosine (I34), which expands the decoding capacity of specific tRNAs through wobbling. Antibody-secreting cells had increased I34 levels and were more reliant on I34 for protein production than na\u00efve B cells.

    "abstract": "Mutual neutralization of hydronium (H 3 O + ) and hydroxide (OH \u2212 ) ions is a very fundamental chemical reaction. Yet, there is only limited experimental evidence about the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, we report three-dimensional imaging of coincident neutral products of mutual-neutralization reactions at low collision energies of cold and isolated ions in the cryogenic double electrostatic ion-beam storage ring (DESIREE). We identified predominant H 2 O + OH + H and 2OH + H 2 product channels and attributed them to an electron-transfer mechanism, whereas a minor contribution of H 2 O + H 2 O with high internal excitation was attributed to proton transfer. The reported mechanism-resolved internal product excitation, as well as collision-energy and initial ion-temperature dependence, provide a benchmark for modeling charge-transfer mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Touch perception is enabled by mechanically activated ion channels, the opening of which excites cutaneous sensory endings to initiate sensation. In this study, we identify ELKIN1 as an ion channel likely gated by mechanical force, necessary for normal touch sensitivity in mice. Touch insensitivity in Elkin1 \u2212/\u2212 mice was caused by a loss of mechanically activated currents (MA currents) in around half of all sensory neurons activated by light touch (low-threshold mechanoreceptors). Reintroduction of Elkin1 into sensory neurons from Elkin1 \u2212/\u2212 mice restored MA currents. Additionally, small interfering RNA\u2013mediated knockdown of ELKIN1 from induced human sensory neurons substantially reduced indentation-induced MA currents, supporting a conserved role for ELKIN1 in human touch. Our data identify ELKIN1 as a core component of touch transduction in mice and potentially in humans.",

Here, we show that in the DRT2 defense system, the reverse transcriptase binds a neighboring pseudoknotted noncoding RNA. Upon bacteriophage infection, a template region of this RNA is reverse transcribed into an array of tandem repeats that reconstitute a promoter and open reading frame, allowing expression of a toxic repetitive protein and an abortive infection response. Biochemical reconstitution of this activity and cryo\u2013electron microscopy provide a molecular basis for repeat synthesis. Gene synthesis from a noncoding RNA is a previously unknown mode of genetic regulation in prokaryotes.",

We show that, in the presence of antibiotics, MRSA adopts an alternative mode of cell division and shows an altered peptidoglycan architecture at the division septum. PBP2a can replace the transpeptidase activity of the endogenous and essential PBP2 but not that of PBP1, which is responsible for the distinctive native septal peptidoglycan architecture. Successful division without PBP1 activity requires the alternative division mode and is enabled by several possible chromosomal potentiator ( pot ) mutations. MRSA resensitizing agents differentially interfere with the two codependent mechanisms required for high-level antibiotic resistance, which provides opportunities for new interventions.",

We hypothesized that free diffusion from random noise could generate shape-matched binders for challenging targets and tested this approach on TNFR1. We obtain designs with low picomolar affinity whose specificity can be completely switched to other family members using partial diffusion. Designs function as antagonists or as superagonists when presented at higher valency for OX40 and 4-1BB. The ability to design high-affinity and high-specificity antagonists and agonists for pharmacologically important targets in silico presages a coming era in protein design in which binders are made by computation rather than immunization or random screening approaches.",

However, new aircraft-based measurements revealed total gas-phase organic carbon emissions that exceed oil sands industry\u2013reported values by 1900% to over 6300%, the bulk of which was due to unaccounted-for intermediate-volatility and semivolatile organic compounds. Measured facility-wide emissions represented approximately 1% of extracted petroleum, resulting in total organic carbon emissions equivalent to that from all other sources across Canada combined. These real-world observations demonstrate total organic carbon measurements as a means of detecting unknown or underreported carbon emissions regardless of chemical features. Because reporting gaps may include hazardous, reactive, or secondary air pollutants, fully constraining the impact of anthropogenic emissions necessitates routine, comprehensive total organic carbon monitoring as an inherent check on mass closure.",

In this work, we report high-yielding and selective prebiotic syntheses of pantetheine in water. Chemoselective multicomponent aldol, iminolactone, and aminonitrile reactions delivered spontaneous differentiation of pantoic acid and proteinogenic amino acid syntheses, as well as the dihydroxyl, gem-dimethyl, and \u03b2-alanine-amide moieties of pantetheine in dilute water. Our results are consistent with a role for canonical pantetheine at the outset of life on Earth.",

Using data from 19 sites across 22 degrees of longitude along the tree line of northern Alaska, we show a stronger temporal correlation of tree ring growth with open water uncovered by retreating Arctic sea ice than with air temperature. Spatially, our results suggest that tree growth, recruitment, and range expansion are causally linked to open water through associated warmer temperatures, deeper snowpacks, and improved nutrient availability. We apply a meta-analysis to 82 circumarctic sites, finding that proportionally more tree lines have advanced where proximal to ongoing sea ice loss. Taken together, these findings underpin how and where changing sea ice conditions facilitate high-latitude forest advance.",

However, the synthesis and utilization of all-organic perovskites in 2D form remain largely unexplored because the design principle has not been developed. We present the successful synthesis of a metal-free 2D layered perovskite, denoted as the Choi-Loh van der Waals phase (CL-v phase), with the chemical formula A 2 B 2 X 4 , where A represents a larger-sized cation compared to B and X denotes an anion. The CL-v phase exhibits a van der Waals gap enabled by interlayer hydrogen bonding and can be exfoliated or grown as molecularly thin 2D organic crystals. The dielectric constants of the CL-v phase range from 4.8 to 5.5 and we demonstrate their potential as gate dielectrics for thin-film transistors.",

We report the observation that a thin fluid film of oil separating two water droplets can lead to an adhesive interaction between the droplets. Moreover, this interaction prevents their coalescence over timescales of several weeks, without the use of any surfactant or solvent.",

Using cryo\u2013electron microscopy, we solved the structure of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase bound to a negatively supercoiled minicircle DNA. We show how DNA gyrase captures a DNA crossover, revealing both conserved molecular grooves that accommodate the DNA helices. Together with molecular tweezer experiments, the structure shows that the DNA crossover is of positive chirality, reconciling the binding step of gyrase-mediated DNA relaxation and supercoiling in a single structure.",

Because of the favorable reactivity that often cannot be achieved with other aryl(pseudo)halides, diazonium chemistry continues to grow. Facile extrusion of dinitrogen contributes to the desired reactivity but is also reason for safety concerns. Explosions have occurred since the discovery of these reagents and still result in accidents. In this study, we report a diazonium chemistry paradigm shift based on nitrate reduction using thiosulfate or dihalocuprates as electron donors that avoids diazonium accumulation. Because nitrate reduction is rate-limiting, aryldiazoniums are produced as fleeting intermediates, which results in a safer and often more efficient deaminative halogenation in a single step from anilines.",

We demonstrate this technique by creating a bilayer of dysprosium atoms and observing dipolar interactions between two physically separated layers through interlayer sympathetic cooling and coupled collective excitations. At 50-nm distance, dipolar interactions are 1000 times stronger than at 500 nm. For two atoms in optical tweezers, this should enable purely magnetic dipolar gates with kilohertz speed.",

    "abstract": "The aza Patern\u00f2\u2013B\u00fcchi reaction is a [2+2]-cycloaddition reaction between imines and alkenes that produces azetidines, four-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Currently, successful examples rely primarily on either intramolecular variants or cyclic imine equivalents. To unlock the full synthetic potential of aza Patern\u00f2\u2013B\u00fcchi reactions, it is essential to extend the reaction to acyclic imine equivalents. Here, we report that matching of the frontier molecular orbital energies of alkenes with those of acyclic oximes enables visible light\u2013mediated aza Patern\u00f2\u2013B\u00fcchi reactions through triplet energy transfer catalysis. The utility of this reaction is further showcased in the synthesis of epi- penaresidin B. Density functional theory computations reveal that a competition between the desired [2+2]-cycloaddition and alkene dimerization determines the success of the reaction. Frontier orbital energy matching between the reactive components lowers transition-state energy (\u0394 G \u01c2 ) values and ultimately promotes reactivity.",

We simultaneously measured spontaneous retinal waves and the activity of individual retinocollicular axons and tracked morphological changes in axonal arbors across hours in vivo in neonatal mice. We demonstrate that the correlation of an axon branch\u2019s activity with neighboring axons or postsynaptic neurons predicts whether the branch will be added, stabilized, or eliminated. Desynchronizing individual axons from their local networks, changing the pattern of correlated activity, or blocking N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors all significantly altered single-axon morphology. These observations provide the first direct evidence in vivo that endogenous patterns of correlated neuronal activity instruct fine-scale refinement of axonal processes.",

We show that predator-prey contact can be established by gliding motility or extracellular assemblages we call \u201cgrappling hooks.\u201d Cryo\u2013electron microscopy identified the grappling hooks as heptamers of a type IX secretion system substrate. After close predator-prey contact is established, cryo\u2013electron tomography and functional assays showed that puncturing by a type VI secretion system mediated killing. Single-cell analyses with stable isotope\u2013labeled prey revealed that prey components are taken up by the attacker. Depending on nutrient availability, insertion sequence elements toggle the activity of ixotrophy. A marine metagenomic time series shows coupled dynamics of ixotrophic bacteria and prey. We found that the mechanism of ixotrophy involves multiple cellular machineries, is conserved, and may shape microbial populations in the environment.",

Using tailored experiments on titanium oxide thin films of various thicknesses, we demonstrate the simultaneous occurrence of both processes. For the interpretation of the entire storage profile encompassing both contributions, the (free) energies of the charge carriers in the mixed conductor and the neighboring phase are the only materials parameters required. The experimental results enable no less than a unification of insertion and supercapacitive storage, the first being dominant for thick films, the latter for thin films or negligible electronic conductivity. Therefore, the size of the storage medium and the nature of the current collecting phases can be used to tune power density versus energy density.",

Solute segregation triggering phase transitions at GBs has been suggested theoretically to offer different pathways to design interfaces, but an understanding of their intrinsic atomistic nature is missing. We combined atomic resolution electron microscopy and atomistic simulations to discover that iron segregation to GBs in titanium stabilizes icosahedral units (\u201ccages\u201d) that form robust building blocks of distinct GB phases. Owing to their five-fold symmetry, the iron cages cluster and assemble into hierarchical GB phases characterized by a different number and arrangement of the constituent icosahedral units. Our advanced GB structure prediction algorithms and atomistic simulations validate the stability of these observed phases and the high excess of iron at the GB that is accommodated by the phase transitions.",

We report that Arabidopsis Decapping 5 (DCP5) functions as a multifunctional cytoplasmic osmosensor that senses and responds to extracellular hyperosmolarity. DCP5 harbors a plant-specific intramolecular crowding sensor (ICS) that undergoes conformational change and drives phase separation in response to osmotically intensified molecular crowding. Upon hyperosmolarity exposure, DCP5 rapidly and reversibly assembles to DCP5-enriched osmotic stress granules (DOSGs), which sequestrate plenty of mRNA and regulatory proteins, and thus adaptively reprograms both the translatome and transcriptome to facilitate plant osmotic stress adaptation. Our findings uncover a cytoplasmic osmosensing mechanism mediated by DCP5 with plant-specific molecular crowding sensitivity and suggest a stress sensory function for hyperosmotically induced stress granules.",

Hepatic branch vagotomy also prevents food intake disruptions induced by high-fat diet feeding and reduces body weight gain. Our findings reveal a homeostatic feedback signal that relies on communication between the liver and the brain to control circadian food intake patterns.

TIR domains across different kingdoms have NADase activities and can produce phosphoribosyl adenosine monophosphate/diphosphate (pRib-AMP/ADP) or cyclic ADPR (cADPR) isomers. The lipase-like proteins EDS1 and PAD4 transduce immune signals from sensor TIR-NLRs to a helper NLR called ADR1, which executes immune function. We report the structure and function of an Arabidopsis EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 (EPA) heterotrimer in complex with pRib-AMP/ADP activated by plant or bacterial TIR signaling. 2\u2032cADPR can be hydrolyzed into pRib-AMP and thus activate EPA signaling. Bacterial TIR domains producing 2\u2032cADPR also activate EPA function. Our findings suggest that 2\u2032cADPR may be the storage form of the unstable signaling molecule pRib-AMP.",

Specifically, a copper catalyst preferentially oxidizes secondary amines to radical species, whereas a cobalt catalyst carbonylates primary amines to produce cobalt amides. Coupling these fragments by cooperative catalysis produces unsymmetrical ureas with high selectivity, as showcased by the modification of 41 biologically active compounds and six drugs.",

The results revealed two dissociation pathways: One proceeds through the MEP to produce vibrationally colder O 2 (a 1 \u0394 g ) and the other yields vibrationally hotter O 2 (a 1 \u0394 g ) by means of a roaming pathway involving an intramolecular O abstraction during reorientation motion. Such roaming dynamics may well be the rule rather than the exception for molecular photodissociation through highly excited states.",

Fine-mapping implicated amino acid heterozygosity in the HLA -II peptide binding groove in reduced lung cancer risk, and single-cell analyses showed that smoking drives enrichment of proinflammatory lung macrophages and HLA -II+ epithelial cells. In lung cancer, widespread loss of HLA -II heterozygosity (LOH) favored loss of alleles with larger neopeptide repertoires.

    "abstract": "Vocal production learning (\u201cvocal learning\u201d) is a convergently evolved trait in vertebrates. To identify brain genomic elements associated with mammalian vocal learning, we integrated genomic, anatomical, and neurophysiological data from the Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) with analyses of the genomes of 215 placental mammals. First, we identified a set of proteins evolving more slowly in vocal learners. Then, we discovered a vocal motor cortical region in the Egyptian fruit bat, an emergent vocal learner, and leveraged that knowledge to identify active cis-regulatory elements in the motor cortex of vocal learners. Machine learning methods applied to motor cortex open chromatin revealed 50 enhancers robustly associated with vocal learning whose activity tended to be lower in vocal learners. Our research implicates convergent losses of motor cortex regulatory elements in mammalian vocal learning evolution.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which prophage proteins interact with eukaryotic macromolecules is largely unknown. In this work, we show that cytoplasmic incompatibility factor A (CifA) and B (CifB) proteins, encoded by prophage WO of the endosymbiont Wolbachia, alter long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and DNA during Drosophila sperm development to establish a paternal-effect embryonic lethality known as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CifA is a ribonuclease (RNase) that depletes a spermatocyte lncRNA important for the histone-to-protamine transition of spermiogenesis. Both CifA and CifB are deoxyribonucleases (DNases) that elevate DNA damage in late spermiogenesis. lncRNA knockdown enhances CI, and mutagenesis links lncRNA depletion and subsequent sperm chromatin integrity changes to embryonic DNA damage and CI. Hence, prophage proteins interact with eukaryotic macromolecules during gametogenesis to create a symbiosis that is fundamental to insect evolution and vector control.",

However, these modes cannot be reconfigured after fabrication because they are fixed by the resonator\u2019s physical geometry. In this work, we propose a Moir\u00e9 speedup dispersion tuning method that enables a microresonator device to operate in any of three modes. Electrical tuning of Vernier coupled rings switches operating modality to Brillouin laser, bright microcomb, and dark microcomb operation on demand using the same hybrid-integrated device. Brillouin phase matching and microcomb operation across the telecom C-band is demonstrated. Likewise, by using a single-pump wavelength, the operating mode can be switched. As a result, one universal design can be applied across a range of applications. The device brings flexible mixed-mode operation to integrated photonic circuits.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a heater organ that expresses thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) to maintain high body temperatures during cold stress. BAT thermogenesis is considered an overarching mammalian trait, but its evolutionary origin is unknown. We show that adipose tissue of marsupials, which diverged from eutherian mammals ~ 150 million years ago, expresses a nonthermogenic UCP1 variant governed by a partial transcriptomic BAT signature similar to that found in eutherian beige adipose tissue. We found that the reconstructed UCP1 sequence of the common eutherian ancestor displayed typical thermogenic activity, whereas therian ancestor UCP1 is nonthermogenic. Thus, mammalian adipose tissue thermogenesis may have evolved in two distinct stages, with a prethermogenic stage in the common therian ancestor linking UCP1 expression to adipose tissue and thermal stress. We propose that in a second stage, UCP1 acquired its thermogenic function specifically in eutherians, such that the onset of mammalian BAT thermogenesis occurred only after the divergence from marsupials.",

In this work, we directly imaged the atomic structure and transport of two-dimensional water islands on graphene and hexagonal boron nitride surfaces using qPlus-based atomic force microscopy. The lattice of the water island was incommensurate with the graphene surface but commensurate with the boron nitride surface owing to different surface electrostatics. The area-normalized static friction on the graphene diminished as the island area was increased by a power of ~\u20130.58, suggesting superlubricity behavior. By contrast, the friction on the boron nitride appeared insensitive to the area. Molecular dynamic simulations further showed that the friction coefficient of the water islands on the graphene could reduce to <0.01.",

In this study, we report on a register that uses both optical tweezers and optical lattices to deterministically assemble a two-dimensional array of atoms in an optical cavity. Harnessing a single atom\u2013addressing beam, we stimulate the emission of a photon from each atom and demonstrate multiplexed atom-photon entanglement with a generation-to-detection efficiency approaching 90%.

As atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide doubled from about 410 to about 860 ppm (parts per million) in the latest Permian, the meridional overturning circulation collapsed, the Hadley cell contracted, and El Ni\u00f1os intensified. The resultant deforestation, reef demise, and plankton crisis marked the start of a cascading environmental disaster. Reduced carbon sequestration initiated positive feedback, producing a warmer hothouse and, consequently, stronger El Ni\u00f1os. The compounding effects of elevated climate variability and mean state warming led to catastrophic but diachronous terrestrial and marine losses.",

In this work, we disclose a facile oxidative addition and decarbonylation sequence that forms monoalkylnickel(II) intermediates through a nonradical process. The key ligand, bis(4-methylpyrazole)pyridine, accelerates decarbonylation, stabilizes the alkylnickel(II) intermediate, and destabilizes off-cycle nickel(0) carbonyl species.

However, evolutionary analyses are hampered by the absence of accurate, sequence-resolved haplotype variation maps. We identified 30 structurally distinct haplotypes at nucleotide resolution among 98 present-day humans, revealing that the coding sequences of AMY1 copies are evolving under negative selection. Genomic analyses of these haplotypes in archaic hominins and ancient human genomes suggest that a common three-copy haplotype, dating as far back as 800,000 years ago, has seeded rapidly evolving rearrangements through recurrent nonallelic homologous recombination. Additionally, haplotypes with more than three AMY1 copies have significantly increased in frequency among European farmers over the past 4000 years, potentially as an adaptive response to increased starch digestion.",

Extinction risk is higher in countries with large human coastal populations but lower in nations with stronger governance, larger economies, and greater beneficial fisheries subsidies. Restricting fishing (including incidental catch) and trade to sustainable levels combined with prohibiting retention of highly threatened species can avert further depletion, widespread loss of population connectivity, and top-down predator control.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomeres at natural chromosome ends, should be repressed at double-strand breaks (DSBs), where neotelomere formation can cause terminal truncations. We developed an assay to detect neotelomere formation at Cas9- or I-SceI\u2013induced DSBs in human cells. Telomerase added telomeric repeats to DSBs, leading to interstitial telomeric repeat insertions or the formation of functional neotelomeres accompanied by terminal deletions. The threat that telomerase poses to genome integrity was minimized by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase signaling, which inhibited telomerase at resected DSBs. In addition to acting at resected DSBs, telomerase used the extruded strand in the Cas9 enzyme-product complex as a primer for neotelomere formation. We propose that although neotelomere formation is detrimental in normal human cells, it may allow cancer cells to escape from breakage-fusion-bridge cycles.",

The assumption that this process is the result of an inverse cascade was suggested half a century ago in two-dimensional fluids, but its applicability to atmospheric and oceanic flows remains heavily debated, hampering our understanding of the energy balance in planetary systems. We show using direct numerical simulations with spatial resolutions of 12288 2 \u00d7 384 points that rotating and stratified flows can support a bidirectional cascade of energy, in three dimensions, with a ratio of Rossby to Froude numbers comparable to that of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Our results establish that, in dry atmospheres, spontaneous order can arise through an inverse cascade to the largest spatial scales.",

Understanding how cohesin holds sister DNAs together, and how loss of cohesion causes age-related infertility in females, requires knowledge as to cohesin\u2019s stoichiometry in vivo. Using quantitative super-resolution imaging, we identified two discrete populations of chromatin-bound cohesin in postreplicative human cells. Whereas most complexes appear dimeric, cohesin that localized to sites of sister chromatid cohesion and associated with sororin was exclusively monomeric. The monomeric stoichiometry of sororin:cohesin complexes demonstrates that sister chromatid cohesion is conferred by individual cohesin rings, a key prediction of the proposal that cohesion arises from the co-entrapment of sister DNAs.",

Previous studies have hinted at the existence of a dominant male-sex factor on the V chromosome in brown algae, a group of multicellular eukaryotes distantly related to animals and plants. The nature of this factor has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that an HMG-box gene acts as the male-determining factor in brown algae, mirroring the role HMG-box genes play in sex determination in animals. Over a billion-year evolutionary timeline, these lineages have independently co-opted the HMG box for male determination, representing a paradigm for evolution\u2019s ability to recurrently use the same genetic \u201ctoolkit\u201d to accomplish similar tasks.",

By tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of a pulsed electron wave packet diffracted by a 60-femtosecond (where one femtosecond = 10 \u221215 seconds) standing wave pulse in a pump-probe scheme, we observed time-dependent diffraction patterns. The fringe spacing in the observed pattern differs from that generated by the conventional Kapitza-Dirac effect. By exploiting this time-resolved diffraction scheme, we can access the time evolution of the phase properties of a free electron and potentially image ionic potentials and electronic decoherences.",

In this work, we present high-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of F-actin barbed ends bound by three distinct formins, revealing a common asymmetric formin conformation imposed by the filament. Formation of new intersubunit contacts during actin polymerization sterically displaces formin and triggers its translocation. This \u201cundock-and-lock\u201d mechanism explains how actin-filament growth is coordinated with formin movement. Filament elongation speeds are controlled by the positioning and stability of actin-formin interfaces, which distinguish fast and slow formins. Furthermore, we provide a structure of the actin-formin-profilin ring complex, which resolves how profilin is rapidly released from the barbed end during filament elongation.",

Here, we found that sensory food perception rapidly induced mitochondrial fragmentation in the liver through protein kinase B/AKT (AKT)\u2013dependent phosphorylation of serine 131 of the mitochondrial fission factor (MFFS131). This response was mediated by activation of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)\u2013expressing neurons. A nonphosphorylatable MFF S131G knock-in mutation abrogated AKT-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in vitro. In vivo, MFF S131G knock-in mice displayed altered liver mitochondrial dynamics and impaired insulin-stimulated suppression of hepatic glucose production. Thus, rapid activation of a hypothalamus\u2013liver axis can adapt mitochondrial function to anticipated changes of nutritional state in control of hepatic glucose metabolism.",

CDK4/6 and CDK2 regulate the growth 1 (G 1 ) to synthesis (S) phase transition of the cell cycle by responding to mitogen signaling, promoting E2F transcription and inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex. We found that this mechanism was still required in G 2 -arrested cells to prevent cell cycle exit after the S phase. This mechanism revealed a role for CDK4/6 in maintaining the G 2 state, challenging the notion that the cell cycle is irreversible and that cells do not require mitogens after passing the restriction point. Exit from G 2 occurred during ribotoxic stress and was actively mediated by stress-activated protein kinases. Upon relief of stress, a significant fraction of cells underwent a second round of DNA replication that led to whole-genome doubling.",

One potential origin is the growth of less-massive black holes merging with stars and compact objects within globular clusters (GCs). However, previous simulations have indicated that this process only produces IMBHs under 500 M \u2299 before gravitational wave recoil ejects them from the GC. We performed star-by-star simulations of GC formation, finding that high-density star formation in a GC\u2019s parent giant molecular cloud can produce sufficient mergers of massive stars to overcome that mass threshold. We conclude that GCs can form with IMBHs more than 10 3 M \u2299\u2a00 , which is sufficiently massive to be retained within the GC even with the expected gravitational wave recoil.",

Sequential cleavage of the first and last tether, with washing in between, ensured that the final library comprises only the fully complete compounds.

Here, we identified intact phage and their derived elements in a metapopulation of wild plant\u2013associated Pseudomonas genomes. We discovered that the most abundant viral cluster encodes a phage remnant resembling a phage tail called a tailocin, which bacteria have co-opted to kill bacterial competitors. Each pathogenic Pseudomonas strain carries one of a few distinct tailocin variants that target the variable polysaccharides in the outer membrane of co-occurring pathogenic Pseudomonas strains. Analysis of herbarium samples from the past 170 years revealed that the same tailocin and bacterial receptor variants have persisted in Pseudomonas populations. These results suggest that tailocin genetic diversity can be mined to develop targeted \u201ctailocin cocktails\u201d for microbial control.",

    "abstract": "Heart rate (HR) can be voluntarily regulated when individuals receive real-time feedback. In a rat model of HR biofeedback, the neocortex and medial forebrain bundle were stimulated as feedback and reward, respectively. The rats reduced their HR within 30 minutes, achieving a reduction of approximately 50% after 5 days of 3-hour feedback. The reduced HR persisted for at least 10 days after training while the rats exhibited anxiolytic behavior and an elevation in blood erythrocyte count. This bradycardia was prevented by inactivating anterior cingulate cortical (ACC) neurons projecting to the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VMT). Theta-rhythm stimulation of the ACC-to-VMT pathway replicated the bradycardia. VMT neurons projected to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and DMH neurons projected to the nucleus ambiguus, which innervates parasympathetic neurons in the heart.",

We quantified realized and potential thermal niches of 188 North American tree species to conduct a continental-scale test of the architecture of niches. We found strong and consistent evidence that species occurring at thermal extremes occupy less than three-quarters of their potential niches, and species\u2019 potential niches overlap at a mean annual temperature of ~12\u00b0C. These results clarify the breadth of thermal tolerances of temperate tree species and support the centrifugal organization of thermal niches. Accounting for the nonrealized components of ecological niches will advance theory and prediction in global change ecology.",

    "abstract": "The human mitochondrial genome encodes crucial oxidative phosphorylation system proteins, pivotal for aerobic energy transduction. They are translated from nine monocistronic and two bicistronic transcripts whose native structures remain unexplored, posing a gap in understanding mitochondrial gene expression. In this work, we devised the mitochondrial dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (mitoDMS-MaPseq) method and applied detection of RNA folding ensembles using expectation-maximization (DREEM) clustering to unravel the native mitochondrial messenger RNA (mt-mRNA) structurome in wild-type (WT) and leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat\u2013containing protein (LRPPRC)\u2013deficient cells. Our findings elucidate LRPPRC\u2019s role as a holdase contributing to maintaining mt-mRNA folding and efficient translation. mt-mRNA structural insights in WT mitochondria, coupled with metabolic labeling, unveil potential mRNA-programmed translational pausing and a distinct programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Our data define a critical layer of mitochondrial gene expression regulation. These mt-mRNA folding maps provide a reference for studying mt-mRNA structures in diverse physiological and pathological contexts.",

    "abstract": "The RNA-guided ribonuclease CRISPR-Cas13 enables adaptive immunity in bacteria and programmable RNA manipulation in heterologous systems. Cas13s share limited sequence similarity, hindering discovery of related or ancestral systems. To address this, we developed an automated structural-search pipeline to identify an ancestral clade of Cas13 (Cas13an) and further trace Cas13 origins to defense-associated ribonucleases. Despite being one-third the size of other Cas13s, Cas13an mediates robust programmable RNA depletion and defense against diverse bacteriophages. However, unlike its larger counterparts, Cas13an uses a single active site for both CRISPR RNA processing and RNA-guided cleavage, revealing that the ancestral nuclease domain has two modes of activity. Discovery of Cas13an deepens our understanding of CRISPR-Cas evolution and expands opportunities for precision RNA editing, showcasing the promise of structure-guided genome mining.",

Their polyketide polyether toxins, the prymnesins, are among the largest nonpolymeric compounds in nature and have biosynthetic origins that have remained enigmatic for more than 40 years. In this work, we report the \u201cPKZILLAs,\u201d massive P. parvum polyketide synthase (PKS) genes that have evaded previous detection. PKZILLA-1 and -2 encode giant protein products of 4.7 and 3.2 megadaltons that have 140 and 99 enzyme domains. Their predicted polyene product matches the proposed pre-prymnesin precursor of the 90-carbon\u2013backbone A-type prymnesins. We further characterize the variant PKZILLA-B1, which is responsible for the shorter B-type analog prymnesin-B1, from P. parvum RCC3426 and thus establish a general model of haptophyte polyether biosynthetic logic. This work expands expectations of genetic and enzymatic size limits in biology.",

How this increase in firing rates and synchrony after learning is counterbalanced to preserve network stability is not understood. We discovered a network event generated by an intrahippocampal circuit formed by a subset of CA2 pyramidal cells to cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK+) basket cells, which fire a barrage of action potentials (\u201cBARR\u201d) during non\u2013rapid eye movement sleep. CA1 neurons and assemblies that increased their activity during learning were reactivated during SWRs but inhibited during BARRs. The initial increase in reactivation during SWRs returned to baseline through sleep. This trend was abolished by silencing CCK+ basket cells during BARRs, resulting in higher synchrony of CA1 assemblies and impaired memory consolidation.",

We obtained single-cell spatial transcriptomic atlases of macaque, marmoset, and mouse cerebella and identified primate-specific cell subtypes, including Purkinje cells and molecular-layer interneurons, that show different expression of the glutamate ionotropic receptor Delta type subunit 2 ( GRID2 ) gene. Distinct gene expression profiles were found in anterior, posterior, and vestibular regions in all species, whereas region-selective gene expression was predominantly observed in the granular layer of primates and in the Purkinje layer of mice. Gene expression gradients in the cerebellar cortex matched well with functional connectivity gradients revealed with awake functional magnetic resonance imaging, with more lobule-specific differences between primates and mice than between two primate species. These comprehensive atlases and comparative analyses provide the basis for understanding cerebellar evolution and function.",

We established the merged-net approach, proffering optimal balance between designability and complexity, as a systematic solution for the rational assembly of multicomponent structures. In this work, by methodically mapping node-net relationships among 53 basic edge-transitive nets, we conceived a signature net map to identify merging net pairs, resulting in the enumeration of 53 merged nets. We developed a practical design algorithm and proposed more than 100 multicomponent metal-organic framework platforms. The effectiveness of this approach is commended by the successful synthesis of four classes of materials, which is based on merging three-periodic nets with the four possible net periodicities. The construction of multicomponent materials based on derived nets of merged nets highlights the potential of the merged-net approach in accelerating the discovery of intricate reticular materials.",

We isolated the specific neurons modulated by a psychedelic to determine their role in driving behavior. Using a light- and calcium-dependent activity integrator, we genetically tagged psychedelic-responsive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that the psychedelic drove network-level activation of multiple cell types beyond just those expressing 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors. We labeled psychedelic-responsive mPFC neurons with an excitatory channelrhodopsin to enable their targeted manipulation. We found that reactivation of these cells recapitulated the anxiolytic effects of the psychedelic without driving its hallucinogenic-like effects. These findings reveal essential insight into the cell-type\u2013specific mechanisms underlying psychedelic-induced behavioral states.",

Single-cell analysis revealed that the injury-induced niche is governed by mesenchymal proliferation and Notch signaling, which suppressed Wnt/Fgf signaling in the injured niche. Conversely, loss of Notch signaling rewired alveolar signaling patterns to promote functional regeneration and gas exchange. Signaling patterns in injury-induced niches can differentiate fibrotic from degenerative human lung diseases through altering the direction of Wnt/Fgf signaling.

We used a proximity labeling method (LIPSTIC) to identify APCs that presented dietary antigens under tolerizing and inflammatory conditions and to understand cellular mechanisms by which tolerance to food is induced and can be disrupted by infection. Helminth infections disrupted tolerance induction proportionally to the reduction in the ratio between tolerogenic APCs\u2014including migratory dendritic cells (cDC1s) and Ror\u03b3t + APCs\u2014and inflammatory APCs, which were primarily cDC2s.

Here we report a new construction of fossil eukaryote diversity from the Paleoproterozoic to early Cambrian based on a comprehensive data compilation and quantitative analyses. The resulting taxonomic richness curve verifies Cryogenian glaciations as a major divide that separates the \u201cBoring Billion\u201d and Ediacaran periods, with the former characterized by a prolonged stasis, and the latter by greater diversity, more-rapid turnover, and multiple radiations and extinctions. These contrasting evolutionary patterns and dynamics provide a framework to test competing hypotheses on biosphere and geosphere coevolution in the Proterozoic Eon.",

    "abstract": "An important challenge in enantioselective catalysis is developing strategies for the precise synthesis of neighboring congested all-carbon quaternary stereocenters. The well-defined transition states of [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements and their underlying stereospecificity render them powerful tools for the synthesis of such arrays. However, this type of pericyclic reaction remains notoriously difficult to catalyze, especially in an enantioselective fashion. Herein, we describe an enantioselective reductive Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement catalyzed by chiral 1,3,2-diazaphospholene-hydrides. This developed transformation enables full control of the two newly formed acyclic stereogenic centers, leading to amides with vicinal all-carbon quaternary-tertiary or quaternary-quaternary carbon atoms.",

However, these interactions are difficult to measure, leaving uncertainty about the mechanisms underlying body-size-dependent grazing\u2014and even whether succession occurs at all. We used data from an 8-year camera-trap survey, GPS-collared herbivores, and fecal DNA metabarcoding to analyze the timing, arrival order, and interactions among migratory grazers in Serengeti National Park. Temporal grazing succession is characterized by a \u201cpush-pull\u201d dynamic: Competitive grazing nudges zebra ahead of co-migrating wildebeest, whereas grass consumption by these large-bodied migrants attracts trailing, small-bodied gazelle that benefit from facilitation. \u201cNatural experiments\u201d involving intense wildfires and rainfall respectively disrupted and strengthened these effects. Our results highlight a balance between facilitative and competitive forces in co-regulating large-scale ungulate migrations.",

Theoretical models predict that this FUV radiation produces photodissociation regions (PDRs) on the surfaces of protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, which affects planet formation within the disks. We report James Webb Space Telescope and Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations of a FUV-irradiated protoplanetary disk in the Orion Nebula. Emission lines are detected from the PDR; modeling their kinematics and excitation allowed us to constrain the physical conditions within the gas. We quantified the mass-loss rate induced by the FUV irradiation and found that it is sufficient to remove gas from the disk in less than a million years. This is rapid enough to affect giant planet formation in the disk.",

However, cell-intrinsic predeterminants controlling these single-cell decisions remain enigmatic. We found that the subcellular architectures of na\u00efve CD8 T cells, defined by the presence (T \u00d8 ) or absence (T O ) of nuclear envelope invaginations, changed with maturation, activation, and differentiation. Upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, na\u00efve T \u00d8 cells displayed increased expression of the early-response gene Nr4a1 , dependent upon heightened calcium entry. Subsequently, in vitro differentiation revealed that T \u00d8 cells generated effector-like cells more so compared with T O cells, which proliferated less and preferentially adopted a memory-precursor phenotype. These data suggest that cellular architecture may be a predeterminant of na\u00efve CD8 T cell fate.",

    "abstract": "Plant stems comprise nodes and internodes that specialize in solute exchange and elongation. However, their boundaries are not well defined, and how these basic units arise remains elusive. In rice with clear nodes and internodes, we found that one subclade of class I knotted1-like homeobox ( KNOX1 ) genes for shoot meristem indeterminacy restricts node differentiation and allows internode formation by repressing YABBY genes for leaf development and genes from another node-specific KNOX1 subclade. YABBY s promote nodal vascular differentiation and limit stem elongation. YABBY and node-specific KNOX1 genes specify the pulvinus, which further elaborates the nodal structure for gravitropism. Notably, this KNOX1 subclade organization is specific to seed plants. We propose that nodes and internodes are distinct domains specified by YABBY \u2013 KNOX1 cross-regulation that diverged in early seed plants.",

With the excitation of electron paramagnetic resonance, we established dynamic control of single spins by spin torque using a local electric current. In addition, our work highlights the dissipative action of the spin-transfer torque, in contrast to the nondissipative action of the magnetic field, which allows for the manipulation of individual spins based on controlled decoherence.",

In mitochondria, ATP is produced by a series of redox reactions, whereby an electrochemical gradient is established across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The ATP synthase harnesses the energy of the gradient to generate ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate. We determined the structure of ATP synthase within mitochondria of the unicellular flagellate Polytomella by electron cryo-tomography and subtomogram averaging at up to 4.2-angstrom resolution, revealing six rotary positions of the central stalk, subclassified into 21 substates of the F 1 head. The Polytomella ATP synthase forms helical arrays with multiple adjacent rows defining the cristae ridges. The structure of ATP synthase under native operating conditions in the presence of a membrane potential represents a pivotal step toward the analysis of membrane protein complexes in situ.",

Seeking improved modulators, we docked libraries of 2.7 million and 1.2 billion molecules against the CaSR structure. The billion-molecule docking found PAMs with a 2.7-fold higher hit rate than the million-molecule library, with hits up to 37-fold more potent. Structure-based optimization led to nanomolar leads. In ex vivo organ assays, one of these PAMs was 100-fold more potent than the standard of care, cinacalcet, and reduced serum PTH levels in mice without the hypocalcemia typical of CaSR drugs. As determined from cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures, the PAMs identified here promote CaSR conformations that more closely resemble the activated state than those induced by the established drugs.",

Here we identify a cellulose synthase\u2013like protein, an unexpected biosynthetic component that interacts with the early pathway enzymes, enabling steroidal scaffolds production in plants. Moreover, knockout of this gene in black nightshade, Solanum nigrum , resulted in plants lacking both steroidal alkaloids and saponins. Unexpectedly, these knockout plants also revealed that steroidal saponins deter serious agricultural insect pests. This discovery provides the missing link to engineer these high-value steroidal molecules and also pinpoints the ecological role for steroidal saponins.",

    "abstract": "Tardigrades are captivating organisms known for their resilience in extreme environments, including ultra-high-dose radiation, but the underlying mechanisms of this resilience remain largely unknown. Using genome, transcriptome, and proteome analysis of Hypsibius henanensis sp. nov. , we explored the molecular basis contributing to radiotolerance in this organism. A putatively horizontally transferred gene, DOPA dioxygenase 1 ( DODA1 ), responds to radiation and confers radiotolerance by synthesizing betalains\u2014a type of plant pigment with free radical\u2013scavenging properties. A tardigrade-specific radiation-induced disordered protein, TRID1, facilitates DNA damage repair through a mechanism involving phase separation. Two mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly proteins, BCS1 and NDUFB8, accumulate to accelerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) regeneration for poly(adenosine diphosphate\u2013ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and subsequent poly(adenosine diphosphate\u2013ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)\u2013mediated DNA damage repair. These three observations expand our understanding of mechanisms of tardigrade radiotolerance.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the complex interplay between neuronal activity and mitochondrial function is pivotal in understanding brain aging, a multifaceted process marked by declines in synaptic function and mitochondrial performance. Here, we identified an age-dependent coupling between neuronal and synaptic excitation and mitochondrial DNA transcription (E-TC mito ), which operates differently compared to classic excitation-transcription coupling in the nucleus (E-TC nuc ). We demonstrated that E-TC mito repurposes molecules traditionally associated with E-TC nuc to regulate mitochondrial DNA expression in areas closely linked to synaptic activation. The effectiveness of E-TC mito weakens with age, contributing to age-related neurological deficits in mice. Boosting brain E-TC mito in aged animals ameliorated these impairments, offering a potential target to counteract age-related cognitive decline.",

We combined field experiments, microscopy, chemical analyses, and laser Doppler vibrometry with comparative phylogenetic analyses to show that two carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plant species independently evolved similar adaptations in three distinct traits to acquire a new, composite trapping mechanism. Comparative analyses suggest that this new trait arose convergently through \u201cspontaneous coincidence\u201d of the required trait combination, rather than directional selection in the component traits. Our results indicate a plausible mechanism for composite trait evolution and highlight the importance of stochastic phenotypic variation as a facilitator of evolutionary novelty.",

Anthropogenically enhanced oxidants [ozone (O 3 ) and nitrate radicals (NO 3 )] rapidly degrade floral scents, potentially reducing pollinator attraction to flowers. However, the physiological and behavioral impacts on pollinators and plant fitness are unknown. Using a nocturnal flower-moth system, we found that atmospherically relevant concentrations of NO 3 eliminate flower visitation by moths, and the reaction of NO 3 with a subset of monoterpenes is what reduces the scent\u2019s attractiveness. Global atmospheric models of floral scent oxidation reveal that pollinators in certain urban areas may have a reduced ability to perceive and navigate to flowers. These results illustrate the impact of anthropogenic pollutants on an animal\u2019s olfactory ability and indicate that such pollutants may be critical regulators of global pollination.",

Some NLRs are encoded in tightly linked co-regulated head-to-head genes whose products function together as pairs. We uncover the oligomerization requirements for different Arabidopsis paired CHS3-CSA1 alleles. These pairs form resting-state heterodimers that oligomerize into complexes distinct from NLRs analyzed previously. Oligomerization requires both conserved and allele-specific features of the respective CHS3 and CSA1 Toll-like interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains. The receptor kinases BAK1 and BIRs inhibit CHS3-CSA1 pair oligomerization to maintain the CHS3-CSA1 heterodimer in an inactive state. Our study reveals that paired NLRs hetero-oligomerize and likely form a distinctive \u201cdimer of heterodimers\u201d and that structural heterogeneity is expected even among alleles of closely related paired NLRs.",

The key gene for gramine formation has remained elusive, hampering breeding initiatives. In this work, we report that a gene encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP76M57, which we name AMI synthase (AMIS), enables the production of gramine in Nicotiana benthamiana , Arabidopsis thaliana , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . We reconstituted gramine production in the gramine-free barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) variety Golden Promise and eliminated it from cultivar Tafeno by Cas-mediated gene editing. In vitro experiments unraveled that an unexpected cryptic oxidative rearrangement underlies this noncanonical conversion of an amino acid to a chain-shortened biogenic amine. The discovery of the genetic basis of gramine formation now permits tailor-made optimization of gramine-linked traits in barley by plant breeding.",

Using cryo\u2013electron microscopy, mutagenesis, optical trapping, and Langevin dynamics simulation, we resolved the structure of PP7, T4P, and the PP7/T4P complex and showed that T4P detachment is driven by the affinity between the phage maturation protein and its bound pilin, plus the pilus retraction force and speed, and pilus bending. Pilus detachment may be widespread among other ssRNA phages and their retractile pilus systems and offers new prospects for antibacterial prophylaxis and therapeutics.",

The isotopic composition of Io\u2019s inventory of volatile chemical elements, including sulfur and chlorine, reflects its outgassing and mass-loss history and thus records information about its evolution. We used submillimeter observations of Io\u2019s atmosphere to measure sulfur isotopes in gaseous sulfur dioxide and sulfur monoxide, and chlorine isotopes in gaseous sodium chloride and potassium chloride. We find 34 S/ 32 S = 0.0595 \u00b1 0.0038 (equivalent to \u03b4 34 S = +347 \u00b1 86\u2030), which is highly enriched compared to average Solar System values and indicates that Io has lost 94 to 99% of its available sulfur. Our measurement of 37 Cl/ 35 Cl = 0.403 \u00b1 0.028 (\u03b4 37 Cl = +263 \u00b1 88\u2030) shows that chlorine is similarly enriched.

However, the genetics behind adaptive variation in behavior are poorly understood. In this work, we examined a fundamental and widespread behavioral trait, exploratory behavior, in one of the largest adaptive radiations on Earth, the cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika. By integrating quantitative behavioral data from 57 cichlid species (702 wild-caught individuals) with high-resolution ecomorphological and genomic information, we show that exploratory behavior is linked to macrohabitat niche adaptations in Tanganyikan cichlids. Furthermore, we uncovered a correlation between the genotypes at a single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the AMPA glutamate-receptor regulatory gene cacng5b and variation in exploratory tendency. We validated this association using behavioral predictions with a neural network approach and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.",

We prepared the initial nuclear spins in KRb (potassium-rubidium) in an entangled state by lowering the magnetic field to where the spin-spin interaction dominates and characterized the preserved coherence in nuclear spin wave function after the reaction. We observed an interference pattern that is consistent with full coherence at the end of the reaction, suggesting that entanglement prepared within the reactants could be redistributed through the atom-exchange process.",

The diazoborane displays a strong tendency to release dinitrogen, thus serving as a borylene source, in analogy to organic azides and diazoalkanes serving as nitrene and carbene sources, respectively. Also reminiscent of diazoalkane and organic azide reactivity, the diazoborane serves as a 1,3-dipole that undergoes uncatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition with an unactivated terminal alkyne, affording a five-membered heterocycle after a two-step rearrangement.",

Whereas 5-HT and emotional contagion reduced habenular burst firing, limiting 5-HT synthesis prevented burst plasticity. Enhancing raphe-to-habenula 5-HT was sufficient to recapitulate resilience. In contrast, reducing 5-HT release in the habenula made witnessing a conspecific in distress ineffective to promote the resilient phenotype after adversity. These findings reveal that 5-HT supports vicarious emotions and leads to resilience by tuning definite patterns of habenular neuronal activity.",

Here, we describe computationally guided transition metal\u2013ligand design that positions a hydrogen-bond acceptor anion at the reactive site to promote functionalization. A general cross-coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary aliphatic alcohols with terminal olefins to furnish >130 ethers is achieved. The mild conditions tolerate functionality that is prone to substitution, elimination, and epimerization and achieve site selectivity in polyol settings. Mechanistic studies support the hypothesis that the ligand\u2019s geometry and electronics direct positioning of the phosphate anion at the \u03c0-allyl-palladium terminus, facilitating the phosphate\u2019s hydrogen-bond acceptor role toward the alcohol. Ligand-directed counteranion positioning in cationic transition metal catalysis has the potential to be a general strategy for promoting challenging bimolecular reactivity.",

Recently discovered global epistasis, in which the fitness effects of mutations scale with the fitness of the background genotype, can improve predictions, but how the environment modulates this scaling is unknown. We measured the fitness effects of ~100 insertion mutations in 42 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in six laboratory environments and found that the global epistasis scaling is nearly invariant across environments. Instead, the environment tunes one global parameter, the background fitness at which most mutations switch sign. As a consequence, the distribution of mutational effects is predictable across genotypes and environments. Our results suggest that the effective dimensionality of genotype-to-phenotype maps across environments is surprisingly low.",

Here we describe TDP-REG, which exploits the specificity of cryptic splicing induced by TDP-LOF to drive protein expression when and where the disease process occurs. The SpliceNouveau algorithm combines deep learning with rational design to generate customizable cryptic splicing events within protein-coding sequences. We demonstrate that expression of TDP-REG reporters is tightly coupled to TDP-LOF in vitro and in vivo. TDP-REG enables genomic prime editing to ablate the UNC13A cryptic donor splice site specifically upon TDP-LOF. Finally, we design TDP-REG vectors encoding a TDP-43/Raver1 fusion protein that rescues key pathological cryptic splicing events, paving the way for the development of precision therapies for TDP43-related disorders.",

Yet, other environmental changes may affect the geographical distribution of species in unexpected ways. Here, we quantify multidecadal shifts in the distribution of European forest plants and link these shifts to key drivers of forest biodiversity change: climate change, atmospheric deposition (nitrogen and sulfur), and forest canopy dynamics. Surprisingly, westward distribution shifts were 2.6 times more likely than northward ones. Not climate change, but nitrogen-mediated colonization events, possibly facilitated by the recovery from past acidifying deposition, best explain westward movements. Biodiversity redistribution patterns appear complex and are more likely driven by the interplay among several environmental changes than due to the exclusive effects of climate change alone.",

Here, we characterize a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) from a growth-associated intestinal strain of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii cultured from these children. This enzyme, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, hydrolyzes a variety of N -acylamides, including oleoylethanolamide (OEA), neurotransmitters, and quorum sensing N -acyl homoserine lactones; it also synthesizes a range of N -acylamides, notably N -acyl amino acids. Treating germ-free mice with N -oleoylarginine and N -oleolyhistidine, major products of FAAH OEA metabolism, markedly affected expression of intestinal immune function pathways. Administering MDCF to Bangladeshi children considerably reduced fecal OEA, a satiety factor whose levels were negatively correlated with abundance and expression of their F. prausnitzii FAAH. This enzyme, structurally and catalytically distinct from mammalian FAAH, is positioned to regulate levels of a variety of bioactive molecules.",

Optimization of StitchR activity in mammalian cells resulted in a ~900-fold increase in protein expression that approached levels observed for genes expressed from single vectors.

Slow decoding during translation promotes association of CCR4-NOT with ribosomes, accelerating mRNA degradation. We applied selective ribosome profiling to further investigate the determinants of CCR4-NOT recruitment to ribosomes in mammalian cells. This revealed that specific arginine codons in the P-site are strong signals for ribosomal recruitment of human CNOT3, a CCR4-NOT subunit. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy and transfer RNA (tRNA) mutagenesis demonstrated that the D-arms of select arginine tRNAs interact with CNOT3 and promote its recruitment whereas other tRNA D-arms sterically clash with CNOT3. These effects link codon content to mRNA stability. Thus, in addition to their canonical decoding function, tRNAs directly engage regulatory complexes during translation, a mechanism we term P-site tRNA-mediated mRNA decay.",

In this work, we used single-nuclei transcriptomics to dissect the contributions of sex chromosomes and gonads in demyelination and AD. In a mouse model of demyelination, we identified the roles of sex chromosomes and gonads in modifying microglia and oligodendrocyte responses before and after myelin loss. In an AD-related mouse model expressing APOE4, XY sex chromosomes heightened interferon (IFN) response and tau-induced demyelination. The X-linked gene, Toll-like receptor 7 ( Tlr7 ), regulated sex-specific IFN response to myelin. Deletion of Tlr7 dampened sex differences while protecting against demyelination. Administering TLR7 inhibitor mitigated tau-induced motor impairment and demyelination in male mice, indicating that Tlr7 plays a role in the male-biased type I Interferon IFN response in aging- and AD-related demyelination.",

We show that the ensemble-averaged shifts can be suppressed below the level of evaluated systematic uncertainties for optical atomic clocks. Additionally, we demonstrate that excitation of the atomic dipoles near a Bragg angle can enhance these effects by nearly an order of magnitude compared with nonresonant geometries.

    "abstract": "The idea of guidance toward a target is central to axon pathfinding and brain wiring in general. In this work, we show how several thousand axonal growth cones self-pattern without target-dependent guidance during neural superposition wiring in Drosophila . Ablation of all target lamina neurons or loss of target adhesion prevents the stabilization but not the development of the pattern. Intravital imaging at the spatiotemporal resolution of growth cone dynamics in intact pupae and data-driven dynamics simulations reveal a mechanism by which >30,000 filopodia do not explore potential targets, but instead simultaneously generate and navigate a dynamic filopodial meshwork that steers growth directions. Hence, a guidance mechanism can emerge from the interactions of the axons being guided, suggesting self-organization as a more general feature of brain wiring.",

The life span of nuclear RNAs, which are critical for proper chromatin architecture and transcription regulation, has not been determined in adult tissues. In this work, we identified and characterized nuclear RNAs that do not turn over for at least 2 years in a subset of postnatally born cells in the mouse brain. These long-lived RNAs were stably retained in nuclei in a neural cell type\u2013specific manner and were required for the maintenance of heterochromatin. Thus, the life span of neural cells may depend on both the molecular longevity of DNA for the storage of genetic information and also the extreme stability of RNA for the functional organization of chromatin.",

The timing of that instability is poorly constrained. In this work, we use dynamical simulations to demonstrate that the instability implanted planetesimal fragments from the terrestrial planet region into the asteroid main belt. We use meteorite data to show that the implantation occurred >60 million years (Myr) after the Solar System began to form. Combining this constraint with a previous upper limit derived from Jupiter\u2019s trojan asteroids, we conclude that the orbital instability occurred 60 to 100 Myr after the beginning of Solar System formation. The giant impact that formed the Moon occurred within this range, so it might be related to the giant planet instability.",

However, their functional properties and physiological roles in the healthy lung, trachea, and larynx remain largely unknown. In this work, we show that murine NE cells in these compartments have distinct biophysical properties but share sensitivity to two commonly aspirated noxious stimuli, water and acid. Moreover, we found that tracheal and laryngeal NE cells protect the airways by releasing adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) to activate purinoreceptive sensory neurons that initiate swallowing and expiratory reflexes. Our work uncovers the broad molecular and biophysical diversity of NE cells across the airways and reveals mechanisms by which these specialized excitable cells serve as sentinels for activating protective responses.",

We found that the Arrhenius frequency factor A of the electron diffraction signal decay provides W d through an experimental equation A = A INT W d , where A INT is an inelastic scattering cross section. The method connects Clausius and Boltzmann experimentally and supplements the Clausius approach, being applicable to a femtogram quantity of thermally unstable and biomolecular crystals. The data also showed that crystal disordering and crystallization of melt are reciprocal, both governed by the entropy change but manifesting in opposite directions.",

We discovered a layered cortical cytoskeleton and membrane architecture that enables hyperextensions through the folding and unfolding of cellular-scale origami. Physical models of this curved crease origami display topological singularities, including traveling developable cones and cytoskeletal twisted domain walls, which provide geometric control of hyperextension. Our work unravels how cell geometry encodes behavior in single cells and provides inspiration for geometric control in microrobotics and deployable architectures.",

The control of this crucial up-regulation is poorly understood. Using CRISPR screens in ILCs we identified previously unappreciated myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2d (Mef2d)-mediated regulation of GATA3-dependent type-2 lymphocyte differentiation. Mef2d-deletion from ILC2s and/or T cells specifically protected against an allergen lung challenge. Mef2d repressed Regnase-1 endonuclease expression to enhance IL-33 receptor production and IL-33 signaling and acted downstream of calcium-mediated signaling to translocate NFAT1 to the nucleus to promote type-2 cytokine-mediated immunity.",

In contrast to mitotic cells, the process and mechanism of spindle bipolarization in human oocytes remains unclear. Using high-resolution imaging in more than 1800 human oocytes, we revealed a typical state of multipolar intermediates that form during spindle bipolarization and elucidated the mechanism underlying this process. We found that the minor poles formed in multiple kinetochore clusters contribute to the generation of multipolar intermediates. We further determined the essential roles of HAUS6, KIF11, and KIF18A in spindle bipolarization and identified mutations in these genes in infertile patients characterized by oocyte or embryo defects. These results provide insights into the physiological and pathological mechanisms of spindle bipolarization in human oocytes.",

We found three distinct regimes as a function of doping and interaction strength: a weakly correlated metal, a correlated metal with strong interaction effects, and a pseudogap regime at low doping. We show that the pseudogap forms both at weak coupling, when the magnetic correlation length is large, and at strong coupling, when it is shorter. As the temperature goes to zero, the pseudogap regime extrapolates precisely to the ordered stripe phase found by ground-state methods.",

The mechanism of Pi efflux, activated by inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs), has remained unclear. This study presents cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of XPR1 in multiple conformations, revealing a transmembrane pathway for Pi export and a dual-binding activation pattern for PP-IPs. A canonical binding site is located at the dimeric interface of Syg1/Pho81/XPR1 (SPX) domains, and a second site, biased toward PP-IPs, is found between the transmembrane and SPX domains. By integrating structural studies with electrophysiological analyses, we characterized XPR1 as an inositol phosphates (IPs)/PP-IPs\u2013activated phosphate channel. The interplay among its transmembrane domains, SPX domains, and IPs/PP-IPs orchestrates the conformational transition between its closed and open states.",

We designed probes targeting >2000 gene regions to generate a dated evolutionary tree for 475 fungi and combined it with a similarly generated tree for 276 ants. We found that fungus-ant agriculture originated ~66 million years ago when the end-of-Cretaceous asteroid impact temporarily interrupted photosynthesis, causing global mass extinctions but favoring the proliferation of fungi. Subsequently, ~27 million years ago, one ancestral fungal cultivar population became domesticated, i.e., obligately mutualistic, when seasonally dry habitats expanded in South America, likely isolating the cultivar population from its free-living, wet forest\u2013dwelling conspecifics. By revealing these and other major transitions in fungus-ant coevolution, our results clarify the historical processes that shaped a model system for nonhuman agriculture.",

However, a substantial gap remains in integrating RNA expression data with spatial context across organs, primarily owing to the challenges associated with RNA detection within intact tissue volumes. Here, we developed Tris buffer\u2013mediated retention of in situ hybridization chain reaction signal in cleared organs (TRISCO), an effective tissue-clearing method designed for whole-brain spatial three-dimensional (3D) RNA imaging. TRISCO resolved several crucial issues, including the preservation of RNA integrity, achieving uniform RNA labeling, and enhancing tissue transparency. We tested TRISCO using a broad range of cell-identity markers, noncoding and activity-dependent RNAs, within diverse organs of varying sizes and species. TRISCO thus emerges as a powerful tool for single-cell, whole-brain, 3D imaging that enables comprehensive transcriptional spatial analysis across the entire brain.",

However, most individuals exhibit a more robust response to one of these strains and thus are vulnerable to infection by others. By studying a monozygotic twin cohort, we found that although prior exposure is a factor, host genetics are a stronger driver of subtype bias to influenza viral strains. We found that covalent coupling of heterologous hemagglutinin (HA) from different viral strains could largely eliminate subtype bias in an animal model and in a human tonsil organoid system. We proposed that coupling of heterologous antigens improves antibody responses across influenza strains by broadening T cell help, and we found that using this approach substantially improved the antibody response to avian influenza HA.",

    "abstract": "Expression of Protocadherin (Pcdh) genes is critical to the generation of neuron identity and wiring of the nervous system. Pcdh\u03b1 genes are arranged in clusters and exhibit a range of expression profiles, from stochastic to deterministic. Because Pcdh\u03b1 promoters have high sequence identity and share distal enhancers, how distinct neurons choose which gene to express remains unclear. We show that the interplay between multiple enhancers, epigenetics, and genome folding orchestrates differential readouts of the locus across neurons. The probability of Pcdh\u03b1 promoter choice depends on enhancer/promoter encounters catalyzed by cohesin, whose extrusion trajectories determine the likelihood that an individual promoter can \u201cescape\u201d heterochromatin-mediated silencing. We propose that tunable locus-specific regulatory elements and cell type\u2013specific cohesin activity underlie the generation of cellular diversity by Pcdh genes.",

    "abstract": "Memories are dynamic constructs whose properties change with time and experience. The biological mechanisms underpinning these dynamics remain elusive, particularly concerning how shifts in the composition of memory-encoding neuronal ensembles influence the evolution of a memory over time. By targeting developmentally distinct subpopulations of principal neurons, we discovered that memory encoding resulted in the concurrent establishment of multiple memory traces in the mouse hippocampus. Two of these traces were instantiated in subpopulations of early- and late-born neurons and followed distinct reactivation trajectories after encoding. The divergent recruitment of these subpopulations underpinned gradual reorganization of memory ensembles and modulated memory persistence and plasticity across multiple learning episodes. Thus, our findings reveal profound and intricate relationships between ensemble dynamics and the progression of memories over time.",

We explored a causal relationship between cellular synaptic strength and electroencephalography delta power indicating macro-level sleep pressure by developing a theoretical framework and a molecular tool to manipulate synaptic strength. The mathematical model predicted that increased synaptic strength promotes the neuronal \u201cdown state\u201d and raises the delta power. Our molecular tool (synapse-targeted chemically induced translocation of Kalirin-7, SYNCit-K), which induces dendritic spine enlargement and synaptic potentiation through chemically induced translocation of protein Kalirin-7, demonstrated that synaptic potentiation of excitatory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) increases nonrapid eye movement sleep amounts and delta power. Thus, synaptic strength of PFC excitatory neurons dictates sleep pressure in mammals.",

This limitation has been overcome in electromagnetic resonators by coupling them to other strongly nonlinear quantum systems such as atoms and superconducting qubits. We demonstrate the realization of the single-phonon nonlinear regime in a solid-state mechanical system. The single-phonon anharmonicity in our system exceeds the decoherence rate by a factor of 6.8, allowing us to use it as a mechanical qubit and demonstrate initialization, readout, and single-qubit gates. Our approach provides a powerful quantum acoustics platform for quantum simulations, sensing, and information processing.",

To colonize, a symbiont must locate its niche and sustain growth within the gut. Adhesins are bacterial cell surface proteins that facilitate attachment to host tissues and are often virulence factors for opportunistic pathogens. However, the attachments are often transient and nonspecific, and additional mechanisms are required to sustain infection. In this work, we use live imaging of individual symbiotic bacterial cells colonizing the gut of living Drosophila melanogaster to show that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum specifically recognizes the fruit fly foregut as a distinct physical niche. L. plantarum establishes stably within its niche through host-specific adhesins encoded by genes carried on a colonization island. The adhesin binding domains are conserved throughout the Lactobacillales, and the island also encodes a secretion system widely conserved among commensal and pathogenic bacteria.",

These changes result in a significant upstream shift in streamflow experienced by about 29% of the global land surface. We found the most changes in the smallest steams in our study: increases in erosion potential (approximately 5% increase in stream power), flood frequency (approximately 42% increase in 100-year floods), and likely nutrient dynamics (altered seasonal flow regimes). We revealed these changes using \u201cdetail at scale\u201d by mapping millions of individual rivers. Widely adopting this approach could reveal other changes to the hydrosphere.",

We show that cellulose synthase\u2013like M [GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM15 (GAME15)] functions both as a cholesterol glucuronosyltransferase and a scaffold protein.

Although it has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments, path dependence is difficult to demonstrate in natural systems because of a lack of independent replicates. Here, we show that two types of distributed visual systems recently evolved twice within chitons, demonstrating rapid and path-dependent evolution of a complex trait. The type of visual system that a chiton lineage can evolve is constrained by the number of openings for sensory nerves in its shell plates. Lineages with more openings evolve visual systems with thousands of eyespots, whereas those with fewer openings evolve visual systems with hundreds of shell eyes. These macroevolutionary outcomes shaped by path dependence are both deterministic and stochastic because possibilities are restricted yet not entirely predictable.",

N-803+bNAbs treatment induced immune activation and transient viremia but only limited reductions in the SHIV reservoir. Upon ART discontinuation, viral rebound occurred in all animals, which was followed by durable control in approximately 70% of all N-803+bNAb\u2013treated macaques. Viral control was correlated with the reprogramming of CD8 + T cells by N-803+bNAb synergy.

Genetic screening in zebrafish revealed that loss of function of the transmembrane protein Cachd1 resulted in right-sided habenula neurons adopting left-sided identity. Cachd1 is expressed in neuronal progenitors, functions downstream of asymmetric environmental signals, and influences timing of the normally asymmetric patterns of neurogenesis. Biochemical and structural analyses demonstrated that Cachd1 can bind simultaneously to Lrp6 and Frizzled family Wnt co-receptors. Consistent with this, lrp6 mutant zebrafish lose asymmetry in the habenulae, and epistasis experiments support a role for Cachd1 in modulating Wnt pathway activity in the brain. These studies identify Cachd1 as a conserved Wnt receptor\u2013interacting protein that regulates lateralized neuronal identity in the zebrafish brain.",

Individuals with a high germline-epitope burden in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ ERBB2 ) are less likely to develop HER2-positive breast cancer compared with other subtypes. The same holds true for recurrent amplicons defining three aggressive estrogen receptor (ER)\u2013positive subgroups. Tumors that overcome such immune-mediated negative selection are more aggressive and demonstrate an \u201cimmune cold\u201d phenotype.

    "abstract": "Investigating the dissociation of acids in the presence of a limited number of water molecules is crucial for understanding various elementary chemical processes. In our study, focusing on HCl(H 2 O) n clusters (where HCl is hydrogen chloride and H 2 O is water) formed in a cold and isolated jet expansion, we used the nuclear quadrupole coupling tensor obtained through rotational spectroscopy to decipher the nature of the hydrogen-chlorine (H-Cl) chemical bond in a microaqueous environment. For n = 1 to 4, the H-Cl bond is covalent. At n = 5 and 7, the contact ion pair of H 3 O + Cl \u2212 is spontaneously formed within the hydrogen bond networks of book and cube acid-water clusters, respectively.",

Ischemic conditions switch complex I from rapid, reversible catalysis into a dormant state that protects upon reoxygenation, but the molecular basis for the switch is unknown. We combined precise biochemical definition of complex I catalysis with high-resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures in the phospholipid bilayer of coupled vesicles to reveal the mechanism of the transition into the dormant state, modulated by membrane interactions. By implementing a versatile membrane system to unite structure and function, attributing catalytic and regulatory properties to specific structural states, we define how a conformational switch in complex I controls its physiological roles.",

By reconsidering the fundamentals of imaging, we demonstrate an event-responsive approach to electron microscopy that delivers more information about the sample for a given beam current. Measuring the time to achieve an electron count threshold rather than waiting a predefined constant time improves the information obtained per electron. The microscope was made to respond to these events by blanking the beam, thus reducing the overall dose required. This approach automatically apportions dose to achieve a given signal-to-noise ratio in each pixel, eliminating excess dose that is associated with diminishing returns of information. We demonstrate the wide applicability of our approach to beam-sensitive materials by imaging biological tissue and zeolite.",

Mantle composition and evolution have been primarily inferred by surface sampling and indirect methods. We recovered a long (1268-meter) section of serpentinized abyssal mantle peridotite interleaved with thin gabbroic intrusions. We find depleted compositions with notable variations in mantle mineralogy controlled by melt flow. Dunite zones have predominantly intermediate dips, in contrast to the originally steep mantle fabrics, indicative of oblique melt transport. Extensive hydrothermal fluid-rock interaction is recorded across the full depth of the core and is overprinted by oxidation in the upper 200 meters. Alteration patterns are consistent with vent fluid composition in the nearby Lost City hydrothermal field.",

This ecological study included 128,225 T2DM cases diagnosed from 2000 to 2008 among 10,186,016 male and female Ukrainians born from 1930 to 1938. Individuals who were born in the first half-year of 1934, and hence exposed in early gestation to the mid-1933 peak famine period, had a greater than twofold likelihood of T2DM compared with that of unexposed controls. There was a dose-response relationship between severity of famine exposure and increase in adult T2DM risk.",

While these compounds act on numerous central and peripheral pain pathways, the neuroanatomical substrate for opioid analgesia is not fully understood. By means of single-cell transcriptomics and manipulation of morphine-responsive neurons, we have identified an ensemble of neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) that regulates mechanical nociception in mice. Among these, forced activation or silencing of excitatory RVM BDNF projection neurons mimicked or completely reversed morphine-induced mechanical antinociception, respectively, via a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)\u2013dependent mechanism and activation of inhibitory spinal galanin-positive neurons. Our results reveal a specific RVM-spinal circuit that scales mechanical nociception whose function confers the antinociceptive properties of morphine.",

Utilizing extensive datasets and advanced cryo\u2013electron microscopy analysis, we present structural insights into HBsAg at a near-atomic resolution of 3.7 angstroms. HBsAg homodimers assemble into subviral particles with D 2 - and D 4 -like quasisymmetry, elucidating the dense-packing rules and structural adaptability of HBsAg. These findings provide insights into how HBsAg assembles into higher-order filaments and interacts with the capsid to form virions.",

BBR from nanostructured filaments with twisted geometry from nanocarbon or metal has strong ellipticity from 500 to 3000 nanometers. The submicrometer-scale chirality of these filaments satisfies the dimensionality requirements imposed by fluctuation-dissipation theorem and requires symmetry breaking in absorptivity and emissivity according to Kirchhoff\u2019s law. The resulting BBR shows emission anisotropy and brightness exceeding those of conventional chiral photon emitters by factors of 10 to 100. The helical structure of these filaments enables precise spectral tuning of the chiral emission, which can be modeled using electromagnetic principles and chirality metrics. Encapsulating nanocarbon filaments in refractive ceramics produces highly efficient, adjustable, and durable chiral emitters capable of functioning at extreme temperatures previously considered unattainable.",

Upon fertilization, the cell cycle resumes. Successful development requires that male and female gametes are in the same phase of the cell cycle. The molecular mechanisms that reinstate cell division in a fertilization-dependent manner are poorly understood in both animals and plants. Using Arabidopsis , we show that a sperm-derived signal induces the proliferation of a female gamete, the central cell, precisely upon fertilization. The central cell is arrested in S phase by the activity of the RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED1 (RBR1) protein. Upon fertilization, delivery of the core cell cycle component CYCD7;1 causes RBR1 degradation and thus S phase progression, ensuring the formation of functional endosperm and, consequently, viable seeds.",

While budding yeast control chromosome inheritance through ~125-base pair DNA sequence-defined centromeres, mammals and many other eukaryotes use large, epigenetic centromeres. Harnessing centromere epigenetics permits human artificial chromosome (HAC) formation but is not sufficient to avoid rampant multimerization of the initial DNA molecule upon introduction to cells. We describe an approach that efficiently forms single-copy HACs. It employs a ~750-kilobase construct that is sufficiently large to house the distinct chromatin types present at the inner and outer centromere, obviating the need to multimerize. Delivery to mammalian cells is streamlined by employing yeast spheroplast fusion. These developments permit faithful chromosome engineering in the context of metazoan cells.",

The Gifsy-1 prophage terminase protein, whose canonical function is to process phage DNA for packaging in the virus head, unexpectedly acts as a transfer ribonuclease (tRNase) under oxidative stress, cleaving the anticodon loop of tRNA Leu . The ensuing RNA fragmentation compromises bacterial translation, intracellular survival, and recovery from oxidative stress in the vertebrate host. S. enterica adapts to this transfer RNA (tRNA) fragmentation by transcribing the RNA repair Rtc system. The counterintuitive translational arrest provided by tRNA cleavage may subvert prophage mobilization and give the host an opportunity for repair as a way of maintaining bacterial genome integrity and ultimately survival in animals.",

    "abstract": "Meningomyelocele is one of the most severe forms of neural tube defects (NTDs) and the most frequent structural birth defect of the central nervous system. We assembled the Spina Bifida Sequencing Consortium to identify causes. Exome and genome sequencing of 715 parent-offspring trios identified six patients with chromosomal 22q11.2 deletions, suggesting a 23-fold increased risk compared with the general population. Furthermore, analysis of a separate 22q11.2 deletion cohort suggested a 12- to 15-fold increased NTD risk of meningomyelocele. The loss of Crkl , one of several neural tube\u2013expressed genes within the minimal deletion interval, was sufficient to replicate NTDs in mice, where both penetrance and expressivity were exacerbated by maternal folate deficiency. Thus, the common 22q11.2 deletion confers substantial meningomyelocele risk, which is partially alleviated by folate supplementation.",

However, decomposition rates are highly variable and large-scale patterns and drivers of this process remain poorly understood. Using a cellulose-based assay to reflect the primary constituent of plant detritus, we generated a predictive model (81% variance explained) for cellulose decomposition rates across 514 globally distributed streams. A large number of variables were important for predicting decomposition, highlighting the complexity of this process at the global scale. Predicted cellulose decomposition rates, when combined with genus-level litter quality attributes, explain published leaf litter decomposition rates with high accuracy (70% variance explained). Our global map provides estimates of rates across vast understudied areas of Earth and reveals rapid decomposition across continental-scale areas dominated by human activities.",

    "abstract": "In addition to their intrinsic rewarding properties, opioids can also evoke aversive reactions that protect against misuse. Cellular mechanisms that govern the interplay between opioid reward and aversion are poorly understood. We used whole-brain activity mapping in mice to show that neurons in the dorsal peduncular nucleus (DPn) are highly responsive to the opioid oxycodone. Connectomic profiling revealed that DPn neurons innervate the parabrachial nucleus (PBn). Spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomics resolved a population of PBn-projecting pyramidal neurons in the DPn that express \u03bc-opioid receptors (\u03bcORs). Disrupting \u03bcOR signaling in the DPn switched oxycodone from rewarding to aversive and exacerbated the severity of opioid withdrawal. These findings identify the DPn as a key substrate for the abuse liability of opioids.",

Using a 5\u2032 single-cell RNA sequencing approach, we defined transcription start sites of enhancer RNAs and other classes of coding and noncoding RNAs in human CD4 + T cells, revealing cellular heterogeneity and differentiation trajectories. Integration of these datasets with single-cell chromatin profiles showed that active enhancers with bidirectional RNA transcription are highly cell type\u2013specific and that disease heritability is strongly enriched in these enhancers. The resulting cell type\u2013resolved multimodal atlas of bidirectionally transcribed enhancers, which we linked with promoters using fine-scale chromatin contact maps, enabled us to systematically interpret genetic variants associated with a range of immune-mediated diseases.",

Mechanisms of P. destructans invasion of bat epidermis remain obscure. Guided by our in vivo observations, we modeled hibernation with a newly generated little brown bat ( Myotis lucifugus ) keratinocyte cell line. We uncovered the stealth intracellular lifestyle of P. destructans , which inhibits apoptosis of keratinocytes and spreads through the cells by two epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\u2013dependent mechanisms: active penetration during torpor and induced endocytosis during arousal. Melanin of endocytosed P. destructans blocks endolysosomal maturation, facilitating P. destructans survival and germination after return to torpor. Blockade of EGFR aborts P. destructans entry into keratinocytes.",

Our cryo\u2013electron microscopy studies show that, within the NuA4/TIP60 complex, the E1A binding protein P400 (EP400) subunit serves as a scaffold holding the different functional modules in specific positions, creating a distinct arrangement of the actin-related protein (ARP) module. EP400 interacts with the transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP) subunit by using a footprint that overlaps with that of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, preventing the formation of a hybrid complex. Loss of the TRRAP subunit leads to mislocalization of NuA4/TIP60, resulting in the redistribution of H2A.Z and its acetylation across the genome, emphasizing the dual functionality of NuA4/TIP60 as a single macromolecular assembly.",

We found that both Ctf18-RFC and Pol\u03b5 contain specific structural features that direct PCNA loading onto DNA.

In addition, Ctf18-RFC can pry prebound Pol\u03b5 off of DNA, then load PCNA onto DNA and transfer the PCNA-DNA back to Pol\u03b5. These elements in both Ctf18-RFC and Pol\u03b5 provide specificity in loading PCNA onto DNA for Pol\u03b5.",

We succeeded in the mass growth of aluminum (Al) NW forests at desired locations by controlling atomic diffusion within the solid film. Whereas prior attention has focused only on how to increase the driving force, we show that focused ion beam irradiation created localized regions of high stress, which provided pathways for atomic diffusion as well as nuclei and driving forces for vertical NW growth. The underlying growth process could in principle be extended to other metals.",

We discovered grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) that have grid fields representing future locations during goal-directed behavior. These predictive grid cells represented prospective spatial information by shifting their grid fields against the direction of travel. Predictive grid cells discharged at the trough phases of the hippocampal CA1 theta oscillation and, together with other types of grid cells, organized sequences of the trajectory from the current to future positions across each theta cycle. Our results suggest that the MEC provides a predictive map that supports forward planning in spatial navigation.",

During DNA replication, CENP-A nucleosomes undergo dilution. To preserve centromere identity, correct amounts of CENP-A must be restored in a cell cycle\u2013controlled manner orchestrated by the Mis18 complex (Mis18\u03b1-Mis18\u03b2-Mis18BP1). We demonstrate here that PLK1 interacts with the Mis18 complex by recognizing self-primed phosphorylations of Mis18\u03b1 (Ser 54 ) and Mis18BP1 (Thr 78 and Ser 93 ) through its Polo-box domain. Disrupting these phosphorylations perturbed both centromere recruitment of the CENP-A chaperone HJURP and new CENP-A loading. Biochemical and functional analyses showed that phosphorylation of Mis18\u03b1 and PLK1 binding were required to activate Mis18\u03b1-Mis18\u03b2 and promote Mis18 complex-HJURP interaction. Thus, our study reveals key molecular events underpinning the licensing role of PLK1 in ensuring accurate centromere inheritance.",

We present a mutagenesis strategy to arrest the RSV F protein in its pre-F state by blocking localized changes in protein structure that accompany large-scale conformational rearrangements. We generated a series of mutants and screened them in vitro to assess their potential for forming a stable pre-F. In animals, the immunogenicity of a representative mutant F protein, with a conformation confirmed by cryo\u2013electron microscopy, elicited levels of neutralizing antibodies and protection against RSV-induced lung damage that were comparable to those of DS-Cav1, a pre-F used in a licensed vaccine.",

We show a functional screen of the bacterial microbiota from mice with low intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels; we identified a Gram-negative bacterium, proposed as Tomasiella immunophila , that induces and degrades IgA in the mouse intestine. Mice harboring T. immunophila are susceptible to infections and show poor mucosal repair. T. immunophila is auxotrophic for the bacterial cell wall amino sugar N-acetylmuramic acid. It delivers immunoglobulin-degrading proteases into outer membrane vesicles that preferentially degrade rodent antibodies with kappa but not lambda light chains.

    "abstract": "Deciphering the context-specific relationship between sequence and function is a major challenge in genomics. Existing tools for inducing locus-specific hypermutation and evolution in the native genome context are limited. Here we present a programmable platform for long-range, locus-specific hypermutation called helicase-assisted continuous editing (HACE). HACE leverages CRISPR-Cas9 to target a processive helicase-deaminase fusion that incurs mutations across large (>1000\u2013base pair) genomic intervals. We applied HACE to identify mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) that confer kinase inhibitor resistance, to dissect the impact of individual variants in splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1)\u2013dependent missplicing, and to evaluate noncoding variants in a stimulation-dependent immune enhancer of CD69. HACE provides a powerful tool for investigating coding and noncoding variants, uncovering combinatorial sequence-to-function relationships, and evolving new biological functions.",

However, little is known about the mechanism behind the abundant presence of T H 1-T reg cells in the TME. We demonstrate that selective depletion of arginase I (Arg1)\u2013expressing tumor-associated macrophages (Arg1 + TAMs) inhibits tumor growth and concurrently reduces the ratio of T H 1-T reg cells in the TME. Arg1 + TAMs secrete the chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4), which reinforces interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)\u2013induced T reg cell polarization into T H 1-T reg cells in a manner dependent on CXCR3 and the IFN-\u03b3 receptor. Both genetic PF4 inactivation and PF4 neutralization hinder T H 1-T reg cell accumulation in the TME and reduce tumor growth. Collectively, our study highlights the importance of Arg1 + TAM\u2013produced PF4 for high T H 1-T reg cell levels in the TME to suppress antitumor immunity.",

We report the discovery of footprints (~1.5 million years old) from Koobi Fora, Kenya, that provide the first evidence of two different patterns of Pleistocene hominin bipedalism appearing on the same footprint surface. New analyses show that this is observed repeatedly across multiple contemporaneous sites in the eastern Turkana Basin. These data indicate a sympatric relationship between Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei , suggesting that lake margin habitats were important to both species and highlighting the possible influence of varying levels of coexistence, competition, and niche partitioning in human evolution.",

However, conventional soft materials are typically limited to a single, unidirectional deformation unless complex hybrid constructs are used. We exploited the combination of mesogen self-assembly, polymer chain elasticity, and polymerization-induced stress to design liquid crystalline elastomers that exhibit two mesophases: chevron smectic C (cSmC) and smectic A (SmA). Inducing the cSmC-SmA\u2013isotropic phase transition led to an unusual inversion of the strain field in the microstructure, resulting in opposite deformation modes (e.g., consecutive shrinkage or expansion and right-handed or left-handed twisting and tilting in opposite directions) and high-frequency nonmonotonic oscillations. This ambidirectional movement is scalable and can be used to generate Gaussian transformations at the macroscale.",

Patients expressing a preference for ORS increased ORS prescribing by 27 percentage points. Eliminating stock-outs increased ORS provision by 7 percentage points. Removing financial incentives did not affect ORS prescribing on average but did increase ORS prescribing at pharmacies. We estimate that perceptions that patients do not want ORS explain 42% of underprescribing, whereas stock-outs and financial incentives explain only 6 and 5%, respectively.",

We report new evidence for tropical oxygenation during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a warming event that serves as a geologic analog to anthropogenic warming. Foraminifera-bound nitrogen isotopes indicate that the tropical North Pacific oxygen-deficient zone contracted during the PETM. A concomitant increase in foraminifera size implies that oxygen availability rose in the shallow subsurface throughout the tropical North Pacific. These changes are consistent with ocean model simulations of warming, in which a decline in biological productivity allows tropical subsurface oxygen to rise even as global ocean oxygen declines. The tropical oxygen increase may have helped avoid a mass extinction during the PETM.",

Here, we show that females of the egg-laying caecilian amphibian Siphonops annulatus provide similarly lipid-rich milk to altricial hatchlings during parental care. We observed that for 2 months, S. annulatus babies ingested milk released through the maternal vent seemingly in response to tactile and acoustic stimulation by the babies. The milk, composed mainly of lipids and carbohydrates, originates from the maternal oviduct epithelium\u2019s hypertrophied glands.

Unlike somatic cells, which preferentially mis-segregate larger chromosomes, aged oocytes preferentially mis-segregate smaller chromosomes through unclear processes. Here, we provide a comprehensive three-dimensional chromosome identifying-and-tracking dataset throughout meiosis I in live mouse oocytes. This analysis reveals a prometaphase pathway that actively moves smaller chromosomes to the inner region of the metaphase plate. In the inner region, chromosomes are pulled by stronger bipolar microtubule forces, which facilitates premature chromosome separation, a major cause of segregation errors in aged oocytes. This study reveals a spatial pathway that facilitates aneuploidy of small chromosomes preferentially in aged eggs and implicates the role of the M phase in creating a chromosome size\u2013based spatial arrangement.",

    "abstract": "Mollusks encompass enormous disparity, including familiar clams and snails alongside less familiar aculiferans (chitons and vermiform aplacophorans) with complex multicomponent skeletons. Paleozoic fossils trace crown mollusks to forms exhibiting a combination of biomineralized shells and sclerites (e.g., scales, spines, and spicules). We describe a shell-less, Cambrian stem mollusk, Shishania aculeata gen. et sp. nov., with conical, hollow chitinous sclerites and a smooth girdle, broad foot, and mantle cavity. The sclerites have a microstructure of narrow canals consistent with the impressions of chaetal microvilli found in annelids and brachiopods. Shishania sclerites provide a morphological stepping stone between typical chaetae (chitinous bristles) and the external organic part of aculiferan sclerites that encloses a mineralized body. This discovery reinforces a common origin of lophotrochozoan chaetae and the biomineralized aculiferan sclerites, suggesting that the mollusk ancestor was densely covered with hollow chitinous chaetae.",

    "abstract": "Antiviral therapies with reduced frequencies of administration and high barriers to resistance remain a major goal. For HIV, theories have proposed that viral-deletion variants, which conditionally replicate with a basic reproductive ratio [R 0 ] > 1 (termed \u201ctherapeutic interfering particles\u201d or \u201cTIPs\u201d), could parasitize wild-type virus to constitute single-administration, escape-resistant antiviral therapies. We report the engineering of a TIP that, in rhesus macaques, reduces viremia of a highly pathogenic model of HIV by >3log 10 following a single intravenous injection. Animal lifespan was significantly extended, TIPs conditionally replicated and were continually detected for >6 months, and sequencing data showed no evidence of viral escape. A single TIP injection also suppressed virus replication in humanized mice and cells from persons living with HIV. These data provide proof of concept for a potential new class of single-administration antiviral therapies.",

We show that functional nucleotide-diphosphate-heptose biosynthetic enzymes (HBEs) are distributed widely in bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. We identified a conserved STT R5 motif as a hallmark of heptose nucleotidyltransferases that can synthesize not only ADP-heptose but also cytidine-diphosphate (CDP)\u2013 and uridine-diphosphate (UDP)\u2013heptose. Both CDP- and UDP-heptoses are agonists that trigger stronger alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1)\u2013dependent immune responses than ADP-heptose in human and mouse cells and mice. We also produced ADP-heptose in archaea and verified its innate immune agonist functions. Hence, the \u03b2- d - manno -heptoses are cross-kingdom, small-molecule, pathogen-associated molecular patterns that activate the ALPK1-dependent innate immune signaling cascade.",

    "abstract": "The centromere, a chromosome locus defined by the histone H3\u2013like protein centromeric protein A (CENP-A), promotes assembly of the kinetochore to bind microtubules during cell division. Centromere maintenance requires CENP-A to be actively replenished by dedicated protein machinery in the early G 1 phase of the cell cycle to compensate for its dilution after DNA replication. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) limit CENP-A deposition to once per cell cycle and function as negative regulators outside of early G 1 . Antithetically, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) promotes CENP-A deposition in early G 1 , but the molecular details of this process are still unknown. We reveal here a phosphorylation network that recruits PLK1 to the deposition machinery to control a conformational switch required for licensing the CENP-A deposition reaction. Our findings clarify how PLK1 contributes to the epigenetic maintenance of centromeres.",

However, the carbon is mostly returned to the atmosphere by decomposition. We found a 3775-year-old ancient wood log buried 2 meters belowground that was preserved far beyond its expected lifetime. The wood had near-perfect preservation, with carbon loss less than 5% compared to a modern sample. The lack of decay is likely due to the low permeability of the compact clay soil at the burial site. Our observation suggests a hybrid nature-engineering approach for carbon removal by burying woody biomass in similar anoxic environments. We estimate a global sequestration potential of up to 10 gigatonnes CO 2 per year with existing technology at a low cost of $30 to $100 per tonne after optimization.",

The momentum-exchange interaction leads to an observed all-to-all Ising-like interaction in a matter-wave interferometer. A many-body energy gap also emerges, effectively binding interferometer matter-wave packets together to suppress Doppler dephasing in analogy to M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. The tunable momentum-exchange interaction expands the capabilities of quantum interaction\u2013enhanced matter-wave interferometry and may enable the realization of exotic behaviors, including simulations of superconductors and dynamical gauge fields.",

Previous Africa-wide assessments have tended to solely represent surface water using precipitation, ignoring many important hydrological processes. Here, we applied a validated and weighted ensemble of global hydrological and climate models to estimate present and future areas of hydroclimatic suitability for malaria transmission. With explicit surface water representation, we predict a net decrease in areas suitable for malaria transmission from 2025 onward, greater sensitivity to future greenhouse gas emissions, and different, more complex, malaria transmission patterns. Areas of malaria transmission that are projected to change are smaller than those estimated by precipitation-based estimates but are associated with greater changes in transmission season lengths.",

By examining longitudinal data from 196 radio-tagged southern sea otters ( Enhydra lutris nereis ), we found that tool-using individuals, particularly females, gained access to larger and/or harder-shelled prey. These mechanical advantages translated to reduced tooth damage during food processing. We also found that tool use diminishes trade-offs between access to different prey, tooth condition, and energy intake, all of which are dependent on the relative prey availability in the environment. Tool use allowed individuals to maintain energetic requirements through the processing of alternative prey that are typically inaccessible with biting alone, suggesting that this behavior is a necessity for the survival of some otters in environments where preferred prey are depleted.",

We leveraged two decades of behavioral research coupled with historical DNA analysis to reveal that coevolution with hosts underpins speciation in brood-parasitic bronze-cuckoos. At a macroevolutionary scale, we show that highly virulent brood-parasitic taxa have higher speciation rates and are more likely to speciate in sympatry than less-virulent and nonparasitic relatives. We reveal the microevolutionary process underlying speciation: Hosts reject cuckoo nestlings, which selects for mimetic cuckoo nestling morphology. Where cuckoos exploit multiple hosts, selection for mimicry drives genetic and phenotypic divergence corresponding to host preference, even in sympatry. Our work elucidates perhaps the most common, but poorly characterized, evolutionary process driving biological diversification.",

We show that the tumor suppressor Merlin, an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway, localizes to both cell junctions and medial apical cortex in Drosophila epithelia, with the latter forming solid-like condensates that activate Hippo signaling. Merlin condensation required phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P)\u2013mediated plasma membrane targeting and was antagonistically controlled by Pez and cytoskeletal tension through plasma membrane PI4P regulation. The solid-like material properties of Merlin condensates are essential for physiological function and protect the condensates against external perturbations. Collectively, these findings uncover an essential role for solid-like condensates in normal physiology and reveal regulatory mechanisms for their formation and disassembly.",

Here, we present a modular flow platform that streamlines the synthesis of heteroatom-CF 3 motifs. Our method uses readily available organic precursors in combination with cesium fluoride as the primary fluorine source, facilitating the rapid generation of N -trifluoromethyl(R) [NCF 3 (R)], SCF 3 (trifluoromethylthio), and OCF 3 (trifluoromethoxy) anions on demand without reliance on perfluoroalkyl precursor reagents.

    "abstract": "Humans cooperate to build complex structures with culture-specific architectural styles. However, they are not the only animals to build complex structures nor to have culture. We show that social groups of white-browed sparrow weavers ( Plocepasser mahali ) build structures (nests for breeding and multiple single-occupant roosts for sleeping) that differ architecturally among groups. Morphological differences are consistent across years and are clear even among groups with territories a few meters apart. These repeatable differences are not explained by among-group variation in local weather conditions, bird size, tree height, or patterns of genetic relatedness. Architectural styles are also robust to the immigration of birds from other groups.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an \u201ceat-me\u201d signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial \u201cdon\u2019t eat-me\u201d signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality.",

A mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon is obscured by the biological richness of these aggregates and a lack of direct observation of their sedimentation physics. Utilizing a scale-free vertical tracking microscopy in a field setting, we present microhydrodynamic measurements of freshly collected marine snow aggregates from sediment traps. Our observations reveal hitherto-unknown comet-like morphology arising from fluid-structure interactions of transparent exopolymer halos around sinking aggregates. These invisible comet tails slow down individual particles, greatly increasing their residence time. Based on these findings, we constructed a reduced-order model for the Stokesian sedimentation of these mucus-embedded two-phase particles, paving the way toward a predictive understanding of marine snow.",

We found that in mice, transection of the anterior commissure (AC), which connects the rostroventral forebrain, impaired avoidant behaviors. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the mouse projects to the contralateral nucleus accumbens (NAc) through the AC, independent of its ipsilateral projections. Aversive stimuli activated contralateral BLA-NAc projections. Positive stimuli, however, activated ipsilateral projections. Selective activation of contralateral BLA-NAc projections activated D2-positive medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs), reduced NAc dopamine levels, and caused aversion, whereas selective activation of ipsilateral BLA-NAc projections activated D1-MSNs, increased NAc dopamine levels, and induced reward. The contralateral BLA-AC-NAc pathway is crucial for encoding negative valence, demonstrating distinct functions of intra- and interhemispheric circuits in brain physiology.",

We found that, although corals have some adaptation capacity, they will suffer severe heatwave-induced declines over the coming decades. For a future in which emissions lead to ~3\u00b0C of global warming, natural selection could allow populations to persist, albeit in severely depleted states with elevated extinction risk and potential loss of ecosystem functioning. Yet, for thermally sensitive coral populations to thrive beyond 2050, there must be rapid reductions of greenhouse gas emissions that limit global warming to 2\u00b0C.",

In Lepidoptera, mir-193 is derived from a gigantic primary long noncoding RNA, ivory , and it functions by directly repressing multiple pigmentation genes.

Between the 7-year period before (2008\u20132014) and after (2016\u20132022) the heatwave, murre numbers plummeted 52 to 78% at 13 colonies across two large marine ecosystems.

We investigated mental sorting using high-throughput electrophysiological recordings in the frontal cortex of macaque monkeys, who memorized and sorted spatial sequences in forward or backward orders according to visual cues. We discovered that items at each ordinal rank in WM were encoded in separate rank-WM subspaces and then, depending on cues, were maintained or reordered between the subspaces, accompanied by two extra temporary subspaces in two operation steps. Furthermore, the cue activity served as an indexical signal to trigger sorting processes. Thus, we propose a complete conceptual framework, where the neural landscape transitions in frontal neural states underlie the symbolic system for mental programming of sequence WM.",

The response maps onto the Arctic Oscillation and is strongest in the North Atlantic, where it resembles the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Unexpectedly, these 1-year lagged teleconnections are at least as strong as the better-known simultaneous winter connections. However, the 1-year lagged response is opposite in sign to the simultaneous response such that 1 year later, El Ni\u00f1o is followed by a positive NAO, whereas La Ni\u00f1a is followed by a negative NAO. The lagged response may also interfere with simultaneous ENSO teleconnections. We show here that these effects are unlikely to be caused by residual aliasing of ENSO cycles; rather, slowly migrating atmospheric angular momentum anomalies explain both the sign and the timing of the extratropical response. Our results have implications for understanding ENSO teleconnections, explaining observed extratropical climate variability and interpreting seasonal to interannual climate predictions.",

We have developed catalysts, readily derived from the Cinchona alkaloid family of natural products, which can achieve this by virtue of their chiral amine structure. The catalyst, following single-electron oxidation, desymmetrizes meso -diols by selectively abstracting a hydrogen atom from one carbon center, which then regains a hydrogen atom by abstraction from a thiol. This results in an enantioselective epimerization process, forming the chiral diastereomer with high enantiomeric excess. Cyclic and acyclic 1,2-diols are compatible, as are acyclic 1,3-diols. Additionally, we demonstrate the viability of combining our approach with carbon-carbon bond formation in Giese addition. Given the increasing number of synthetic methods involving hydrogen atom transfer steps, we anticipate that this work will have a broad impact in the field of enantioselective radical chemistry.",

RAD51 recombinase, the central component of several crucial processes in repairing DNA and protecting genome integrity, forms filaments on DNA, which are tightly regulated. One of these RAD51 regulators is FIGNL1 (fidgetin-like 1), which prevents RAD51 genotoxic chromatin association in normal cells and persistent RAD51 foci upon DNA damage. The cryogenic electron microscopy\u2013imaged structure of FIGNL1 in complex with RAD51 reveals that FIGNL1 forms a nonplanar hexamer and encloses RAD51 N terminus in the FIGNL1 hexamer pore. Mutations in pore loop or catalytic residues of FIGNL1 render it defective in filament disassembly and are lethal in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our study reveals a distinct mechanism for removing RAD51 from bound substrates and provides the molecular basis for FIGNL1 in maintaining genome stability.",

    "abstract": "Emotional experiences often evoke neural plasticity that supports adaptive changes in behavior, including maladaptive plasticity associated with mood and substance use disorders. These adaptations are supported in part by experience-dependent activation of immediate-early response genes, such as Npas4 (neuronal PAS domain protein 4). Here we show that a conserved long noncoding enhancer RNA (lnc-eRNA), transcribed from an activity-sensitive enhancer, produces DNA:RNA hybrid R-loop structures that support three-dimensional chromatin looping between enhancer and proximal promoter and rapid Npas4 gene induction. Furthermore, in mouse models, Npas4 lnc-eRNA and its R-loop are required for the development of behavioral adaptations produced by chronic psychosocial stress or cocaine exposure, revealing a potential role for this regulatory mechanism in the transmission of emotional experiences.",

Here, we present an approach to the formation of carbon-carbon \u03c3 bonds by remote proton elimination, a distinct mode of carbon-hydrogen activation enabled by distal acidification through five carbon-carbon bonds. Application of remote proton elimination to cyclodecyl cations unveiled an appealing method for the synthesis of decalins. The transformation is regioconvergent, proceeds without the need for a directing group or precious metal, and demonstrates exquisite site selectivity. An in-depth computational study illuminated the reaction mechanism. Additionally, we describe the complete stereoisomeric enrichment of the decalin products through epimerization mediated by hydrogen atom transfer.",

    "abstract": "Human visual recognition is remarkably robust to chromatic changes. In this work, we provide a potential account of the roots of this resilience based on observations with 10 congenitally blind children who gained sight late in life. Several months or years following their sight-restoring surgeries, the removal of color cues markedly reduced their recognition performance, whereas age-matched normally sighted children showed no such decrement. This finding may be explained by the greater-than-neonatal maturity of the late-sighted children\u2019s color system at sight onset, inducing overly strong reliance on chromatic cues. Simulations with deep neural networks corroborate this hypothesis. These findings highlight the adaptive significance of typical developmental trajectories and provide guidelines for enhancing machine vision systems.",

The ice discharges of these episodes constrain the sensitivity of overturning circulation to iceberg melting. We reconstructed these ice discharges to be as high as 0.13 sverdrup (Sv) (1 Sv = 1 million cubic meters per second) during Heinrich event 4 and to average 0.029 Sv over all episodes. The present-day Greenland Ice Sheet calving of icebergs is comparable to that of a mid-range Heinrich event. As the future Greenland Ice Sheet recedes from marine-terminating outlets, its iceberg calving likely will not persist long enough for icebergs alone to cause catastrophic disruption to the Atlantic overturning circulation, although the accelerating Greenland runoff and continued global warming remain threats to the circulation stability.",

We combined comprehensive phylogenetic and fossil information in a new \u201cbirth-death diffusion\u201d model that provides a detailed characterization of variation in diversification rates in mammals. We found an early rising and sustained diversification scenario, wherein speciation rates increased before and during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary. The K-Pg mass extinction event filtered out more slowly speciating lineages and was followed by a subsequent slowing in speciation rates rather than rebounds. These dynamics arose from an imbalanced speciation process, with separate lineages giving rise to many, less speciation-prone descendants. Diversity seems to have been brought about by these isolated, fast-speciating lineages, rather than by a few punctuated innovations.",

Neutralizing antibodies targeting viral fusion are one potential therapeutic approach but have not yet been structurally characterized or advanced to clinical use. We present cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of prefusion F alone [2.1-angstrom (\u00c5) resolution], F complexed with a fusion-inhibitory peptide (2.3-\u00c5 resolution), F complexed with the neutralizing and protective monoclonal antibody (mAb) 77 (2.6-\u00c5 resolution), and an additional structure of postfusion F (2.7-\u00c5 resolution). In vitro assays and examination of additional EM classes show that mAb 77 binds prefusion F, arrests F in an intermediate state, and prevents transition to the postfusion conformation.

We reversed these jumps through microwave-driven transitions, which resulted in a 20-fold improvement in the time the molecule dwells in a chosen state. The measured transition rates showed anisotropy in the thermal environment, pointing to the possibility of using single molecules as in situ probes for the strengths of ambient fields.

Our data indicate that the Chicxulub impactor was a carbonaceous-type asteroid, which had formed beyond the orbit of Jupiter. The five other impact structures have isotopic signatures that are more consistent with siliceous-type asteroids, which formed closer to the Sun.

We measured how the kinetic and total energies evolve after quenching the confining potential. Although the bare interactions are attractive, the atoms behave as if they repel each other: Their kinetic energy paradoxically decreases as the gas is compressed. The missing \u201cphantom\u201d energy is quantified by benchmarking our experimental results against generalized hydrodynamics calculations. We present evidence that the missing kinetic energy is carried by undetected, very high momentum atoms.",

Herein, a click and clip reaction pair is demonstrated by manipulation of a sulfilimine linkage. Phenothiazines and amines are rapidly and quantitatively coupled through oxidative sulfilimine bond formation with N-bromosuccinimide, and the resulting sulfilimine bromides then undergo quantitative reversion to the phenothiazines and amines through photoreduction at 380 nanometers. This protocol enables fabrication of depolymerizable macromolecules and reversible modification of aminosaccharides, demonstrating high selectivity and efficiency for manipulating sulfilimine linkages in complex systems.",

We present a single-flask transformation of carboxylic acids to acyl phosphonates that can access synthetically useful triplet diradicals under visible light or near-ultraviolet irradiation. The use of phosphorus circumvents unproductive Norrish type I processes, promoting selectivity that enables hydrogen-atom transfer reactivity. Use of this strategy promotes the efficient scaffold remodeling of carboxylic acids through various annulation, contraction, and expansion manifolds.",

To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word \u201cshe,\u201d to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves. We recorded from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task.

Despite many studies of specific host-pathogen systems, a unifying framework for predicting the outcomes of interactions among pathogens has remained elusive. We address this gap by developing a pathogen invasion theory (PIT) based on modern ecological coexistence theory and testing the resulting framework against empirical systems. Across major human pathogens, PIT predicts near-universal mutual susceptibility of one strain to invasion by another strain. However, predicting co-circulation from mutual invasion also depends on the degree to which susceptible abundance is reduced below the invasion threshold by overcompensatory epidemic dynamics, and the time it takes for susceptibles to replenish. The transmission advantage of an invading strain and the strength and duration of immunity are key determinants of susceptible dynamics. PIT unifies existing ideas about pathogen co-circulation, offering a quantitative framework for predicting the emergence of novel pathogen strains.",

In silico analyses have revealed hundreds of mobile genetic elements shared between these species, yet little is known about the phenotypes they encode, their effects on fitness, or pleiotropic consequences for the recipient\u2019s genome. In this work, we show that acquisition of a ubiquitous integrative conjugative element (ICE) encoding a type VI secretion system (T6SS) shuts down the native T6SS of Bacteroides fragilis . Despite inactivating this T6SS, ICE acquisition increases the fitness of the B. fragilis transconjugant over its progenitor by arming it with the new T6SS.

    "abstract": "Electrocaloric (EC) cooling presents a promising approach to efficient and compact solid-state heat pumps. However, reported EC coolers have complex architectures and limited cooling temperature lift. In this work, we introduce a self-regenerative heat pump (SRHP) using a cascade of EC polymer film stacks, which have electrostrictive actuations in response to an electric field that are directed to realize efficient heat transfer, eliminating the need for additional transportive or regenerative mechanisms. The SRHP demonstrates a cooling of 8.8 kelvin below ambient temperature in 30 seconds and delivers a maximum specific cooling power of 1.52 watts per gram. The temperature lift of the SRHP is 14.2 kelvin. These results underscore the potential of the compact solid-state cooling mechanism to address the increasing need for localized thermal management.",

They usually rely on carrier tunneling between two quantum wells or two layers to hybridize with nondipolar excitons to gain oscillator strength. In this work, we uncovered a new type of bright infrared dipolar exciton by stacking 90\u00b0-twisted black phosphorus (BP) structures. These excitons, inherent to the reconstructed band structure, exhibit high oscillator strength. Most importantly, they inherit the linear polarization from BP, which allows light polarization to be used to select the dipole direction. Moreover, the dipole moment and resonance energy can be widely tuned by the thickness of the BP. Our results demonstrate a useful platform for exploring tunable correlated dipolar excitons.",

This \u201cperceptein\u201d circuit combines weighted input summation through reversible binding interactions with self-activation and mutual inhibition through irreversible proteolytic cleavage. These interactions collectively generate a large repertoire of distinct protein species stemming from up to eight coexpressed starting protein species. The complete system achieves multi-output signal classification with tunable decision boundaries in mammalian cells and can be used to conditionally control cell death.

In subsurface environments, methane often exhibits equilibrium isotopic signals, but the equilibration process has never been demonstrated in the laboratory. We cocultured a hydrogenotrophic methanogen with an H 2 -producing bacterium under conditions (55\u00b0C, 10 megapascals) simulating a methane-bearing subsurface. This resulted in near-complete reversibility of methanogenesis, leading to equilibria for both hydrogen and carbon isotopes. The methanogen not only equilibrated kinetic isotope signals of initially produced methane but also modified the isotope signals of amended thermogenic methane. These findings suggest that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis can overwrite the isotope signals of subsurface methane, distorting proxies for its origin and formation temperature\u2014insights crucial for natural gas exploration.",

We found that the lipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) expressed on germinal center (GC) B cells is essential for the production of high-affinity antibodies. Mechanistically, Gb3 bound and disengaged CD19 from its chaperone CD81, permitting CD19 to translocate to the B cell receptor complex to trigger signaling. Moreover, Gb3 regulated major histocompatibility complex class II expression to increase diversity of T follicular helper and GC B cells reactive with subdominant epitopes. In influenza infection, elevating Gb3, either endogenously or exogenously, promoted broadly reactive antibody responses and cross-protection. These data demonstrate that Gb3 determines the affinity and breadth of B cell immunity and has potential as a vaccine adjuvant.",

Using anatomical and functional approaches in mice, we reveal that odor-driven activity propagates to a large part of the cortex during the first postnatal week and enhances whisker-evoked activation of primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1). This effect disappears in adult animals, in line with the loss of excitatory connectivity from olfactory cortex to wS1. By performing neonatal odor deprivation, followed by electrophysiological and behavioral work in adult animals, we identify a key transient regulation of nasal chemosensory information necessary for the development of wS1 sensory-driven dynamics and somatosensation. Our work uncovers a cross-modal critical window for nasal chemosensation\u2013dependent somatosensory functional maturation.",

We combined a new budget of radiocarbon produced by nuclear bomb testing in the 1960s with model simulations to evaluate carbon cycling in terrestrial vegetation. We found that most state-of-the-art vegetation models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project underestimated the radiocarbon accumulation in vegetation biomass. Our findings, combined with constraints on vegetation carbon stocks and productivity trends, imply that net primary productivity is likely at least 80 petagrams of carbon per year presently, compared with the 43 to 76 petagrams per year predicted by current models. Storage of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial vegetation is likely more short-lived and vulnerable than previously predicted.",

These genetic elements are common in viruses, but whether they confer a selective advantage is unclear. In this work, we studied intron-encoded homing endonuclease gp210 in bacteriophage \u03a6PA3 and found that it contributes to viral competition by interfering with the replication of a coinfecting phage, \u03a6KZ. We show that gp210 targets a specific sequence in \u03a6KZ, which prevents the assembly of progeny viruses. This work demonstrates how a homing endonuclease can be deployed in interference competition among viruses and provide a relative fitness advantage. Given the ubiquity of homing endonucleases, this selective advantage likely has widespread evolutionary implications in diverse plasmid and viral competition as well as virus-host interactions.",

In this work, we present insights that we obtained using daily data from the National Health Service COVID-19 app for England and Wales and that we shared with health authorities in almost real time. Our indicator of the reproduction number R ( t ) was available days earlier than other estimates, with an innovative capability to decompose R ( t ) into contact rates and probabilities of infection. When Omicron arrived, the main epidemic driver switched from contacts to transmissibility. We separated contacts and transmissions by day of exposure and setting and found pronounced variability over days of the week and during Christmas holidays and events. For example, during the Euro football tournament in 2021, days with England matches showed sharp spikes in exposures and transmissibility. Digital contact-tracing technologies can help control epidemics not only by directly preventing transmissions but also by enabling rapid analysis at scale and with unprecedented resolution.",

Almost all current global chemistry models calculate about 15% too much OH and thus too rapid methane loss. Methane is a short-lived climate forcer, critical to achieving global warming targets, and this error affects our model projections of climate change. New observations of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet region (290 to 350 nanometers) imply reductions in sunlight with key photolysis rates decreasing by 8 to 12% in the near-surface tropical atmosphere. Incorporation of this new mechanism in a chemistry-transport model reduces OH and methane loss by only 4%, but combined with other proposed mechanisms, such as tropospheric halogen chemistry (7%), we may be able to resolve this conundrum.",

Using fruit-consumption and trait information for 97 frugivorous bird and 831 plant species across six continents, we demonstrate that birds feed more frequently on closely size-matched fruits near their geographic range limits. This pattern was particularly strong for highly frugivorous birds, whereas opportunistic frugivores showed no such tendency. These findings highlight how frugivore interactions might respond to stressful conditions and reveal that trait matching may not predict resource use consistently.",

We propose \u201cnetwork control,\u201d a contrasting paradigm that exploits hidden interactions between rate constants to greatly amplify modest intrinsic biases and enable precise multisite editing. When network control is applied to the photochemical isomerization of hexoses, six of the eight possible diastereomers can be selectively obtained.

    "abstract": "Despite continuous expansion of the RNA binding protein (RBP) world, there is a lack of systematic understanding of RBPs in the mammalian testis, which harbors one of the most complex tissue transcriptomes. We adapted RNA interactome capture to mouse male germ cells, building an RBP atlas characterized by multiple layers of dynamics along spermatogenesis. Trapping of RNA\u2013cross-linked peptides showed that the glutamic acid\u2013arginine (ER) patch, a residue-coevolved polyampholytic element present in coiled coils, enhances RNA binding of its host RBPs. Deletion of this element in NONO (non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein) led to a defective mitosis-to-meiosis transition due to compromised NONO-RNA interactions. Whole-exome sequencing of over 1000 infertile men revealed a prominent role of RBPs in the human genetic architecture of male infertility and identified risk ER patch variants.",

    "abstract": "New memories are integrated into prior knowledge of the world. But what if consecutive memories exert opposing demands on the host brain network? We report that acquiring a robust (food-context) memory constrains the mouse hippocampus within a population activity space of highly correlated spike trains that prevents subsequent computation of a flexible (object-location) memory. This densely correlated firing structure developed over repeated mnemonic experience, gradually coupling neurons in the superficial sublayer of the CA1 stratum pyramidale to whole-population activity. Applying hippocampal theta-driven closed-loop optogenetic suppression to mitigate this neuronal recruitment during (food-context) memory formation relaxed the topological constraint on hippocampal coactivity and restored subsequent flexible (object-location) memory. These findings uncover an organizational principle for the peer-to-peer coactivity structure of the hippocampal cell population to meet memory demands.",

    "abstract": "Mid-crustal magma domains are the source of many basaltic eruptions. Lavas from individual eruptions are often chemically homogeneous, suggesting that they derive from single, well-mixed magma reservoirs. The 2023 to 2024 eruptions at Sundhn\u00faksg\u00edgar in the Svartsengi volcanic system in Iceland provide an opportunity to observe the behavior of a mid-crustal magma domain at high spatial and temporal resolution by detailed sampling and geochemical characterization. We observed substantial mantle-derived geochemical variability in the products erupted in the first hours of the December 2023 and January, February, and March to May 2024 eruptions, indicating that the eruptions derived from multiple magma reservoirs, which mineral-melt equilibration pressures place in the mid crust. The unusual presence of geochemical heterogeneity in the mid-crustal magma domain provides insights into how dynamic and complex mid-crustal magma domains can be.",

    "abstract": "How living systems achieve precision in form and function despite their intrinsic stochasticity is a fundamental yet ongoing question in biology. We generated morphomaps of preimplantation embryogenesis in mouse, rabbit, and monkey embryos, and these morphomaps revealed that although blastomere divisions desynchronized passively, 8-cell embryos converged toward robust three-dimensional shapes. Using topological analysis and genetic perturbations, we found that embryos progressively changed their cellular connectivity to a preferred topology, which could be predicted by a physical model in which actomyosin contractility and noise facilitate topological transitions, lowering surface energy. This mechanism favored regular embryo packing and promoted a higher number of inner cells in the 16-cell embryo. Synchronized division reduced embryo packing and generated substantially more misallocated cells and fewer inner-cell\u2013mass cells. These findings suggest that stochasticity in division timing contributes to robust patterning.",

Deep (239\u00d7) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of brain neurons from 61 SCZ cases and 25 controls postmortem identified mutations occurring during prenatal neurogenesis. SCZ cases showed increased somatic variants in open chromatin, with increased mosaic CpG transversions (CpG>GpG) and T>G mutations at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) overlapping open chromatin, a result not seen in controls. Some of these variants alter gene expression, including SCZ risk genes and genes involved in neurodevelopment.

    "abstract": "Diverging from conventional cell division models, plant cells undergo incomplete division to generate plasmodesmata communication bridges between daughter cells. Although fundamental for plant multicellularity, the molecular events leading to bridge stabilization, as opposed to severing, remain unknown. Using electron tomography, we mapped the transition from cell plate fenestrae to plasmodesmata. We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) connects daughter cells across fenestrae, and as the cell plate matures, fenestrae contract, causing the plasma membrane (PM) to mold around constricted ER tubes. The ER\u2019s presence prevents fenestrae fusion, forming plasmodesmata, whereas its absence results in closure. The ER-PM protein tethers MCTP3, MCTP4, and MCTP6 further stabilize nascent plasmodesmata during fenestrae contraction. Genetic deletion in Arabidopsis reduces plasmodesmata formation. Our findings reveal how plants undergo incomplete division to promote intercellular communication.",

Insects and spiders play critical roles in ecosystems by accumulating and synthesizing organic nutrients such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). However, links between biodiversity and nutrient content of insect and spider communities have yet to be quantified. We relate insect and spider richness to biomass and PUFA-mass from stream and terrestrial communities encompassing nine land uses. PUFA-mass and biomass relate positively to biodiversity across ecosystems. In terrestrial systems, human-dominated areas have lower biomass and PUFA-mass than more natural areas, even at equivalent levels of richness. Aquatic ecosystems have consistently higher PUFA-mass than terrestrial ecosystems. Our findings reinforce the importance of conserving biodiversity and highlight the distinctive benefits of aquatic biodiversity.",

In this study, we translocated wild Kuhl\u2019s pipistrelle bats and tracked their homing abilities while manipulating their visual, magnetic, and olfactory sensing and accurately tracked them using a new reverse GPS system. We show that bats can identify their location after translocation and conduct several-kilometer map-based navigation using solely echolocation. This proposition was further supported by a large-scale echolocation model disclosing how bats use environmental acoustic information to perform acoustic cognitive map\u2013based navigation. We also demonstrate that navigation is improved when using both echolocation and vision.",

Large tree islands and higher initial planted diversity catalyzed diversity recovery, particularly functional diversity at the landscape level.

Here, we investigated the evolutionary origins of chimpanzee cumulative culture and why it remained incipient. To trace cultural transmission among the four chimpanzee subspecies, we compared population networks based on genetic markers of recent migration and shared cultural traits. We show that limited levels of group connectivity favored the emergence of a few instances of cumulative culture in chimpanzees. As in humans, cultural complexification likely happened in steps, with transmission between populations, incremental changes, and repurposing of technologies. We propose that divergence in social patterns led to increased mobility between groups in the genus Homo , resulting in irreversible dependence on cultural exchange and complexification.",

Protein complex function can be modulated by RNA molecules that provide allosteric regulation or act as molecular guides or scaffolds. We hypothesized that RNA plays a role in organizing MAVS signaling platforms. We found that MAVS, through its central intrinsically disordered domain, directly interacted with the 3\u2032 untranslated regions of cellular messenger RNAs. Elimination of RNA by ribonuclease treatment disrupted the MAVS signalosome, including RNA-modulated MAVS interactors that regulate RLR signaling and viral restriction, and inhibited phosphorylation of transcription factors that induce interferons. This work uncovered a function for cellular RNA in promoting signaling through MAVS and highlights generalizable principles of RNA regulatory control of immune signaling complexes.",

Although traditional flat, high-fraction sp 2 molecules, such as pyridine, can be decorated through electrophilic aromatic substitution and palladium (Pd)\u2013based cross-couplings, general strategies to derivatize three-dimensional (3D) saturated molecules are far less developed. In this work, we present an approach for the rapid, modular, enantiospecific, and diastereoselective functionalization of piperidine (saturated analog of pyridine), combining robust biocatalytic carbon-hydrogen oxidation with radical cross-coupling. This combination is directly analogous to electrophilic aromatic substitution followed by Pd-couplings for flat molecules, streamlining synthesis of 3D molecules. This study offers a generalizable strategy for accessing complex architectures, appealing to both medicinal and process chemists.",

This structural complexity imparts a rich chemistry to the isolates but has impeded synthetic access to the structures in the nearly three decades since their isolation. We present a flexible route to eight isolates that exemplify the three skeletal classes of metabolites. The route proceeds by the modular assembly of the advanced azides 38 and 49 (13 steps, 6 to 10% yield), sequential oxidative photocyclizations, and late-stage functional group manipulations. With this approach, the targets were obtained in 17 to 19 steps, 12 to 13 purifications, and 0.5 to 3.5% overall yield. The structure of an advanced intermediate was elucidated by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) analysis. The route will support structure-function and target identification studies of the securamines.",

Tumor chromatin accessibility is strongly influenced by copy number alterations that can be used to identify subclones, yet underlying cis-regulatory landscapes retain cancer type\u2013specific features. Using organ-matched healthy tissues, we identified the \u201cnearest healthy\u201d cell types in diverse cancers, demonstrating that the chromatin signature of basal-like\u2013subtype breast cancer is most similar to secretory-type luminal epithelial cells. Neural network models trained to learn regulatory programs in cancer revealed enrichment of model-prioritized somatic noncoding mutations near cancer-associated genes, suggesting that dispersed, nonrecurrent, noncoding mutations in cancer are functional. Overall, these data and interpretable gene regulatory models for cancer and healthy tissue provide a framework for understanding cancer-specific gene regulation.",

We determined the magnetic field distribution with altitude in the corona and monitored the evolution at different latitudes over multiple solar rotations. The field strength between 1.05 and 1.60 solar radii varies from <1 to ~20 gauss. A signature of active longitudes appears in the coronal magnetic field measurements.

Our findings show how signals emanating from cells on opposing sides ensure robust yet dynamically adjustable positioning of a bifacial stem cell layer.",

To elucidate shared determinants of antimalarial resistance that can empower in silico inference, we examined the genomes of 724 Plasmodium falciparum clones, each selected in vitro for resistance to one of 118 compounds. We identified 1448 variants in 128 recurrently mutated genes, including drivers of antimalarial multidrug resistance. In contrast to naturally occurring variants, those selected in vitro are more likely to be missense or frameshift, involve bulky substitutions, and occur in conserved, ordered protein domains. Collectively, our dataset reveals mutation features that predict drug resistance in eukaryotic pathogens.",

Distinct allotype pairs, however, differ in the extent to which they bind shared sets of peptides. We developed a functional divergence metric that measures pairwise complementarity of allotype-associated peptide binding profiles. Greater functional divergence for pairs of HLA-A and/or HLA-B allotypes was associated with slower AIDS progression and independently with enhanced viral load control. The metric predicts immune breadth at the peptide level rather than gene level and redefines HLA heterozygosity as a continuum differentially affecting disease outcome. Functional divergence may affect response to additional infections, vaccination, immunotherapy, and other diseases where HLA heterozygote advantage occurs.",

Annual killifish embryogenesis, however, challenges prepatterning models as blastomeres disperse and then aggregate to form the germ layers and body axes. We show that huluwa , a prepatterning factor thought to break symmetry by stabilizing \u03b2-catenin, is truncated and inactive in Nothobranchius furzeri . Nuclear \u03b2-catenin is not selectively stabilized on one side of the blastula but accumulates in cells forming the aggregate. Blocking \u03b2-catenin activity or Nodal signaling disrupts aggregate formation and germ layer specification. Nodal signaling coordinates cell migration, establishing an early role for this signaling pathway. These results reveal a surprising departure from established mechanisms of axis formation: Huluwa-mediated prepatterning is dispensable, and \u03b2-catenin and Nodal regulate morphogenesis.",

The abundances of inorganic pools increase with depth and are the only phases preserved in sediments. Changes in the particulate-Zn speciation influence Zn bioavailability and explain the decoupling of Zn and phosphorus and the correlation of Zn and silicon in the water column.

In a conventional experiment, only the amplitudes F are obtained, and the phases \u03d5 are lost. This is the crystallographic phase problem. In this work, we show that a neural network, trained on millions of artificial structure data, can solve the phase problem at a resolution of only 2 angstroms, using only 10 to 20% of the data needed for direct methods. The network works in common space groups and for modest unit-cell dimensions and suggests that neural networks could be used to solve the phase problem in the general case for weakly scattering crystals.",

Nuclide concentrations are near zero in almost all samples, suggesting that these locations were never exposed during the Holocene. Our data imply that many glaciers in the tropics are probably now smaller than they have been in at least 11,700 years, making the tropics the first large region where this milestone has been documented.",

    "abstract": "The functions of proteins generally depend on their assembly into complexes. During evolution, some complexes have transitioned from homomers encoded by a single gene to heteromers encoded by duplicate genes. This transition could occur without adaptive evolution through intermolecular compensatory mutations. Here, we experimentally duplicated and evolved a homodimeric enzyme to determine whether and how this could happen. We identified hundreds of deleterious mutations that inactivate individual homodimers but produce functional enzymes when coexpressed as duplicated proteins that heterodimerize. The structure of one such heteromer reveals how both losses of function are buffered through the introduction of asymmetry in the complex that allows them to subfunctionalize. Constructive neutral evolution can thus occur by gene duplication followed by only one deleterious mutation per duplicate.",

We comprehensively profiled the sequence dependence of DNA hairpin properties and Cas9-induced target DNA unwinding-rewinding dynamics. The ability to explore a large sequence space for Cas9 allowed us to identify a number of target sequences with unexpected behaviors.

This timekeeping phenomenon triggers adaptive responses in higher organisms, such as gonadal stimulation, flowering, and hibernation. Unexpectedly, we observed this capability in cyanobacteria\u2014unicellular prokaryotes with generation times as short as 5 to 6 hours. Cyanobacteria exposed to short, winter-like days developed enhanced resistance to cold mediated by desaturation of membrane lipids and differential programs of gene transcription, including stress response pathways. As in eukaryotes, this photoperiodic timekeeping required an intact circadian clockwork and developed over multiple cycles of photoperiod. Therefore, photoperiodic timekeeping evolved in much simpler organisms than previously appreciated and enabled genetic responses to stresses that recur seasonally.",

Complementary chemical, molecular, and genomics analyses revealed that MED6-189 targets the parasite apicoplast and acts by inhibiting lipid biogenesis and cellular trafficking. Genetic analyses revealed that a mutation in PfSec13 , which encodes a component of the parasite secretory machinery, reduced susceptibility to the drug. Its high potency, excellent therapeutic profile, and distinctive mode of action make MED6-189 an excellent addition to the antimalarial drug pipeline.",

Using mouse models of the TF Nr5a2 , we show that Nr5a2 \u2212/\u2212 embryos arrest at the early morula stage and exhibit altered lineage specification, frequent mitotic failure, and substantial chromosome segregation defects. Although NR5A2 plays a minor but measurable role during zygotic genome activation, it predominantly acts as a master regulator at the eight-cell stage, controlling expression of lineage-specifying TFs and genes involved in mitosis, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair. We conclude that NR5A2 coordinates proliferation, genome stability, and lineage specification to ensure correct morula development.",

Hormone release is controlled through metabolite-sensing proteins. Low expression, interspecies differences, and the existence of multiple EEC subtypes have posed challenges to the study of these sensors. We describe differentiation of stomach EECs to complement existing intestinal organoid protocols. CD200 emerged as a pan-EEC surface marker, allowing deep transcriptomic profiling from primary human tissue along the stomach-intestinal tract. We generated loss-of-function mutations in 22 receptors and subjected organoids to ligand-induced secretion experiments. We delineate the role of individual human EEC sensors in the secretion of hormones, including GLP-1. These represent potential pharmacological targets to influence appetite, bowel movement, insulin sensitivity, and mucosal immunity.",

The somatosensory mechanisms that underlie this behavior are unclear. We report that Piezo2-dependent mechanosensation mediates wet dog shakes evoked by water or oil droplets applied to back hairy skin of mice. Unmyelinated C-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) were activated by oil droplets, and their optogenetic activation elicited wet dog shakes. Ablation of C-LTMRs attenuated this behavior. Moreover, C-LTMRs synaptically couple to spinoparabrachial neurons, and optogenetically inhibiting spinoparabrachial neuron synapses and excitatory neurons in the parabrachial nucleus impaired both oil droplet\u2013 and C-LTMR\u2013evoked wet dog shakes. Thus, a C-LTMR\u2013spinoparabrachial pathway promotes wet dog shakes for removal of water and mechanical irritants from back hairy skin.",

Impaired splicing has been associated with diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and cellular responses remain poorly understood. In this work, we report that deficiency of ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39) in human cell lines, zebrafish larvae, and mice led to impaired spliceosome assembly and a cytotoxic splicing profile characterized by the use of cryptic 5\u2032 splice sites. Disruptive cryptic variants evaded messenger RNA (mRNA) surveillance pathways and were translated into misfolded proteins, which caused proteotoxic aggregates, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and, ultimately, cell death. The detrimental consequence of splicing-induced proteotoxicity could be mitigated by up-regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system and selective autophagy. Our findings provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of spliceosome-associated diseases.",

Here, we describe a switch from glutamine catabolism to synthesis required for erythroid cell maturation. Glutamine synthetase (GS), one of the oldest functioning genes in evolution, is activated during erythroid maturation to detoxify ammonium generated from heme biosynthesis, which is up-regulated to support hemoglobin production. Loss of GS in mouse erythroid precursors caused ammonium accumulation and oxidative stress, impairing erythroid maturation and recovery from anemia. In \u03b2-thalassemia, GS activity is inhibited by protein oxidation, leading to glutamate and ammonium accumulation, whereas enhancing GS activity alleviates the metabolic and pathological defects. Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved metabolic adaptation that could potentially be leveraged to treat common red blood cell disorders.",

We performed multielectrode recording in macaque visual and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while animals performed a visual discrimination task before and after non\u2013rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Although sleep induces synchronized fluctuations in population activity across cortical areas, the post-sleep population activity became more desynchronized relative to the pre-sleep state. The changes after sleep were correlated with an increase in information encoded in population activity in each area and improved behavioral performance. Electrically stimulating visual cortex at 4 hertz emulated the beneficial effects of sleep on network and perceptual performance. A large-scale neural network model indicated that asymmetric depression of local intracortical synapses is consistent with the observed changes in neural activity after sleep.",

    "abstract": "We tested a hypothesis that misinformation exploits outrage to spread online, examining generalizability across multiple platforms, time periods, and classifications of misinformation. Outrage is highly engaging and need not be accurate to achieve its communicative goals, making it an attractive signal to embed in misinformation. In eight studies that used US data from Facebook (1,063,298 links) and Twitter (44,529 tweets, 24,007 users) and two behavioral experiments (1475 participants), we show that (i) misinformation sources evoke more outrage than do trustworthy sources; (ii) outrage facilitates the sharing of misinformation at least as strongly as sharing of trustworthy news; and (iii) users are more willing to share outrage-evoking misinformation without reading it first. Consequently, outrage-evoking misinformation may be difficult to mitigate with interventions that assume users want to share accurate information.",

In bacteria, the small ribosomal subunit (30 S ) is recruited to many mRNAs through base pairing with the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and RNA binding by ribosomal protein bS1. Translation can initiate on nascent mRNAs, and RNA polymerase (RNAP) can promote the recruitment of the pioneering 30 S . Here, we examined 30 S recruitment to nascent mRNAs using cryo\u2013electron microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence colocalization, and in-cell cross-linking mass spectrometry. We show that bS1 delivers the mRNA to the ribosome for SD duplex formation and 30 S activation. Additionally, bS1 and RNAP stimulate translation initiation. Our work provides a mechanistic framework for how the SD duplex, ribosomal proteins, and RNAP cooperate in 30 S recruitment to mRNAs and establish transcription-translation coupling.",

Observing quantum collective phenomena with macroscopic mechanical oscillators has been impeded by the stringent requirement that oscillators be identical. We demonstrate the quantum regime for collective motion of N = 6 mechanical oscillators, a hexamer, in a superconducting circuit optomechanical platform. By increasing the optomechanical couplings, the system transitions from individual to collective motion, characterized by a N enhancement of cavity-collective mode coupling, akin to superradiance of atomic ensembles. Using sideband cooling, we prepare the collective mode in the quantum ground state and measure its quantum sideband asymmetry, with zero-point motion distributed across distant oscillators. This regime of optomechanics opens avenues for studying multipartite entanglement, with potential advances in quantum metrology.",

The prevailing view is that in the free troposphere, new particles are formed predominantly in convective cloud outflows. We present another mechanism using global observations. We find that during stratospheric air intrusion events, the mixing of descending ozone-rich stratospheric air with more moist free tropospheric background results in elevated hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations. Such mixing is most prevalent near the tropopause where the sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) mixing ratios are high. The combination of elevated SO 2 and OH levels leads to enhanced sulfuric acid concentrations, promoting particle formation. Such new particle formation occurs frequently and over large geographic regions, representing an important particle source in the midlatitude free troposphere.",

In this interaction, the hosts must regulate nodule numbers and distribution patterns to control the degree of symbiosis and maintain root growth functions. The host response to symbiotic bacteria occurs discontinuously but repeatedly at the region behind the tip of the growing roots. Here, live-imaging and transcriptome analyses revealed oscillating host gene expression with approximately 6-hour intervals upon bacterial inoculation. Cytokinin response also exhibited a similar oscillation pattern. Cytokinin signaling is crucial to maintaining the periodicity, as observed in cytokinin receptor mutants displaying altered infection foci distribution. This periodic regulation influences the size of the root region responsive to bacteria, as well as the nodulation process progression.",

Crystallographic studies show that the C-O distance in the outer form exceeds that of the final or inner adduct by 1.1 angstroms. As the system samples the two forms of the complex, which correspond to minima on the corresponding potential energy surface, the C-O linkage switches from a secondary interaction in the outer complex to a dative bond in the inner complex. This phenomenon is harnessed as a functional feature to stabilize xanthylium-based photoredox catalysts.",

However, no evaluation of these bans exists. We compile a comprehensive waste dataset covering 36 US states between 1996 and 2019 to evaluate the first five implemented state-level bans. Contrary to policy-makers\u2019 expectations, we can reject aggregate waste reductions higher than 3.2%, and we cannot reject a zero-null aggregate effect. Moreover, we cannot reject a zero-null effect for any other state except Massachusetts, which gradually achieved a 13.2% reduction.

We found an ancient lncRNA, MAYEX , that gained male-specific expression more than 89 million years ago. MAYEX evolved a notable association with the acetylated histone 4 lysine 16 (H4K16ac) epigenetic mark and the ability to loop its locus to the totality of the X chromosome to increase expression levels.

In this work, we show that the Ser 23/24 -encoding exon 3 of TNNI3 was pseudoexonized multiple times in shrews and moles to mimic Ser 23/24 phosphorylation without adrenergic stimulation, facilitating the evolution of exceptionally high resting heart rates (~1000 beats per minute). We further reveal alternative exon 3 splicing in distantly related bat families and confirm that both cTnI splice variants are incorporated into cardiac myofibrils. Because exon 3 of human TNNI3 exhibits a relatively low splice strength score, our findings offer an evolutionarily informed strategy to excise this exon to improve diastolic function during heart failure.",

We forecasted the acoustic structure of songs for a set of possible evolutionary futures (successive droughts spurring increasingly large beaks) and, in a field assay, presented resulting song simulations to territorial males. We found that responses to songs dropped off after six simulated drought events, to degrees roughly comparable to drops in response to songs that diverged through cultural drift and acoustic adaptation.

We present velocity-resolved kinetics measurements for catalytic hydrogen oxidation on palladium over a wide range of surface concentrations and at high temperatures. The rates exhibit a complex dependence on oxygen coverage and step density, which can be quantitatively explained by a density functional and transition-state theory\u2013based kinetic model involving a cooperatively stabilized configuration of at least three oxygen atoms at steps. Here, two oxygen atoms recruit a third oxygen atom to a nearby binding site to produce an active configuration that is far more reactive than isolated oxygen atoms.

However, the mechanism underlying their ability to generate a spectrum of vibrant yellows, reds, and greens remains enigmatic. We uncover a unifying chemical basis for a wide range of parrot plumage colors, which result from the selective deposition of red aldehyde- and yellow carboxyl-containing psittacofulvin molecules in developing feathers. Through genetic mapping, biochemical assays, and single-cell genomics, we identified a critical player in this process, the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2 , which oxidizes aldehyde psittacofulvins into carboxyl forms in late-differentiating keratinocytes during feather development. The simplicity of the underlying molecular mechanism, in which a single enzyme influences the balance of red and yellow pigments, offers an explanation for the exceptional evolutionary lability of parrot coloration.",

Contrary to the prevailing view of N-glycosylation as a housekeeping function, we identified an ER pathway that modulates the activity of OST-A. Genetic analyses linked OST-A to HSP90B1, an ER chaperone for membrane receptors, and CCDC134, an ER luminal protein. During its translocation into the ER, an N-terminal peptide in HSP90B1 templates the assembly of a translocon complex containing CCDC134 and OST-A that protects HSP90B1 during folding, preventing its hyperglycosylation and degradation. Disruption of this pathway impairs WNT and IGF1R signaling and causes the bone developmental disorder osteogenesis imperfecta. Thus, N-glycosylation can be regulated by specificity factors in the ER to control cell surface receptor signaling and tissue development.",

We unravel the genetic basis of sexually selected plumage traits to investigate their effects on reproductive isolation in barn swallows. The genetic architecture of sexual traits is characterized by 12 loci on two autosomes and the Z chromosome. Sexual trait loci exhibit signatures of divergent selection in geographic isolation and barriers to gene flow in secondary contact. Linkage disequilibrium between these genes has been maintained by selection in hybrid zones beyond what would be expected under admixture alone. Our findings reveal that selection on coupled sexual trait loci promotes reproductive isolation, providing key empirical evidence for the role of sexual selection in speciation.",

It has been proposed that the projected future decline in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will cause a reduction in nutrient supply and resulting productivity. In this work, we examine how the nutrient stream changed over the Younger Dryas climate reversal that marked the transition out of the last ice age. Gulf Stream nutrient content decreased, and oxygen content increased at the Florida Straits during this time of weakened AMOC. The decreased nutrient stream was accompanied by a reduction in biological productivity at higher latitudes in the North Atlantic, which supports the link postulated in theoretical and modeling studies.",

We created gene expression networks from hundreds of mouse tissue samples (both normal and tumor) and integrated these with lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-seq, to identify convergence of cell states in premalignant tumor cells expressing markers of lineage plasticity and drug resistance. Two of these cell states representing multilineage plasticity or proliferation were inversely correlated, suggesting a mutually exclusive relationship. Treatment of carcinomas in vivo with chemotherapy repressed the proliferative state and activated multilineage plasticity whereas inhibition of differentiation repressed plasticity and potentiated responses to cell cycle inhibitors. Manipulation of this cell state transition point may provide a source of potential combinatorial targets for cancer therapy.",

Using spectral hole burning, we measured an even narrower linewidth of 410 pico\u2013electron volts at 77 kelvin. Narrow linewidths allowed low-field magnetic circular dichroism at room temperature, used to sense Earth-scale magnetic fields.

Using an eco-evolutionary vegetation model, we demonstrate here that the vegetation\u2019s climate adaptation capacity, through biological evolution and geographic dispersal, is a major determinant of the severity and longevity of LIP-induced hyperthermals and can promote the emergence of a new climatic steady state. Proxy-based temperature reconstructions of the Permian-Triassic, Triassic-Jurassic, and Paleocene-Eocene hyperthermals match the modeled trajectories of bioclimatic disturbance and recovery. We conclude that biological vegetation dynamics shape the multimillion-year Earth system response to sudden carbon degassing and global warming episodes.",

We found that a subset of HSCs displays macrophage-associated markers on their cell surface. Although fully functional, these HSCs are selectively niche-retained as opposed to stem cells lacking macrophage markers, which exit the BM upon forced mobilization. Macrophage markers on HSCs could be acquired through direct transfer by trogocytosis, regulated by receptor tyrosine-protein kinase C-Kit (CD117), from BM-resident macrophages in mouse and human settings. Our study provides proof of concept that adult stem cells utilize trogocytosis to rapidly establish and activate function-modulating molecular mechanisms.",

The integrity of the kinetochore, a macromolecular complex built on centromeric DNA, is required for biorientation, but components sufficient for biorientation remain unknown. Here, we show that tethering the outer kinetochore heterodimer NDC80-NUF2 to the surface of apolar microbeads establishes their biorientation-like state in mouse cells. NDC80-NUF2 microbeads align at the spindle equator and self-correct alignment errors. The alignment is associated with stable bipolar microtubule attachment and is independent of the outer kinetochore proteins SPC24-SPC25, KNL1, the Mis12 complex, inner kinetochore proteins, and Aurora. Larger microbeads align more rapidly, suggesting a size-dependent biorientation mechanism. This study demonstrates a biohybrid kinetochore design for synthetic biorientation of microscale particles in cells.",

Because of reliance on ex vivo cell manipulation and marrow transplant, such therapies cannot lessen disease burden. To develop new small-molecule approaches, we investigated the state of BCL11A protein in erythroid cells. We report that tetramer formation mediated by a single zinc finger (ZnF0) is required for production of steady-state protein. Beyond its role in protein stability, the tetramer state is necessary for \u03b3-globin gene repression, because an engineered monomer fails to engage a critical co-repressor complex. These aspects of BCL11A protein production identify tetramer formation as a vulnerability for HbF silencing and provide opportunities for drug discovery.",

However, how the relevant cues are relayed to trigger hatching remains unknown. In this work, we show that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Trh) is the neuroendocrine activator of hatching in zebrafish. To elicit hatching, Trh neurons form a transient circuit that deposits the peptide into the embryo\u2019s circulation. Trh also activates hatching in a distantly related fish species that separated more than 200 million years ago. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved neuroendocrine circuit that controls a major life event in oviparous fish species.",

In all cases, we found that two or more phage species coexisted stably, despite competition for a single, clonal host population. Phage coexistence was supported through host phenotypic heterogeneity, whereby bacterial cells adopting different growth phenotypes served as niches for different phage species.

We found that PC precursors (prePCs) expressing high-affinity antibodies received higher levels of T follicular helper cell (T FH cell)\u2013derived help and divided at higher rates compared with their lower-affinity counterparts once they left the germinal center.

Field data and mathematical simulations showed that heterogeneity in parasitoid dispersal can generate variation in parasitism-mediated selection on hosts through time and space. Experiments showed how evolutionary trade-offs plus moderate host dispersal across this selection mosaic cause host-parasitoid coexistence and maintenance of genetic variation in host resistance.

Modifying skin identity has clinical potential, such as the conversion of residual limb and stump (nonvolar) skin of amputees to pressure-responsive palmoplantar (volar) skin to enhance prosthesis use and minimize skin breakdown. Greater keratin 9 ( KRT9 ) expression, higher epidermal thickness, keratinocyte cytoplasmic size, collagen length, and elastin are markers of volar skin and likely contribute to volar skin resiliency. Given fibroblasts\u2019 capacity to modify keratinocyte differentiation, we hypothesized that volar fibroblasts influence these features. Bioprinted skin constructs confirmed the capacity of volar fibroblasts to induce volar keratinocyte features.

Although metal-containing enzymes oxidize alkanes with remarkable ease and selectivity, chemical approaches have largely been limited to transition metal\u2013based catalytic carbon\u2013hydrogen functionalizations. Alkanes can be protonated to form pentacoordinated carbonium ions and fragmented into smaller hydrocarbons in the presence of strong Br\u00f8nsted acids. However, catalytic stereocontrol over such reactions has not previously been accomplished. We show here that strong and confined acids catalyze highly enantioselective fragmentations of a variety of cyclopropanes into the corresponding alkenes, expanding the boundaries of catalytic selective alkane activation.

How substrates are released from SRP at the ER to subsequently access translocation factors is not well understood. We found that TMEM208 can engage the substrate binding domain of SRP to accelerate release of its bound cargo. Without TMEM208, slow cargo release resulted in excessive synthesis of downstream polypeptide before engaging translocation factors. Delayed access to translocation machinery caused progressive loss of insertion competence, particularly for multipass membrane proteins, resulting in their impaired biogenesis. Thus, TMEM208 facilitates prompt cargo handover from the targeting to translocation machinery to minimize biogenesis errors and maintain protein homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Stellar superflares are energetic outbursts of electromagnetic radiation that are similar to solar flares but release more energy, up to 10 36 erg on main-sequence stars. It is unknown whether the Sun can generate superflares and, if so, how often they might occur. We used photometry from the Kepler space observatory to investigate superflares on other stars with Sun-like fundamental parameters. We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56,450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies >10 34 erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability. The resulting stellar superflare frequency-energy distribution is consistent with an extrapolation of the Sun\u2019s flare distribution to higher energies, so we suggest that both are generated by the same physical mechanism.",

However, the shear modulus in most fluids is close to zero, which makes it challenging for fluids to maintain spatial periodicity akin to photonic crystals. We realized periodic vortices in hydrodynamic metamaterials and created a bilayer moir\u00e9 superlattice by stacking and twisting two such vortex fluids. We observed energy delocalization and localization when the twist angles, respectively, result in the Pythagorean and non-Pythagorean triples in the fluidic moir\u00e9 superlattice. Anomalous localization was found even in commensurate moir\u00e9 fluids with large lattice constants that satisfy Pythagorean triples. Our work reports the moir\u00e9 phenomena in fluids and opens an unexpected door to controlling the energy transfer, mass transport, and particle navigation through the elaborate dynamics of vortices in fluidic moir\u00e9 superlattices.",

Nevertheless, on-chip frequency combs have relied predominantly on single-ring resonators. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of a novel class of frequency combs, the topological frequency combs, in a two-dimensional lattice of hundreds of ring resonators that hosts fabrication-robust topological edge states with linear dispersion. By pumping these edge states, we demonstrate the generation of a nested frequency comb that shows oscillation of multiple edge state resonances across \u224840 longitudinal modes and is spatially confined at the lattice edge. Our results provide an opportunity to explore the interplay between topological physics and nonlinear frequency comb generation in a commercially available nanophotonic platform.",

Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe an anomalous energy gap, an order of magnitude smaller than the antiferromagnetic gap, in a wide portion of the underdoped regime and smoothly connecting to the superconducting gap at optimal doping. After considering all the known ordering tendencies in tandem with the phase diagram, we hypothesize that the normal-state gap in the underdoped n-type cuprates originates from Cooper pairing. The high temperature scale of the normal-state gap raises the prospect of engineering higher transition temperatures in the n-type cuprates comparable to those of the p-type cuprates.",

Yet direct observations from the 79 North Glacier (79NG) calving front reveal decreasing Atlantic Intermediate Water (AIW) temperatures below the ice tongue from 2018 to 2021, leading to reduced ocean heat transport. This is linked to a concurrent decrease in basal melt and thinning rates at the grounding line. The origin of this AIW cooling is traced to a slowdown of the large-scale ocean circulation in the Nordic Seas, driven by European atmospheric blocking that strengthens cold air advection from the central Arctic through the Fram Strait. Blocking has driven major ocean cooling events over the last 50 years and will remain crucial in affecting Northeast Greenland\u2019s glaciers.",

We show that widespread deforestation has underpinned repeated color shifts in wild insect populations. Specifically, loss of forest has led to color changes across lineages that mimic the warning coloration of a toxic forest stonefly. Predation experiments suggest that the relative fitness of color phenotypes varies between forested and deforested habitats. Genomic and coloration analyses of 1200 specimens show repeated selection at the ebony locus controlling color polymorphism across lineages. These findings represent an example of human-driven evolution linked to altered species interactions, highlighting the possibility for populations to adapt rapidly in the wake of sudden environmental change.",

We report monthly resolved records of coral skeleton\u2013bound nitrogen isotopes (CS-\u03b4 15 N) to reconstruct denitrification in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) ODZ over the last 80 years. The data indicate strong decadal variation in ETNP denitrification, with maxima during the cool North Pacific phase of Pacific Decadal Variability. The maxima in denitrification (and thus oxygen deficiency) were likely due to stronger upwelling that enhanced productivity leading to greater oxygen demand in the thermocline. Prior findings of multidecadal-to-centennial ODZ trends were likely biased by this variability. ODZ evolution over the next century will depend on how global warming interacts with the decadal oscillations.",

We used phonologically coded lexical data from contemporary languages to infer relatedness and suggest that these methods can help study regular form changes in sign languages.

One prevailing hypothesis for the origin of the MPT is that glacial deep ocean circulation fundamentally changed, marked by a circulation \u201ccrisis\u201d at ~0.90 Ma (marine isotope stages 24 to 22) ( 3 ). Using high-resolution paired neodymium, carbon, and oxygen isotope data from the South Atlantic Ocean (Cape Basin) across the MPT, we find no evidence of a substantial change in deep ocean circulation. Before and during the early MPT (~1.30 to 1.12 Ma), the glacial deep ocean variability closely resembled that of the most recent glacial cycle. The carbon storage facilitated by developing deep ocean stratification across the MPT required only modest circulation adjustments.",

In this work, we identify a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of TCR sensitivity that guides alternative splicing of TCR signaling transcripts through an evolutionarily ultraconserved poison exon (PE) in the RNA-binding protein (RBP) TRA2\u03b2 in mouse and human. TRA2 \u03b2 - PE splicing, seen during cancer and infection, was required for TCR-induced effector T cell expansion and function. Tra2 \u03b2-PE skipping enhanced T cell response to antigen by increasing TCR sensitivity. As antigen levels decreased, Tra2 \u03b2-PE reinclusion allowed T cell survival. Finally, we found that TRA2 \u03b2-PE was first included in the genome of jawed vertebrates that were capable of TCR gene rearrangements. We propose that TRA2 \u03b2 - PE splicing acts as a gatekeeper of TCR sensitivity to shape T cell fate.",

This response, typical for most mammals, safeguards against short-term water deprivation but fails in the long term. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) use the short-term response during summer, whereas during winter, they lack thirst and survive without water for months. In this work, we show that long-term thirst suppression occurs despite hormonal and behavioral signs of a substantial fluid deficit and originates from hypoactivity of neurons in the circumventricular organs, which exhibit marked functional suppression during winter that blunts their sensitivity to thirst cues. Our work reveals a notable capacity of the evolutionarily conserved brain regions that control fluid homeostasis in mammals to enable long-term survival without water.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes have evolved diverse defense strategies against viral infection, including foreign nucleic acid degradation by CRISPR-Cas systems and DNA and RNA synthesis inhibition through nucleotide pool depletion. Here, we report an antiviral mechanism of type III CRISPR-Cas\u2013regulated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion in which ATP is converted into inosine triphosphate (ITP) by CRISPR-Cas\u2013associated adenosine deaminase (CAAD) upon activation by either cA 4 or cA 6 , followed by hydrolysis into inosine monophosphate (IMP) by Nudix hydrolase, ultimately resulting in cell growth arrest. The cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of CAAD in its apo and activated forms, together with biochemical evidence, revealed how cA 4 or cA 6 binds to the CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domain and abrogates CAAD autoinhibition, inducing substantial conformational changes that reshape the structure of CAAD and induce its deaminase activity. Our results reveal the mechanism of a CRISPR-Cas\u2013regulated ATP depletion antiviral strategy.",

    "abstract": "Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are known for their robust topological order and possess properties that are appealing for applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. An engineered quantum platform would provide opportunities to operate FQH states without an external magnetic field and enhance local and coherent manipulation of these exotic states. We demonstrate a lattice version of photon FQH states using a programmable on-chip platform based on photon blockade and engineering gauge fields on a two-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamics system. We observe the effective photon Lorentz force and butterfly spectrum in the artificial gauge field, a prerequisite for FQH states. After adiabatic assembly of Laughlin FQH wave function of 1/2 filling factor from localized photons, we observe strong density correlation and chiral topological flow among the FQH photons. We then verify the unique features of FQH states in response to external fields, including the incompressibility of generating quasiparticles and the smoking-gun signature of fractional quantum Hall conductivity. Our work illustrates a route to the creation and manipulation of novel strongly correlated topological quantum matter composed of photons and opens up possibilities for fault-tolerant quantum information devices.",

    "abstract": "The ability of anthropogenic aerosols to freeze supercooled cloud droplets remains debated. In this work, we present observational evidence for the glaciation of supercooled liquid-water clouds at industrial aerosol hot spots at temperatures between \u221210\u00b0 and \u221224\u00b0C. Compared with the nearby liquid-water clouds, shortwave reflectance was reduced by 14% and longwave radiance was increased by 4% in the glaciation-affected regions. There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness. Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles. However, rare glaciation events downwind of nuclear power plants indicate that factors other than aerosol emissions may also play a role in the observed glaciation events.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are 21- to 22-nucleotide RNAs that guide Argonaute-class effectors to targets for repression. In this work, we uncover 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), the initiating enzyme for heme biosynthesis, as a general repressor of miRNA accumulation. Although heme is known to be a positive cofactor for the nuclear miRNA processing machinery, ALAS1\u2014but not other heme biosynthesis enzymes\u2014limits the assembly and activity of Argonaute complexes under heme-replete conditions. This involves a cytoplasmic role for ALAS1, previously considered inactive outside of mitochondria. Moreover, conditional depletion of ALAS activity from mouse hepatocytes increases miRNAs and enhances siRNA-mediated knockdown. Notably, because ALAS1 is the target of a Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved siRNA drug, agents that suppress ALAS may serve as adjuvants for siRNA therapies.",
