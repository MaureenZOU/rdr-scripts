    "abstract": "Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Models are routinely used in drug development and therefore appear frequently in marketing authorization applications (MAAs) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). For a model to be a key source of evidence for a regulatory decision, it must be considered qualified for the intended use. Advice on the data expected to allow qualification of a PBPK model or platform is provided in the EMA Guideline on the reporting of PBPK modeling and simulation. The present study is an EMA review of the use of PBPK models in submitted MAAs in 2022 and 2023 focussing on the concept of qualification and the reasons why models were not considered qualified. A review of the 95 MAAs with a “full” legal basis approved during these years showed that 25 of them contained PBPK modeling. There were 65 proposed general areas of intended use for PBPK modeling identified across the applications, with the most common being a prediction of drug–drug interactions with enzymes or transporters (69%). Finally, this review showed that most of the models submitted in applications to EMA were not considered qualified for the intended use(s). The reasons identified for this are reported and the need for further EMA guidance, particularly around requirements for qualification of PBPK models, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Green tea ( Camellia sinensis ) is a commonly consumed beverage or dietary supplement. As a natural product with a myriad of proposed health benefits, patients are likely to consume green tea while taking their medications unaware of its potential to interact with drugs and influence drug efficacy and safety. Catechins are the abundant polyphenolic compounds in green tea (e.g., (−)‐epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate), which are reported to influence determinants of drug pharmacokinetics, such as drug solubility and the activity of drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes. This review summarized the results of clinical studies investigating the influence of green tea catechins on the pharmacokinetics of clinically used medications. The majority of analyses (72%) reported significant decreases (by 18–99%) in systemic drug exposure with green tea consumption (atorvastatin, celiprolol, digoxin, fexofenadine, folic acid, lisinopril, nadolol, nintedanib, raloxifene, and rosuvastatin). One analysis (6%) reported a 50% increase in drug systemic exposure (sildenafil) and for 22% of analyses drug pharmacokinetics were not affected by green tea consumption (fluvastatin, pseudoephedrine, simvastatin, and tamoxifen). For most drugs reporting an interaction, green tea catechins were proposed to decrease intestinal drug absorption by inhibiting OATP uptake (particularly OATP1A2), enhancing P‐gp efflux activity or reducing drug solubility. Case reports have associated changes in drug pharmacokinetics with green tea consumption to changes in drug efficacy or safety (e.g., nadolol and erlotinib). These findings prompt the need for further research in relating evidence from existing literature to predict additional clinically important green tea–drug interactions and to provide appropriate recommendations for patients and clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Psychedelics, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), are being investigated for the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders, for which concomitant treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is prevalent. The present study investigated the acute response to single doses of LSD (100 μg) after daily administration of paroxetine (10 mg for 7 days, followed by 20 mg for 35 days) or placebo (42 days) using a randomized, double‐blind, cross‐over design in 23 healthy participants. Paroxetine did not alter pleasant subjective effects of LSD but significantly reduced “bad drug effect,” “anxiety,” and “nausea.” No differences in autonomic effects or QTc interval after LSD administration were found between both conditions. The strong cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitor paroxetine led to higher maximal concentrations and total exposures of LSD (geometric mean ratios of 1.4 and 1.5, respectively) indicating relevant involvement of CYP2D6 in its metabolism. The extent of this inhibition was nominally highest in genetic CYP2D6 normal metabolizers and lowest in poor metabolizers. The present findings suggest that add‐on treatment with LSD to an SSRI is well‐tolerated. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions indicate that no dose adjustment of LSD seems necessary in the presence of an SSRI that inhibits CYP2D6. For SSRIs that do not relevantly inhibit CYP2D6, a dose increase of LSD might be appropriate, but due to lacking data and potential other pharmacokinetic interactions with these compounds, no definitive dose recommendation can be made.",

This review article describes the evolution of the RWE era, including pharmacoepidemiologic methods designed to support causal inferences regarding treatment effects, the role of regulators and other health authorities in establishing distributed real‐world data networks enabling analytics at scale, and the many global guidance documents on principled methods of producing RWE. This article also highlights the growing opportunity for RWE to support decision making by regulators, health technology assessment groups, clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders and provides examples of influential RWE studies. RWE holds promise to address important questions that clinical trials typically do not answer about treatment benefits and risks, and to ultimately impact public health by helping to guide decision making across the healthcare ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Despite being approved by the US FDA and the EU European Medicines Agency, the performance of esketamine nasal spray as an adjunctive therapy with an antidepressant in major depressive disorder is still controversial. Comprehensive retrieval in Embase, Pubmed, and Web of Science was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials comparing esketamine nasal spray versus control in major depressive disorder or treatment‐resistant depression. The primary efficacy outcome was a reduction of the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale, from baseline to Day 2 or Day 28 for patients with or without suicidal ideation, respectively. The long‐term efficacy outcome was the relapse rate of patients who achieved stable remission. The certainty of evidence was assessed according to the Cochrane recommendation. Esketamine nasal spray was superior to placebo in reduction of Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale from baseline to Day 28 in patients without suicidal ideation (standardized mean difference: −0.24, 95% confidence interval: −0.38, −0.09, P = 0.001, I 2 = 24%), and on Day 2 in patients with suicidal ideation (standardized mean difference: −0.30, 95% confidence interval: −0.47, −0.12, P = 0.0008, I 2 = 0%). The long‐term relapse rate was significantly lower in the esketamine nasal spray group than in the placebo/quetiapine group (risk ratio: RR: 0.60, 95% confidence interval: 0.45–0.80, I 2 = 0%). The rate of suicidal ideation was similar between the two groups. The certainty of evidence was graded as “moderate” or “high” in the abovementioned results. Esketamine nasal spray in conjunction with an antidepressant effectively controls short‐term and long‐term depressive symptoms in major depressive disorder and treatment‐resistant depression, with a manageable trade‐off between efficacy and safety.",

    "abstract": "The safety of systemic fluoropyrimidines (e.g., 5‐fluorouracil, capecitabine) is impacted by germline genetic variants in DPYD, which encodes the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme that functions as the rate‐limiting step in the catabolism of this drug class. Genetic testing to identify those with DPD deficiency can help mitigate the risk of severe and life‐threatening fluoropyrimidine‐induced toxicities. Globally, the integration of DPYD genetic testing into patient care has varied greatly, ranging from being required as the standard of care in some countries to limited clinical use in others. Thus, implementation strategies have evolved differently across health systems and countries. The primary objective of this tutorial is to provide practical considerations and best practice recommendations for the implementation of DPYD ‐guided systemic fluoropyrimidine dosing. We adapted the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) framework to cover topics including the clinical evidence supporting DPYD genotyping to guide fluoropyrimidine therapy, regulatory guidance for DPYD genotyping, key stakeholder engagement, logistics for DPYD genotyping, development of point‐of‐care clinical decision support tools, and considerations for the creation of sustainable and scalable DPYD genotype‐integrated workflows. This guide also describes approaches to counseling patients about DPYD testing and result disclosure, along with examples of patient and provider educational resources. Together, DPYD testing and clinical practice integration aim to promote safe prescribing of fluoropyrimidine therapy and decrease the risk of severe and life‐threatening fluoropyrimidine toxicities.",

This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advances in the machine learning algorithms for pharmacokinetics analysis. Specifically, we describe the common practices in data preprocessing, the application scenarios of various algorithms, and the critical challenges that require attention. Most machine learning models show comparable performance to those of population pharmacokinetics models. Tree‐based algorithms and neural networks have the most applications. Furthermore, the use of ensemble modeling techniques can improve the accuracy of these models' predictions of drug concentrations, especially the ensembles of machine learning and pharmacometrics.",

    "abstract": "Two observational studies were conducted to support an initiative to qualify translational kidney safety biomarkers as clinical drug development tools that identify tubular injury prior to changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Normal healthy volunteers provided three morning spot urine collections over 4 weeks. Patients undergoing surgical resection and intrathoracic cisplatin for malignant pleural mesothelioma provided urine samples pre‐ and postoperatively at 4, 8, and 12 hours and daily for 6 days. Using receiver‐operating characteristics curves, “statistically significant thresholds” established peak longitudinal changes for 8 biomarkers to differentiate mesothelioma patients who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) from normal healthy volunteers. We also assessed “medically significant thresholds” to differentiate mesothelioma patients who did vs. did not develop AKI. Statistically and medically significant thresholds for a fold‐change from baseline of urine creatinine (UCr)‐normalized values were established for 6 biomarkers: clusterin (2.2, 5.1); osteopontin (3.1, 7.1); N ‐acetyl‐ ß ‐ D ‐glucosaminidase (2.7, 8.1); kidney injury molecule‐1 (4.3, 7.5); cystatin C (1.8, 4.5); neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin (2.9, 7.8). For urine albumin and total protein, thresholds were established based on UCr‐normalized absolute values: (> upper limit normal, > 10× upper limit normal). Statistically significant thresholds for all biomarkers outperformed eGFR at discriminating mesothelioma subjects exposed to cisplatin from healthy volunteers, demonstrating their utility for enhancing safe drug development. Medically significant thresholds provide perspective on when patients begin to exhibit AKI. These studies have established guideposts for confirmatory studies with additional cohorts and nephrotoxicants to formally qualify the selected biomarkers with worldwide regulatory authorities.",

    "abstract": "In response to increased illicit use of synthetic opioids, various μ‐receptor antagonist formulations, with varied pharmacological characteristics, have been and are being developed. To understand how pharmacologic characteristics such as absorption rate and clearance rate affect reversal in treating community opioid overdose, we used our previously published translational opioid model. We adapted this model with in vitro receptor binding data and clinical pharmacokinetic data of three intranasal nalmefene formulations along with an intranasal naloxone formulation to study the reversal of fentanyl and carfentanil‐induced respiratory depression in chronic opioid users. Nalmefene has a longer plasma half‐life and slower unbinding from the μ‐receptor compared to naloxone. For a more rapid reversal of acute overdose‐induced respiratory depression, a fast‐absorbing antagonist formulation may be of greater utility than a slow‐absorbing one containing the same dosage of the antagonist. For preventing renarcotization caused by a long opioid exposure, a slow‐clearing antagonist with slow unbinding from the receptor may be of value. While a more potent antagonist with a longer half‐life may have the potential to facilitate recovery from respiratory depression for overdose with synthetic opioids, such interventions may also lead to longer and more pronounced withdrawal. This emphasizes the need for a nuanced consideration of several facets while choosing a μ‐receptor antagonist, dose, and formulation to treat community opioid overdose cases.",

    "abstract": "The current standard method for the analysis of potential drug–drug interactions (pDDIs) is time‐consuming and includes the use of multiple clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and the interpretation by healthcare professionals. With the emergence of large language models developed with artificial intelligence, an interesting alternative arose. This retrospective study included 30 patients with polypharmacy, who underwent a pDDI analysis between October 2022 and August 2023, and compared the performance of Chat GPT and established CDSSs (MediQ®, Lexicomp®, Micromedex®) in the analysis of pDDIs. A multidisciplinary team interpreted the obtained results and decided upon clinical relevance and assigned severity grades using three categories: (i) contraindicated, (ii) severe, (iii) moderate. The expert review identified a total of 280 clinically relevant pDDIs (3 contraindications, 13 severe, 264 moderate) using established CDSSs, compared with 80 pDDIs (2 contraindications, 5 severe, 73 moderate) using Chat GPT. Chat GPT almost entirely neglected pDDIs with the risk to QTc prolongation (85 vs. 8), which could also not be sufficiently improved by using a specific prompt. To assess the consistency of the results provided by Chat GPT, we repeated each query and found inconsistent results in 90% of the cases. In contrast, Chat GPT provided acceptable and comprehensible recommendations for specific questions on side effects. The use of Chat GPT for the identification of pDDIs cannot be recommended currently, because clinically relevant pDDIs were not detected, there were obvious errors and results were inconsistent. However, if these limitations are addressed accordingly, it is a promising platform for the future.",

After outlining the challenges and possible strategies to address the challenges in rare disease drug development (see the accompanying paper), the Real‐World Evidence (RWE) Scientific Working Group of the American Statistical Association Biopharmaceutical Section reviews the roles of RWD and RWE in clinical trials for drugs treating rare diseases. This paper summarizes relevant guidance documents and frameworks by selected regulatory agencies and the current practice on the use of RWD and RWE in natural history studies and the design, conduct, and analysis of rare disease clinical trials. A targeted learning roadmap for rare disease trials is described, followed by case studies on the use of RWD and RWE to support a natural history study and marketing applications in various settings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic cell death in the substantia nigra. While the interplay between dopamine loss and symptoms is well‐recognized, a respective quantitative link has yet to be established. The objective was to establish a biomarker‐directed clinical endpoint model for early‐stage PD patients. We developed a disease progression model using DATscan data in 196 healthy subjects and 419 Parkinson's patients to characterize the onset and progression of disease in early‐stage PD patients. This disease progression model was then linked to MDS‐UPDRS Parts I, II, and III data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) using a modified item response theory (IRT) analysis to characterize and predict the impact of dopamine loss on motor and non‐motor symptoms. Disease onset occurs ~4–15 years pre‐diagnosis. There is correlation (Spearman's rank correlation: 0.73–0.78, P < 0.001) between striatal binding ratio values (SBR) and MDS‐UPDRS total scores in early‐stage PD patients once interindividual differences in age at diagnosis and onset of symptoms are considered. Stratification by degree of damage improved the model's performance for putamen/motor symptoms but not for caudate/cognitive symptoms. The model captured changes in MDS‐UPDRS Parts I, II, and III in early‐stage, moderately progressing PD patients (60–65% of PPMI patients). In conclusion, we developed an SBR‐directed IRT model that characterizes changes in MDS‐UPDRS in > 60% of early‐stage PPMI patients for ~15 years.",

    "abstract": "The widely prescribed oral anti‐diabetic drug metformin is eliminated unchanged in the urine primarily through active tubular secretion. This process is mediated by organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), an uptake transporter expressed on the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. Metformin uptake into the liver, the site of action, is mediated by organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), which is expressed on the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes. Sixteen healthy adults participated in a clinical pharmacokinetic drug–drug interaction study in which they were orally administered metformin (50 mg) as a dual OCT1/2 substrate alone (baseline) and with cimetidine (400 mg) as an OCT inhibitor. Relative to baseline, metformin systemic plasma exposure increased by 24% ( p < 0.05) in the presence of cimetidine, which was accompanied by a disproportional decrease (8%) in metformin renal clearance ( p = 0.005). Genetic variants of OCT1 and OCT2 moderately impacted the significance and magnitude of the interaction. Collectively, we hypothesized that the cimetidine–metformin interaction involves inhibition of hepatic OCT1 as well as renal OCT2. We tested this hypothesis by developing a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and assessing potential OCT biomarkers in plasma and urine to gain mechanistic insight into the transporters involved in this interaction. The PBPK model predicted that cimetidine primarily inhibits hepatic OCT1 and, to a lesser extent, renal OCT2. The unchanged renal clearance of potential OCT2 biomarkers following cimetidine exposure supports a minimal role for renal OCT2 in this interaction.",

    "abstract": "Liver dysfunction can impact drug disposition and may lead to altered pharmacokinetics (PK). Here, we characterized the modulation in the in vivo activity of drug metabolizing enzymes and membrane transporters in populations with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (HI). Analysis of a well‐curated dataset of 357 drugs across a range of clearance mechanisms suggested that the PK of OATP1B substrates is markedly altered by HI, while changes associated with other clearance mechanisms are relatively small. Of the metabolizing enzymes, CYP1A2 and UGTs were found to be most sensitive to disease progression, while PK changes of CYP2C/CYP2D6/CYP3A substrates were relatively less impacted. The median estimated loss in OATP1B and CYP3A activities, after adjusting for alterations in plasma protein binding, was found to be about 90% ( n = 18) and 57% ( n = 53) in severe HI, compared to healthy control, respectively. Large variability of AUC change within each HI category was present for CYP3A substrates compared to OATP1B substrates. Interestingly, exposure of drugs secreted in bile was not affected, while a statistically significant ( P < 0.001) increase in AUC was noted for renally cleared drugs in severe HI. For CYP3A substrates, linear relationships ( P < 0.001) between disease‐induced AUC changes and AUC changes perpetrated by CYP3A probe inhibitor (ketoconazole/itraconazole) and the hepatic extraction ratio were evident. Similarly, there was a significant correlation between AUC changes following OATP1B inhibitor (rifampicin) and in the disease state for OATP1B substrates. Collectively, this meta‐analysis suggests differential modulation in various clearance mechanisms and provides quantitation of the progressive reduction in metabolic/transport activity in HI.",

    "abstract": "Apixaban could be a potential treatment option for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL). This analysis describes an updated two‐compartment population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model that characterizes the PK variability of apixaban in pediatric patients with ALL or LL treated with asparaginase using PK data from a phase III study (PREVAPIX). Patient type of ALL or LL was found to be a significant covariate on the apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F) and first‐order absorption rate (Ka). Pediatric patients (aged 9 months to < 18 years) with ALL or LL had a 52.4% lower Ka compared with adults; this was 81.1% lower than other pediatric patients (9 months to < 18 years) at risk of VTE. Apixaban Vc/F was estimated to be 43.1% lower in pediatric patients compared with adult patients. The updated PPK model was used to simulate and confirm apixaban fixed‐dose by weight‐tiered regimen‐achieved target exposures in pediatric patients (aged 28 days to < 18 years) with ALL or LL. In addition, a PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis was performed using a linear regression model to characterize the relationship between anti‐FXa activity (AXA) and apixaban concentration in pediatric patients with ALL or LL. The characterization of apixaban PK and PK/PD in this analysis contributes to evidence that apixaban could be a potential antithrombotic option in pediatric patients.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing target engagement for bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) is challenging, as bsAbs bind to two different targets in vivo to form a trimolecular complex (trimer), and likely display a bell‐shaped concentration–response curve. bsAbs trimer formation is expected to be related to efficacy and safety, and determining the dose level at which it is achieved may support dose selection; however, trimer levels currently cannot be quantified in vivo. GEN1042 (DuoBody®‐CD40x4‐1BB)—a novel, agonistic bsAb—combines targeting and conditional activation of co‐stimulatory molecules CD40 and 4‐1BB on immune cells, resulting in enhanced priming and reactivation of tumor‐specific immunity. We describe data and models that supported GEN1042 dose selection for expansion, including a minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic and receptor occupancy (mPBPK/RO) model that can predict levels of GEN1042 trimers crosslinked to CD40 and 4‐1BB in tumors and lymph nodes to guide dose selection. The model leverages PK data, physiologic parameters, and in vitro data from the literature for parameterization of GEN1042 kinetics and distribution, its interaction with target receptors CD40 and 4‐1BB, and their expression on the surface of various cell types. Trimer level outcomes were further assessed with clinical data for dose selection. An initial expansion dose of GEN1042 100 mg every 3 weeks was chosen based on available clinical safety/tolerability, efficacy, PK/pharmacodynamics data, mPBPK/RO, and exposure–response analysis. This dose level is currently being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab, with or without chemotherapy, in the expansion phase of the GEN1042 phase 1/2 trial (NCT04083599); other alternative doses are currently being explored.",

In Japan, RWD/RWE have been practically utilized as an external control for drug approval. Most cases were related to orphan diseases where the feasibility of conducting randomized controlled clinical trials was generally low. The utilization of RWD/RWE as an external control provides additional information that can support regulatory review for drug approval. However, many points should be taken into consideration through all stages of a study that is based on RWD/RWE, including planning, analysis, and interpretation. In this article, we present our recent review experience focusing on efficacy evaluations with an external control based on RWD/RWE that were submitted as a part of new drug applications in Japan, and we describe our regulatory consideration of the utilization of RWD/RWE for drug evaluation and approval. Points described in this article promote appropriate drug development based on RWD/RWE and facilitate a proper discussion about RWD/RWE utilization with PMDA. Further accumulation of regulatory experience in PMDA with RWD/RWE utilization will enhance our knowledge and contribute to better regulatory decision making for drug approvals based on RWD/RWE.",

    "abstract": "The value of a medicine is defined by its impact on patients, caregivers, health system, and society. A pharmaceutical company will generate evidence to demonstrate this value in various studies, including randomized clinical trials, non‐interventional and observational studies, real‐world data analyses, modeling, and simulation. The quality and strength of the evidence supporting a medicine's effectiveness, safety and product quality will drive decisions by healthcare system stakeholders for marketing authorization (regulatory authorities). Additional evidence of comparative clinical, humanistic, economic, and societal value of the medicine will be critical for reimbursement coverage by HTA (health technology assessment) bodies and payers, guideline inclusion by clinical societies, and ultimately the treatment decision between a patient and their healthcare provider (HCP). The purpose of this article is to provide practical guidance for an effective approach to evidence planning for pharmaceutical companies. In the first section, we give a brief overview of the requirements for evidence generation from the perspectives of healthcare system decision makers, key functions involved in evidence generation within a pharmaceutical company, and different archetypes of products. We then discuss how a company can implement effective integrated evidence planning across the lifecycle of a product. We also review how requirements are likely to evolve given recent changes in major healthcare system regulations, such as Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) drug price negotiations in the US and EU HTA Regulation (HTAR) in Europe, and finally provide some practical recommendations of how to start implementing a new integrated evidence approach.",

    "abstract": "Understanding cytokine‐related therapeutic protein–drug interactions (TP‐DI) is crucial for effective medication management in conditions characterized by elevated inflammatory responses. Recent FDA and ICH guidelines highlight a systematic, risk‐based approach for evaluating these interactions, emphasizing the need for a thorough mechanistic understanding of TP‐DIs. This study integrates the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for TP (specifically interleukin‐6, IL‐6) with small‐molecule drug PBPK models to elucidate cytokine‐related TP‐DI mechanistically. The integrated model successfully predicted TP‐DIs across a broad range of both constant and fluctuating IL‐6 levels, as observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, HIV‐infection, and those undergoing hip‐surgery or bone marrow transplantation (all simulated AUC and Cmax ratios were within a twofold error of the observed data). Constant IL‐6 levels that would be associated with mild, moderate, and strong inhibitory interactions were estimated. The time‐course and extent of TP‐DI potential were also assessed in cytokine storm triggered by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (COVID‐19) and T‐cell engager therapies (blinatumomab, mosunetuzumab, and epcoritamab). Additionally, scenarios involving concurrent CYP enzyme suppression by IL‐6 and induction by rifampicin were assessed for the magnitude of drug interaction. By providing a robust mechanistic framework for understanding cytokine–drug interactions and establishing reliable exposure–response relationships, this study enhances predictive accuracy and informs human dosing strategies. It demonstrates the potential of PBPK models to improve therapeutic decision making and patient care, particularly in inflammatory conditions.",

Particularly, predictive biomarkers help tailor medical care to individual patients; however, also prognostic biomarkers require consideration at the design stage. At the time of initiating a clinical trial, there may be uncertainty about whether a biomarker is predictive or prognostic, and the trial design may need to account for this. Relevant discussions between drug developers and regulators on the role of a biomarker in a specific drug development program are expected to take place during Scientific Advice (SA) procedures. SA procedures at the European Medicines Agency from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020, were systematically searched for methodological discussions around the use of predictive or prognostic biomarkers. The final analysis included 45 SA procedures for which key characteristics were summarized quantitatively. Selected methodological issues such as the cutoff selection of continuous biomarkers or study design considerations were elaborated in a qualitative summary. Our results identify commonly encountered points for discussion between drug developers and the European Medicines Agency for biomarker‐informed patient selection and enrollment. Identified topics addressed during SA procedures include cutoff selection, study design, multiplicity control, and data‐driven subgroup selection. The majority of the identified 45 SA procedures concern development programs in oncology. Addressing these issues upfront will allow for an improved dialogue between drug developers and regulators and support the drug development program and ultimately patient‐centered access to medicines.",

    "abstract": "Immunization rates of maternal influenza vaccination during pregnancy remain suboptimal, with concerns about potential harm to the mothers and their offspring. We conducted a population‐based cohort study, using mother–child linked database in Korea: (a) maternal cohort between December 2019, and March 2022; (b) neonatal cohort between September 2020, and June 2021. Exposure was defined as influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Study outcomes included gestational outcomes, vaccine‐related adverse events, and other health outcomes in mothers and childbirth and immune‐related health outcomes in children. After 1‐to‐1 propensity score matching using diverse potential confounders, effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the log‐binomial model for cumulative outcomes and the Cox proportional model for time‐to‐event outcomes. After 1‐to‐1 propensity score matching, we identified 174,008 and 53,344 pairs for the maternal and neonatal cohorts, respectively. In the maternal cohort, influenza vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with preeclampsia, antenatal bleeding, and various adverse outcomes, including neurological, vascular, blood, and lymphatic system disorders, except for marginally elevated risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (effect estimate 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.08) and postpartum hemorrhage (1.05, 1.01 to 1.08). In the neonatal cohort, maternal influenza vaccination did not increase risks of childbirth (e.g., preterm/low birth weight, congenital malformations, mortality) and immune‐related outcomes, except for a slightly increased risk of lower respiratory tract infection (1.06, 1.007 to 1.12). In this population‐based cohort study, influenza vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse outcomes in mothers and their offspring.",

    "abstract": "Drug development is a lengthy process with considerable uncertainty at each milestone. Several trials are needed to progress to confirmatory evaluation and establish a positive benefit–risk balance. One of the critical milestones is the decision to progress to phase III based on phase II trial results. Use of probability of success is becoming standard in pharmaceutical companies to support this decision. However, the lack of consistency in terminology makes it difficult to assess the comparative value of different approaches. By leveraging the availability of high‐quality external data (e.g., real‐world data, historical clinical trial data, etc.), probability of success‐based procedures may further improve decision‐making. We performed a scoping review of approaches to calculate the probability of success of a phase III trial depending on the available data sources and the availability of specific endpoints. Calculation of probability of success is relatively straightforward if data for the primary endpoint of the phase III trial are also available in phase II trials. Often, phase II trials are based on biomarker or surrogate outcomes, due to challenges associated with study duration and required sample size. Probability of success‐based procedures as reviewed can incorporate external data sources, for example, from clinical trials testing the same or similar drug or real‐world data on the targeted population—optimizing the calculation of probability of trial success and the projected drug candidate value. We conclude the paper by reflecting on alternative approaches and ideas for uses within pharmaceutical companies and academia.",

    "abstract": "Obeldesivir is an oral nucleoside analog prodrug inhibitor of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase and other viral polymerases. Here, two Phase I studies evaluated potential drug–drug interactions between obeldesivir and substrates or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 and drug transporters in healthy participants. When obeldesivir was tested as a precipitant, pharmacokinetic parameter point estimates for midazolam (CYP3A4 inhibition/induction), caffeine (CYP1A2 inhibition), and metformin (organic cation transporter 1 inhibition) exposures were within 80–125% no‐effect bounds representing the interval within which a systemic exposure change does not warrant clinical action based on EMA/FDA guidance. Dabigatran (P‐glycoprotein substrate) and pitavastatin (organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1/1B3 substrate) exposures decreased by approximately 25% and 30%, respectively, with obeldesivir coadministration; these were considered not clinically relevant, as these exposure changes are not associated with dose changes or precautions in the US prescribing information for these drugs. When obeldesivir was evaluated as an object, exposures of GS‐441524, the parent nucleoside metabolite of obeldesivir, were within the 80–125% no‐effect bounds for ritonavir (P‐glycoprotein inhibition) and cyclosporin A (breast cancer resistance protein inhibition) coadministration [Correction added on 7 February 2025, after first online publication: The word monophosphate has been removed in this version.]. Famotidine (gastric acid suppression) coadministration decreased GS‐441524 exposure by approximately 26%; this was within the range of exposures observed in previous Phase III studies and was considered not clinically relevant. Obeldesivir was well tolerated, and adverse events were mild to moderate. These findings indicate that obeldesivir has low potential for drug–drug interactions. Obeldesivir remains a promising treatment against a broad spectrum of viruses given its antiviral activity and favorable safety profile.",

    "abstract": "Ritonavir‐boosted atazanavir is a victim of drug–drug interaction with rifampicin, a key component of antitubercular treatment. In a recent dose escalation clinical trial, we showed that increasing atazanavir/ritonavir to 300/100 mg b.i.d. compensates for reduced drug exposure in plasma due to rifampicin, but the intracellular effects remained unexplored. This sub‐study investigated the intracellular penetration of atazanavir/ritonavir and dolutegravir into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Twenty‐six healthy volunteers living with HIV, virologically suppressed, and taking atazanavir/ritonavir containing regimens were enrolled. The trial consisted of four sequential periods: PK1, participants were on atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg q.d.; at PK2, rifampicin 600 mg q.d. and dolutegravir 50 mg b.i.d. were added (2 weeks); at PK3, atazanavir/ritonavir dose was increased to 300/100 mg b.i.d. (1 week); at PK4, rifampicin dose was doubled (1 week). Atazanavir, ritonavir, and dolutegravir were quantified in plasma and PBMC using LC–MS/MS methods to evaluate steady‐state concentrations at the end of each period. Atazanavir/ritonavir dose escalation successfully restored intracellular concentrations comparable to those observed without rifampicin, with a geometric mean ratio of 0.99 (CI 90 0.72–1.41) for atazanavir at PK3 compared with PK1. The intracellular concentration of dolutegravir increased significantly with atazanavir/ritonavir dose escalation, similar to plasma. Finally, further, increasing the rifampicin dose did not show an additional impact on atazanavir/ritonavir concentrations in PBMC. The study confirms that increasing the ATV/r dose can be an effective strategy for compensating rifampicin effects even at the intracellular level, supporting its use in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Patients with rare diseases worldwide face substantial unmet therapeutic needs. In Japan, drug lag—delays in drug approval compared to other countries—has resurfaced as a pressing public health issue. This study analyzes orphan drugs (ODs) approved in the United States (US) from 2005 to 2021, examining OD lag trends, and research and development (R&D) models to streamline OD development in Japan. Despite increased OD approval in the United States since 2018, the number of unapproved ODs in Japan has substantially increased. Although OD lag decreased, it has resurged since 2017. This is largely due to changes in the R&D strategies of pharmaceutical companies, which are driven by the growing presence of US‐ and Europe‐based small‐ to mid‐sized enterprises (SMEs) and the evolving industry landscape. Large foreign pharmaceutical companies have shifted toward a global development strategy for Japan, aiming for more efficient development and competitive advantage. This has been propelled by a move toward in‐licensing earlier‐stage drug candidates with global exclusivity from SMEs. Japanese pharmaceutical companies have focused on in‐licensing late‐stage drug candidates for the Japanese market from SMEs without a business presence in Japan, which have not been developed locally, thereby employing a bridging strategy for Japan. With the increase in ODs developed in the United States by these SMEs, this practice has substantially exacerbated the OD lag. As these SMEs are unlikely to enter the Japanese market, it is crucial for Japanese pharmaceutical companies to proactively pursue earlier, more proactive global partnerships with SMEs.",

    "abstract": "Epcoritamab is a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody that activates T cells to kill CD20‐expressing B cells. Epcoritamab is approved for the treatment of adults with different types of relapsed or refractory lymphoma in various geographies, including the United States, Europe, and Japan. Epcoritamab demonstrated an overall response rate of 63%, a complete response rate of 39%, and manageable safety with the approved dosing regimen (0.16‐mg and 0.8‐mg step‐up doses and 48‐mg full dose, with dosing every week in cycles 1–3, every 2 weeks in cycles 4–9, and every 4 weeks in cycles ≥ 10) in patients with relapsed or refractory large B‐cell lymphoma from the phase 1/2 EPCORE® NHL‐1 trial expansion through January 31, 2022. Exposure–efficacy analyses including the EPCORE NHL‐1 and EPCORE NHL‐3 trials revealed that higher exposure was associated with a higher overall response rate, complete response rate, progression‐free survival, and overall survival. A potential plateau of efficacy was observed at 48 mg or above. The exposure–safety analyses of these trials did not identify any safety concerns with the approved dosing regimen. No associations were detected between exposure and safety endpoints. The step‐up doses were clinically active and helped mitigate cytokine release syndrome risk at the subsequent full doses. Most initial responses (94%) were observed during the weekly dosing period, and most responders with large B‐cell lymphoma maintained or improved their response during every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks dosing. Overall, these analyses support the approved single‐agent epcoritamab 0.16/0.8/48‐mg dosing regimen in relapsed or refractory large B‐cell lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated whether drugs approved for other indications that also target metabolic drivers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) pathogenesis are associated with delayed onset of ADRD. Using routinely collected healthcare data from two population‐based data sources from the US (Medicare) and UK (CPRD), we conducted active comparator, new‐user cohort studies. Four alternate analytic and design specifications were implemented: (1) an as‐treated follow‐up approach, (2) an as‐started follow‐up approach incorporating a 6‐month induction period, (3) incorporating a 6‐month symptom to diagnosis period to account for misclassification of ADRD onset, and (4) identifying ADRD through symptomatic prescriptions and diagnosis codes. Of the 10 drug pairs evaluated, hydrochlorothiazide vs. dihydropyridine CCBs showed meaningful reductions in 3 out of 4 analyses that addressed specific biases including informative censoring, reverse causality, and outcome misclassification (pooled hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] across Medicare and CPRD: 0.81 [0.75–0.88] in Analysis 1, 0.98 [0.92–1.06] in Analysis 2, 0.83 [0.75–0.91] in Analysis 3, 0.75 [0.65–0.85] in Analysis 4).

Other analyses suggested likely no major differences in risk (probenecid, salbutamol, montelukast, propranolol/carvedilol, and anastrozole) or had limited precision precluding a definitive conclusion (semaglutide, ciloztozol, levetiracetam). Future replication studies should be considered to validate our findings.",

Triple‐ACTs have emerged as a viable alternative treatment to combat declining ACT efficacy due to drug‐resistant malaria. In this study, we developed and evaluated an optimal fixed‐dose regimen of artemether‐lumefantrine‐amodiaquine through population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Three published population‐based pharmacometric models and two large cohorts of observed adult subjects and pediatric malaria patients were used to simulate pharmacokinetic profiles of different dosing strategies. Based on simulated total exposure and peak concentrations, an optimal dose regimen was developed resulting in an extension of the current 4 weight bands to a total of 5 weight bands to generate equivalent exposures in all body weight groups and minimize the fluctuation in exposure between patients. The proposed drug‐to‐drug ratio of artemether‐lumefantrine‐amodiaquine (20:120:40 mg) was kept constant throughout the dosing bands in order to simplify manufacturing, implementation, and further development of a fixed‐dose co‐formulated product.",

    "abstract": "Conducting clinical studies on drug–drug‐gene interactions (DDGIs) and extrapolating the findings into clinical dose recommendations is challenging due to the high complexity of these interactions. Here, physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling networks present a new avenue for exploring such complex scenarios, potentially informing clinical guidelines and handling patient‐specific DDGIs at the bedside. Moreover, they provide an established framework for drug–drug interaction (DDI) submissions to regulatory agencies. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme is particularly prone to DDGIs due to the high prevalence of genetic variation and common use of CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs. In this study, we present a comprehensive PBPK network covering CYP2D6 drug–gene interactions (DGIs), DDIs, and DDGIs. The network covers sensitive and moderate sensitive substrates, and strong and weak inhibitors of CYP2D6 according to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. For the analyzed CYP2D6 substrates and inhibitors, DD(G)Is mediated by CYP3A4 and P‐glycoprotein were included. Overall, the network comprises 23 compounds and was developed based on 30 DGI, 45 DDI, and seven DDGI studies, covering 32 unique drug combinations. Good predictive performance was demonstrated for all interaction types, as reflected in mean geometric mean fold errors of 1.40, 1.38, and 1.56 for the DD(G)I area under the curve ratios as well as 1.29, 1.43, and 1.60 for DD(G)I maximum plasma concentration ratios. Finally, the presented network was utilized to calculate dose adaptations for CYP2D6 substrates atomoxetine (sensitive) and metoprolol (moderate sensitive) for clinically untested DDGI scenarios, showcasing a potential clinical application of DDGI model networks in the field of model‐informed precision dosing.",

    "abstract": "The decision‐making process in drug development involves “go/no‐go” decisions, particularly at the transition from early to late‐stage trials. While the decisions are solely made by drug developers, they must take into account the perspectives of multiple stakeholders—such as regulatory agencies, HTA bodies, payers, patients, and ethics committees—to ensure well‐informed and robust decision‐making. These perspectives influence key considerations, including resource allocation, risk mitigation, regulatory compliance, etc. To support this process, quantitative methodologies, including Bayesian and hybrid frequentist‐Bayesian approaches, have been introduced to improve decision‐making. However, these methodologies often do not fully account for the diverse priorities and needs of all stakeholders. This scoping review examines criteria and methods used in decision‐making at the phase II to III transition, with a focus on broadening the probability of success (PoS) concept beyond efficacy alone. Our review explores PoS for different success definitions, such as regulatory approval, market access, financial viability, and competitive performance. Key themes include decision criteria selection, trial design optimization, utility‐based approaches, financial metrics, and multi‐stakeholder considerations in decision‐making. Our findings highlight both the limitations of current methodologies and potential paths forward, including the integration of real‐world data (RWD) and advanced analytics. This work complements a companion manuscript by Cetinyurek‐Yavuz et al . (2025) providing a detailed review of PoS methodologies focused solely on efficacy, specifically PoS for achieving statistical significance in phase III studies, including definitions, terminologies, and analytical approaches. Together, these studies provide a foundation for advancing late‐stage trial decisions toward a more balanced, data‐driven, and stakeholder‐aligned approach.",

    "abstract": "A clinical trial was carried out to investigate the pharmacogenetics of single‐dose pravastatin and pitavastatin pharmacokinetics in 173 and 164 healthy participants. Additionally, 96 participants were included from previous pharmacogenetic studies with pravastatin. In a genome‐wide meta‐analysis of pravastatin including all 269 participants, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (rs4149056) was associated with increased AUC 0‐∞ ( P = 9.8 × 10 −12 ). Similarly, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C was genome‐wide significantly associated with increased AUC 0‐∞ of pitavastatin ( P = 9.7 × 10 −15 ). Candidate gene analyses suggested that participants with increased function SLCO1B1 variants had decreased pravastatin exposure. Furthermore, decreased function CYP2C9 variants may increase pitavastatin and pitavastatin lactone exposure. Compared to participants with normal function SLCO1B1 genotype, the AUC 0‐∞ of pravastatin was 140% (90% confidence interval: 86–210%; P = 4.7 × 10 −8 ) and 37% (20–56%; P = 1.1 × 10 −4 ) greater in participants with poor and decreased function SLCO1B1 genotype, respectively, while participants with highly increased function SLCO1B1 genotype had a 60% (39–75%; P = 6.0 × 10 −4 ) lower AUC 0‐∞ . The AUC 0‐∞ of pitavastatin was 153% (100–222%; P = 1.6 × 10 −9 ) and 35% (8–69%; P = 0.027) greater in participants with poor and decreased function SLCO1B1 genotype, respectively, than in those with normal function SLCO1B1 genotype. Participants with intermediate metabolizer CYP2C9 genotype had 18% (3–34%; P = 0.046) greater AUC 0‐∞ of pitavastatin than those with normal metabolizer CYP2C9 genotype. This study demonstrates the important role of SLCO1B1 in pravastatin and pitavastatin pharmacokinetics and suggests that CYP2C9 variants also affect the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin.",

    "abstract": "Tailoring pharmacogenomic (PGx) implementation to diverse populations is vital to promoting health equity. We assessed prescriptions for medications with potentially actionable PGx information to identify patient characteristics associated with differential PGx medication exposure. We analyzed the nationally‐representative MEPS dataset of adults who reported receiving prescriptions between 2014 and 2021. PGx medications include those the FDA and CPIC designate as having drug‐gene associations supported by scientific evidence. With the primary outcome being PGx prescriptions, we performed Poisson regression adjusted for all other relevant covariates. In our final population ( N = 119,722, 72% White/20% Black/4% Asian/8% Hispanic), 61% were prescribed a PGx medication, 56% were female, and 97% held health insurance coverage. Adults with private health insurance (65%) or public Medicaid/Medicare coverage (32%) were more likely to have PGx prescriptions than the uninsured (3%). Individuals with cardiovascular conditions [adjusted IRR (aIRR) = 1.45, 95% CI 1.41, 1.48], high cholesterol [aIRR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.35, 1.40], high blood pressure [aIRR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.12, 1.16], and cancer [aIRR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00, 1.04] were more likely to receive PGx prescriptions. Self‐reported Blacks were less likely than Whites to receive PGx medications [aIRR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.90, 0.94], and among those with health conditions, the likelihood of PGx medication exposure for underrepresented groups (Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians) was lower than for Whites. Our study using a comprehensive list of PGx medications in a nationally representative dataset indicates that certain populations are differentially exposed to genomically informed medications. This may suggest that if implementing a pharmacogenomics program based on reactive testing initiated by a prescription, a small underrepresentation of the Black population could be expected because of an underlying prescription disparity. Secondly, if implementing a pharmacogenomics program based on targeted preemptive testing, using clinical indication/comorbidity may be a reasonable way to enrich the population for prescriptions that would benefit from genotype tailoring.",

    "abstract": "Statin pharmacogenetic implementation guidelines are derived from evidence of primarily Eurocentrically biased study populations. Functional SLCO1B1 variants that are rare in these study populations have not been equitably investigated and are thus missing from guidelines. The objective of this precision medicine health equity study was to determine the clinical validity of understudied candidate functional SLCO1B1 variants common in people with 1,000 Genomes sub‐Saharan African superpopulation (1KG‐AFR‐like) genetic similarity. We conducted our analyses using the real‐world evidence of participants from three large, electronic health record‐linked biobanks. We used bilirubin levels (as an endogenous substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide [OATP1B1] function) and severe statin‐induced myotoxicity phenotypes. Loss‐of‐function splice variant rs77271279 ( P = 1.1 × 10 −17 ) had the strongest association with elevated total bilirubin levels in Black participants (mean 84% AFR‐like genetic similarity) followed by missense variant rs59502379 ( P = 7.4 × 10 −12 ) then missense variant rs4149056 ( P = 6.0 × 10 −5 ). In an exploratory subset of the Black study population who used statins ( n = 77 severe statin‐induced myotoxicity cases), rs59502379 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–7.52), but not rs77271279 (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 0.62–4.73) was associated with myotoxicity. Sensitivity analyses in participants with >5% AFR‐like genetic similarity corroborated these findings. For white participants, rs77271279 and rs59502379 were rare precluding subsequent analyses. Our findings highlight the clinical relevance for understudied SLCO1B1 variants on pharmacogenetic testing panels with a potential immediate impact on reducing the risk of severe statin‐induced myotoxicity primarily in Black patients, a group historically excluded from genomic research. Future studies require larger statin user study populations with less heterogeneity by statin type.",

    "abstract": "Real‐world evidence involving healthcare database studies is well established for making causal inferences in post‐market drug safety studies and methods, data, and research infrastructure for evaluating effectiveness have advanced in recent years. The rapidly expanding field of etiologic research using insurance claims and electronic health records databases is being evaluated for supporting effectiveness claims. One such use case to support regulatory decision‐making on effectiveness is for expanding indications beyond existing effectiveness claims. Confidence in the validity of findings from cohort studies conducted using databases (hereafter “database study”) to support indication expansions could be increased through a structured benchmarking process of an initial database study against RCT evidence followed by calibration of a subsequent database study based on differences in results observed in the initial RCT‐database pair. This paper proposes a benchmark, expand, and calibration (BenchExCal) approach to trial emulation and describes the design and process for evaluating the performance of the approach through both simulation studies; five planned empirical examples are also described. The project will provide insights regarding how a first‐stage benchmarking emulation of a completed trial for an existing indication can be used to calibrate, increase confidence, and improve interpretation of the results for a second‐stage emulation of a hypothetical trial that could potentially provide evidence for an expanded indication. Although the examples have been selected to provide a variety of learnings, five use cases do not address all clinical and data scenarios that may be encountered when seeking a supplemental indication for a marketed drug.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the association of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients across different subgroups, we searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SGLT2i with the control groups among T2DM patients and including DKA as a safety outcome. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using random or fixed‐effects models, as appropriate. An inverse–variance‐weighted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to estimate the genetic correlation. Twenty‐two trials involving 80,235 patients were included. SGLT2i increased the risk of DKA compared to the control groups (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.64–3.27). The risk was significantly increased in patients with higher HbA1c levels (> 7.9%) (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.59–3.14), but not in those with lower HbA1c levels (≤ 7.9%) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.49–2.26; interaction P = 0.034). SGLT2i increased DKA risk in chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.55–4.71) and high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk trials (RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.47–4.11) but not significantly in heart failure (HF) trials (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.51–2.96). Moreover, in the HF trials, SGLT2i consistently did not increase the risk of DKA in any clinical subgroups. Nevertheless, MR analysis still confirmed a genetic association between SGLT2i and the risk of DKA among overall T2DM patients. SGLT2i may increase the risk of DKA in T2DM patients, particularly in patients with higher levels of HbA1c and those with comorbid CKD or at high‐risk ASCVD. However, the increased risk was not significant in patients with HF.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric patients with advanced‐stage newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) were treated with brentuximab vedotin (BV) combined with adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A + AVD). Weight‐based BV dosing is employed in adult patients, while both body weight‐ and body surface area (BSA)‐based dosing are used in pediatric patients. Data from two pediatric studies were used for a population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. Study 1 was a phase I/II dose‐escalation study in which patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large‐cell lymphoma or HL received single‐agent weight‐based BV 1.4–1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Study 2 tested BSA‐based BV 48 mg/m 2 every 2 weeks with AVD in patients with advanced‐stage, newly diagnosed HL. Sources of PK variability were quantified using nonlinear mixed‐effects modeling. The relationships between antibody‐drug conjugate (ADC) or payload monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) exposures and progression‐free survival (PFS) or incidence of adverse events were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression, respectively. Population PK models of ADC and MMAE were developed using data from 95 patients. BSA was identified as a significant covariate for the clearance of ADC and MMAE. BSA‐based BV dosing resulted in similar systemic exposures of ADC and MMAE in pediatric patients across age groups (< 12, 12–16, and > 16 years). A significant increase ( P < 0.05) in the incidence of febrile neutropenia was related to increasing exposure of MMAE. No apparent relationship was identified between ADC or MMAE exposures and PFS. The analyses support BSA‐based BV dosing in combination with AVD in pediatric patients.",

    "abstract": "While endogenous cortisol secretion rises in the early morning, the number of lymphocytes in the blood is higher at night, thus exhibiting an antiphase pattern to cortisol secretion. Therefore, compared with the daytime, the infiltration of lymphocytes into immune‐reactive tissues is enhanced at night. This study aimed to determine whether the administration of methylprednisolone (mPSL) in the evening is more effective against T cell‐mediated rejection (TCMR) after liver transplantation compared with morning administration. This study used a randomized, open‐label, parallel‐group comparison design. Pediatric patients scheduled to undergo living‐donor liver transplantation were randomly divided into morning (8:00 a.m.) and evening (8:00 p.m.) mPSL administration groups. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of TCMR within 14 days of surgery. Sixty‐two patients were enrolled between 2014 and 2023, and six patients were excluded from the analysis as their dose of mPSL deviated from the protocol within 14 days after surgery. Of the 56 subjects analyzed, TCMR was detected in 10 of the morning group ( n = 29) and three of the evening group ( n = 27) within 14 days after surgery. Stratified analysis of patients who did not receive preoperative rituximab treatment showed that none of the evening group and 36.4% of the morning group developed TCMR within 14 days after surgery ( P < 0.01, 95% confidence interval; 2.00–infinity). Safety evaluation results were comparable between the two groups. This study shows that the evening administration of mPSL is an effective approach for suppressing TCMR. This study is hypothesis generating, and replication in further studies is needed.",

    "abstract": "The ICH M12 Guideline on Drug Interaction Studies is the result of a harmonization process led by global regulatory and industry experts with experience in drug–drug interaction (DDI) assessments and interpretation. The Expert Working Group (EWG) built on areas of regional consensus and identified solutions to topics lacking initial consensus. This article describes the topics addressed in the guideline, with emphasis on areas that required extensive discussion. It mentions topics that were the subject of comments during the public consultation period. The scope of the guideline is pharmacokinetic DDIs mediated by metabolic enzymes and drug transporters. It describes in vitro and clinical DDI studies and predictive modeling evaluations conducted during drug development. The understanding of DDI liability, in the context of the intended patient population, guides the development of risk management strategies. In the in vitro area, this article describes the considerations that support the use of experimentally measured fraction unbound for drugs with > 99% protein binding, modification of several in vitro criteria used to recommend a clinical DDI study and modification of DDI assessment for metabolites. Areas of close attention by the EWG for clinical evaluation included the use of endogenous biomarker studies, the use of nested DDI studies, and the establishment of no‐effect boundaries. The article indicates the value of describing a general process for evaluating UGT‐mediated DDIs, although specific criteria are not available. The guideline describes the current understanding of the role of predictive modeling in DDI evaluation. The topics described in this article can stimulate further growth in the science of DDI assessments.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic antibodies are often prescribed off‐label to pregnant patients to treat inflammatory, autoimmune, or malignant conditions. Despite their broad use, the extent of fetal exposure to such therapeutic antibodies and the risk to fetal development remain largely unknown. Given the ethical challenges to conduct randomized trials in pregnant patients, modeling and simulation approaches offer an opportunity to yield mechanistic insights using data from observational studies. In this study, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling framework was developed to predict maternal and fetal therapeutic antibody exposures throughout pregnancy. The model incorporates expression data on the placental neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), a receptor critical to transplacental IgG transfer. FcRn‐mediated transplacental antibody transfer was described by three endosomal compartments: (1) maternal vascular endothelial cells; (2) syncytiotrophoblast cells; and (3) fetal vascular endothelial cells. The model was calibrated and validated using endogenous IgG concentrations and pharmacokinetic data from > 2,000 non‐pregnant subjects, 167 pregnant women, and 268 infants. Overall, the minimal PBPK model adequately captured the observations, with predictions falling within a twofold range of maternal and fetal concentrations as follows: infliximab (54% and 50%), adalimumab (100% and 70%), ustekinumab (38% and 41%), vedolizumab (92% and 77%), and etanercept (75% and 33%). In addition, the PBPK framework supported the evaluation of infliximab and adalimumab dosing regimens that maintain maternal therapeutic levels while minimizing fetal exposure. This study provides a generalizable PBPK framework including FcRn ontogeny, implemented in a user‐friendly tool, to predict transplacental transfer of many biologics and to support appropriate dosing regimens throughout pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Measuring medication discontinuation in claims data primarily relies on the gaps between prescription fills, but such definitions are rarely validated. This study aimed to establish a natural language processing (NLP)‐based validation framework to evaluate the performance of claims‐based discontinuation algorithms for commonly used medications against NLP‐based reference standards from electronic health records (EHRs). A total of 36,656 patients receiving antipsychotic medications (APMs), benzodiazepines (BZDs), warfarin, or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were identified from the Mass General Brigham EHRs in 2007–2020. These EHR data were linked with 97,900 Medicare Part D claims. An NLP‐aided chart review was applied to determine medication discontinuation from EHR (reference standard). In claims data, discontinuation was defined by having a prescription gap larger than 15–90 days (claims‐based algorithms). Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of claims‐based algorithms against the reference standard were measured. The sensitivity and specificity of 90‐day‐gap‐based algorithms were 0.46 and 0.79 for haloperidol, 0.41 and 0.85 for atypical APMs, 0.47 and 0.75 for BZDs, 0.33 and 0.80 for warfarin, and 0.38 and 0.87 for DOACs, respectively. The corresponding estimates for 15‐day‐gap‐based algorithms were 0.68 and 0.55 for haloperidol, 0.59 and 0.62 for atypical APMs, 0.71 and 0.45 for BZDs, 0.61 and 0.49 for warfarin, and 0.58 and 0.64 for DOACs, respectively. Positive predictive values were primarily affected by medication discontinuation rates and less by gap lengths. The overall accuracy of claims‐based discontinuation algorithms differs by medications. This study demonstrates the scalability and utility of the NLP‐based validation framework for multiple medications.",

    "abstract": "Over 10 million children in the world have epilepsy, with an unknown cause in half of the cases. The gut microbiome has been associated with various neurological disorders, and certain drugs greatly disturb the microbiome. Our aim was to study the association of prenatal and childhood exposure (before the age of two) to antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine‐2 receptor antagonists, and the risk of childhood epilepsy. Using population‐based registers, we included all live singleton births in Sweden from 2006 to 2017. Exposure was considered prescription(s) to antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, or H2‐receptor antagonists (separately). Multivariable Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. 708,903 mother–child dyads were included, and 0.5% of children had an epilepsy diagnosis. Average follow‐up was 3.8 years (IQR 1–6). Prenatal exposure to antibiotics (aHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01–1.18) and PPIs (aHR 1.38, 95% CI 1.17–1.65) were associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. Exposure to antibiotics (1.11, 95% CI 1.02–1.21), PPIs (3.40, 95% CI 2.47–4.68) and H2RAs (1.65, 95% CI 1.03–2.64) before the age of two was associated with an increased risk of epilepsy after the age of two. Dose response analysis showed that one prescription of antibiotics in pregnancy or early life was not associated with an increased risk of epilepsy, while one prescription of PPIs in pregnancy or early life had an association. To conclude, our results support the hypothesis that microbiome modulating drugs are associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. This needs to be further validated in other studies, ideally including indications for drug use.",

    "abstract": "Oncology dose optimization during the era of chemotherapy focused on identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for registrational trials, often resulting in significant toxicity. The advent of molecular targeted drugs and immunotherapies offers the potential to achieve similar efficacy with lower doses and fewer side effects, as maximal efficacy is often reached at doses below the MTD. Recent FDA guidance outlines expectations for improving dose optimization in oncology drug development. This review presents a framework for tailored dose optimization by categorizing oncology molecules into four distinct classes based on their mechanisms of action and clinical activities: small molecule targeted therapies and antibody‐drug conjugates (Class 1), large molecule antagonists (Class 2), cancer immunotherapy agonists (Class 3), and molecules with limited or no single‐agent activity (Class 4). Unique dose optimization considerations for each class are discussed, supported by illustrative case examples. To enhance robust dose decision‐making and optimize patient resource utilization, we propose using proof of activity as a gate for initiating dose expansion with one or multiple dose levels. This review emphasizes the importance of integrating all relevant preclinical data, disease knowledge, and clinical measurements and highlights the essential role of quantitative pharmacology and statistical modeling in optimizing doses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Improvements in the relevance and reliability of routinely collected clinical data and statistical methods to analyze the available data have enhanced the adoption of real‐world data (RWD) to generate real‐world evidence (RWE) for regulatory decision making of medical products. As part of the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA VII), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) committed to issuing annual reports describing such uses for drugs and biological products. The first report covered fiscal year (FY) 2023 and described two approvals based, at least in part, on RWE: tocilizumab (trade name Actemra) and lacosamide (trade name Vimpat). This article describes New Drug Applications and Biologics Licensing Applications approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in FYs 2020–2022 with RWE that (1) contributed to substantial evidence of effectiveness or (2) provided safety data necessary for approval. RWE contributed to substantial evidence of effectiveness for the approval of applications for fosdenopterin (trade name Nulibry) and tacrolimus (trade name Prograf) in FY 2021 and abatacept (trade name Orencia), vosoritide (trade name Voxzogo), and alpelisib (trade name Vijoice) in FY 2022. No studies provided only safety data necessary for approval. The five approvals included six total studies that provided RWE pivotal for the applications approval. Four studies leveraged registry data, and two leveraged medical record data. In parallel with annual RWE public reporting under PDUFA VII, this report can inform interested parties regarding how RWD are used to generate RWE that can support regulatory decision making for medical products.",

The objective of this review is to describe FDA experience with assessing the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and conducting model‐based analyses of FDA‐approved CAR T cell products. The seven currently approved CAR T cell products target CD19 or BCMA and have both flat dose and body‐weight‐based intravenous dosing. The PK (e.g., expansion and persistence) and PD (e.g., B‐cell aplasia, cytokine levels, and chemokine levels) data were an integral component of CAR T cell clinical pharmacology assessments. Model‐based assessments, including population PK and exposure–response analysis, were conducted to understand PK variability and identify intrinsic/extrinsic factors impacting safety and efficacy outcomes. Continued use of clinical pharmacology tools such as model‐based assessment to inform dose selection, dose optimization, and therapeutic individualization is integral to characterizing the effects of CAR T products.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing attention on the clinical utility and value of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing to individualize medication management. Most clinical practice guidelines from medical professional societies do not recommend routine PGx testing, with a few key exceptions. Inconsistent recommendations across clinical practice guidelines, FDA product labeling, and payer reimbursement policies have hampered widespread adoption of testing. Multiple resources exist to aid in the adoption and use of actionable PGx test results in clinical practice; however, most of these resources do not provide guidance on who should receive PGx testing and when—a critical question the clinical community continues to struggle with. There are multiple considerations when answering this question beyond the clinical validity of the drug–gene interaction itself, such as the actionable result frequency, severity of the adverse clinical outcome, predictive power of the PGx test, suitability of alternative treatments, cost, and turnaround time of test results. This perspective discusses these considerations and models for testing including preemptive screening, pretreatment testing, and reactive testing, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The authors provide their perspectives on identifying candidates for PGx testing in the current real‐world environment and how that differs from a clinically ideal scenario.",

This article focuses on the outcome of a two‐day multistakeholder workshop organized by EMA in 2024, which explored ways to optimize the EMA qualification procedure for patient registries, and to establish the value and enable the use of these data across the full spectrum of research questions. Key recommendations include the need to clarify the aim, scope, and added value of the qualification of registries, coupled with a review of the procedural steps to ensure the process is fit‐for‐purpose to evaluate the use of registries in specific regulatory contexts. Further recommendations focused on strengthening interactions between stakeholders, as well as providing them with enhanced support by increasing awareness of publicly available tools that could leverage the potential of registry data, together with existing guidance. The European Medicines Regulatory Network is now working together with all relevant stakeholders, including the EMA scientific committees and working parties, the Joint HMA/EMA Network Data Steering Group and existing focus groups with external partners, to implement concrete actions that will address these recommendations. Among others, the update of existing guidance, the development of templates and Questions & Answers documents, and the design of appropriate communication and stakeholder engagement plans will aid in achieving the common goal of making optimal use of patient registry data to support public health in the European Union.",

Data from SAXOPHONE, a phase II pediatric study, were used to update a previously developed population pharmacokinetics (PPK) model and to assess the covariate effect of patient type on PK parameters while retaining previous covariates. Stochastic simulations were performed to assess whether the proposed dosing regimens in pediatric patients aged 28 days to < 18 years matched adult exposures. The relationship between anti‐Factor Xa (AXA) and apixaban concentration, as well as apixaban concentration and chromogenic FX, were evaluated. Apixaban dose adjustment in response to the growth of pediatric patients and changes in age and weight were also assessed. Apixaban PK in pediatric patients with CAHD was well characterized by a 2‐compartment model with first‐order absorption, dose‐dependent F1, and first‐order elimination. Apixaban apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution in the central compartment (Vc/F) increased with increasing body weight. Apixaban CL/F was lower in pediatric patients with CAHD compared to adults and other pediatric patients. The fixed dose by weight‐tiered dosing regimen for pediatric patients with CAHD (28 days to < 18 years) achieved target exposures similar to adult VTE treatment and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation populations. A linear PK/PD relationship between apixaban and AXA was observed. Inhibition of FXa was observed across weight tiers. Apixaban dose adjustment in response to weight gain resulted in exposures similar to target adult exposures.",

    "abstract": "In the EU, conditional marketing authorization is a pragmatic tool for early approval of a medicine that fulfills an unmet medical need. In the pharmaceutical legislation, an unmet medical need means that a condition lacks a satisfactory method for diagnosis, prevention, or treatment. If such satisfactory methods exist, the new medicinal product must hold a major therapeutic advantage for those affected, meaning that it must demonstrate an improvement in efficacy or safety over existing methods or, in exceptional cases, a major improvement in patient care. This review evaluates the approaches taken to justify a major therapeutic advantage in oncology and hematology products recommended for approval between 2006 and 2023. The review confirmed an increase in the number of conditional marketing authorizations over time. Out of a total of 65 CMAs, a satisfactory treatment method was available for 40 cases (61.5%), thereby requiring a demonstration of major therapeutic advantage to fulfill the unmet medical need requirement. Satisfactory treatments existed more often for the more recently approved medicinal products. Qualitative arguments and quantitative comparisons were common to demonstrate meaningful improvement in efficacy or safety. In the absence of head‐to‐head trials, indirect comparisons were often used. Most quantitative comparisons used naïve side‐by‐side comparisons, lacking adjustments for trial differences or quantification of uncertainty. Regulatory guidance on indirect comparisons and data requirements may be helpful to support applicants and assessors in making available promising medicines early that fulfill an unmet medical need and continue to meet rigorous efficacy and safety standards pending availability of comprehensive data post‐approval.",

We assessed the duration of time intervals between regulatory milestones for RMM effectiveness studies assessed by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). We included completed RMM effectiveness post‐authorization safety studies (PASSs) assessed by PRAC between 2016 and 2022. Regulatory documents submitted by marketing authorization holders and assessment reports were extracted from non‐public EMA databases. To calculate the duration of time intervals, we collected the dates of study request, protocol assessment start, protocol approval, study start, final study report assessment start, and final study report PRAC outcome. We identified 98 PASSs. The median duration from study request to final study report PRAC outcome was 52 months (Q1–Q3: 40–70). The median duration from study request to study start was 21 months (Q1–Q3: 15–30; n = 95) and from study start to final study report assessment start was 21 months (Q1–Q3: 13–36; n = 95). The final study report assessment often comprised <6 months (median: 4; Q1–Q3: 1–6). For PASSs with a PRAC‐approved protocol ( n = 80, 81.6%), the median duration of protocol assessment was 7 months (Q1–Q3: 4–10). Concluding, the median duration from study request to RMM effectiveness PASS completion exceeded 4 years. Next to the study conduct duration, the period from study request until study start was the most time‐consuming. The duration of this period might be minimized by improved guidance on RMM effectiveness PASSs and encouraging timely protocol submission.",

    "abstract": "Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a common, acute adverse event associated with T‐cell redirecting therapies such as bispecific antibodies (BsAbs). The nature of CRS events data makes it challenging to capture an unbiased exposure–response relationship with commonly used models. For example, simple logistic regression models cannot handle traditional time‐varying exposure, and static exposure metrics chosen at early time points and with lower priming doses may underestimate the incidence of CRS. Therefore, more advanced modeling techniques are needed to adequately describe the time course of BsAb‐induced CRS. Herein, we present a two‐part mixture model that describes the population incidence and time course of CRS following various dose‐priming regimens of elranatamab, a humanized BsAb that targets the B‐cell maturation antigen on myeloma cells and CD3 on T cells, where the conditional time‐evolution of CRS was described with a two‐state (i.e., CRS‐yes or no) Markov model. In the first part, increasing elranatamab exposure (maximum elranatamab concentration at first CRS event time ( C max,event )) was associated with an increased CRS incidence probability. Similarly, in the second part, increased early elranatamab exposure ( C max,D1 ) increased the predicted probability of CRS over time, whereas premedication including corticosteroids and IL‐6 pathway inhibitors use demonstrated the opposite effect. This is the first reported application of a Markov model to describe the probability of CRS following BsAb therapy, and it successfully explained differences between different dose‐priming regimens via clinically relevant covariates. This approach may be useful for the future clinical development of BsAbs.",

    "abstract": "Technological developments and innovations in regulatory pathways have meant medicinal products are increasingly associated with substantial clinical and economic uncertainties at launch. This has increased the focus on continuous evidence generation to assess the real‐world value of new medicines post‐launch. This paper examines Post‐Launch Evidence Generation (PLEG) systems in France, Spain, and England, drawing on insights from a series of multistakeholder roundtables hosted by RWE4Decisions. These discussions provided a platform to compare national approaches to PLEG considering PLEG planning and operationalization. The roundtable events included presentations by representatives of the HTA bodies and payers in France, Spain, and England, an industry response, and multistakeholder discussions. The events highlighted that while there are differences in the products to which PLEG is applied and the way it is operationalized, there are many common challenges experienced across systems and by all stakeholders. First, there is a recognition that evidentiary needs must be anticipated earlier to avoid PLEG where possible and better plan for PLEG where needed. Second, there is a need to streamline data collection. This includes trying to make greater use of existing data sources vs. primary data collection, prioritizing collection of a small number of outcomes that directly address key uncertainties, and by improving international collaborations to streamline data collection and evidence generation across borders. Our findings suggest value in improving scientific advice processes and international collaboration to discuss key data gaps early and ensure efficient and effective evidence collection that improves the speed and quality of reimbursement and pricing decisions.",

Although citalopram/escitalopram is the second most frequently prescribed antidepressant for pregnant people, information about its pharmacokinetics in pregnancy is limited. We investigated plasma (S) ‐citalopram concentration to dose (C/D) ratios across pregnancy and postpartum and the effect of pharmacogenetics on its elimination. This prospective observational cohort study enrolled 30 participants with a singleton pregnancy who chose to continue citalopram/escitalopram during pregnancy for a prior diagnosis of major depression. Monthly blood samples were obtained 24 hours post‐dose across pregnancy and twice postpartum for measurement of plasma citalopram, desmethylcitalopram, and didesmethylcitalopram enantiomer concentrations. Compared with the 36‐week reference, (S) ‐citalopram C/D ratios were not significantly different throughout pregnancy. However, the mean (S) ‐citalopram C/D ratio was elevated by 63% ( P < 0.001) 6 to 8 weeks after delivery before it decreased to a mean C/D ratio in the later post‐birth period that was marginally different than at 36 weeks (1.20 ± 0.64 vs. 0.92 ± 0.46, respectively; P = 0.06). Analyzing the results by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2C19 phenotype, the mean late postpartum (S) ‐citalopram concentration to dose ratio in intermediate metabolizers was approximately twice that in extensive, rapid, or ultrarapid metabolizers. However, at the 36‐week reference point, the mean concentration to dose ratio in pregnant CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers was 35.7% lower than the distant postpartum ratio, while the ratios in extensive and rapid/ultrarapid metabolizers were 15.4% and 18.5% lower, respectively. Without dose adjustment, people with intermediate or poor CYP2C19 activity may be at risk for subtherapeutic S‐ citalopram concentrations during pregnancy.",

An additional critical benefit of MIDD is postulated to be improvement in trial and program efficiencies. While the application of MIDD has grown, there have been no clear examples across programs to demonstrate its value at the portfolio level. This manuscript offers a methodology and examples to demonstrate MIDD value in terms of time and cost savings. We utilized an algorithm to estimate savings based on MIDD‐related activities at each stage of development across the entire drug development portfolio during a typical year between 2021 and 2023. This algorithm, although company‐specific, demonstrated general applicability across several programs of the portfolio. Overall, the use of MIDD yielded annualized average savings of approximately 10 months of cycle time and $5 million per program. Systematic application of MIDD approaches yielded significant time and cost savings across the drug development portfolio in addition to informing data‐driven decisions. Increased utilization of MIDD approaches is a driver for improving drug development efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Oral small molecule inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) are emerging as attractive therapeutic agents for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases. Balinatunfib (SAR441566), a novel oral inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling, changes the configuration of the soluble TNFα (sTNFα) trimer and prevents its heterotrimerization with TNFR1 but not TNFR2, thereby blocking TNFR1 signaling. Herein, we report the results from a first‐in‐human (FIH) study that evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) following single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of balinatunfib in healthy male participants. Single (5–600 mg) and multiple (100–600 mg total daily dose for up to 14 days) oral doses of balinatunfib were well‐tolerated in all participants. Consistent PK data were obtained across the studies, with a median t max of 2.5–5 hours, a mean terminal half‐life of 22–30 hours, and a time to steady state of 5–6 days. A supra‐proportional exposure increase was observed in both SAD and MAD studies, which was less pronounced at doses ≥ 180 mg. Food had no relevant effects on the PK characteristics of balinatunfib. As the main PD read‐out, complete TNFα occupancy was shown at all tested time points after the treatment started. Balinatunfib, as the first clinically tested oral TNFR1 signal inhibitor, demonstrated a good safety profile along with favorable PK/PD characteristics that allowed both once and twice daily dosing, confirming a successful preclinical‐to‐clinical translation and guiding dose selection for further clinical efficacy studies.",

    "abstract": "Non‐randomized studies will remain the mainstay for evidence on medications' effects in pregnancy since the number of pregnant participants in randomized clinical trials is insufficient to evaluate uncommon but serious pregnancy outcomes. There has been a growing interest in conceptualizing causal inference based on observational data as an attempt to emulate a hypothetical randomized trial: the target trial. This approach can help identify design flaws and ensuing biases and can point toward potential solutions. Adoption of the target trial emulation framework in perinatal studies raises unique challenges due to the distinct role of gestational time. Challenges include, among others, identifying the timing of conception, pregnancy losses as competing events for later outcomes, different etiologically relevant time windows depending on the outcome, and time‐varying outcome risks. We discuss various considerations in developing a protocol for a target trial evaluating drug effects in pregnancy and its observational emulation in databases and registries. While not a panacea, the framework offers a valuable tool to guide us through the specification of the causal questions, the study population and the treatment strategies to be compared and helps to identify avoidable biases as well as unavoidable deviations from the optimal protocol. Making these deviations explicit elucidates the assumptions we make when drawing causal conclusions, and the types of analyses that can be undertaken to quantify the potential magnitude of such biases. Such discipline in the design, conduct, and reporting of pregnancy studies will ultimately lead to the best information possible to inform treatment decisions during pregnancy.",

Exposure–efficacy was assessed in 446 patients with EGFR ‐mutated NSCLC; exposure–safety was assessed in 715 patients with NSCLC, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer. A range of HER3‐DXd dosing regimens was evaluated, including fixed‐dosing regimens (1.6–8 mg/kg every 3 weeks [Q3W]; 3.2–6.4 mg/kg Q3W), an up‐titration dosing regimen, and an alternative Q2W/Q3W dosing regimen. Logistic regression or time‐to‐event models were used to test the relationships of each endpoint with pharmacokinetic analytes (anti‐HER3‐ac‐DXd and DXd). Anti‐HER3‐ac‐DXd exposure was positively associated with objective response rate, and bone metastasis was identified as a significant covariate. DXd exposure showed a stronger correlation with most safety endpoints compared with anti‐HER3‐ac‐DXd exposure, except for grade ≥ 2 nausea/vomiting and any grade adjudicated drug‐related interstitial lung disease (ILD). Dose response predictions verified a manageable safety profile for the 5.6 mg/kg Q3W regimen. This observation was supported by low predicted rates of adjudicated drug‐related ILD and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation with the 5.6 mg/kg Q3W regimen. Overall, these results support the selection of HER3‐DXd 5.6 mg/kg Q3W as the recommended dosing regimen for patients with NSCLC, and these data inform the optimal dosing regimen for other tumor types.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of oral drug absorption in humans is essential for early drug development; however, physiologically relevant human models are lacking. This study aims to comprehensively assess the EpiIntestinal™, a human primary intestinal 3D model, for its ability to predict oral absorption ( F a ), intestinal availability ( F g ), CYP3A4 induction, and drug–drug interactions (DDIs). The model showed clinically relevant expression of a key drug‐metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and a nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR). The model demonstrated a moderate improvement over Caco‐2 in correlating permeability coefficients with human absorption data for a set of 18 drugs. However, PBPK modeling, using EpiIntestinal™ permeability data, accurately predicted the clinical maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) of the P‐gp substrates digoxin and dabigatran etexilate, unlike the significant underpredictions from Caco‐2 data. PBPK modeling using intrinsic clearance and permeability data from EpiIntestinal™ accurately predicted human F g for CYP3A4/5 substrate drugs (except buspirone). Furthermore, the model demonstrated the induction of CYP3A4 and P‐gp (threefold) by a strong PXR inducer, rifampicin. Combining induction parameters of rifampicin from EpiIntestinal™ with those from the TruVivo (human hepatic model) into PBPK modeling accurately captured DDI effects on midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4/5 substrate. Additionally, the model accurately predicted clinical outcomes of P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated DDIs for ARV‐471. These data underscore the potential of EpiIntestinal™ in predicting human F a and F g , and in quantitatively assessing CYP3A4 induction and transporter‐based DDIs.",

    "abstract": "Studies with negative results are less likely to be published than others, potentially leading to publication bias. Introduced in 2000, trial registration could have participated in decreasing the proportion of unpublished studies. We assessed the proportion of negative randomized controlled trials (RCT) over the last 20 years. We searched Medline for RCT published in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 in the British Medical Journal, the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine. The primary endpoint was the proportion of negative (final comparison on the primary study‐endpoint without statistical significance or favoring the control arm) studies published in 2000 and 2020. Factors independently associated with the publication of negative studies were identified using multivariable analysis. A total of 1,542 studies were included. The proportion of negative RCT significantly increased between 2000 and 2020 (from 27.6% to 37.4%; P = 0.01), however, the trend over time was not significant ( P = 0.203). In multivariable analysis, the following factors were associated with a higher proportion of published negative studies: superiority ( P < 0.001), two‐group trials ( P < 0.001), number of patients ≥510 ( P < 0.001), cardiology trials ( P = 0.003), emergency/critical care trials ( P < 0.001), obstetrics trials ( P = 0.032), surgery trials ( P = 0.006), pneumology trials ( P = 0.029). Exclusive industry funding was associated with a lower proportion of published negative studies ( P < 0.001). The proportion of published negative studies in 2020 was higher only when compared to 2000. During the two decades, no trend was noticeable. There is no clear relationship between trial registration and the publication of negative results over time.",

    "abstract": "OATP1B, P‐gp, BCRP, and CYP3A are the most contributing drug‐metabolizing enzymes or transporters (DMETs) for commonly prescribed medication. Their activities may change in end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with large inter‐individual variabilities (IIVs), leading to altered substrate drug exposure and ultimately elevated safety risk. However, the changing extent and indictive influencing factors are not quantified so far. Here, a microdose cocktail regimen containing five sensitive substrate drugs (pitavastatin, dabigatran etexilate, rosuvastatin, midazolam, and atorvastatin) for these DMETs was administrated to Chinese healthy volunteers and ESRD patients. Drug pharmacokinetics profiles were determined, together with physiological, pharmacogenetic, and gut microbiome signature. Population pharmacokinetic and machine learning model were established to identify key influencing factors and quantify their contribution to drug exposure change. The exposure of pitavastatin, dabigatran, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin increased to 1.8‐, 3.1‐, 1.1‐, and 1.3‐fold, respectively, whereas midazolam exposure decreased by 72% in ESRD patients. Notably, in addition to disease state, the relative abundance of genus Veillonella and Clostridium_XIVb were firstly identified as significant influencing factors for PTV and RSV apparent clearance, respectively, suggesting their indicative role for OATP and BCRP activity evaluation. Moreover, several genera were found to strongly associate with drug clearance and reduce unexplained IIVs. Accordingly, it was estimated that OATP1B and intestine P‐gp activity decreased by 35–75% and 29–44%, respectively, whereas BCRP and CYP3A4 activity may upregulate to some extent. Our study provides a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of individual DMET activity and could support precision medicine of substrate drugs in ESRD patients.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenetic testing can prevent severe toxicities from several oncology drug therapies; it also has the potential to improve the outcomes from supportive care drugs. Paired tumor and germline sequencing is increasingly common in oncology practice; these include sequencing of pharmacogenes, but the germline pharmacogenetic variants are rarely included in the clinical reports, despite many being clinically actionable. We established an informatics workflow to evaluate the clinical sequencing results for pharmacogenetic variants. We used the Aldy computational tool, which we have previously shown to determine the variant alleles in 14 pharmacogenes in clinical sequencing data with >99% accuracy, to identify pharmacogenetic variants in the clinical whole exome sequencing from our molecular tumor board. Patients with genetic variants that are clinically actionable for their individual therapy programs, including both treatment and supportive care, are referred to a clinical pharmacogenetics testing laboratory for confirmation. Through an evaluation of our weekly informatics workflow, we determined it took approximately 3.25 hours to complete the analysis of the sequencing data from approximately 20 patients. Using a United States pharmacist's median salary, we estimated the incremental added cost of the process to be only ~$15 per patient. This adds only a minor increase to the patient's cost of testing and has the potential to improve the safety and efficacy of their treatment.",

This white paper serves as an update to the previously published white paper by Fang et al. at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which introduced the general framework to provide pAUC recommendations. Since August 2020, 18 product‐specific guidances (PSGs) have been published or revised using the general framework to provide consistent, science‐ and risk‐based pAUC recommendations. Notable regulatory examples of pAUC applications discussed include loxapine inhalation powder, leuprolide long‐acting injectables (LAIs), and goserelin LAIs. This paper discusses recent applications of pAUC in the United States, highlights key examples of pAUC recommendations for regulatory applications, and provides insights about areas for global harmonization of pAUC recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health burden in Africa. Although TB is treatable, anti‐TB drugs are associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which are partly attributed to pharmacogenetic variation. The distribution of star alleles (haplotypes) influencing anti‐TB drug metabolism is unknown in many African populations. This presents challenges in implementing genotype‐guided therapy in Africa to decrease the occurrence of ADRs and enhance the efficacy of anti‐TB drugs. In this study, we used StellarPGx to call variants and star alleles in NAT1 , NAT2 , GSTM1 , GSTT1 , GSTP1 , and CYP2E1 , from 1079 high‐depth African whole genomes. We present the distribution of common, rare, and potential novel star alleles across various Sub‐Saharan African (SSA) populations, in comparison with other global populations. NAT1*10 (53.6%), GSTT1*0 (65%), GSTM1*0 (48%), and NAT2*5 (17.5%) were among the predominant functionally relevant star alleles. Additionally, we predicted varying phenotype distributions for NAT1 and NAT2 (acetylation) and the glutathione‐S‐transferase (GST) enzymes (detoxification activity) between SSA and other global populations. Forty‐seven potentially novel haplotypes were identified computationally across the genes. This study provides insight into the distribution of key variants and star alleles potentially relevant to anti‐TB drug metabolism and other drugs prescribed across various African populations. The high number of potentially novel star alleles exemplifies the need for pharmacogenomics studies in the African context. Overall, our study provides a foundation for functional pharmacogenetic studies and potential implementation of pharmacogenetic testing in Africa to reduce the risk of ADRs related to treatment of TB and other diseases.",

    "abstract": "The liver is crucial for metabolizing the anticancer drug palbociclib, but limited information is available on the impact of hepatic impairment on its toxicity and efficacy, with no real‐world data available. This study aims to evaluate how hepatic impairment affects hematological toxicity and progression‐free survival (PFS) of palbociclib in advanced hormone receptor‐positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‐negative breast cancer, using the National Cancer Institute scoring system, in a large real‐world dataset. This multicenter retrospective observational study included female patients treated with palbociclib between August 2017 and February 2024. Regression analysis was used to compare the risk of developing grade 3/4 hematological toxicity and PFS between patients with normal and mild impaired liver function. In total, 478 female patients were included. Patients with mild hepatic impairment ( n = 205) did not have an increased risk of developing grade 3/4 neutropenia compared with patients with normal hepatic function ( n = 273) (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.11; 95% CI 0.83–1.47). In addition, the PFS was not significantly different between both groups (HR = 1.15; 95% CI 0.93–1.42). In real‐world settings, patients with mild hepatic impairment do not have a higher risk of developing palbociclib‐induced neutropenia or disease progression than patients with normal hepatic function. These findings can guide clinicians when treating breast cancer patients with mild hepatic impairment.",

    "abstract": "Iptacopan, a first‐in‐class complement factor B inhibitor acting proximally in the alternative complement pathway, has been shown to be safe and effective for patients with complement‐mediated diseases. Iptacopan selectively binds with high affinity to factor B, a soluble, plasma‐based, hepatically produced protein. Factor B is abundant in the circulation but can be saturated at the iptacopan clinical dose of 200 mg twice daily. Iptacopan pharmacokinetics (PK) are influenced by target binding. This target‐mediated drug disposition (TMDD) behavior makes PK data useful for understanding target occupancy and motivates modeling of drug‐target binding to connect exposure with pharmacological effect. A phase I hepatic impairment (HI) PK study measuring both total and unbound iptacopan PK profiles provided an opportunity to characterize the effect of variation in target concentration (due to varying hepatic function) on iptacopan PK. HI caused no change in total iptacopan exposure but increased unbound iptacopan exposure 1.38‐ to 3.72‐fold in participants with mild, moderate, or severe HI relative to demographically matched participants with normal hepatic function, with the largest increases in severe HI. A two‐site competitive binding model was developed to elucidate the relationship between iptacopan PK and factor B occupancy to characterize exposure thresholds for maximal target engagement. The model was used to assess alternative dose regimens to provide insight into how to approach dose recommendations for patients with severe HI. This study provides an example of small‐molecule TMDD, a behavior typically associated with targeted biologics; its importance is too often underappreciated in small‐molecule drug development.",

    "abstract": "Clopidogrel, an anti‐platelet drug, is used to prevent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Clopidogrel resistance results in recurring ischemic events, with African Americans (AA) suffering disproportionately. The aim of this study was to discover novel biomarkers of clopidogrel resistance in African Americans using genome and transcriptome data. We conducted a genome‐wide association study (GWAS), including local ancestry adjustment, in 141 AA on clopidogrel to identify genetic associations with high on‐treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR), with validation of genome‐wide significant and suggestive loci in an independent cohort of AA clopidogrel patients ( N = 823) from the Million Veteran's Program (MVP) along with in vitro functional analysis. We performed differential gene expression (DGE) analysis in whole blood to identify transcriptomic predictors of response, followed by functional validation in MEG‐01 cells. GWAS identified one signal on Chromosome 7 as significantly associated with increasing risk of HTPR. The lead single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7807369, within thrombospondin 7A ( THSD7A ) was associated with an increased risk of HTPR (odds ratio (OR) = 4.02, P = 4.56 × 10 −9 ). Higher THSD7A gene expression was associated with HTPR in an independent cohort of clopidogrel‐treated patients ( P = 0.004) and carrying a risk allele showed increased gene expression in primary human endothelial cells. Notably, the CYP2C19*2 variants showed no association with clopidogrel response in the discovery or MVP cohorts. DGE analysis identified an association with decreased LAIR1 and AP3B2 expression to HTPR. LAIR1 knockdown in MEG‐01 cells resulted in increased expression of SYK and AKT1, suggesting an inhibitory role of LAIR1 in the Glycoprotein VI pathway. In summary, these findings suggest that other variants and genes outside of CYP2C19 star alleles play an important role in clopidogrel response in AA.",

    "abstract": "An immunogenicity risk assessment (IRA) is a relatively new expectation of health authorities that is increasingly incorporated into the drug development process across the pharmaceutical/biotech industry. The guiding principle for an IRA includes a comprehensive evaluation of product‐ and patient‐related factors that may influence the immunogenic potential of a biotherapeutic drug and a potential action plan. The Immunogenicity Working Group from the IQ Consortium (Clinical Pharmacology Leadership Group) has conducted a survey to understand the current practices for conducting IRAs and relevant aspects of bioanalysis. Survey results were provided by 19 IQ member companies participating in the Clinical Pharmacology Leadership Group (CPLG) and the Translational and ADME Sciences Leadership Group (TALG). Nearly all the respondents reported experience with monoclonal antibodies (mAb), with 10 other drug modalities including bioengineered protein therapeutics such as fusion and multi‐domain proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides as well as gene and cell therapies. The survey results demonstrate that most companies have a defined IRA process, and there was a common understanding that the IRA may need to be revised as more information becomes available or the drug development strategy changes. Some differences found across the respondents are related to the time frame for implementation of IRA document, the types of preclinical data and computational methods used to assess risk, and how the IRA informs clinical plans and documentation practices. These results highlight that while there have been widespread insights gained with performing IRA for mAbs, more experience is needed to perform IRAs for the novel modalities.",

    "abstract": "Daprodustat, a novel oral hypoxia‐inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor is approved in the United States for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults receiving dialysis for at least 4 months. Pharmacodynamic dose‐hemoglobin (Dose‐Hgb) models were developed as daprodustat progressed through development. To support global phase III development, a dose‐titration algorithm, guided by simulations from the initial Dose‐Hgb model based on phase II clinical data, was implemented. This work was to update and re‐calibrate this model to support the dose titration algorithm. Data from five pivotal phase III studies in CKD patients with anemia treated with daprodustat once daily (q.d.) and/or three times a week (t.i.w.) using a titration dosing schedule were included. The data comprised 2,770 CKD patients with anemia providing 53,535 Hgb observations over a period of 6 months up to 4 years. This final Dose‐Hgb model consisted of a precursor cell compartment and 12 transit compartments to describe the red blood cell (RBC) lifespan. Treatment increased the precursor cell production rate ( K in ) by a power of allometrically scaled dose. Disease progression, as an exponential decline of Hgb production rate over time, varied with dialysis status. The dose‐titration algorithm resulted in comparable response for t.i.w. dosing relative to q.d. dosing. Titration‐based visual predictive checks for Hgb target criteria for the analysis dataset and the prediction dataset showed that the model adequately predicted the observed data. This re‐calibrated Dose‐Hgb model will provide further support for the individualized dosing strategy in CKD patients with anemia treated with daprodustat.",

    "abstract": "Emergency department visits due to cannabinoid‐induced toxicity, including acute cannabinoid intoxication (ACI) have increased worldwide as more states have liberalized cannabis policy. ACI symptoms include anxiety, panic attacks, tachycardia, and psychosis, primarily mediated through cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB 1 ) agonism by Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This phase II randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study assessed the potential of CB 1 receptor antagonist selonabant (ANEB‐001) to block THC‐induced effects in healthy adults. In Part A of the study, 10.5 mg of THC was coadministered with 50 mg ( N = 20) or 100 mg ( N = 20) selonabant, or matching placebo ( N = 20). In Part B, 21‐mg THC was coadministered with 30 mg ( N = 9) or 10 mg ( N = 7) selonabant, or matching placebo ( N = 9). THC‐related effects were assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS) for feeling high and alertness, objective measures of postural stability, and heart rate and analyzed using a mixed effects model. Selonabant significantly reduced VAS “Feeling High” (up to −82.8% (95% CI: −91.0%, −67.2%, P < 0.0001) at 30‐mg selonabant) and increased VAS “Alertness” (up to 10.8 mm (95% CI: 4.7, 16.8 mm, P = 0.001) at 30‐mg selonabant) vs. placebo. Selonabant 10 and 30 mg significantly reduced body sway (up to −30.6% (95% CI: −44.1%, −13.9%, P = 0.002) at 30 mg selonabant) vs. placebo. Effects on heart rate were not significant. Selonabant was generally safe and no clinically meaningful changes in mood occurred. Nausea and vomiting occurred more frequently at high selonabant doses; 10‐mg selonabant was both well tolerated and efficacious. Present results support further development of selonabant for emergency treatment of ACI.",

However, the diversity of PCT participants remains inadequate. PCTs for new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012–2021 and their primary publications (PPub) were identified from the label and review documents. The country information about the PCT investigators and PPub authors were extracted from the PPubs or clinicaltrials.gov . The racial/ethnic diversity of PCT participants as reported in PPubs was assessed using the Diversity Index (DI). For 429 new drugs, 734 PCTs and 718 PPubs were identified. North America and Western Europe (NAWE) contributed the largest proportion of PCT investigators, PPub authors, and lead authors (62.9%, 81.7%, and 90.9%, respectively). Of 521 PPubs that reported the racial/ethnic distribution of PCT participants, the median DI was low at 0.33 (interquartile range 0.18–0.46) and only 16.3% PPubs had a DI >0.5. The number of PPub authors in non‐NAWE and the number of countries of PPub authors in non‐NAWE was significantly associated with the racial/ethnic diversity of PCT participants (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.08–1.26] and OR 1.25 [1.08–1.46], respectively). Evidence generation for the regulatory approval of new drugs has been predominantly centered in NAWE. The dominance is even more pronounced in the authorship of PPubs. To improve the racial/ethnic diversity of PCT participants, investigators from non‐NAWE countries should be encouraged to play more leadership roles, thereby increasing their likelihood of serving as authors in PPub.",

    "abstract": "Platelet reconstitution after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo‐HCT) is heterogeneous and influenced by various patient‐ and transplantation‐related factors, associated with poor prognoses for poor graft function (PGF) and isolated thrombocytopenia. Tailored interventions could improve the outcome of patients with PGF and post‐HCT thrombocytopenia. To provide individual predictions of 180‐day platelet counts from early phase data, we developed a model of long‐term platelet reconstitution after allo‐HCT. A large cohort ( n = 1949) of adult patients undergoing their first allo‐HCT was included. Real‐world data from 1,048 retrospective patients were used for non‐linear mixed‐effects model development. Bayesian forecasting was used to predict platelet–time profiles for 518 retrospective and 383 prospective patients during internal and external model validation, respectively. Thrombocytopenia was defined as mean platelet count < 75 × 10 9 /L, derived from the last 12 platelet measurements within the first 180 days post‐HCT. Thrombocytopenia affected 37% of all patients and was associated with significantly reduced overall survival ( P ‐value < 0.0001). On days +7, +14, +21, and +28, the developed model achieved areas under the receiver‐operating characteristic of ≥ 0.68, ≥ 0.75, ≥ 0.78, and 0.81 for the prediction of post‐HCT thrombocytopenia, respectively, with anti‐thymocyte globulin, donor relation, and total protein measurements representing prognostic markers for post‐HCT platelet kinetics. A publicly accessible web‐based demonstrator of the model was established ( https://hsct.precisiondosing.de ). In summary, the developed model predicts individual platelet counts from day +28 post‐HCT adequately, utilizing internal and external datasets. The web‐based demonstrator provides a basis to implement model‐based predictions in clinical practice and to confirm these findings in future clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Refining dose projections requires a deep understanding of drug‐target relationships at the site of action, which is often challenging to achieve. Here we present a case study of how one can refine dose projections for a TIGIT‐targeted immunotherapy by leveraging information from the well‐studied PD‐1 pathway since the co‐expression of PD‐1 and TIGIT on immune cells provides a unique opportunity to extrapolate data from one target to inform the dosing strategy for the other. We develop a fit‐for‐purpose mathematical model that captures the experimentally observed relationship between the concentration of a mouse PD‐1 antagonist in the plasma and PD‐1 target engagement within the tumor microenvironment (TME). We then assess the applicability of this PD‐1 model to elucidate the relationship between drug concentration and target engagement for tiragolumab, an anti‐TIGIT antibody, across various doses. This analysis aims to refine our understanding of the dose–response relationship for targeting TIGIT, a critical step in optimizing therapeutic efficacy, without conducting additional experiments. The approach is then extended to project efficacious doses for M6223, another anti‐TIGIT antibody, using the established PD‐1 model, by leveraging the M6223 clinical PK and PD data, as well as virtual population analysis. This work provides a case study of a possible framework for refining dose projections via quantitative estimation of drug‐target relationship at the site of action by leveraging established drug‐target relationships. Through extrapolating information from a well‐characterized pathway, we offer a method to inform dose optimization strategies with limited data using model‐informed drug development.",

The immunogenicity working Group, IQ Consortium (Clinical Pharmacology Leadership Group) has conducted a survey to understand the current practices in analyzing immunogenicity data generated during clinical development and its impact on pharmacokinetics, clinically relevant pharmacodynamic biomarkers, safety, and efficacy outcome measures. Information was collected for 93 drugs, spanning multiple drug classes and over the different phases of clinical development, including post‐approval. The predominant drug classes reported included monoclonal antibodies or Fc‐fusion proteins, endogenous protein replacement therapies, bispecific antibodies, and antibody–drug conjugates. The extent of quantitative evaluation varied and was influenced by several factors, including descriptive analyses, statistical approaches, and modeling. In addition to understanding current practices, this survey also highlights areas for future exploration in analyzing clinical relevance of ADAs which can facilitate the use for regulatory submissions and product labels.",

    "abstract": "Clinical cocktails for cytochrome P450 (CYP) phenotyping lack a marker for CYP2C8. We aimed to combine the CYP2C8 index drug repaglinide with the Geneva cocktail (caffeine/CYP1A2, bupropion/CYP2B6, flurbiprofen/CYP2C9, omeprazole/CYP2C19, dextromethorphan/CYP2D6, and midazolam/CYP3A4). We also included endogenous organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3 biomarkers glycochenodeoxycholate 3‐O‐glucuronide and glycochenodeoxycholate 3‐sulfate, and investigated the CYP2C8 inhibition selectivity of clopidogrel and gemfibrozil with the full cocktail. In a five‐phase randomized cross‐over study, the following drugs were administered to 16 healthy volunteers: (i) repaglinide, (ii) the Geneva cocktail, (iii) repaglinide with the Geneva cocktail (full cocktail), (iv) clopidogrel followed by the full cocktail, and (v) gemfibrozil followed by the full cocktail. The Geneva cocktail increased repaglinide AUC 0‐23h 1.22‐fold (90% confidence interval 1.04–1.44, P = 0.033). The full cocktail accurately captured known inhibitory effects of clopidogrel on CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 and that of gemfibrozil on CYP2C8. Gemfibrozil decreased the paraxanthine/caffeine AUC 0‐12h ratio by 23% (14–31%, P < 0.01) and increased caffeine AUC 0‐12h 1.20‐fold (1.03–1.40, P = 0.036). Gemfibrozil increased the metabolite‐to‐index drug AUC 0‐23h ratios of flurbiprofen, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and midazolam 1.59‐fold (1.32–1.92), 1.47‐fold (1.34–1.61), 1.79‐fold (1.23–2.59), and 2.1‐fold (1.9–2.4), respectively, without affecting the index drug AUCs ( P < 0.01). Gemfibrozil increased the AUC 0‐4h of glycochenodeoxycholate 3‐O‐glucuronide 1.33‐fold (1.07–1.65, P = 0.027). In conclusion, the combination of repaglinide, the Geneva cocktail and endogenous biomarkers for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 yields a nine‐in‐one phenotyping tool. Apart from strong CYP2C8 inhibition, gemfibrozil weakly inhibits CYP1A2 and OATP1B1 and appears to impair the elimination of the metabolites of several CYP index drugs.",

    "abstract": "Less frequent adverse drug reactions are usually discovered after a drug's release to the market, making effective and timely communication of regulatory post‐market advisories essential for preventing emerging adverse effects. Time series analysis is a key study design for assessing the impact of post‐market safety advisories. However, most previous studies have focused on narrow evaluations, limiting systematic assessment of how different safety advisories affect prescribing practices. This study aimed to investigate changes in prescribing practices following regulatory post‐market safety advisories in Korea. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted using nationwide claims data from 2018 to 2021 and hospital datasets covering the period from 2 years before and 3 years after post‐market safety advisories. We categorized the selected drugs into two groups: safety warning through letters and real‐time safety alarms (contraindications or requiring attention). Twelve post‐market safety advisories were analyzed, including four safety warnings and eight safety alarms, which showed an overall relative reduction (safety warning: relative change [95% confidence interval]: −8.06% [−10.23% to −5.84%], safety alarm on contraindication: −92.65% [−95.65% to −87.59%], and safety alarm on requiring attention: −8.04% [−9.98% to −6.05%]). All types of regulatory interventions reduced the prescribing of targeted drugs; however, the magnitude of these effects differed substantially depending on the type of intervention. By identifying and comparing the influence of regulatory post‐market safety advisories, we can enhance these measures to better protect patient health. Continuous monitoring and systematic assessment of safety‐related regulatory advisories, with ensured reproducibility, are warranted to optimize effectiveness and ensure safe medication practices.",

The IQ Consortium Clinical Pharmacology Organ Impairment Working Group conducted a survey across IQ Consortium member pharmaceutical companies to understand current practices on how PBPK is used in understanding the effect of hepatic impairment (HI) on drug disposition and its impact on clinical development. Responses from 21 participants indicated that most organizations (~86%) are already using PBPK models for HI assessment. The survey results indicate that PBPK models have been influential in optimizing the design of dedicated HI study with 57% of respondents using PBPK models to inform the design elements of dedicated HI studies, and the majority of these respondents using the PBPK model to support internal decision making regarding the HI study. Additionally, the PBPK model was used by 62% of the respondents to predict drug plasma protein binding. Despite common usage of the PBPK models by drug developers, 14.3% of the respondents discussed their PBPK modeling strategy with regulatory agencies with only two cases where the regulators accepted the PBPK model. In conclusion, although the use of PBPK models to support regulatory decisions regarding drug use in HI is currently limited, its future is promising, and the success of such models needs collaboration between regulators and drug developers to shrink the knowledge gap in the use of PBPK as an impactful tool for drug development in patients with HI.",

This study aimed to refine the understanding of creatinine kinetics for more reliable assessments of GFR and net creatinine tubular secretion (nCTS) via OCT2/MATE in humans. In a clinical study of 14 healthy volunteers, iohexol was administered intravenously as a reference GFR marker, and creatinine was introduced through a meat meal. A joint pharmacometric model was developed using dense plasma and urine sampling. Simulations were used to evaluate the effect of different creatinine volume of distribution (V d ) values on GFR estimation after acute kidney injury (AKI) and to assess the impact of limited sampling strategies on GFR and nCTS estimation. Pharmacokinetic parameters for iohexol and creatinine aligned with reported values, but a lower V d of 41% of total body weight and a nCTS fraction of 31% relative to overall creatinine clearance were observed. Commonly used equations based on single‐point creatinine measurement all overestimated GFR, with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation performing best, followed by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD‐EPI) 2009 equation. Simulations demonstrate the effect of V d estimate accuracy on detecting AKI from creatinine plasma concentrations only. Following low‐dose iohexol administration, a single plasma sample at 5 hours and a urine sample from 0 to 5 hours provided accurate estimates of both GFR and nCTS using the joint model and enabled adequate correction for incomplete urine collection. This approach shows promise for assessing renal transporter activity based on estimated nCTS.",

We analyzed dose determinations during Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug reviews to determine whether there were changes between the proposed and approved doses of new molecular entities (NMEs), including cases where postmarketing dose‐finding studies were requested, and explored the factors associated with these decisions. Of the 218 eligible NMEs approved between 2018 and 2022, 28 drugs (13%) had modifications to the proposed dose or requested additional postmarketing assessments, 20 of which were to a lower dose (“downward,” 9.2%) and five were to a higher dose (“upward,” 2.3%). Multinomial logistic regression analysis suggested that products that used the Accelerated Approval program were more likely to undergo downward modification (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 5.73). In addition, the fact that a dose/exposure–response relationship was observed for safety, but not efficacy, was associated with an increased probability of downward modifications (RRR: 4.27). In contrast, the use of pharmacodynamic biomarkers for dose setting and designation of Priority Review was associated with decreased probabilities of downward change (RRR: 0.405 and 0.195, respectively). Infectious disease drugs went through more upward modifications than those in the other therapeutic categories. This study revealed that dose “optimization” occurs during the FDA's review for drug approval and that not only product characteristics but also factors related to the drug review and approval process are associated with the decisions to modify or question the dose, suggesting considerations for the presence of compelling evidence and restrictions in data availabilities.",

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of these surrogate endpoints by analyzing their correlations with overall survival (OS) across different cancer types, treatments, and therapy lines at both the patient and trial levels using an integrated dataset from Bristol Myers Squibb. At the patient level, correlation between OS and PFS was consistently stronger than those between OS and best overall response (BOR), suggesting that PFS may serve as a more reliable surrogate for OS. Melanoma patients exhibited the highest correlation between OS and BOR, and immune‐oncology (IO) therapy patients showed stronger correlations than those treated with chemotherapy. First‐line therapy patients demonstrated stronger correlations between BOR, PFS, and OS compared with second‐line or third‐line patients. At the trial level, the correlation between PFS hazard ratio (HR) and difference in ORR (∆ORR) was stronger than that between other endpoints. Melanoma studies exhibited strong correlations with significant P ‐values. IO therapy studies exhibited more consistent correlations.",

Despite the widespread use of QT‐prolonging drugs during pregnancy, the extent of heart rate (HR)‐corrected QT (QTc) interval changes during normal pregnancy and preeclampsia remains unclear. This study aimed to quantify changes in QTc interval across different trimesters of normal pregnancy and third‐trimester preeclampsia. Eight databases were systematically searched from their inception to January 13, 2025. Any type of study design, except case reports/series, reporting QT interval and HR or RR interval, and/or QTc interval for at least one trimester were included. Those reporting at least two trimesters or one trimester with nonpregnant controls were pooled in meta‐analyses using random‐effect models to calculate pooled mean differences (MD) across trimesters. Data from 57 studies (6,686 participants) were included with 33 studies (5,153 participants) pooled in meta‐analyses. Compared with nonpregnant individuals, QTc intervals increased across trimesters of normal pregnancy and in third‐trimester preeclampsia. Meta‐analyses revealed significant increases in QTc interval during first (MD = 10.0 msec), second (MD = 20.2 msec), and third trimesters (MD = 23.0 msec) compared with nonpregnant individuals. Furthermore, preeclampsia increased the QTc interval by 21.7 msec during the third trimester compared to normal pregnancy. No publication bias was detected, and the overall quality scores of most studies were fair ( n = 23) or poor ( n = 33). A significant QTc interval lengthening throughout normal pregnancy was identified, and to a greater extent during preeclampsia. The arrhythmogenicity in third‐trimester preeclampsia with a known risk for QTc interval prolongation, especially with using QT‐prolonging drugs, warrants further investigation.",

This paper reviews state‐of‐the‐art methods for studying HTE using real‐world data (RWD), which offer larger study sizes and more diverse patient populations compared to randomized clinical trials. The paper first defines HTE and discusses its measurement. It then examines three leading approaches to studying HTE: subgroup analysis, disease risk score (DRS) methods, and effect modeling methods. Subgroup analyses offer simplicity, transparency, and provide insights into drug mechanisms. However, they face difficulties in resolving which subgroup or combination of characteristics should be the basis for clinical decision making when multiple effect modifiers are present. DRS methods address some of these limitations by incorporating multiple patient characteristics into a summary score of outcome risk but may obscure insights into mechanisms. Effect modeling methods directly predict individual treatment effects, offering potential for precise HTE characterization, but are prone to model misspecification and may not provide mechanistic insights. The methods each have tradeoffs. Subgroup analysis is straightforward but can lead to spurious associations and does not account for multiple characteristics at once. DRS methods are relatively simple to implement and clinically useful, but may not completely describe HTE or provide mechanistic insight. Effect modeling approaches have great potential for characterizing HTE but are still being developed. Understanding HTE is essential for personalizing treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Researchers must weigh the strengths and limitations of each approach when using RWD to study HTE.",

This study assesses how the patient populations for oncology medicines (2010–2023) are defined (1) at trial, (2) regulatory submission, (3) upon approval for marketing authorization, (4) at submission, and (5) recommendation by the HTA, and (6) in clinical guidelines in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Based on 25 populations for oncology medicines, we developed a framework for describing oncology populations consisting of 20 elements in four domains: disease specifications, patient characteristics, treatment position, and exclusion criteria. In exploratory analyses, we tabulated any observed variation in these framework elements throughout the six steps in the lifecycle of a medicine. On average, 10 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.2–10.9) potential adjustments were made, 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0–2.5) by each decision‐maker. The adjustments by pharmaceutical developers focused mostly on the disease specifications (0.5 of the average 0.8 adjustments, 63%), while adjustments by regulators, HTA organizations, and guideline developers predominantly targeted the treatment's position (range: 0.5/1.3 [36%] in guidelines to 0.6/1.0 [58%] in regulatory approvals). Each decision‐maker on average modifies 1.0 element (out of 2.3 [43%]) that was previously adjusted by another decision‐maker. The multiple differences observed in the description of patient populations reflect inconsistency in reporting between decision‐makers, complicating communication to patients and potentially affecting access to medicines. The developed framework can support consistent reporting across stakeholders and countries.",

All patients with incident T2D in Taiwan National Health Institution databases (2016–2021) and TriNetX datasets (2014–2023) were retrospectively analyzed. The study analyzed a propensity score‐matched pairs with T2D treated with SGLT2i or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i). The primary outcome was the incidence of urolithiasis and urolithiasis requiring surgery during the study period. Urolithiasis diagnoses were identified using International Classification of Diseases diagnostic codes and categorized into upper and lower urinary tract stones. Cases of urolithiasis requiring surgery were determined by the presence of both diagnostic codes and surgical procedure codes within the same outpatient visit or hospitalization. Conditional and time‐dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During the study period, 5700 participants were diagnosed with urolithiasis, 1297 participants were urolithiasis requiring surgery in Taiwan NHIRD cohort 8438 participants with urolithiasis as well as 289 participants with urolithiasis requiring surgery were in the TriNetX cohort. Adjusted HRs of urolithiasis and urolithiasis requiring surgery were 0.82‐fold (95% CI, 0.77–0.87), 0.72‐fold (95% CI, 0.63–0.82) in Taiwan NHIRD, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78–0.90), and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.44–0.88) in TriNetX cohort respectively.

    "abstract": "Developing drugs for rare diseases presents unique challenges from a statistical perspective. These challenges may include slowly progressive diseases with unmet medical needs, poorly understood natural history, small population size, diversified phenotypes and genotypes within a disorder, and lack of appropriate surrogate endpoints to measure clinical benefits. The Real‐World Evidence (RWE) Scientific Working Group of the American Statistical Association Biopharmaceutical Section has assembled a research team to assess the landscape including challenges and possible strategies to address these challenges and the role of real‐world data (RWD) and RWE in rare disease drug development. This paper first reviews the current regulations by regulatory agencies worldwide and then discusses in more detail the challenges from a statistical perspective in the design, conduct, and analysis of rare disease clinical trials. After outlining an overall development pathway for rare disease drugs, corresponding strategies to address the challenges are presented. Other considerations are also discussed for generating relevant evidence for regulatory decision‐making on drugs for rare diseases. The accompanying paper discusses how RWD and RWE can be used to improve the efficiency of rare disease drug development.",

We identified all indications for CAR‐T cell and BsAb products for LN approved in the United States, European Union, or Japan between January 2010 and September 2023 using public databases. The United States was the most frequent region of first approval for both CAR‐T (11/12 [92%]) and BsAb groups (6/9 [67%]). Regulatory incentives, such as orphan designation and expedited reviews, were more common in the CAR‐T group than in the BsAb group in the United States, the European Union, and Japan. Pivotal trials for approval were generally identical in the United States and the European Union, and all indications, excluding the two indications for CAR‐T cell products, were approved based on single‐arm trials. The proportion of regular approvals was higher in the CAR‐T group than in the BsAb group in both the United States (75% vs. 11%) and the European Union (67% vs. 25%). Unlike in the United States and European Union, all indications were granted regular approval in Japan. In conclusion, most indications for CAR‐T cell and BsAb products were approved based on single‐arm studies in the United States, European Union, and Japan; however, regulatory incentives and regular approvals were more frequently granted for CAR‐T cell products than for BsAb products.",

    "abstract": "The utilization of lipid nanoparticles (LNP) for encapsulating mRNA has revolutionized the field of therapeutics, enabling the rapid development of COVID‐19 vaccines and cancer vaccines. However, the clinical development of mRNA‐LNP therapeutics faces numerous challenges due to their complex mechanisms of action and limited clinical experience. To overcome these hurdles, Model‐Informed Drug Development (MIDD) emerges as a valuable tool that can be applied to mRNA‐LNP therapeutics, facilitating the evaluation of their safety and efficacy through the integration of data from all stages into appropriate modeling and simulation techniques. In this review, we provide an overview of current MIDD applications in mRNA‐LNP therapeutics clinical development using in vivo data. A variety of modeling methods are reviewed, including quantitative system pharmacology (QSP), physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK), mechanistic pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), population PK/PD, and model‐based meta‐analysis (MBMA). Additionally, we compare the differences between mRNA‐based therapeutics, small interfering RNA, and adeno‐associated virus‐based gene therapies in terms of their clinical pharmacology, and discuss the potential for mutual sharing of MIDD knowledge between these therapeutics. Furthermore, we highlight the promising future opportunities for applying MIDD approaches in the development of mRNA‐LNP drugs. By emphasizing the importance of applying MIDD knowledge throughout mRNA‐LNP therapeutics development, this review aims to encourage stakeholders to recognize the value of MIDD and its potential to enhance the safety and efficacy evaluation of mRNA‐LNP therapeutics.",

However, the relationship between OATP1B1 transport activity and these factors in patients with cancer cachexia has not been reported. This study aimed to identify the factors contributing to individual differences in OATP1B1 transport activity in patients with cancer cachexia, using coproporphyrin‐I (CP‐I) as an endogenous biomarker of OATP1B1 transport activity. The study recruited 114 patients with cancer cachexia who satisfied the selection criteria. The subjects were classified into pre‐cachexia, cachexia, and refractory cachexia. Median [interquartile range] plasma CP‐I level was higher in patients with pre‐cachexia (0.91 [0.67–1.12] ng/mL) compared with the data in the general population reported previously and tended to be higher in patients with refractory cachexia (1.06 [0.78–1.64] ng/mL) than in those with cachexia (0.87 [0.62–1.07] ng/mL), suggesting that OATP1B1 transport activity may decrease with the progression of cancer cachexia. Plasma CP‐I correlated positively with IL‐6 and TNF‐α concentrations but did not correlate with OATP1B1 polymorphisms or CMPF concentration, which have been reported to reduce transport activity. Multiple regression analysis using the forced entry method identified refractory cachexia as a significant factor independently affecting plasma CP‐I concentration. These findings suggest that the reduction in OATP1B1 transport activity in patients with cancer cachexia may be attributed to inflammatory cytokines or some other factors that are elevated by cancer cachexia progression, rather than OATP1B1 polymorphisms and CMPF.",

Identification of ADRs in clinical practice, surveillance and research is essential to prevent further harm. The aim of this study was to assess the likelihood of drugs contributing to clinically important inpatient adverse events, in order to provide a list of drug‐event pairs indicating ADRs in electronic health record (EHR) data, referred to as “indicators of ADRs”. We conducted a consensus process based on the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method for 14 ADRs. Experts were asked to rate the strength of the causal link between adverse events and potentially causative drugs on a 4‐point Likert scale. Based on the median rating, drug‐event pairs were categorized according to the likelihood of an ADR being present. Drug‐event pairs with a median rating of ≥ 3 without disagreement were defined as indicators of certain and probable ADRs. Of the 255 drug‐event pairs evaluated, 2 (1%) and 42 (16%) achieved consensus validation that they certainly and probably indicate an ADR. In addition, 137 drug‐event pairs were considered as indicators of possible (54%) and 74 drug‐event pairs were considered as indicators of unlikely (29%) ADRs. The provided set of content‐validated indicators of clinically important inpatient ADRs can be used in clinical practice (e.g., decision support), surveillance (e.g., quality indicators) and research (e.g., outcome measures). They will be implemented in EHR data from German university hospitals to determine the prevalence of ADRs, support efficient use of pharmacist resources, and develop models predicting ADRs.",

For a new molecular entity to be approved for marketing under a new drug application or original biologics license application by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the product should be shown to be both safe and effective. In some cases, one adequate and well‐controlled clinical trial and confirmatory evidence are sufficient to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness. This important topic is the focus of a September 2023 draft guidance entitled Demonstrating Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness Based on One Adequate and Well‐Controlled Clinical Investigation and Confirmatory Evidence . Most non‐oncologic rare disease marketing applications (67%) approved between 2020 and 2023 utilized a single adequate and well‐controlled trial plus confirmatory evidence to demonstrate effectiveness. Though different types of confirmatory evidence were utilized in different applications, mechanistic or pharmacodynamic evidence was used to support 77.5% of recent rare disease marketing applications that were approved based on one adequate and well‐controlled trial plus confirmatory evidence. The quantity of confirmatory evidence necessary to support effectiveness may vary across development programs. Early and frequent discussions with the Agency to align on the developmental plan will facilitate efficient drug development and regulatory assessment.",

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) taking rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban were enrolled, and a single steady‐state trough concentration was measured. FXaI concentrations were compared with the expected range reported in clinical trials to define high or low drug levels. The primary outcome was major bleeding, and the secondary outcome was ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (IS/TIA). From 2016 to 2023, 1,037 patients aged from 30 to 105 years were enrolled (average, 75.4 ± 10.0 years; 33.8% were aged ≥ 80 years). During a median follow‐up of 2.35 years, 48 major bleeding events and 32 IS/TIA events were observed. Although drug concentrations were similar between the two age groups, those aged ≥ 80 years with high FXaI levels experienced a greater increase in major bleeding risk compared to those aged < 80 years with high levels (aHR 6.47 [2.07, 20.28] vs. 3.45 [1.15, 10.30]). Additionally, patients aged ≥ 80 years without elevated FXaI levels also had a higher risk of major bleeding compared to those aged < 80 years without elevated levels (aHR 2.39 [1.20, 4.76]). While low FXaI concentrations were associated with IS/TIA, the risk was not significantly different across age groups. In conclusion, despite similar FXaI concentrations, patients aged ≥ 80 years have a higher baseline risk of major bleeding and experience a greater increase in bleeding risk at high drug levels compared to those aged < 80 years.",

    "abstract": "Brand‐name drug manufacturers commonly receive numerous patents covering their products to try to block price‐lowering competition from generic manufacturers. However, under US law, generic manufacturers can develop clinically interchangeable versions that avoid some brand‐name drug patents by creating new formulations that “design around” existing patents or skinny labels that do not include patented methods of use. Since generics nearly always lead brand‐name manufacturers to file lawsuits, we sought to characterize the types of generic design around strategies by examining patent infringement litigation from 2000 to 2023. We used Lex Machina to identify cases and manually reviewed them to determine the drug involved and how generics designed around the patent. The cohort consisted of 153 cases involving 114 products. Twenty‐eight cases (18%, 95% CI: 13–25) involved changes to how the product was used, including skinny labeling. The other 125 cases (82%, 95% CI: 75–87) involved alterations to the physical product or packaging. The most common physical change was to the formulation of the product (73 cases (48%, 95% CI: 40–56)). Changes to the active ingredient (18 cases (12%, 95% CI: 8–18)) or manufacturing process (15 cases (10%, 95% CI: 6–16)) were also common. Tablets and capsules were overrepresented in our cohort as compared to all approved drugs (the June 2023 Orange Book had 41% tablets and capsules, 95% CI: 39%–42%, P < 0.001), as were extended or delayed‐release formulations (making up 23/57 (40% [95% CI: 29–53]) of the tablet or capsule products in our cohort vs. 324/886 in the Orange Book, 15% [95% CI: 14–17], P < 0.001).",

    "abstract": "Clinical inhibition and genetic variation of the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP/ ABCG2 ) efflux transporter can significantly influence drug exposure, highlighting the need for reliable BCRP functional biomarkers. This study aimed to identify and evaluate biomarkers predictive of BCRP function in humans. A comprehensive analysis of metabolomic genome‐wide association studies (mGWAS) was conducted to discover potential BCRP biomarkers, followed by evaluation in in vitro transporter assays and a clinical drug–drug interaction (DDI) study. Across multiple mGWAS datasets, plasma concentrations of three herbicide derivatives—4‐hydroxychlorothalonil (4HC), 3‐bromo‐5‐chloro‐2,6‐dihydroxybenzoic acid (BCDBA), and 3,5‐dichloro‐2,6‐dihydroxybenzoic acid (DCDBA)—were significantly elevated ( P < 5E‐8) in individuals carrying reduced function ABCG2 polymorphisms. These compounds were confirmed as novel BCRP substrates via transporter uptake assays and selected for clinical evaluation alongside riboflavin, a known BCRP substrate and potential BCRP biomarker. In a DDI study with 11 healthy subjects, eltrombopag, a BCRP inhibitor, increased rosuvastatin concentrations by approximately twofold ( P = 0.002). No significant changes in the plasma concentrations of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B (OATP1B) biomarkers (CP‐I and CP‐III) or potential BCRP biomarkers (4HC, BCDBA, DCDBA, or riboflavin) were observed. Notably, two subjects were heterozygous carriers for the ABCG2 p.Q141K variant and exhibited significantly higher baseline concentrations of 4HC ( P = 0.004) and BCDBA ( P = 0.0003), consistent with reduced BCRP function. These findings suggest that 4HC and BCDBA are promising biomarkers for baseline BCRP function in specific populations, such as those harboring reduced function genetic polymorphisms, but do not appear suitable for detecting acute BCRP inhibition.",

Real‐world data (RWD), particularly claims databases with reliable information on pharmacy dispensing, provide an opportunity to understand conmeds usage in the target indication in a real‐world setting as one approach to assess potential DDI risk. We describe two cases of characterizing DDI‐related conmeds usage with a large closed US‐based claims database, IQVIA PharMetrics® Plus, and identified potential DDI risk for multiple sclerosis and hormone receptor‐positive breast cancer. For example, prevalent and chronic use of statins (atorvastatin and simvastatin), which are CYP3A4 substrates, were identified among both disease cases. Further examples, limitations, and future directions are also discussed. These insights can therefore help augment decision‐making during clinical drug research and development.",

With respect to stage of development, all phase‐I‐related biomarkers are developed in some form of partnership, while academic institutions alone and foundations devote slightly more attention to trial endpoints as a total share of BQP activities. These findings shed light on the incentives at play and the types of stakeholders that have been active in the development of these tools to date.",

    "abstract": "Following the implementation of drug regulatory reforms in China, expedited programs have been established to accelerate drug development, review, and approval for marketing. This study examined a sample of 302 oncology indications approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to explore the relationship between indication characteristics, pivotal clinical trial features, clinical benefit, and the cumulative number of expedited program designations. Furthermore, the study evaluated the actual execution of these expedited programs in China by assessing the clinical development time and review time of the approvals for oncology indications. Indications that received a higher cumulative number of expedited program designations generally exhibit higher innovation, lower pivotal clinical trial quality, greater clinical benefit, and reduced clinical development time and review time. Within these expedited programs, the implementation of Conditional Approval (CA) was pivotal in shortening the clinical development time, while Priority Review (PR) contributed to a reduction in review time. However, no significant impact of Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) on the drug development process was observed. The simultaneous implementation of multiple expedited programs has been shown to be more effective in decreasing both clinical development and review times. While the implementation of expedited programs in China has yielded preliminary outcomes, it is imperative for regulatory authorities to further refine the legal and regulatory frameworks associated with these programs, addressing any deficiencies arising from their implementation.",

    "abstract": "Emerging innovations in pediatric rare diseases are offering up the opportunity to fundamentally change the way therapeutic development in pediatric rare diseases is enabled, largely through the application of model‐informed drug development (MIDD). Pediatric rare diseases, often characterized by small patient populations, patient heterogeneity that is compounded by differences in adult and pediatric diseases, and limited development options, pose significant challenges in drug development. The ICH E11(R1) addendum particularly calls out the value of modeling and simulation and other statistical approaches in extrapolation and filling the gaps in knowledge and/or reducing uncertainties. Therefore, MIDD provides a powerful solution by enabling more efficient, data‐driven decision‐making, reducing the need for large, costly trials while ensuring that clinical endpoints are both relevant and feasible. MIDD approaches have been able to extrapolate the treatment responses from adults to pediatrics, making decisions around the viability of targets and dose selection simpler. In this whitepaper, we build on our previous results by critically examining the role of biomarkers and surrogate endpoints, statistical innovations, and modeling and simulation best practices as they apply to pediatric rare diseases therapeutic development. We posit that the effective integration of digital biomarkers, patient‐reported outcomes, and quality of life methodologies into the development of therapies for pediatric rare diseases will catalyze a significant shift towards more personalized, patient‐centered approaches in this vulnerable population.",

We characterize the feasibility of supplementing SATs with real‐world data (RWD)‐derived external control arms by determining the proportion of SATs on breast cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) for which an external control arm based on RWD can be constructed. The main outcome measure is the number and percentage of trials for which all important eligibility criteria and at least one primary endpoint could be identified in one of five German RWD sources. We surveyed all SATs concerning breast cancer or ALS treatment registered in the European Union's clinical trial registers between 2004 and 2023. Ten out of 379 breast cancer SATs and 2 of 11 ALS SATs could feasibly be supplemented with RWD‐derived external control arms, if all important eligibility criteria and a primary endpoint have to be identifiable in the RWD source. Ninety‐three breast cancer trials had at least one outcome ascertainable in a RWD source, and 35 trials had all important eligibility criteria recorded in a RWD source. Nine ALS trials had at least one primary endpoint ascertainable in RWD sources, and 2 had all important eligibility criteria recorded in a RWD source. Our study shows that SATs with RWD‐derived external control arms will rarely be suitable to establish treatment effects of medicines in the current setting for the investigated phenotypes and that SATs should be designed with limitations of the source of external controls in mind.",

    "abstract": "The ESR1 gene is relevant in breast cancer treatments in the pharmacogenetics context. However, Native, African, and mixed populations are known to be underrepresented in genomic studies. This is particularly important given that the difference in variants' frequencies among different populations can lead to population‐specific clinical implications. Therefore, this study aims to infer the genomic subcontinental ancestry and allele frequencies of the ESR1 gene variants in 2,427 individuals from 26 populations worldwide from the 1000 Genomes Project and 125 Natives from Peru, whose genomes have not yet been analyzed in the literature regarding this gene. Linear regression with Bonferroni correction analyses was conducted based on ancestry inference and frequencies. Our findings demonstrate subcontinental differentiation of African, Asian, European, and Native populations. Overall, 102 associations ( P < 0.01) were found for 68 clinically relevant variants. Particularly, subcontinental associations were observed for variants associated with the Native, Asian, European, and African components. We highlight the findings for the rs9340799 and rs2234693 variants, previously associated with altered responses to breast cancer treatments. rs9340799 was positively associated with the South‐Asian component, while rs2234693 was negatively associated with the Coast/Amazonian Native and positively associated with the East‐African component. Nearly half of the variants are intronic, highlighting the importance of studying whole genomes rather than just exomes. These results emphasize subcontinental differences' relevance for designing pharmacogenetic panels. Including neglected populations in genomic and pharmacogenomic studies is essential for democratic access to scientific advances and for more egalitarian and effective pharmacogenetic implementation, tailored to each population's specificities.",

    "abstract": "The polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of approximately 25% of clinically prescribed drugs. However, the impact of specific genetic variants on the interindividual variability in CYP2D6‐mediated drug metabolism remains insufficiently quantified. This translational study sought to address this gap by analyzing the genotypes and phenotypes of patients in two large clinical cohorts, focusing on the metabolism of the CYP2D6 substrates risperidone and desmethyltamoxifen. The analysis incorporated novel polymorphic haplotypes and substrate‐specific differences among the CYP2D6.1, CYP2D6.2, and CYP2D6.35 enzyme variants. The study revealed that CYP2D6.2 and CYP2D6.35 exhibit reduced metabolic capacity for these substrates, both in vivo and in an in vitro expression model. This was evidenced by decreased catalytic turnover (Kcat), decreased substrate affinity, and altered substrate docking. Furthermore, novel polymorphic haplotypes on the CYP2D6*1, CYP2D6*2, and CYP2D6*35 backgrounds were identified, each associated with a 30–40% increase in CYP2D6 activity. Incorporating these findings into prediction equations significantly improved the genetic prediction accuracy ( R 2 ) for CYP2D6‐mediated metabolism of desmethyltamoxifen from 59% to 71% and risperidone, also metabolized by CYP3A4, from 42% to 46%. These results highlight the importance of accounting for drug‐specific interactions with enzyme variants and integrating distinct polymorphic haplotypes into CYP pharmacogenomic models and guidelines for better translation into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The drug titration paradox is a clinical observation at a population level whereby patients receiving a high dose of medication appear to have a lower‐than‐average clinical effect, and patients receiving a low dose of medication appear to have a higher‐than‐average clinical effect. Consequently, there would be a negative correlation between dose and effect. The paradox was previously described as present in all titratable medications, particularly anesthetics. The underlying assumption of the paradox is that titration is gradual, that is, consisting of a sequence of relatively minor adjustments with the intent to avoid target over‐shoot. This assumption may not hold true with technological advancements and automated drug delivery. The methodology of the paradox was re‐explored without that assumption, both mathematically and with computer simulation of different control schemes that may be used to assist with drug titration. In these cases, achieving a positive correlation between dose and effect and reversing the paradox is possible. Recognizing that a perfectly titrated medication will have zero correlation coefficient at a population level, measuring the correlation coefficient over time can be a useful quality metric in evaluating automation technology in drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Concerns about the applicability of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing across diverse ancestry groups have risen from the underrepresentation of non‐European populations in PGx research. Current PGx panels may fail to detect relevant variants in non‐European populations, increasing the likelihood of false‐negative results. To investigate this, we assessed reference allele (*1) and genotype (*1/*1) frequencies by self‐reported ancestry in a cohort of 1086 youth aged 6–24 years who underwent PGx testing. Testing included 10 pharmacogenes ( CYP2B6 , CYP2C19 , CYP2C9 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 , NUDT15 , SLCO1B1 , TPMT , and VKORC1 ) using a panel covering all Association for Molecular Pathology Tier 1 alleles and 53% of Tier 2 alleles. Compared with Europeans ( n = 727), non‐Europeans ( n = 359) had higher *1 allele frequencies for CYP2C9 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A5 (all P < 0.01), while Europeans had higher frequencies for CYP2C19 and VKORC1 (all P < 0.01). Similarly, *1/*1 genotype frequencies were higher in non‐Europeans for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (all P < 0.01), but higher in Europeans for VKORC1 ( P < 0.01). False‐negative estimates exceeded 1% for CYP2B6 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , and SLCO1B1 in at least one ancestry group. These findings support the notion that *1 allele and *1/*1 genotype frequencies are more frequent in non‐Europeans for specific genes, but Europeans are also at comparable risk for false‐negative results. Expanded allele coverage on PGx panels could mitigate false‐negative risks, improving equity in PGx testing across diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Vicasinabin is an oral cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) agonist showing anti‐inflammatory effects and was developed for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Vicasinabin is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP2C19 and UGTs. The drug shows in vitro induction of CYP3A4, as well as inhibition of hepatic and renal transporters. Translation of in vitro data to a clinical drug–drug interaction (DDI) risk assessment has been challenging, with a potential role of CYP2C19 genotypes in the pharmacokinetics to be considered. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of vicasinabin based on a bottom‐up approach predicted a moderate systemic exposure reduction for the selective CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. Neither the OATP1B1/P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibition effect on atorvastatin nor the OCT2/MATE1 inhibition effect on metformin was predicted to be of clinical relevance by PBPK modeling, as was confirmed by clinical DDI study data. After successful PBPK model prediction of itraconazole DDI using an in vitro fm,CYP3A4 of 0.6, the model was applied to simulate weak or moderate exposure changes of vicasinabin after co‐administration with perpetrators for CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 (erythromycin, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, efavirenz, and rifampicin). A strong effect of induction due to rifampicin was also indicated. The CYP2C19 genotypes did not result in a significant impact on the victim DDI prediction for vicasinabin due to a low fm,CYP2C19 (∼0.2). The case study illustrated the usefulness of prospective PBPK predictions of clinical drug–drug interactions using in vitro data.",

Due to the clinical suspicion of impaired CYP3A4 metabolism, in the absence of drug–drug or drug‐food interactions, clinical sequencing of CYP3A4 was performed. This revealed that the patient is compound heterozygous for two rare loss‐of‐function variants in CYP3A4 (*8/*20). This clinical case highlights that a routine pharmacogenetic test panel that includes *22 as the only CYP3A4 variant is not a suitable diagnostic test for individuals with an increased pre‐test probability of altered CYP3A4 metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) is responsible for the removal and recycling of the neurotransmitter serotonin from neuronal synapses and is an important pharmacological target for treating a variety of CNS disorders. However, excessive levels of extrasynaptic serotonin resulting from SERT inhibition can lead to serotonin toxicity, which manifests as a spectrum of adverse events (AEs) termed “serotonin syndrome” (SS), ranging in severity from mild to life‐threatening. We hypothesized that, by performing a model‐based meta‐analysis (MBMA) of the data in the literature, the dose at which tremors (a characteristic manifestation of SS) occur could be predicted based on the pharmacokinetic properties and SERT inhibitory potency of a given drug. To investigate the relationship between tremors and the predicted relative strength of SERT inhibition, a literature survey was performed to collate observed tremor data, pharmacokinetic parameters, and SERT potency data for known SERT inhibitors. Using these data for 20 SERT inhibitors, an E max model relationship between tremor incidence and the ratio between brain unbound exposure and SERT IC50 was observed. The identified relationship provides a valuable tool to predict the likelihood of tremor incidence for investigational drugs with SERT inhibitory activity and to inform safety assessment and dose selection.",

This study examined the prevalence of actionable PGx genotypes (i.e., those linked to a guideline that recommends a change to standard prescribing), the use of cautionary medications (i.e., those associated with an actionable PGx genotype), polypharmacy (i.e., ≥ 5 medications simultaneously), and cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitor and inducer use among 13,670 older adults enrolled in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial. Genotyping was conducted for 10 pharmacogenes with actionable PGx‐based prescribing guidelines. Medication data were collected annually and assessed to identify cautionary medication use in the cohort. Most participants (98.8%) carried at least one actionable PGx genotype, with an average of three actionable genotypes per participant. VKORC1 (61.1%) and CYP2C19 (59.6%) were the most frequently observed genes with actionable genotypes. Statins (29.3%), nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (14.2%), and proton‐pump inhibitors (7.9%) were the most used cautionary medications, with 27.5% of participants taking at least one medication for which PGx guidelines recommended a deviation from standard prescribing. Most (83.9%) participants reported taking a polypharmacy regimen, and 68.2% reported use of at least one cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitor or inducer during the trial. Our findings underscore the high prevalence of actionable PGx genotypes, polypharmacy, and use of inhibitors and inducers in older adults, which collectively have the potential to inform safer and more effective prescribing practices.",

    "abstract": "Inhaled formulations are the first choices for treating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Both local and systemic exposures need to be considered when assessing the efficacy and safety of inhaled drugs. Physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were constructed and verified for budesonide and formoterol with different inhalation devices, CXG87 (test (T) formulation) and Symbicort® Turbuhaler® (reference (R) formulation). The models were then used to evaluate local exposures at different peak inspiratory flow rates (PIFRs) and dose conditions. Local exposures of CXG87 were comparable to the R formulation at PIFR 50–80 L/min at the dose of 200 μg/6 μg (budesonide/ formoterol fumarate), which was determined as the recommended dose. At this dose, CXG87 had local exposure advantages compared with the R formulation at PIFR 30–50 L/min and better local exposure stability at PIFR 30–80 L/min in the indication population. The simulation results indicated that 200 μg/6 μg can be selected as the study dose in the subsequent clinical study of CXG87 in indication patients. In addition, the clinical study could also include a lower flow rate (30–50 L/min) patient population to further evaluate the advantages of the modified formulation CXG87. This is the first study to predict CXG87 local exposure by a verified PBPK model.",

    "abstract": "Although attractive for relevance to real‐world scenarios, real‐world data (RWD) is typically used for drug repurposing and not therapeutic target discovery. Repurposing studies have identified few effective options in neurological diseases such as the rare disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which has no disease‐modifying treatments available. We previously reclassified drugs by their simulated effects on proteins downstream of drug targets and observed class‐level effects in the EHR, implicating the downstream protein as the source of the effect. Here, we developed a novel ALS‐focused network medicine model using data from patient samples, the public domain, and consortia. With this model, we simulated drug effects on ALS and measured class effects on overall survival in retrospective EHR studies. We observed an increased but non‐significant risk of death for patients taking drugs with complement system proteins downstream of their targets and experimentally validated drug effects on complement activation. We repeated this for six protein classes, three of which, including multiple chemokine receptors, were associated with a significantly increased risk for death, suggesting that targeting proteins such as CXCR5, CXCR3, chemokine signaling generally, or neuropeptide Y (NPY) could be advantageous therapeutic targets for these patients. We expanded our analysis to the neuroinflammatory condition, myasthenia gravis, and neurodegenerative disease, Parkinson's, and recovered similar effect sizes. We demonstrated the utility of network medicine for testing novel therapeutic effects using RWD and believe this approach may accelerate target discovery in neurological diseases, addressing the critical need for new therapeutic options.",

The objective of this study was to derive a riliprubart dosing regimen for CAD patients using model‐informed drug development (MIDD) approaches utilizing available clinical data. A virtual population consisting of 1,000 CAD patients was created by sampling with replacement of the body weight distribution of CAD patients from a clinical database. The 3.5 g IV quarterly (q12w) riliprubart regimen with an additional 3.5 g IV dose on Day 29 is predicted to have a greater than threefold safety margin and >90% efficacy. The observed riliprubart concentration‐time profiles from 9 CAD patients were consistently within the popPK simulated 90% prediction interval.

    "abstract": "The use of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) has been associated with increased fertility in women with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is increasingly used during pregnancy to support both maternal and fetal health. However, little is known about the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ETI during pregnancy, which is crucial for optimizing its efficacy and safety. This study aimed to predict the PK of ETI during pregnancy and to determine the maternal dose required to achieve therapeutic concentrations in both the maternal and fetus. The pregnancy physiological‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model within the Simcyp Simulator was used to predict the maternal and feto‐placental exposure of ETI. Placental kinetics were parameterized using permeability parameters determined from the physicochemical properties of these compounds. The model closely predicted the observed data, with the observed ETI maternal plasma concentrations, cord concentrations, and infant plasma concentrations mostly falling within the range of predicted 5th to 95th percentiles. Steady‐state simulations up to gestational week 40 predicted a continuous decline in ETI concentrations, with the AUC declining to 32.4–37.5% of baseline levels by week 40. However, the 5th percentile of trough concentrations for ETI consistently remained above the efficacy thresholds, both in mother and fetus. Therefore, it appears reasonable to maintain standard dosing regimen during pregnancy, complemented by careful monitoring. A clinical trial, such as the ongoing Maternal and Fetal Outcomes in the Era of Modulators (MAYFLOWERS) study, is required to further confirm the efficacy and safety of ETI in this population.",

    "abstract": "Interindividual variability in drug exposure can significantly influence treatment outcomes and may lead to drug concentration‐related side effects during tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Although the gut microbiota is known to affect drug metabolism, its impact on anti‐TB drugs has not been thoroughly explored. This study sought to elucidate the relationship between pre‐treatment gut microbiota and drug exposure levels among patients with pulmonary TB. Two cohorts were analyzed: a discovery cohort ( N = 99) and a validation cohort ( N = 32), both comprising patients undergoing anti‐TB therapy with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. The gut microbiota patterns of participants from the discovery cohort and the validation cohort were profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics, respectively. Analyses of both cohorts robustly established a positive association between pre‐treatment microbial diversity and drug exposure, as well as significant differences in gut microbiota composition across various drug exposure groups. At the species level, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was positively associated with drug exposure to rifampicin. Moreover, functional analysis revealed that starch and sucrose metabolism and secondary bile acid biosynthesis were more abundant in the high drug exposure group. To identify biomarkers capable of stratifying patients based on their drug exposure levels, 11 taxa, represented by Faecalibacterium , were selected in the discovery cohort (AUC = 0.992) and were confirmed in the validation cohort with high predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.894). This study demonstrated a correlation between microbial dysbiosis and reduced exposure to anti‐TB medications. Optimizing treatment by regulating gut microbiota to improve drug exposure levels requires further validation through larger scale multicenter clinical trials.",

Randomized controlled trials are essential for evaluating safety and efficacy but often exclude specific populations that are also targets for the intervention. This study assessed which populations are included in vaccine registration studies and/or addressed in label indications, and if special populations are considered at any point in the regulatory life cycle of vaccines approved in the European Union. We analyzed product labels, pivotal studies, risk management plans, and post‐authorization studies for all vaccines centrally approved via the European Medicines Agency between 2012 and 2022. For the 31 vaccines approved, we identified 90 pivotal studies supporting initial marketing authorizations and 46 studies supporting product revisions. At the end of our follow‐up, 27 vaccines (87%) were approved for adults, 19 (68%) for pediatric patients, 3 (11%) were recommended for pregnant populations, 4 (14%) for breastfeeding populations, and 7 (23%) for immunocompromised populations. Pregnant, breastfeeding, and immunocompromised individuals were rarely included in studies supporting regulatory actions. We observed a slight increase in the inclusion of special populations in post‐marketing studies, yet this had limited impact on product indications or information availability on labels. Pivotal studies supporting vaccine registrations were also highly selective and predominantly conducted in high‐income settings. These findings highlight significant variations in how different populations are considered during vaccine development and by regulators. Greater inclusion of special populations in the evidence‐generation chain is essential to ensure that vaccines respond to unmet medical needs equitably.",

    "abstract": "In pediatric oncology, pharmacogenetic guidelines are underutilized and the potential impact of pre‐emptive pharmacogenetic screening remains largely unexplored despite this field's need for individualized approaches. While comprehensive pharmacogenetic guidelines are not yet available for all anticancer drugs, evidence‐based recommendations exist for a subset of supportive care drugs and anticancer drugs, including thiopurines, irinotecan, capecitabine, and 5‐fluorouracil. In this study, we evaluate the potential impact of pre‐emptive pharmacogenetic screening by retrospectively identifying opportunities for dose or treatment adjustments within a national pediatric oncology cohort. Our analysis focused on ten genes and 28 drugs relevant to pediatric oncology, which are included in the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group guidelines. In a cohort of 1,151 pediatric oncology subjects, we identified that 16% of individuals could have benefited from altered drug dosing or treatment. These include dose and treatment recommendations for allopurinol, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, phenytoin, amitriptyline, proton pump inhibitors, voriconazole, tramadol, codeine, paroxetine, tacrolimus, rasburicase, and 6‐mercaptopurine. As genetic data increasingly becomes available through molecular diagnostics in pediatric oncology, there is a unique opportunity to re‐utilize this data for pre‐emptive pharmacogenetic screening. Leveraging genetic profiles to guide clinicians in drug selection and dose optimization can improve patient outcomes by enhancing the safety and efficacy of treatments. We therefore recommend incorporating pharmacogenetic screening into clinical workflows to advance personalized medicine in pediatric oncology.",

    "abstract": "Sertraline and escitalopram, commonly used antidepressants in clinical practice, are metabolized by the polymorphic CYP2C19 enzyme. In a large‐scale Chinese Han cohort, this study comprehensively examines the influence of CYP2C19 genotype on sertraline and escitalopram exposure, while also evaluating genotype‐associated antidepressant switching rates. A total of 525 serum concentration measurements of sertraline in 415 patients and 355 serum concentration measurements of escitalopram in 294 patients were retrospectively included from the therapeutic drug monitoring database of the First Hospital of Hebei Medical University. Patients were categorized into four subgroups based on CYP2C19 genotype: Normal metabolizers (NMs), Rapid metabolizers (RMs), Intermediate metabolizers (IMs), and Poor metabolizers (PMs). Differences in sertraline and escitalopram exposure and antidepressant switching rates were compared between the subgroups, with CYP2C19 NMs set as reference. Compared with the CYP2C19 NMs group, sertraline serum concentrations were significantly increased 2‐fold and 1.3‐fold in the CYP2C19 PMs and CYP2C19 IMs groups, respectively, and escitalopram serum concentrations were significantly increased 2‐fold and 1.2‐fold in the CYP2C19 PMs and CYP2C19 IMs groups, respectively. Compared to the CYP2C19 NMs group, the antidepressant switching rate of sertraline in the CYP2C19 PMs and CYP2C19 IMs groups was significantly increased 5.8‐fold and 2.8‐fold; the antidepressant switching rate of escitalopram in the CYP2C19 RMs, CYP2C19 PMs, and CYP2C19 IMs groups was increased 13.1‐fold, 3.7‐fold, and 2.4‐fold, respectively. The CYP2C19 genotype exerts a substantial influence on the exposure and the antidepressant switching rate of sertraline and escitalopram. CYP2C19 genotyping prior to administering drugs is clinically beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolizes around 20% of currently prescribed medications, including the antipsychotic risperidone. Previous studies reported greater odds of switching antipsychotic medication from risperidone among CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) without considering treatment duration up to the switch. Risperidone treatment failure, defined as risperidone treatment duration up to switching medication, was analyzed among 515 patients of the PsyMetab cohort using Kaplan–Meier estimates with log‐rank tests and Cox multivariate regression. Risperidone‐to‐paliperidone ratios were higher among CYP2D6 PMs (median: 2.78) vs. the other phenotypes (median: 0.14, P < 0.001). After 1 year of treatment, the proportion of patients who switched from risperidone was 44%. This proportion was increased to 70% among PMs, vs. 42% among the other CYP2D6 phenotypes ( P = 0.026). PMs' risk of switching increased over time (interaction PM*treatment duration: 1.01; P = 0.011), becoming statistically significant after 3 months of treatment, with 1.79 ( P = 0.028), 3.7 times ( P < 0.001) and 16.3 times higher ( P = 0.001) risk of switch at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively (95% confidence intervals: 1.07–3.01, 1.91–7.17, and 3.13–85.37, respectively). Considering a pharmacogenetic‐guided treatment, the number of patients needed to genotype to find one PM and lower the switching proportion from 70% to 42% would be 65. In conclusion, CYP2D6 PM status presented an increased risk of switching from risperidone over 1 year of treatment, the risk increasing over time and becoming statistically significant after the first 3 months of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Drug development approaches increasingly harness computational modeling to predict drug behavior. These in silico approaches, collectively termed “pharmacometrics”, have significant value in deriving biological meaning from the analysis of pooled drug concentration vs. time (CvT) datasets. However, the field lacks standardization for pharmacokinetic data description, requiring expert annotation to enable aggregate mining and sharing. These limitations impede data sharing and preservation as mandated by current NIH policies. To this end, we propose a minimum information standard for pharmacokinetic studies composed of three categories ( Intervention , System , and Concentration ). We implement this standard in the development of a web‐based database: the HIV Pharmacology Data Repository (HIV PDR). We describe our technical approach for creating the HIV PDR, the protocols we established for standardized data deposition, and the current content of the database. We also demonstrate the utility of the HIV PDR for pharmacometrics research through computational modeling of CvT data extracted from this new database. Based on these efforts, we propose the HIV PDR as a standard to preserve and share pharmacokinetic data generated through preclinical and clinical HIV research.",

    "abstract": "P2Y 12 inhibitor selection involves numerous factors, including CYP2C19 genetics, since evidence demonstrates reduced clopidogrel efficacy in patients with decreased or no function CYP2C19 variants. In 2020, Indiana University health embedded interruptive clinical decision support ( CDS ) alerts in the electronic health record ( EHR ) to recommend alternative P2Y 12 inhibitors for patients with decreased CYP2C19 function who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ). The objective of this study was to evaluate prescriber response to these CDS alerts. Utilizing alert response data and P2Y 12 inhibitor prescriptions from October 2020 to December 2023, we evaluated prescriber response for 362 patients who had a mean of 2.2 (SD: 1.7) CYP2C19 ‐clopidogrel alerts fire post‐PCI. Alert recommendations were accepted 24.5% ± 36.8% (mean ± SD) of the time. Alternative (i.e., non‐clopidogrel) P2Y 12 inhibitors were prescribed for 22.4% ± 36.8% of days during the year following PCI. Alerts were accepted more for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers than for intermediate metabolizers ( P = 0.03). Each year after 2020 was associated with a 4.6% increase in the days prescribed alternative P2Y 12 inhibitors. In contrast, increasing age was associated with decreased alert acceptance and decreased percentage of days prescribed alternatives, and concomitant oral anticoagulant use was associated with decreased percentage of days prescribed alternatives. Provider clinical judgment was the most common alert override reason, accounting for 68% of clinician responses. Our findings demonstrate that CYP2C19 ‐clopidogrel CDS alerts promoted genotype‐guided P2Y 12 inhibitor prescribing in some cases (~22% of study days). Future research should better determine prescriber reasons for rejecting alert recommendations and establish best implementation practices to complement CDS alerts.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the perspectives and trade‐offs of EU regulators about expedited approvals for treatments of patients with advanced cancer. The study consisted of a cross‐sectional survey with assessors and experts from the network of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). First, general attitudes were collected using a 5‐point Likert scale. Second, a conjoint analysis was used to assess the compatibility of “conditional approval” for different scenarios of response rate, response duration, and toxicity from a single‐arm trial, and timeliness of confirmatory data. The survey was completed by 60 participants out of 351 invited participants. The majority agreed that outstanding activity is indicative of efficacy, that toxicity is a concern, and that confirmatory trials should be ongoing at the time of approval. The majority also agreed that conditional approval is not well understood by patients and doctors. Opinions varied on the usefulness of external comparator studies. Higher antitumour activity could outweigh higher toxicity or longer time to confirmation. Based on confidence with expedited pathways and evidence generation, participants could be categorized as “supportive,” “pragmatic,” and “cautious.” The importance of toxicity and timeliness of confirmatory studies was similar between groups but varied for antitumour activity. This study highlighted different attitudes when balancing speed of access with incomplete evidence in situations of high unmet medical needs. Confidence in expedited pathways and early evidence varied. There is an opportunity for improving communication and better alignment on evidentiary standards for expedited approvals.",

    "abstract": "Alemtuzumab is a T cell‐depleting monoclonal antibody that is used for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection. The duration of lymphodepletion after the current standard induction therapy dose is likely longer than necessary, resulting in prolonged T cell lymphopenia with the associated risk of infections. Here, the interplay between alemtuzumab exposure and T cell dynamics was quantitatively evaluated, and the influence of different doses on T cell recovery was investigated. A population pharmacokinetic‐pharmacodynamic model describing the interplay between 30 mg alemtuzumab induction therapy and T cell dynamics in kidney transplantation was developed using NONMEM, using pharmacodynamic data from the Triton study (NCT02057965). The developed model was used to perform an exposure‐response analysis and investigate dose optimization with model‐derived simulations. In total, 418 peripheral blood T cell measurements from 61 adult kidney transplant recipients were included for model development. A single‐compartment turnover E max model with a first‐order T cell influx with feedback and a first‐order T cell efflux with parallel alemtuzumab‐stimulated T cell removal best described the data. Higher alemtuzumab exposure was associated with lower individual‐predicted T cells 4 weeks after administration and longer T cell recovery (> 200 cells/μL). In the simulations, a fixed dose of 15 mg improved median recovery times by 19 days as compared to the standard 30 mg dose without influencing early T cell depletion. A population pharmacokinetic‐pharmacodynamic model adequately described T cell dynamics after alemtuzumab induction therapy in kidney transplant recipients. This model can be used to inform future dose‐optimization studies of alemtuzumab in different clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the most prevalent inherited kidney disease and leads to bilateral kidney enlargement and progressive loss of renal function, often over decades. Comorbidities include hypertension, flank pain, and bacterial infections. The condition often necessitates prolonged multidrug therapy. Given the kidneys' critical role in drug excretion, the progressive functional impairment in the disease can lead to complications such as drug overdosing and unexpected levels of drug–drug interactions. Studies of drug‐metabolizing enzyme and transporter expression in this patient group remain scarce. We conducted comprehensive global liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry proteomic analyses of microsomal and cytosolic fractions from early‐stage (chronic kidney disease stage: 13, n = 16) and end‐stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients (chronic kidney disease stage: 5, n = 14), comparing them with age‐matched healthy controls ( n = 11). In the early‐stage ADPKD samples, most drug‐metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters did not differ significantly from the healthy controls. Exceptions were EPHX2 and SULT1C2 in the cytosolic fraction, which showed a more than 2‐fold decrease in abundance ( P < 0.05). In contrast, the end‐stage ADPKD kidney samples showed a decrease in the abundance of most measured proteins. Several drug‐metabolizing enzymes, including CYP4F2, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7, exhibited statistically significant reductions ( P < 0.05). Among the drug transporters, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 were below the limit of quantification in most ES‐ADPKD samples. MDR1 was the only efflux drug transporter consistently measured, with an average abundance of 1.24 pmol/mg microsomal protein across all samples.",

A population pharmacokinetic model for JNJ‐73763989 was developed based on pooled data from seven clinical studies to characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of the short‐interfering RNAs following subcutaneous administration. Additionally, simulations of liver (target organ) exposure using the final population pharmacokinetic model in conjunction with preclinical information were performed. Disposition of JNJ‐73763976 and JNJ‐73763924 was governed by a linear two‐compartment model describing the peripheral distribution of both short‐interfering RNAs and a saturable component describing liver uptake via the asialoglycoprotein receptor. While the estimated first‐order absorption rate constant was similar for both short‐interfering RNAs, the corresponding absorption half‐life values were 20‐ to 40‐fold longer than the estimated plasma elimination half‐life for both short‐interfering RNAs, indicating absorption rate‐limited or “flip‐flop” kinetics. Plasma‐to‐liver transport of each short‐interfering RNA was modeled by a saturable, receptor‐mediated competitive process, and the affinity for the asialoglycoprotein receptor was 2.5‐fold higher for JNJ‐73763924 relative to JNJ‐73763976. Predicted liver concentrations of both short‐interfering RNA triggers approached steady state after 12 months of JNJ‐73763989 treatment. The 2:1 dosing ratio of JNJ‐73763976 to JNJ‐73763924 was predicted to maintain an ~2:1 liver concentration ratio, irrespective of the identified plasma disposition differences between the triggers. Body weight, creatinine clearance, presence of chronic hepatitis B, and hepatic impairment were associated with plasma pharmacokinetic parameters and were included in the final population pharmacokinetic model.",

Target FIX activity levels in plasma should be individually set primarily taking bleeding tendency into account, alongside the presence of target joints, physical activity, and preferred dosing schedules. In other words, both PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) are relevant when individualizing therapy. Our objective was to examine the relationship between dose, FIX activity levels, and bleeding specifically for EHL‐FIX concentrate recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with albumin (rIX‐FP). Data from hemophilia B patients with endogenous FIX activity level ≤ 2 IU/dL from five clinical trials were combined. Bleeding probability was described with a parametric repeated time‐to‐event (RTTE) model. Data included 2,493 FIX activity levels and 514 bleeds from 114 unique patients with a median age of 26 years (range: 1–61) followed for a median of 416 days (range: 6–1,233). Joints were the most frequent bleeding site (46%), and more than half of the bleeds were trauma‐related (52%). Overall, 60% and 40% were categorized as damage‐causing or nuisance bleeds, respectively. A baseline hazard of 7.3 bleeds per year was calculated when FIX activity levels were set at zero. The probability of all bleeding decreased by 50% when the FIX activity level was 12 IU/dL. Variability in bleeding hazard between individuals with similar FIX activity levels was substantial (182%). Simulations showed that targeting trough FIX activity levels to 20 IU/dL resulted in a median annual bleeding rate (ABR) of zero (range: 0–3).",

Accurate inhibitor classification is essential for evaluating phenoconversion and managing drug–drug interactions. The objective of this study was to assess the concordance between inhibitor classifications according to the FDA and Flockhart tables and pharmacokinetic data from the primary literature. A scoping review of PubMed, product labels, and the Drug Interactions Database (DIDB®) up to April 2024 was conducted. Inhibitor‐substrate pairs (e.g., fluoxetine‐omeprazole) were assigned literature‐reported classifications (i.e., weak, moderate, or strong) based on pharmacokinetic data. Concordance between literature‐reported and listed classifications was evaluated. Of 90 inhibitor‐substrate pairs identified, 66% involved sensitive substrates, which were the focus of our primary analysis. Among sensitive inhibitor‐substrate pairs, 36% of FDA‐listed and 45% of Flockhart‐listed classifications were concordant with the literature. CYP2C19 phenotype appeared to impact concordance, with greater concordance among normal metabolizers for both FDA‐listed (42%) and Flockhart‐listed (50%) classifications. Steady state status and dosing also appeared to affect concordance. Discrepancies between listed and literature‐reported classifications led to the following recommendations: (1) upgrade fluoxetine from moderate to strong in the Flockhart Table™, (2) upgrade fluconazole from moderate to strong in the Flockhart Table™, (3) downgrade omeprazole (and esomeprazole) from moderate to weak in the Flockhart Table™, and (4) include footnotes describing dose‐dependent inhibition for fluvoxamine and fluconazole in both tables. These recommendations aim to improve the accuracy of CYP2C19 inhibitor classifications and the clinical utility of these tables.",

    "abstract": "Optimal dosing of oncological drugs is historically determined based on the “higher is better” paradigm. However, a paradigm shift in optimal dose selection has occurred in the development of new modalities, including molecularly targeted drugs, antibody drugs, and immunotherapies. In 2021, Project Optimus was launched by the Food and Drug Administration Oncology Center of Excellence to reform the dose optimization and dose selection paradigm in oncology drug development. In August 2024, “Optimizing the Dosage of Human Prescription Drugs and Biological Products for the Treatment of Oncologic Diseases” was published, encouraging randomized evaluation of the benefit/risk profile of a range of doses before initiating a registration trial. Although Project Optimus offers general guidance on dose optimization, it does not specify which early clinical data requires a more cautious approach to dose optimization. This is the first comprehensive study to investigate newly approved oncology drugs by the FDA over a long period and to identify the risk factors for postmarketing requirement or commitment to dose optimization, using logistic regression analysis. Our findings show that when the labeled dose is the maximum tolerated dose, the percentage of adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation is increased, and an exposure‐safety relationship is established, the risk for postmarketing requirement or commitment to dose optimization is increased. Our study will provide actionable, data‐driven insights into dose optimization strategies by objectively and quantitatively evaluating risk factors. These findings will serve as valuable guidance for designing more effective early‐phase trials, complementing the FDA Project Optimus guidance.",

    "abstract": "The recent ICH M12 guidance on Drug Interaction Studies encourages the use of alternate approaches for predicting drug–drug interaction (DDI) potential of new chemical entities. One approach involves the use of endogenous substrates of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET) as biomarkers, which can assess the inhibitory potential of new chemical entities towards DMET during Phase 1 clinical studies. Thus, biomarkers could potentially eliminate the need for dedicated DDI studies with exogenous probe substrates. Metabolomics, in conjunction with in vitro and/or in vivo preclinical models or clinical studies, can be used for biomarker discovery. We developed and applied a novel metabolomics‐based DMET biomarker discovery (MDBD) approach to identify and qualify biomarkers of renal organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1) and OAT3. Untargeted metabolomics of pooled plasma and urine samples ( n = 16) from a pharmacokinetic DDI study using the OAT1/3 inhibitor, probenecid, yielded 153 features identified as putative OAT1/3 biomarkers. Subsequently, in vitro transporter uptake assays using processed urine samples confirmed 57 of these features as OAT1 and/or OAT3 substrates. Finally, 23 features were clinically validated as OAT1/3 biomarkers through a detailed pharmacokinetic analysis (0–24 h) of plasma and urine samples ( n = 4). These biomarkers, either alone or as part of a panel, can predict OAT1/3‐mediated DDIs and interindividual variability in the renal secretory clearance of organic anions across different populations, thereby enabling translational utility in clinical settings. The novel MDBD approach can be extended to discover biomarkers of enzymes and other transporters.",

    "abstract": "Optimal pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, including tissue distribution, is pivotal for a drug achieving success in clinical trials. Traditionally, PK estimation in early drug development has relied on extensive in vitro and in vivo testing to assess drug‐like properties, a process that is not only costly and time‐consuming but also limited in its ability to evaluate the synergistic effects of multiple properties. This study aims to develop an integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) platform to rapidly estimate drug in vivo fate based solely on molecular structures. The AI models were trained to predict eight types of key properties (solubility, pKa values, crystal density, intrinsic dissolution rate, apparent permeability, protein unbound fraction, plasma clearance, and tissue partition coefficients for 15 organs), from which the PBPK model forecasted PK curves without further training. The AI‐PBPK approach was validated against human PK data of 71 intravenous and 606 oral administrations collected from the PK‐DB database. The results were robust, with most of the AUC predictions falling within two and threefold error ranges. The AI‐PBPK model also accurately predicted drug organ selectivity, and for drugs exhibiting high plasma clearance, predictions were optimized through an inter‐species extrapolation approach. This study illustrates that the developed modeling strategy adeptly addresses pivotal PK challenges in drug discovery and aligns with contemporary drug development processes. The modeling system can guide candidate selection, advancing more drugs with favorable PK profiles into clinical trials, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of drug development.",

Different LSD formulations (base or tartrate, oral or intravenous) are being used. Unclear is whether LSD base and tartrate pharmacokinetics are equivalent. Additionally, LSD's absolute oral bioavailability is unknown. Therefore, we tested the bioequivalence of different oral LSD base and tartrate formulations and defined LSD's absolute oral bioavailability at a dose of ~80 μg freebase equivalent. We used a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, five‐period crossover design in 20 healthy participants to investigate an ethanolic drinking solution of LSD base, a watery drinking solution of LSD tartrate, a rapid dissolvable tablet of LSD base, an intravenous formulation of LSD tartrate, and corresponding placebos. We assessed pharmacokinetic parameters and acute subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects up to 24 hours. All oral formulations were bioequivalent, with the ethanolic base solution as a reference. The area under the concentration–time curve from zero to infinity and maximum plasma concentration were within a 90% confidence interval of 80–125%. The absolute bioavailability of oral LSD was 80% and similar for all tested formulations. Overall, the oral formulations showed comparable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. Intravenous LSD administration produced higher “any drug effect,” “good drug effect,” and “ego dissolution” compared with oral LSD tartrate, more “anxiety” compared with all oral formulations, and more “nausea” and “bad drug effect” compared with oral LSD base and tartrate. In conclusion, dosing with LSD base and tartrate can be considered bioequivalent with high and similar oral bioavailability.",

    "abstract": "Organic cation transporter (OCT) 2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) transporters play significant roles in the renal secretion of organic cations and drug–drug interactions (DDIs). Recent in vitro studies indicate that the K i values for OCT2 exhibit substrate dependency and increase in potency with pre‐incubation. However, consensus is lacking on whether these factors should be considered in predicting in vivo inhibition. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, combined with the extended clearance concept, have been used and are discussed here for OCT2/MATEs probes. In addition to modeling, early clinical studies use endogenous biomarkers to evaluate transporter‐mediated DDI risk, with the aim of avoiding unnecessary clinical DDI studies. Identified biomarkers for OCT2/MATEs, such as creatinine, N 1 ‐methylnicotinamide, and N 1 ‐methyladenosine, have proven useful in confirming clinically relevant OCT2/MATEs‐mediated DDIs when renal clearance (CLr) is used as an endpoint; their application is discussed further. From a clinical perspective, the intact nephron hypothesis (INH), which postulates that the decrease in CLr in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is proportional to that in nephron numbers, has been proposed. However, reports suggest that the secretion clearance of creatinine and substrates of organic anion transporters (OATs) does not follow this proportionality in patients with CKD. This state‐of‐the‐art review highlights key developments in predicting OCT2/MATEs‐mediated DDIs in healthy volunteers and explores the prediction of clinical OCT2/MATEs DDI risk in patients with CKD by comparing substrate‐dependent changes in secretion clearance for substrates of OCT2/MATEs and OATs. Recommendations for the prediction of OCT2/MATEs‐mediated DDI risk, together with the current knowledge gaps and future directions, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Pemetrexed is a cornerstone in chemo(immunotherapy) of non‐small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma; however, it is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment due to severe toxicity concerns. Therefore, a large proportion of patients is withheld from effective chemo(immunotherapy). We performed an intra‐patient 3 + 3 dose escalation renal impairment study (eGFR < 45 mL/min). The pemetrexed dose was calculated based on renal function to reach a target AUC, and patients received oral folinic acid prophylaxis 45 mg four times daily on Days 2–15 of each cycle. Endpoints included safety (incidence of hematological and non‐hematological toxicity, treatment delays) and pharmacokinetics in line with regulatory guidance for renal impairment trials. Six patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 26 and 41 mL/min were included. All patients were successfully escalated to the full dose. Adverse event patterns and pharmacokinetics were comparable to those in patients with normal renal function. Grade I/II anemia occurred in five patients (already present at baseline). One occurrence of grade IV neutropenia was observed, which resolved without intervention. Moreover, in three patients, a 1‐week treatment delay occurred. Treatment resulted in a response in four patients ( n = 1 complete response, n = 2 partial response, n = 1 stable disease). Pemetrexed can be safely administered in patients with impaired renal function when the dose is calculated based on renal function and folinic acid prophylaxis is administered, thereby enabling an effective treatment modality for patients that, thus far, could not be treated.",

    "abstract": "In silico trials, utilizing mathematical models calibrated with clinical data, present a transformative approach to expedite drug development. We propose a virtual trial framework for chronic Hepatitis B, accurately simulating clinical protocols, patient characteristics, and endpoints using a mechanistic mathematical model. Clinical trial simulations with this model successfully captured functional cure with standard‐of‐care therapies (nucleos(t)ide analogs and pegylated interferon) as well as complex clinical observations, facilitating mechanistic hypothesis generation and suggesting biomarker signatures that may predict treatment outcomes. In silico trials revealed that responders exhibited enhanced cytotoxic immunity and significant serum‐alanine transaminase increases, suggesting a potential response biomarker. However, a higher baseline Hepatitis B surface antigen did not proportionately increase cytotoxic antiviral immune responses, indicating a potential immune ceiling but in the face of increasing systemic antigen burden, therefore culminating in a lower treatment response. Virtual patients enabled the generation of large virology biomarker synthetic datasets, which empowered a machine learning model to predict functional cure in virtual patients with ~ 95% accuracy. This underscores the potential of in silico trials in enhancing clinical trials, generating mechanistic hypotheses, and accelerating chronic Hepatitis B drug development.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR::ABL1 have greatly improved the survival of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and their teratogenicity appears as an important factor for individuals of childbearing potential. This study aims to investigate pregnancy and fetal/newborn adverse outcomes resulting from exposure to BCR::ABL1‐TKIs during pregnancy. For this disproportionality analysis, we used the WHO's global VigiBase up to January 2024, and included reports involving pregnancy, antineoplastic treatment during pregnancy, and cancer. The exposure group consisted of reports mentioning BCR::ABL1‐TKIs at any time during pregnancy. The primary outcome was the reporting odds ratio (ROR) of maternal‐fetal complications in the BCR::ABL1‐TKIs group compared to other anticancer treatments. The analysis included 3,389 reports (TKI = 969; other = 2,420). In the BCR::ABL1‐TKI‐exposed group, the mean age was 28.9 years, and 724 patients (92.2%) were treated for CML. BCR::ABL1‐TKIs were mainly imatinib ( n = 642, 66.3%), nilotinib ( n = 218, 22.5%), and dasatinib ( n = 127, 13.1%) reported without other non‐TKI anticancer agents(92.3%). Compared to other anticancer drugs, overreported outcomes with TKIs included hydrops fetalis (ROR = 13 [95%CI = 1.5–110], P = 0.009), polyhydramnios (ROR = 5 [1.3–20], P = 0.02), and threatened preterm labor (ROR = 10 [1.1–90], P = 0.03). When analyzing specific molecule effects, hydrops fetalis (ROR = 27 [5.4–130], P = 0.001) and polyhydramnios (ROR = 13 [3.3–54], P = 0.004) were overreported with dasatinib. In this large cohort of 969 individuals exposed to TKIs during pregnancy, dasatinib use was associated with most BCR::ABL1‐TKI‐specific toxicities and should be avoided during pregnancy. Fewer or no adverse events were overreported with imatinib and nilotinib.",

    "abstract": "Pazopanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in patients with either metastatic renal cell carcinoma or soft tissue sarcoma. Pazopanib has a high interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and a well‐established exposure–response relationship. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to improve the efficacy–toxicity balance. Intra‐patient variability in pazopanib pharmacokinetics is moderate with a mean of 24.7%. In other fields, such as transplantation medicine, a high intra‐patient variability of immunosuppressive drugs has previously been associated with worse outcomes. Whether this also applies to therapeutic modalities in oncology is unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between pazopanib intra‐patient variability and clinical outcomes. Data from patients diagnosed with either metastatic renal cell carcinoma or soft tissue sarcoma treated with pazopanib guided by routine therapeutic drug monitoring with at least three available pazopanib trough concentrations were retrieved. Non‐dose corrected estimated trough concentrations were used to calculate intra‐patient variability. Among 144 patients, median intra‐patient variability was 30.2%. The high intra‐patient variability group (intra‐patient variability > 30.2%) was at risk for worse progression‐free survival (HR 1.42; 95% CI 0.85–2.35) and overall survival (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.10–4.29) in patients with renal cell carcinoma. No association between a high intra‐patient variability and clinical outcomes for patients with soft tissue sarcoma could be established. Our results show that high intra‐patient variability is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. A high intra‐patient variability urges the treating clinician to address therapy adherence, drug–drug and food–drug interactions, and improve chances for optimal treatment outcome.",

This approach was suggested by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following review of the primary endpoint analysis results of secukinumab 3 mg/kg q4w IV in patients with PsA (INVIGORATE‐2 study). Noting the higher exposure of the investigated IV regimen compared to the approved SC regimens, the FDA considered that the INVIGORATE‐2 data available through Week 16 only may not convey sufficient safety information to support the benefit–risk assessment of this IV regimen. A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis was conducted on a pool of 15 PsA or axSpA clinical trials to identify 1.75 mg/kg IV secukinumab q4w (with or without a 6 mg/kg IV loading dose at Week 0) as a regimen with steady‐state exposure within the ranges of the approved SC regimens. This entitled its efficacy and safety to be assessed by full extrapolation from those of the approved SC regimens. This extrapolation was substantiated by the use of exposure‐response analyses to predict the efficacy and safety of the IV regimen. Based on those analyses, this IV secukinumab regimen, not tested in clinical trials, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with PsA and axSpA.",

The impact of genotype in patients undergoing PCI for stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) in real‐world populations is less clear. We determined time to major adverse cardiac event (MACE), defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction, within 12 months following PCI in the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) participants treated with clopidogrel from 1/1/2009 to 9/30/2017. Among 9061 Veterans (mean age 66.4 ± 8.7 years, 98% male, 13% Black); 43% had ACS, 57% had SIHD, and 28% carried a CYP2C19 LOF allele. In total, 619 patients (6.8%) experienced MACE, 317 (8.2%) in the ACS group and 302 (5.8%) in the SIHD group. Overall, a trend toward increased MACE risk was seen in the LOF carriers vs. non‐carriers (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.13, confidence interval [95% CI] 0.98–1.31, P = 0.097), with a stronger risk among those presenting with ACS (aHR 1.20, 95% CI 0.98–1.47; P = 0.083). In post hoc analyses, LOF was associated with a significantly increased risk of MACE among younger (< 66 years) patients with ACS (aHR 1.41 [1.04–1.91], P = 0.028); however, no difference in risk was observed among older patients (aHR 1.07, 95% CI 0.80–1.40, P = 0.676). There was no impact of genotype in patients with SIHD (aHR 1.09, 95% CI 0.82–1.44, P = 0.565). Clinical factors may be more important than CYP2C19 genotype in determining the risk of MACE in older Veterans treated with clopidogrel undergoing PCI for ACS.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing efforts to optimize the dosages of oncology drugs have largely focused on the initial indication, with emphasis placed on maximizing the utility of all available evidence to improve dose finding, dose selection, and trial design; however, optimizing dosages for new combinations or subsequent indications is more complex and warrants further discussion. For example, the dose–response (DR) or exposure–response (ER) relationships can change when multiple drugs are used (combination therapies) and can differ between tumor types, patient populations, and treatment settings (subsequent indications). Quantitative approaches can help address the challenges of optimizing dosages for new combinations or subsequent indications. To further this dialogue, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Clinical Pharmacology and the International Society of Pharmacometrics co‐sponsored a workshop to discuss the development of investigational and approved drugs in new combinations or for subsequent indications using model‐informed approaches to investigate, support, and select optimized dosages for oncology drugs.",

    "abstract": "Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP) is an ultra‐rare, potentially life‐threatening condition caused by a deficiency of the blood enzyme ADAMTS13. Until now, ADAMTS13 replacement has been achieved with infusions of plasma or plasma‐based therapies (PBT). However, the quantitative relationship between ADAMTS13 plasma activity and clinical manifestations is poorly understood. We therefore conducted integrated population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) analysis and exposure–response modeling based on three clinical trials of recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13, Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.) in patients with cTTP. These aim to assess the clinical benefit of rADAMTS13, which at the proposed dose of 40 IU/kg provides ADAMTS13 peak levels of approximately 100% of normal levels. The PK model indicated that, besides body weight–based dosing, no further dose adjustment was required based on age or race. The only extrinsic covariates with a significant impact on ADAMTS13 plasma activity levels were dosing interval and treatment type (rADAMTS13 vs. PBT). The correlation between ADAMTS13 plasma activity levels and cTTP manifestations was investigated with three different exposure – response models. Increasing exposure to ADAMTS13, as measured by average activity over a one‐to‐two‐week period, predicted the probability of disease manifestations, primarily assessed as thrombocytopenia. Model simulations predicted that >90% of patients treated with 40 IU/kg rADAMTS13 achieve an average ADAMTS13 plasma activity >13% of normal, which was shown to be highly protective against thrombocytopenia (>70% lower hazard). Similar results were observed for protection against elevation of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Overall, these results support the use of rADAMTS13 treatment for patients with cTTP.",

    "abstract": "Barriers to incorporating pharmacogenetics into routine clinical practice in the United States are well documented. Initial surveys by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) in 2009 and 2010 identified barriers across four key domains that have hindered the widespread adoption of clinical pharmacogenetic testing. These are presented verbatim as: (i) absence of a definition of the processes required to interpret genotype information and to translate genetic information into clinical actions; (ii) need for recommended drug/gene pairs to implement clinically now; (iii) clinician resistance to consider pharmacogenetic information at the bedside; and (iv) concerns about test costs and reimbursement. Over time, many of these challenges have been overcome, and clinical pharmacogenetic testing has subsequently reached broader implementation. Despite this progress, several barriers remain that block further adoption. This narrative review used authors' expertise and experience to identify and describe current barriers to pharmacogenetic implementation across seven domains in the United States: equity and inclusion; guidelines and supporting evidence; regulatory agency oversight; payer coverage and insurance; availability of quality pharmacogenetic tests; electronic health records; and provider and patient education. Within each domain, it revisits past successes and challenges and explores remaining barriers. We also propose solutions to address ongoing challenges across these domains, including further expansion of recommendations beyond pharmacogenetic‐specific guidelines, standards for designing clinical decision support tools, and broader pharmacogenetics education. Addressing these remaining obstacles directs work to enable broader adoption of clinical pharmacogenetic implementation to ultimately improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease with aging, characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and higher fragility fracture risk. Although current pharmacological interventions provide therapeutic benefits, long‐term use is limited by side effects and comorbidities. In this study, we employed driver signaling network identification (DSNI) and drug functional networks (DFN) to identify repurposable drugs from the Library of Integrated Network‐Based Cellular Signatures. We constructed osteoporosis driver signaling networks (ODSN) using multi‐omics data and developed DFN based on drug similarity. By integrating ODSN and DFN with drug‐induced transcriptional responses, we screened 10,158 compounds and identified several drugs with strong targeting effects on ODSN. Mendelian randomization assessed potential causal links between cis‐eQTLs of drug targets and BMD using genome‐wide association study data. Our findings indicate four drugs, including Ruxolitinib, Alfacalcidol, and Doxercalciferol, may exert anti‐osteoporosis effects. Notably, Acebutolol, a β‐blocker for hypertension, has not previously been implicated in osteoporosis therapy. For validation, zebrafish osteoporosis models were established using Dexamethasone‐induced bone loss, followed by treatment with Acebutolol hydrochloride and Alfacalcidol. Both compounds demonstrated significant protective effects against osteoporosis‐related bone deterioration. Furthermore, a population‐based data set, utilizing propensity score matching and analyzed via a generalized linear model, revealed that individuals taking β‐blocker drugs exhibited significantly higher BMD than users of other cardiovascular medications. In summary, this study integrates multi‐omics approaches, experimental validation, and real‐world population data to propose acebutolol as a novel candidate for osteoporosis treatment. These findings warrant further mechanistic studies and clinical trials to evaluate its efficacy in osteoporosis management.",

    "abstract": "Real‐World Evidence (RWE) is increasingly used in submissions to regulatory agencies and health technology assessment bodies (HTAbs) to support the efficacy and effectiveness of new medicines and indications. However, there is limited information on the RWE characteristics that impact its role in approval and reimbursement decisions. To investigate these characteristics, we developed FRAME: a Framework for Real‐world evidence Assessment to Mitigate Evidence uncertainties for efficacy/effectiveness. We compiled a list of medicinal product indications where RWE supported the efficacy of interventional trials or assessed effectiveness in observational settings. FRAME was applied to a prioritized subset of these submissions to authorities from North America, Europe, and Australia. For each product indication, we extracted information on characteristics describing the submission, clinical context, strength of evidence, and process factors from publicly available assessment reports. Of the 87 identified medicinal product indications, 15 were prioritized, covering 68 submissions and 76 RWE studies across 11 authorities in scope. Four main results emerged: (i) low granularity within assessment reports on the analyzed variables, limiting the learnings from analyzing them; (ii) variability in how RWE was assessed within and across regulatory agencies and HTAbs; (iii) a positive association between the proportion of positive comments from authorities on RWE studies and their impact on decision making. Particularly, a large effect size was consistently noted when RWE was considered primary evidence; and (iv) limited use of advanced RWE study designs. These findings support five recommendations to enhance shared learning on RWE, clarify its evidentiary value, and generate evidence to better support authorities' decision making.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacomicrobiomics is an emerging field due to important microbiome effects on pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. However, the application of this knowledge remains limited. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the primary active metabolite of the immunosuppressant, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). MPA undergoes glucuronidation to form MPA glucuronide (MPAG) which is deglucuronidated by bacterial β‐glucuronidases and reformed as MPA through enterohepatic circulation (EHC). We studied the stool microbiome effect on the pharmacokinetics of MPA, its metabolites, and EHC in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients using a semi‐mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model. Microbiome communities were identified using correlation network analysis, and their impact on pharmacokinetics was assessed using full fixed‐effects modeling. Simulations were then conducted to evaluate MMF dosing regimens and to assess the impact of community abundance on EHC and MPA therapeutic target achievement. High abundance of Bacteroides uniformis ‐dominant and Bacteroides vulgatus ‐dominant communities was associated with higher EHC and an increase in MPA exposure. Low abundance of these communities was associated with a 52–80% and 4–83% lower EHC and MPA exposure, respectively. Simulations showed 70% of individuals with low abundance of these communities achieved the therapeutic target at the typical HCT MMF dose of 1,000 mg Q8 hours IV; however, ≥ 95% were within the therapeutic target at 1,250 mg Q8 hours or 1,750 mg Q12 hours. EHC accounted for 34% of the MPA area under the curve. Elimination of EHC reduced troughs by 100%. This work quantifies the microbiome's effect on pharmacokinetics, paving the way for future microbiome‐informed dosing to optimize therapeutic target attainment.",

    "abstract": "Immune‐checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer treatment but are responsible for various immune‐related adverse events (irAE). The impact of non‐anticancer medications (comedications) on irAE occurrence remains largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to assess comedications associated with an increased reporting of irAE with ICIs. In this pharmacovigilance study, all individual case safety reports (ICSRs) involving ICIs reported in the World Health Organization international pharmacovigilance database Vigibase up to January 2024 were extracted. All suspect or interacting comedications were analyzed individually and as drug classes using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification level 4. The primary outcome was the reporting odds ratio (ROR) of irAE in patients who received both an ICI and the comedication of interest, compared with ICI‐treated patients who did not receive that comedication. Among 169,753 ICSRs involving an ICI, a total of 314,366 comedications were recorded, with 8,122 identified as “suspect or interacting.” Analysis shows an increased reporting of nephritis with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) (ROR = 29.62 [95% CI = 18.61–47.14]) and with non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (ROR = 10.47 [95% CI = 4.15–26.41]), myositis with statins (ROR = 9.41 [95% CI = 3.50–25.30]), ketoconazole with hepatitis (ROR = 20.49 [95% CI = 1.53–274.17]) and autoimmune bullous disease with dipeptyl‐peptidase‐4 inhibitors (ROR = 46.42 [95% CI = 11.71–184.05]), among others. Various drugs, including PPI (ROR = 8.61 [95% CI = 3.48–21.26]), some anti‐infectives (sulfamethoxazole, ROR = 31.31 [95% CI = 13.32–73.61], clavulanic acid, ROR = 18.12 [95% CI = 4.77–68.89]), allopurinol (ROR = 57.11 [95% CI = 11.27–289.39]) or levetiracetam (ROR = 14.91 [95% CI = 2.15–103.64]) were associated with serious cutaneous adverse reactions. Complementary analysis showed higher ROR in the ICI population versus without ICI for the association of nephritis with ibuprofen (ROR ICI = 27.82 vs. ROR VigiBaseWithoutICI = 3.56, ROR ratio = 7.81 [95% CI = 1.23–49.50]) and myocarditis with influenza vaccine (ROR ICI = 22.74 vs. ROR VigiBaseWithoutICI = 0.66, ROR ratio = 34.45 [95% CI = 1.66–723.24]), suggesting a synergistic toxicity. This study identified multiple comedications associated with an increased reporting of specific irAE. Some of them might be synergistic warranting further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Polymyxins are used against highly resistant Gram‐negative pathogens, and nephrotoxicity (acute kidney injury, AKI) is the major dose‐limiting adverse effect. We aimed to develop a well‐informed population pharmacokinetic/toxicodynamic (PK/TD) model using the largest polymyxin B‐treated critically ill patient population studied to inform polymyxin B dosing strategies. Critically ill patients receiving intravenous polymyxin B for at least 48 hours were enrolled in an observational study. Serum creatinine (SCr) concentrations were collected from electronic medical records. PK/TD analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the probability of AKI, P (AKI), for clinically relevant treatments. Patients ( N = 117) aged 18–94 received intravenous polymyxin B (1.33–6.00 mg/kg/day) for 1–50 days. The changes in SCr were described using an indirect response model. The effects of polymyxin B‐induced functional kidney injury were characterized using 9 transit compartments (mean time to onset ~7 days), leading to a reduction in SCr elimination. Sex was identified as a significant covariate for baseline SCr 0 . Concomitant amikacin or vancomycin use resulted in increased sensitivity to polymyxin B. On day 21, Low ( f AUC 0–24 , SS = ~10 mg·h/L), medium ( f AUC 0–24,SS = ~20 mg·h/L ), and high ( f AUC 0–24,SS = ~40 mg·h/L) drug exposures resulted in a P (AKI) (> 1‐fold SCr increase) of 25.8%, 32.5%, and 40.4%, respectively. This study, the largest to date, suggests that regimens ranging from low to high polymyxin B exposures can minimize P (AKI) over a longer duration (14 days). However, supratherapeutic exposure can be administered relatively safely when limited to a shorter duration (≤ 4 days). The population PK/TD model may be used to improve polymyxin B dosing to help conserve this last‐line agent.",

    "abstract": "Axatilimab, a high‐affinity humanized monoclonal antibody that targets colony‐stimulating factor 1 receptor, is approved for the treatment of chronic graft‐versus‐host disease (cGVHD). Here, we describe the exposure‐response relationships for efficacy and safety in patients with cGVHD who received axatilimab. Exposure‐efficacy relationships were assessed in treated patients in the AGAVE‐201 study ( n = 239); exposure‐safety relationships were assessed in treated patients in AGAVE‐201 ( n = 239) and the phase 1/2 SNDX‐6352‐0503 study ( n = 39). For binary or time‐to‐event endpoints, logistic or Cox regression analyses, respectively, were performed using axatilimab exposure metrics that were derived from a previously developed population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. Overall response and ≥ 7‐point improvement in modified Lee Symptom Scale responses were associated with axatilimab exposure, with lower axatilimab exposure increasing the odds of a response. Duration of response was not associated with axatilimab exposure. Ten of 11 safety endpoints were associated with axatilimab exposure, with higher axatilimab exposure increasing the odds of adverse events. Among the 3 regimens evaluated in AGAVE‐201, the 0.3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (Q2W) regimen had the highest predicted probability of response. Additionally, this dose group had the lowest predicted probability of event occurrence across all 10 safety endpoints associated with exposure among the evaluated regimens. Despite body weight influencing axatilimab exposure by > 20%, its effect on efficacy and safety endpoints remained minimal, with a maximum difference of ≤ 0.4% and ≤ 4.4% between the 1st and 4th quartiles of body weight, respectively. Taken together, these findings support the benefit–risk profile of axatilimab 0.3 mg/kg Q2W in patients with cGVHD.",

    "abstract": "Busulfan is administered intravenously in conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with model‐informed precision dosing (MIPD) targeting a 4‐day cumulative AUC of 80–100 mg*hour/L. Three pharmacokinetic (PK) models—Bognar, Langenhorst, and McCune—were evaluated using data with a minimum of 1 and a median of 2 PK sampling days from pediatric and adult patients at two tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands. Simulations with the best‐performing model evaluated dose optimization and the role of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The Bognar and Langenhorst models, with overlapping datasets (25% between models, 21% with the current), accurately described busulfan concentration‐time curves in all 535 patients (0.18–72 years), especially in those > 60 years (bias and precision in clearance; −5.6%, 6.48% and 16.55%, 16.95%; in observed concentrations −1.86%, −6.52% and 9.12%, 3.58% for both models > 60 years). The McCune model underestimated clearance by 36% in children < 2 years of age. Despite accounting for age‐dependent glutathione depletion, the Langenhorst model did not outperform the simpler Bognar model. Model‐based initial dosing did not improve target attainment over SmPC‐based dosing. However, TDM‐based MIPD with a single TDM on days 2–4 significantly improved target attainment (49% vs. 87%), with a number needed to treat for TDM of 2.5. This study demonstrates the clinical efficacy of simple PK models such as the Bognar model, providing that simplicity does not compromise performance. It highlights the inadequacy of nomogram‐based dosing alone and reinforces the critical role of TDM in optimizing busulfan exposure for pediatric and adult myeloablative HSCT patients.",

    "abstract": "About half of the world's population is living with overweight or obesity. Tirzepatide is an approved treatment for chronic weight management. We sought to characterize the exposure–response relationship for weight reduction in patients with overweight or obesity and quantify the associated changes in body composition. Monthly body weight measurements were available from 2,539 study participants in a phase 3 clinical trial investigating placebo, 5, 10, or 15 mg of tirzepatide administered once‐weekly. The dependent variables used for modeling were fat‐free mass (FFM) and fat mass. These FFM and fat mass values were calculated for each patient based on their total body weight, height, and sex. The exposure–response model revealed that administration of tirzepatide resulted in three times greater reduction of fat mass than that of FFM. This differential effect resulted in improved body composition over time. The model results showed good agreement with available data from a subset (10%) of clinical trial participants who had dual energy x‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements. For the same drug exposure, females achieved greater weight reduction than males. Study participants with higher baseline weight or body mass index at baseline had a slower rate of weight reduction and were expected to take longer to reach their nadir weight. We present and propose the use of a pharmacometric‐based body composition model to describe weight reduction in future clinical trials investigating similar drugs in similar patient populations, in lieu of DXA scans. In such future trials, our approach can be used to describe exposure–response relationships, optimize doses, and investigate covariates, while considering potential differences in fat mass and FFM.",

    "abstract": "An unimpaired neurological evaluation is essential for detecting delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) patients. Nimodipine is currently the only drug approved for DCI prevention. Intravenous nimodipine infusion contains 23.7 vol% ethanol as an excipient, resulting in up to 45 g of ethanol being infused daily, which may interfere with neurological assessment. Therefore, we aimed to measure ethanol concentrations in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain parenchyma during the infusion of 0.5–2 mg of nimodipine per hour in aSAH patients to quantify the ethanol neuronal exposure. Ethanol concentrations were determined by headspace gas chromatography‐flame ionization detection in plasma and CSF and we set out brain parenchyma measurement using cerebral microdialysis, in 10 aSAH patients. In each compartment four samples were taken over a 6‐hour interval during steady‐state intravenous nimodipine infusion at four different doses (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/hour). A total of 307 samples from plasma and CSF was measured. Ethanol levels were mostly below the quantification limit of 0.002 g/100 mL. In 36 samples ethanol concentration was ≥ 0.002 g/100 mL, ranging from 0.002 to 0.009 g/100 mL. These low values were not reproducible in a second measurement, suggesting these values likely reflected analytical variability rather than true ethanol concentrations. Nimodipine analysis in brain parenchyma was omitted due to insufficient microdialysate volume and low concentrations in blood and CSF. Continuous nimodipine infusion of up to 2 mg/hour is unlikely to impair neurological assessment in aSAH patients, as no significant CSF ethanol concentration (< 0.002 g/100 mL) was detected.",

    "abstract": "The recent surge in T‐cell‐engaging and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapies is changing the landscape of cancer therapy. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that is a well‐known complication of these therapies, of which interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) is a key mediator. Tocilizumab, an IL‐6 receptor (IL‐6R) antagonist, is approved for the management of CAR T‐cell therapy‐induced CRS in adults and in pediatric patients aged ≥ 2 years old. However, the approved dosing schedule was not based on IL‐6R occupancy and may not be the most suitable schedule for T‐cell‐engaging therapies such as bispecific antibodies (bsAb) due to key differences in the levels of released IL‐6, the clinical symptomatology of CRS, and the pharmacology of tocilizumab across settings. In this study, we adapted a previously developed tocilizumab and soluble IL‐6R (sIL‐6R) population pharmacokinetic model to describe and predict tocilizumab concentrations and sIL‐6R occupancy over time in patients with anti‐CD20 bsAb‐induced CRS following tocilizumab dosing. Using this model, which incorporates target binding and receptor occupancy, we propose a new tocilizumab dosing regimen that is based on quantitative clinical pharmacology, cytokine analyses, and clinical practice patterns in patients with relapsed/refractory B‐cell non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (R/R B‐NHL) treated with the anti‐CD20 bsAb mosunetuzumab or glofitamab. This schedule (up to two 8 mg/kg intravenous tocilizumab doses per CRS event at least 8 hours apart and a maximum of three doses in 6 weeks) can be used to effectively manage acute CRS induced by anti‐CD20 bsAb in patients with R/R B‐NHL.",

    "abstract": "The US Food and Drug Administration 2024 guidance prefers regression analysis over categorical analysis for pharmacokinetic data for studies that assess pharmacokinetics in patients with impaired renal functions. The objective of this study was to compare these two statistical methods for pharmacokinetic data analysis of renal impairment studies. Baseline data from seven renal impairment studies were pooled to estimate the impact of three creatinine‐based equations (Cockcroft‐Gault, CKD‐EPI 2009 , and absolute CKD‐EPI 2009 ) on classification of participants into different renal impairment categories. Retrospective analyses were performed on two renal impairment studies with three distinct analytes (predominantly renally cleared; and predominantly metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, or by systemic peptidase) using regression or categorical statistical analysis methods and creatine‐based equations. While the three equations were highly correlated, the use of a different equation may result in up to 50% of participants being reclassified into different renal impairment groups. Categorical analysis with analysis of variance provided different point estimates and precision of exposure difference for a given renal impairment group based on the equation used. The use of regression analysis without inclusion of data from participants on hemodialysis, as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration, showed most consistent estimate of the relationship between renal impairment and exposure of three analytes. These retrospective analyses support the Food and Drug Administration recommendations of using regression analysis without data from participants on hemodialysis as the primary analysis of data for renal impairment study; and established a modeling strategy for such analysis.",

    "abstract": "Germline pharmacogenetics (PGx) is increasingly used to tailor medication selection/dosing. However, existing systems primarily communicate PGx results to providers, limiting direct patient engagement. To address this, we developed YourPGx Oncology, an innovative patient‐facing portal that delivers multi‐gene PGx results ( CYP2D6 , UGT1A1 , DPYD ) through 33 unique, patient‐friendly summaries. The utility of this tool was prospectively evaluated in an oncology population, where these pharmacogenes impact high‐stakes treatments. Patients enrolled in the PhOCus study (NCT04541381) participated in single‐session evaluations of the tool in‐person or via videoconference, with a pharmacist available for questions and administering pre‐ and post‐surveys that assessed educational impact. Each patient viewed their own previously obtained PGx results. Of 190 eligible patients, 70 responded to solicitations via email, phone, and in‐person, of whom 51 (73%) completed an observed session and completed surveys. Patients spent a median of 13.4 minutes (range 8.1–21.0) navigating YourPGx Oncology. After portal interaction, patients' ability to identify individual efficacy and safety estimates for chemotherapies and pain medications significantly improved, with the proportion accurately recognizing PGx‐informed drug efficacy likelihoods rising from 32% to 72% (Odds Ratio [OR] = 5.8 for the shift from discordant to concordant efficacy knowledge, P < 0.001), and PGx‐related toxicity recognition increasing from 31% to 57% (OR = 3.2, P = 0.01). Our findings show that a customized patient‐facing PGx results portal enhances patient understanding of individual medication efficacy and toxicity likelihoods, highlighting the potential key role of direct‐to‐patient PGx tools to facilitate optimized treatment‐informed care and promote genetically guided shared decision‐making.",

    "abstract": "The potential of real‐world data (RWD), particularly from patient registries, has been increasingly recognized over the last decade by academia, regulators, and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies for its role in assessing a product's effectiveness and supporting regulatory submissions. The selection of an appropriate RWD source is of primary concern, since the success of regulatory processes depends on the quality and relevance of the data. In more recent years, EMA and FDA have released extensive guidance on the use of RWD to produce evidence. Simultaneously, public and private research institutions have proposed structured frameworks developed to guide stakeholders in evaluating and selecting “fit‐for‐purpose” RWD sources. This scoping review provides an overview of these structured frameworks, identifying nine key tools, including the Registry Evaluation and Quality Standards Tool (REQueST) and the Structured Process to Identify Fit‐For‐Purpose Data (SPIFD2). Each framework is briefly described, followed by a comparative analysis of the criteria they assess. These criteria relate to dimensions such as study design, data reliability, data relevance, ethical considerations, and practical factors such as cost and feasibility. Our findings indicate that while these frameworks offer robust tools for ensuring the suitability of RWD sources, each has unique strengths and limitations depending on the specific context of use. By providing a comprehensive understanding of these frameworks, this review aims to assist stakeholders in identifying and/or evaluating and/or selecting the most appropriate RWD sources for generating high‐quality evidence for regulatory and HTA purposes.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers can support biosimilarity assessment, potentially reducing the need for comparative clinical efficacy studies. This study aimed to characterize previously identified proteomic PD biomarker candidates for Interferon beta‐1a (IFNβ‐1a, n = 248) and pegylated IFNβ‐1a (pegIFNβ‐1a, n = 528) biologics at therapeutic doses, to further evaluate the utility of proteomics in biosimilar development. Here, we reproduced the results at lower doses and characterized PD responses across multiple doses using criteria for justifying PD biomarker use in biosimilar development. We analyzed candidate proteins from longitudinal proteomics data (SomaScan™ Assay v4.1) from 48 healthy subjects administered intermediate or low doses of IFNβ‐1a (15, 7.5 μg) or pegIFNβ‐1a (62.5, 31.25 μg) in an FDA‐sponsored study, alongside previously published therapeutic dose and placebo data. EDTA plasma samples were collected at 0, 0.125, 0.33, 0.67, 1.33, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 days and at 9, 13 days additionally for pegIFNβ‐1a. Prioritization criteria included significant differential expression at the intermediate dose vs. placebo, ≥20% response difference from placebo, significant baseline‐adjusted area under the effect curve (AUEC) and a monotonic dose–response relationship across all doses. Among the candidates, 165 and 323 were differentially expressed at intermediate doses of IFNβ‐1a and pegIFNβ‐1a respectively. Nine PD biomarkers, including C‐X‐C motif chemokine 11 (I‐TAC), Lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG3), and Granulins (GRN), were prioritized as common to both biologics. Most candidates followed the E max dose–response model. I‐TAC showed the strongest response, and LAG‐3 showed the least variability in AUEC. Our study identified several suitable plasma PD biomarkers for IFNβ‐1a and pegIFNβ‐1a biologics with potential utility in biosimilar development programs.",

In FLAURA2 (NCT04035486), first‐line osimertinib plus platinum‐pemetrexed chemotherapy showed significant improvement in progression‐free survival over osimertinib monotherapy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor‐mutated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer. A population pharmacokinetics analysis using cumulative pharmacokinetics data from 2,196 patients across six studies (AURA, AURA2, AURA3, ADAURA, FLAURA, and FLAURA2) assessed pharmacokinetics and its variability due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Upon a formal covariate search, none of the covariates retained in the final model had a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib and its active metabolite, AZ5104. The osimertinib exposure derived from the population pharmacokinetics model was used to evaluate the relationship between osimertinib exposure and progression‐free survival, as the efficacy primary end point, in the FLAURA2 combination arm. A Cox proportional hazard analysis indicated no exposure‐progression‐free survival relationship for osimertinib and its metabolite; the number of pemetrexed cycles was likely to be associated with progression‐free survival. No exposure‐safety relationship was observed between osimertinib exposure and the occurrence of adverse events, including those leading to osimertinib dose interruption/reduction/discontinuation, and other pre‐determined adverse events. These results further reinforce the benefits of the FLAURA2 clinical data that establish osimertinib 80 mg once daily plus chemotherapy as a first‐line treatment for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor‐mutated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Emerging biopharma companies are key players in drug development, handling more than half of all clinical trials. Drug loss, a situation in which a drug approved in other countries has not been approved nor has its development been initiated at home, has become an issue in Japan following an increase in new drugs developed by emerging biopharma companies outside Japan. As 80% of these companies are not based in Europe, drug loss may also exist in Europe. In this study, we focused on drugs developed by emerging biopharma companies and examined the state of drug loss in Japan compared to Europe to explore the causes and solutions. Of the 98 new drugs approved in the United States between 2019 and 2023 and filed by emerging biopharma companies, drug‐loss products in Japan accounted for 52.0%, which is much higher than that in Europe (19.4%). Regarding involvement in the pivotal study of new drug applications/biologics license applications in the United States, the number of drugs that included Japan in the pivotal study was quite low (16.3%), whereas those that included Europe were 73.4%. Emerging biopharma companies have been more aggressive in drug development in Europe than in Japan because of market attractiveness, language, geographical location, and country‐specific regulatory requirements. Since emerging biopharma companies have a different business model from large pharmaceutical companies, taking specific measures to improve the state of drug loss in Japan is necessary.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the use of 35 pharmacogenomic (PGx) medications listed in the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) guideline, estimated the potential costs of subsidizing PGx testing in Australia, and predicted related prescribing changes. Using administrative claims data from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, accessed via the Australian Bureau of Statistics DataLab, we identified individuals who received any of the 35 medications between January 2021 and December 2023. Incident prescribing rates were calculated for children (0–17), adults (18–64), and older adults (65+). Adults (14.91%) and older adults (14.44%) had the highest rates of PGx medication use, followed by children (3.53%). Commonly prescribed medications included proton pump inhibitors, with frequent associations to genes such as CYP2C19 across all age groups. Estimated costs of PGx testing, assuming 50% and 75% population uptake, were highest for older adults: AUD$1.95 million and AUD$2.93 million, respectively. Predicted prescribing changes, based on literature‐reported phenotype frequencies by ancestry, suggested that up to 18.58% of individuals using drugs like clopidogrel or voriconazole may need alternative treatments due to poor metabolism. These findings highlight the clinical potential of integrating PGx testing into routine practice, especially for medications included in international pharmacogenomic guidelines. While implementation would entail significant upfront costs, PGx testing could enhance medication safety and effectiveness and health care cost‐efficiency. Future research should focus on scalable strategies for PGx implementation across diverse health care settings to optimize patient care globally.",

Covering 34 genes and 164 drugs, CPIC guidelines have become the global standard for translating pharmacogenomic test results into actionable prescribing decisions. This paper summarizes data highlighting CPIC's pivotal role in accelerating the global adoption of pharmacogenomics and establishing itself as the leading resource for clinical implementation. To assess CPIC's growth and impact, we analyzed member demographics, guideline characteristics, author composition, bibliometric data, database/API usage, and real‐world implementation using internal tracking, external databases (Scopus, iCite), website analytics, PubMed review (2019–2024), and CPIC member surveys (2012, 2024). CPIC has 28 active guidelines with international authorship and widespread adoption, garnering over 10,000 citations and 1.4 million views. Robust implementation is evident, with 85% of PubMed‐indexed pharmacogenomic implementation studies referencing CPIC guidelines. Additionally, 128 healthcare institutions and 40 commercial laboratories report using CPIC content. The CPIC API supports over 80,000 monthly queries, increasingly integrated into EHRs, including Epic's foundational genomics module. Member surveys show a shift from scientific evidence concerns to practical barriers like clinician education, reimbursement, and EHR integration. CPIC has evolved from a guideline development initiative into a global leader in pharmacogenomics implementation, fostering collaboration, standardization, and sustainable integration into diverse healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "The previously developed algorithm for identifying subjects with high electronic health record (EHR)‐continuity performed suboptimally in racially diverse populations. We aimed to improve the performance by optimizing the race modeling strategy. We randomly divided TriNetX claims‐linked EHR dataset from 11 US‐based healthcare organizations into training (70%) and testing data (30%) to develop and test models with and without race interactions and race‐specific models. We held out a Medicaid‐linked EHR dataset as validation data. Study subjects were ≥18 years with ≥365 days of continuous insurance enrollment overlapping an EHR encounter. We used cross‐validated least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to select predictors of high EHR‐continuity. We compared the model performance using area under receiver operating curve (AUC). There were 550,859, 236,089, and 65,956 subjects in the training, testing, and validation datasets, respectively. In the validation set, the introduction of race‐interaction terms resulted in improved model performance in Black (AUC 0.821 vs. 0.812, P < 0.001) and other non‐White race (AUC 0.828 vs. 0.812, P < 0.001) subgroups. The performance of the race‐specific models did not differ substantially from that of the models with race‐interaction terms in the race subgroups. Using the race interactions model, subjects in the top 50% of predicted EHR‐continuity had 2–3‐fold lesser misclassification of 40 comparative effectiveness research (CER) relevant variables. The inclusion of race‐interaction terms improved model performance in the race subgroups. Using the EHR‐continuity prediction algorithm with race‐interaction terms can potentially reduce algorithmic bias for racial minorities.",

    "abstract": "Novel compounds targeting the adaptive immune system are commonly initially investigated in healthy volunteers (HV). HV frequently lack constitutively expressed drug‐target engagement biomarkers, complicating the evaluation of pharmacological activity. The keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) neo‐antigen challenge elicits a controlled immune response in HV and is a potential model for investigating compounds targeting the adaptive immune system. A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study in HV was conducted, investigating the effects of repeated immunizations with KLH on Days 1, 15, and 29, followed by intradermal KLH administration on Day 50. Systemically, KLH‐specific antibodies were evaluated. Leukocytes were stimulated ex vivo to determine KLH‐specific responses using ELISpot. Locally, KLH skin response was evaluated 0–48 hours post intradermal administration, using imaging, suction blister fluid analysis, and biopsy analysis. Twelve male HV aged 18–42 years completed the study. KLH antibody levels increased incrementally. ELISpot analyses demonstrated KLH‐specific IFN‐γ and IL‐13 responses. Intradermal KLH injection drove a peak response 24 h after administration, observed as erythema and increased perfusion. Blister fluid analysis showed cell influx (T cells; B cells; monocytes; dendritic cells) at 24 h, largely decreasing at 48 h, as confirmed by immunofluorescent staining of skin biopsies. These findings demonstrate a T‐cell‐mediated response to intradermal KLH that is more rapid than the classical delayed‐type hypersensitivity response. This study highlights the importance of the timing of measurements and combining non‐invasive and invasive biomarkers. The KLH neo‐antigen challenge model presented in this study offers a framework to study the effect of novel immunomodulatory compounds on the adaptive immune system early in clinical development.",

    "abstract": "Real‐world data from sources, such as patient registries and electronic health records, can complement randomized controlled trials by providing timely, generalizable insights that better reflect routine clinical practice. However, the absence of randomization can introduce bias, particularly when treatment switching—defined as deviation from or discontinuation of the initial treatment—is influenced by time‐varying confounders, that is, variables that are associated with both treatment decisions and outcomes over time. This study presents a comprehensive overview of statistical methods used to adjust for treatment switching in real‐world studies to improve causal inference. We systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies comparing at least two statistical methods for adjusting for treatment switching, from inception to December 2024. Forty‐five studies were included, identifying four main categories of methods: (1) traditional approaches (intention‐to‐treat, per‐protocol, as‐treated, repeated measures); (2) propensity score‐based methods (adjustment, matching, marginal structural models); (3) g‐methods other than marginal structural models (g‐computation, structural nested models, longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation); (4) methods addressing unmeasured confounding (regression calibration, instrumental variables). Traditional methods are straightforward, but often yield biased estimates in the presence of treatment switching. Advanced methods, such as g‐methods, are designed to adjust for time‐varying confounding and can produce less biased estimates, though they require complex modeling. Instrumental variables and regression calibration relax the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, but rely on strong, often untestable conditions. By evaluating each method's assumptions, strengths, and limitations, we support applied researchers in selecting appropriate methods to strengthen causal inference in real‐world studies.",

    "abstract": "Azathioprine is used to treat several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, its use is limited by serious adverse events, including acute pancreatitis. Prior studies have found an association between the HLA region and thiopurine‐induced acute pancreatitis (TIAP); however, in clinical practice, many patients with pancreatitis do not meet this strict criterion. We aimed to identify additional genes associated with azathioprine‐related pancreatitis using genome‐wide and transcriptome‐wide association studies (GWAS and TWAS) by broadening the definition of pancreatitis. We conducted a retrospective study of azathioprine users with inflammatory conditions. We used electronic health records linked to genomic data from BioVU (Vanderbilt's biobank) and replicated the results using NIH's All of Us . The primary outcome was acute pancreatitis, and the secondary outcome was pancreatic injury. Sixteen patients with pancreatitis and 2085 control subjects were included from BioVU; the All of Us cohort included < 20 patients with pancreatitis and 847 control subjects. The GWAS analysis (adjusted for 10 principal components of genetic ancestry, sex, age, and azathioprine indication) in the BioVU cohort found an association between pancreatic injury and rs2948386 in RAB19 (OR = 3.47, P = 1.46E −8 ), which was replicated in All of Us (OR = 2.70, P = 4.18E −3 ). We also conducted a TWAS adjusting for the same factors above and found a significant association between genetically predicted pancreatic expression of SERPINB9P1 with pancreatic injury (BioVU: effect size = 0.42, P = 1.48E‐5; All of Us : effect size = 0.48, P ‐value = 0.01). In summary, we identified two new genetic associations for azathioprine‐related pancreatic injury: the predicted expression of SERPINB9P1 and a SNP in RAB19 .",

    "abstract": "CYP2D6 alleles with low frequency in Eurocentrically biased study populations are often excluded from pharmacogenetic investigation and consequently may have misassigned activity values. This health inequity may be contributing to imprecise dose predictions for CYP2D6‐metabolizing drugs. The objective of this study was to determine how sub‐Saharan African‐specific CYP2D6*17 and *29 alleles affect risperidone metabolism. To do this, we generated the largest real‐world cohort of risperidone users in an African study population for pharmacogenetic studies. Risperidone users ≤ 18 years old were recruited from the Federal Neuro‐Psychiatric Hospital. Health records were obtained by parent report and paper charts. CYP2D6 genotyping was performed for > 20 variants. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9‐hydroxyrisperidone were determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. CYP2D6 activity was calculated based on the metabolic ratio 9‐hydroxyrisperidone:risperidone. Multivariable linear regression modeling was performed to determine the association between our alleles of interest and log‐transformed ratio‐defined CYP2D6 activity relative to star alleles with established activity values. Across 208 enrolled participants, CYP2D6 activity value for *17 was found to be twice that of normal function alleles, while *29 was comparable to no function alleles. These results contrast previous values assigned to *17 and *29 from guidelines, which are not based on evidence with risperidone, suggesting the possibility of substrate specificity for these alleles. Ultimately, our findings have the potential to improve risperidone prescribing, especially for patient groups with substantial sub‐Saharan African ancestry. Importantly, this work underscores the critical need to better understand the effects of ancestry‐specific alleles for achieving equitable pharmacotherapeutic health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Talquetamab is the first and only GPRC5D × CD3 bispecific antibody approved for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). In the phase I/II MonumenTAL‐1 study, overall response rates (ORRs) were > 66% in patients with RRMM treated with subcutaneous talquetamab at the recommended phase II doses (RP2Ds): 0.4 mg/kg weekly and 0.8 mg/kg every other week. We characterized the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and exposure‐response relationships for efficacy and safety following talquetamab administration in phase I and II. In phase I, talquetamab exposure increased in an approximately dose‐proportional manner across intravenous and subcutaneous doses and was maintained around or above the 90% maximum effective concentration identified in an ex vivo cytotoxic assay at the RP2Ds. Higher levels of T‐cell activation and cytokine induction were observed at the RP2Ds compared with lower doses. Talquetamab demonstrated time‐dependent clearance with a half‐life of 7.56 days at initial treatment and 12.2 days at steady state. Patients with immunoglobulin G multiple myeloma and International Staging System (ISS) stage II/III exhibited higher clearance of talquetamab, which resulted in lower exposure. Dose adjustment based on myeloma subtype and ISS stage was not required. In exposure‐response analyses, a near‐flat relationship was demonstrated for ORR, duration of response, and progression‐free survival at the exposure range of the RP2Ds. In safety exposure‐response analyses, rates of grade 1/2 dysgeusia increased with higher exposures. The incidence of anti‐talquetamab antibodies had no apparent impact on the PK, efficacy, or safety of talquetamab. These clinical pharmacology results support the selection of the talquetamab RP2Ds.",

    "abstract": "A Phase 1, open‐label, single‐dose, fixed‐sequence crossover study utilizing a hybrid decentralized clinical trial (DCT) design with and without practice sessions for wearable devices and PK sampling was conducted in eight healthy participants. Using etrasimod, the study assessed the feasibility of conducting a Phase 1 hybrid DCT by the Pfizer Clinical Research Unit (PCRU) staff, involving remote collection of pharmacokinetic (PK), safety, and tolerability data. The study objectives were to determine the PK and to assess the safety and tolerability of etrasimod clinical immediate release tablets in healthy adult participants in a hybrid DCT design. The study consisted of two periods, and the treatments were administered to participants in a fixed sequence: a single oral dose of etrasimod, then DCT with practice sessions in Period 1, followed by a single oral dose of etrasimod and DCT without practice sessions in Period 2. PK results were compared between Periods 1 and 2, and vs. PK from a single oral dose of etrasimod administered on site in a previous conventional design study. Serum etrasimod exposure was similar for non‐practice vs. practice sessions within the hybrid DCT framework. PK parameters data from self‐collected microsamples in the hybrid DCT design were comparable to PK parameters data from venous samples collected in a conventional setting. The wearable monitoring devices for recording the electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital parameters allowed remote and real‐time assessment of safety and tolerability. Therefore, the study results demonstrated the feasibility of using multiple DCT modalities in Phase 1 trials for remote PK, safety, and tolerability assessments.",

However, hepatic impairment (HI) is rarely evaluated in pediatric drug development due to challenges such as the relatively small number of patients, differences in adult and pediatric liver disease, and the lack of agreed‐upon markers to assess HI severity. The objectives of the study were to (1) examine adult and pediatric HI dosing recommendations in US FDA prescribing information (PI) and pediatric dosing handbooks, Lexicomp and Micromedex, and (2) identify the clinical evidence behind HI dosing recommendations for pediatric patients. A total of 61 drugs containing both a pediatric indication and the word “hepatic” in the Dosage and Administration section of the PI were reviewed. Of the 61 drugs, only eight drugs included pediatric‐specific HI dosing recommendations, with seven based on the Child–Pugh classification. Pharmacokinetic studies in adults with HI were the primary evidence behind the recommendations for all eight drugs, and only one drug was evaluated in pediatric patients with mild HI. Lexicomp and Micromedex provided consistent HI dosing recommendations with the PI and did not cite additional evidence. Overall, there is a gap in dosing recommendations for pediatric patients with HI. Alternative approaches, such as modeling and simulation based on drug‐ and disease‐specific parameters, may help address knowledge gaps for pediatric patients with HI in the future.",

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from public and private hospitals in Victoria, Australia. Antibiotic dispensings were assessed over 12 months among new users of these medicines. Negative binomial regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to estimate weighted incidence rate ratios and confidence intervals for the total number of antibiotic dispensings and cumulative defined daily doses, stratified by antibiotic class. A total of 58.3% of SGLT2 inhibitor users (9,162 individuals) and 61.4% of DPP4 inhibitor users (16,589 individuals) received antibiotics. Initiators of SGLT2 inhibitors had a lower number of overall antibiotic dispensings compared with initiators of DPP4 inhibitors (weighted incidence rate ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.90), a pattern that was consistent across antibiotic classes. SGLT2 inhibitor initiators also had lower cumulative defined daily doses overall (weighted incidence rate ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.93), with significantly lower doses for penicillins, sulphonamides, and quinolones. These findings suggest that the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with lower antibiotic use in terms of both the number of dispensings and cumulative dose, indicating potentially lower rates of infections among individuals with type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the variability in ovarian response following administration of follicle‐stimulating hormone medications in women undergoing in vitro fertilization may help inform prescribing decisions. A systematic review was conducted to compare the number of retrieved oocytes and fertility outcomes following the administration of different follicle‐stimulating hormone medications. Databases were searched from inception to November 2024, including studies that compared two follicle‐stimulating hormone medications, including follitropin alfa, follitropin beta, follitropin delta, and urofollitropin. Meta‐analyses were performed in random effects models with the restricted maximum likelihood method. From 3867 identified articles, 26 (12613 participants) were included. More oocytes were retrieved with follitropin alfa compared to beta (mean difference 0.64, 95% CI 0.09–1.19). Compared to follitropin delta, more oocytes were retrieved with follitropin alfa and beta (1.38, 95% CI 0.09–2.67, and 1.40, 95% CI 0.41–2.39, respectively); however, higher total doses of follitropin alfa and beta were administered (199.29 IU, 95% CI 43.15–355.43 and 181.08 IU, 95% CI 55.67–306.49, respectively), and the risk of hyperstimulation increased (risk ratios 1.42, 95% CI 1.04–1.96 and 1.75, 95% CI 1.15–2.70, respectively). More oocytes were retrieved with urofollitropin compared to follitropin beta (1.12, 95% CI −1.63 to −0.62), with higher total doses of urofollitropin administered (782.32 IU, 95% CI −1493.79 to −70.85). Variability in ovarian response and hyperstimulation rates across the medications decreased when similar total doses were administered. Fertilization, pregnancy, and live birth rates were similar across the medications, despite differences in the number of retrieved oocytes. Additional research is required to evaluate oocyte quality across follicle‐stimulating hormone medications.",

Regulators have encouraged the use of external data and real‐world evidence (RWE) to improve efficiency, yet adoption in confirmatory settings remains limited by concerns over heterogeneity and bias. We conducted a proof‐of‐concept study to assess the feasibility and regulatory value of a hybrid Bayesian borrowing design to support a Phase III RCT of Dexamethasone Intracameral Drug‐Delivery Suspension (DEXYCU) in China. Using the Equivalence Probability Propensity Score Meta‐Analytic‐Predictive (EQPSMAP) approach, we integrated three data sources—a global RCT, a regional Phase III RCT in China, and a real‐world data (RWD) in China. The method's performance was evaluated via point estimates and 95% credible intervals for the primary efficacy endpoint. The hybrid design based on EQPSMAP demonstrated greater robustness and accuracy in the presence of baseline imbalances and heterogeneous data. Compared to a traditional RCT, the hybrid design reduced the required sample size by 41 to 158 patients and shortened trial duration by approximately 2 to 5 months while preserving internal validity. This study demonstrated the feasibility and regulatory value of hybrid Bayesian designs in late‐phase trials. The approach offers a practical, bias‐controlled framework for integrating external data into regional drug development and regulatory decision making.",

    "abstract": "Prasugrel is recommended for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, East Asians exhibit a stronger antiplatelet response, raising concerns about bleeding risks with standard dosing. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the real‐world effectiveness and safety of reduced‐dose prasugrel in an East Asian population by emulating the pivotal PRASFIT‐ACS trial using Taiwan's National Health Insurance claims data. In this study, ACS patients were classified into reduced‐dose prasugrel or clopidogrel groups post‐PCI. We estimated the intention‐to‐treat effect of initiating reduced‐dose prasugrel vs. clopidogrel on the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and the per‐protocol effect of treating with reduced‐dose prasugrel on major bleeding risk using Cox proportional hazard models. A total of 4833 ACS patients were analyzed, including 977 (20.2%) who received reduced‐dose prasugrel. Reduced‐dose prasugrel showed comparable effectiveness to clopidogrel in preventing MACE (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.72–1.29) and did not increase bleeding risk (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.36–1.90), consistent with PRASFIT‐ACS results (HR MACE : 0.85, 95% CI: 0.62–1.16; HR Bleeding : 0.82, 95% CI: 0.39–1.73). A significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality was observed (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.29–0.89), differing from PRASFIT‐ACS findings (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.48–3.06). Our results suggest that reduced‐dose prasugrel was effective in preventing thrombotic events in the Taiwanese population without significantly increasing bleeding risk. These findings align with pivotal trial outcomes while highlighting the importance of race‐specific dose adjustments to optimize ACS treatment strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate whether these results are applicable to other East Asian populations.",

    "abstract": "Bispecific T‐cell engagers (Bi‐TCEs) have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety, with 7 approved for hematological cancers and 2 approved for solid tumors by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of May 2025. Its intricate mechanism of action through the formation of a trimer involving Bi‐TCE, T cell, and tumor cell presents challenges to clinical development requiring special strategies for multiple disciplines. This review summarizes key clinical pharmacology characterizations of these 9 FDA‐approved Bi‐TCEs to understand the current practice and to identify potential knowledge gaps. The topics covered include dosing strategies, general clinical pharmacology evaluations, and cytokine‐related drug–drug interaction (DDI) assessment. The dosing strategy part discusses the criteria for step‐up dose and full treatment dose selection, the potential for further optimization of dose regimen in later cycles, and the analyses supporting the restarting strategy after dosage delay. The section on general clinical pharmacology evaluations summarizes pharmacokinetic (PK) property and its impact on dosing strategy, PK in specific populations (e.g., organ impairment, pediatrics), pharmacodynamics property, and immunogenicity information. The cytokine‐related DDI part discusses cytokine profiles, risk mitigation strategy, and physiologically based PK (PBPK) models and their limitations. Finally, future perspectives are provided regarding efficient dose selection, PBPK modeling application, and Bi‐TCEs for solid tumors and non‐oncology indications.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous biomarkers for drug transporters are an emerging tool for the assessment of transporter‐mediated drug–drug interactions (DDI). Glycochenodeoxycholic acid 3‐O‐sulfate (GCDCA‐S) has been proposed as a Tier 2 biomarker of hepatic OATP1B3 and renal OAT3 transporters by the International Transporter Consortium. However, there are currently no mechanistic models developed for this biomarker. This study aimed to characterize the synthesis and elimination of this biomarker through population pharmacokinetic (POP‐PK) modeling of GCDCA‐S plasma and urine data in the presence and absence of OATP1B inhibitor rifampicin and OAT3 inhibitor probenecid. Simultaneous fitting of rifampicin and probenecid interaction data incorporated the inhibitory effect of rifampicin on GCDCA‐S hepatic clearance (CL h ) and probenecid inhibitory effect on both renal (CL R ) and hepatic (CL h ) clearance parameters, assuming no effect on the synthesis of GCDCA‐S. The POP‐PK model successfully described the observed data for GCDCA‐S, with reasonable standard errors (<40%) for population parameter estimates. The results indicated biliary excretion as the primary route of elimination for GCDCA‐S (~ 95%). The GCDCA‐S model was successfully verified against four independent datasets on plasma baseline and interaction after rifampicin administration. Power calculations confirmed the sensitivity of GCDCA‐S for identifying weak to strong OATP1B3 and OAT3 inhibitors using plasma AUC and renal clearance as metrics, respectively. This study provides further validation of GCDCA‐S as an endogenous biomarker of OATP1B3 and OAT3 transporters and offers a valuable resource for optimizing the design of prospective OATP1B3‐ and OAT3‐mediated DDI studies in early‐phase clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life due to extensive benefits for the maternal–infant dyad. While over 90% of mothers initiate breastfeeding, continuation drops to 35% by 6 months, often due to concerns about medication safety. Clinicians often face decisions about medication use during lactation in the absence of robust data. Factors such as molecular weight (MW), lipid solubility, protein binding and a drug's acid–base status are routinely stated as the determinants of drug passage into milk and used as “rules of thumb” (e.g., MW <500 Da). However, these have not been rigorously examined for clinical applicability. This study investigates MW, protein binding, milk‐to‐plasma ratios (M/P), and relative infant dose (RID) with the aim of assisting clinicians' estimation of medication safety during breastfeeding. Small‐molecule drugs with well‐documented M/P were selected using predefined criteria. Physicochemical properties and active transporter status were compiled from multiple databases. Analyses investigated relationships between physicochemical properties, M/P, and RID. A total of 94 drugs were included in the physicochemicalM/P analyses, 91 for the M/P‐RID analysis and 91 for the protein binding‐RID analysis. Our study highlights the complexities of predicting drug passage into breast milk, finding no straightforward MW cutoff for passage of small molecules. These findings challenge common assumptions and emphasize the importance of considering active transport and other physicochemical properties. While protein binding >75% can serve as a preliminary guide, slow maternal drug clearance and active metabolites can decrease its utility.",

    "abstract": "Algorithm validation studies of health outcomes using real‐world data are used to generate real‐world evidence. We developed the Algorithm CErtaInty Tool (ACE‐IT) to enable users to appraise whether a given real‐world data‐based algorithm is fit for purpose for a specific decision context, using the outcome of ischemic stroke as an exemplar. Our objective was to refine, develop, and tailor the ACE‐IT to address whether validated algorithms for pregnancy and birth outcomes are fit for purpose for a specific decision context. We also tested the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and content validity of the Pregnancy ACE‐IT for the evaluation of an algorithm on pregnancy/birth outcomes. We engaged an expert panel of pharmacoepidemiologists and regulators to guide the development of the Pregnancy ACE‐IT. The panel contributed to crafting a vignette on the selected pregnancy outcome of neural tube defects. Twenty‐seven external raters used the Pregnancy ACE‐IT to appraise whether a selected peer‐reviewed algorithm to identify neural tube defects was fit for purpose and generalized as a target data source. Most raters found the Pregnancy ACE‐IT acceptable and appropriate, although some did not find it easy to use. The Pregnancy ACE‐IT represents a suitable, flexible, acceptable, and appropriate tool with relevant content for determining whether algorithms for pregnancy outcomes are fit for purpose for a specific decision context. Future studies to encourage broader acceptance and improve ease of use will require familiarizing users with the tool's operational characteristics and evaluating its suitability in the context of additional pregnancy/birth outcomes in different therapeutic areas.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing volume of clinical evidence derived from large‐scale Asian real‐world data (RWD) and the growing interest in its use in regulatory decision‐making, it is important to conduct benchmarking exercises that evaluate whether studies using Asian RWD can generate similar conclusions as randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We aimed to assess whether observational studies based on Korea and Taiwan RWD can yield comparable results with trials by emulating six cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) of antidiabetic drugs in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We emulated six CVOTs using nationwide claims of Korea and Taiwan. An active comparator, new‐user design was applied, and observational analogues to the eligibility criteria and outcomes of the corresponding RCT were implemented. Propensity score matching was utilized to balance the treatment groups. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and compared with corresponding RCT estimates. We used three pre‐specified binary agreement metrics that have been used in prior benchmarking studies to define concordance in results. Results from each of the six emulations were concordant with the corresponding CVOT on ≥ 1 binary agreement metric. Five out of six emulations indicated superiority when the corresponding CVOT only demonstrated non‐inferiority. Results from emulations were more concordant with Asian‐specific results from RCT, with four emulations meeting all agreement metrics. In this binational study using two Asian healthcare claims data, emulations yielded comparable clinical conclusions with the corresponding RCT, increasing the confidence in the validity of RWE studies in patients with T2D using these databases.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials with pragmatic elements can capture diverse patient populations, enable efficient follow‐up, and reflect routine clinical practices; yet there is limited understanding of their design features, characteristics, and use of real‐world data (RWD). Based on a targeted search of PubMed/EMBASE (Jan‐2016 to Jul‐2024), a review was conducted to characterize clinical trial use cases with pragmatic elements during the design and conduct of trials, as well as clinical trials that utilized RWD for long‐term follow‐up in the extension phase of the original (“parent”) trial. A total of 27 use cases were characterized. There were 22 use cases with pragmatic elements, and nearly all employed randomization ( n = 21, 95.5%), open‐label design ( n = 20, 90.9%), with usual/standard of care ( n = 13, 59.1%) as comparators. Most generated evidence on both effectiveness and safety ( n = 18, 81.8%), primarily in diabetes and cardiovascular disease areas ( n = 14, 63.6%). The most common pragmatic elements were broad eligibility criteria, flexible treatment management, minimal or no follow‐up, and streamlined endpoint collection. RWD (including electronic health records, claims, registries) was utilized in half of the use cases ( n = 4 to enrich trial data with additional information abstracted from RWD; n = 7 to embed trials within routine healthcare databases/systems). In addition, 5 use cases were identified that utilized RWD in the extension phase of the original “parent” trials (4 utilizing RWD for long‐term follow‐up purposes, and one utilizing RWD to construct external controls for clinical trial infrastructure‐based extension study). This review underscores the emerging role of pragmatic elements in enhancing trial efficiency, generalizability, and evidence generation on long‐term outcomes.",
