    "abstract": "Deep learning takes on protein folding In 1972, Anfinsen won a Nobel prize for demonstrating a connection between a protein\u2019s amino acid sequence and its three-dimensional structure. Since 1994, scientists have competed in the biannual Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) protein-folding challenge. Deep learning methods took center stage at CASP14, with DeepMind\u2019s Alphafold2 achieving remarkable accuracy. Baek et al . explored network architectures based on the DeepMind framework. They used a three-track network to process sequence, distance, and coordinate information simultaneously and achieved accuracies approaching those of DeepMind. The method, RoseTTA fold, can solve challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo\u2013electron microscopy modeling problems and generate accurate models of protein-protein complexes. \u2014VV",

    "abstract": "Variable memory Immune memory against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) helps to determine protection against reinfection, disease risk, and vaccine efficacy. Using 188 human cases across the range of severity of COVID-19, Dan et al. analyzed cross-sectional data describing the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells, CD8 + T cells, and CD4 + T cells for more than 6 months after infection. The authors found a high degree of heterogeneity in the magnitude of adaptive immune responses that persisted into the immune memory phase to the virus. However, immune memory in three immunological compartments remained measurable in greater than 90% of subjects for more than 5 months after infection. Despite the heterogeneity of immune responses, these results show that durable immunity against secondary COVID-19 disease is a possibility for most individuals. Science , this issue p. eabf4063",

    "abstract": "UK variant transmission Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the capacity to generate variants with major genomic changes. The UK variant B.1.1.7 (also known as VOC 202012/01) has many mutations that alter virus attachment and entry into human cells. Using a variety of statistical and dynamic modeling approaches, Davies et al. characterized the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant in the United Kingdom. The authors found that the variant is 43 to 90% more transmissible than the predecessor lineage but saw no clear evidence for a change in disease severity, although enhanced transmission will lead to higher incidence and more hospital admissions. Large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur after the easing of control measures, and it may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to control the epidemic.

    "abstract": "Path to another drug against COVID-19 The rapid development of vaccines has been crucial in battling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, access challenges remain, breakthrough infections occur, and emerging variants present increased risk. Developing antiviral therapeutics is therefore a high priority for the treatment of COVID-19. Some drug candidates in clinical trials act against the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, but there are other viral enzymes that have been considered good targets for inhibition by drugs. Owen et al . report the discovery and characterization of a drug against the main protease involved in the cleavage of polyproteins involved in viral replication. The drug, PF-07321332, can be administered orally, has good selectivity and safety profiles, and protects against infection in a mouse model. In a phase 1 clinical trial, the drug reached concentrations expected to inhibit the virus based on in vitro studies. It also inhibited other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and could be in the armory against future viral threats. \u2014VV",

    "abstract": "Unmitigated spread in Brazil Despite an extensive network of primary care availability, Brazil has suffered profoundly during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Using daily data from state health offices, Castro et al. analyzed the pattern of spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country from February to October 2020. Clusters of deaths before cases became apparent indicated unmitigated spread. SARS-CoV-2 circulated undetected in Brazil for more than a month as it spread north from S\u00e3 o Paulo. In Manaus, transmission reached unprecedented levels after a momentary respite in mid-2020. Faria et al. tracked the evolution of a new, more aggressive lineage called P.1, which has 17 mutations, including three (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) in the spike protein. After a period of accelerated evolution, this variant emerged in Brazil during November 2020. Coupled with the emergence of P.1, disease spread was accelerated by stark local inequalities and political upheaval, which compromised a prompt federal response.

Baruch et al. and Davar et al. report first-in-human clinical trials to test whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can affect how metastatic melanoma patients respond to anti\u2013PD-1 immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Woelk and Snyder). Both studies observed evidence of clinical benefit in a subset of treated patients. This included increased abundance of taxa previously shown to be associated with response to anti\u2013PD-1, increased CD8 + T cell activation, and decreased frequency of interleukin-8\u2013expressing myeloid cells, which are involved in immunosuppression. These studies provide proof-of-concept evidence for the ability of FMT to affect immunotherapy response in cancer patients. Science , this issue p. 602 , p. 595 ; see also p. 573",

However, two competing reactions restrict the efficiency of this process. In base, much of the CO 2 is trapped as carbonate before reduction; in acid, protons outpace CO 2 at catching electrons from the cathode. Huang et al. report that a high dose of potassium ions can help to solve the latter problem. By concentrating potassium ions at the electrode, high selectivity toward CO 2 reduction at high current in acid is possible, which the authors attribute to electrostatic stabilization of the desired adsorbates.

Two papers now report strategies to create tough but deformable hydrogels (see the Perspective by Bosnjak and Silberstein). Wang et al . introduced a toughening mechanism by storing releasable extra chain length in the stiff part of a double-network hydrogel. A high applied force triggered the opening of cycling strands that were only activated at high chain extension. Kim et al . synthesized acrylamide gels in which dense entanglements could be achieved by using unusually low amounts of water, cross-linker, and initiator during the synthesis. This approach improves the mechanical strength in solid form while also improving the wear resistance once swollen as a hydrogel. \u2014MSL",

    "abstract": "Immune memory after vaccination Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has proven highly effective at preventing severe COVID-19. However, the evolution of viral variants, and waning antibody levels over time, raise questions regarding the longevity of vaccine-induced immune protection. Goel et al . examined B and T lymphocyte responses in individuals who received SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccines. They performed a 6-month longitudinal study of individuals who never had SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with people who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2. Humoral and cellular immune memory was observed in vaccinated individuals, as were functional immune responses against the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) viral variants. Analysis of T cell activity suggested that robust cellular immune memory may prevent hospitalization by limiting the development of severe disease. \u2014PNK",

As new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants emerge, it is important to predict whether they will remain susceptible to antibody treatment. Starr et al. used a yeast library that covers all mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain that do not strongly disrupt binding to the host receptor (ACE2) and mapped how these mutations affect binding to three leading anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The maps identify mutations that escape antibody binding, including a single mutation that escapes both antibodies in the Regeneron antibody cocktail. Many of the mutations that escape single antibodies are circulating in the human population. Science , this issue p. 850",

    "abstract": "Limited initial supply of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine raises the question of how to prioritize available doses. We used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies. A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults greater than 60 years old. Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact. Although maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts.",

However, this effect is one that is only helpful for energy savings in the warmer months. Wang et al . and Tang et al . used the metal-insulator transition in tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide to create window glass and a rooftop coating that circumvents this problem by turning off the radiative cooling at lower temperatures. Because the transition is simply temperature dependent, this effect also happens passively. Model simulations suggest that these materials would lead to energy savings year-round across most of the climate zones in the United States. \u2014BG",

    "abstract": "Another benefit of dietary fiber The gut microbiome can modulate the immune system and influence the therapeutic response of cancer patients, yet the mechanisms underlying the effects of microbiota are presently unclear. Spencer et al . add to our understanding of how dietary habits affect microbiota and clinical outcomes to immunotherapy. In an observational study, the researchers found that melanoma patients reporting high fiber (prebiotic) consumption had a better response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy compared with those patients reporting a low-fiber diet. The most marked benefit was observed for those patients reporting a combination of high fiber consumption and no use of over-the-counter probiotic supplements. These findings provide early insights as to how diet-related factors may influence the immune response. \u2014PNK",

Strength can be increased by adding extra cross-linking or interpenetrating networks with some sacrificial bonds to enhance toughness; however, these properties deteriorate upon stretching and may be slow to recover after relaxation. Liu et al. developed polyethylene glycol hydrogels cross-linked with moderate fractions of polymers that form sliding rings. These allow the chain to orient in parallel when stretched, leading to rapid and reversible strain-induced crystallization and thus much tougher hydrogels. Science , aaz6694, this issue p. 1078",

Although there are many strategies to break this inverse relationship, Pan et al . now show that cyclic torsion on a high-entropy alloy enhances strength without degrading ductility (see the Perspective by Yeh). Cyclic torsion creates a gradient of dislocations and low-angle grain boundaries from the surface to the interior that organize into tiny stacking faults and twin when straining begins. These structures allow for the good ductility while simultaneously helping to work harden the alloy. \u2014BG",

    "abstract": "Resolving genomic structural variation Many human genomes have been reported using short-read technology, but it is difficult to resolve structural variants (SVs) using these data. These genomes thus lack comprehensive comparisons among individuals and populations. Ebert et al. used long-read structural variation calling across 64 human genomes representing diverse populations and developed new methods for variant discovery. This approach allowed the authors to increase the number of confirmed SVs and to describe the patterns of variation across populations. From this dataset, they identified quantitative trait loci affected by these SVs and determined how they may affect gene expression and potentially explain genome-wide association study hits. This information provides insights into patterns of normal human genetic variation and generates reference genomes that better represent the diversity of our species.

    "abstract": "A boost for boosters The evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern poses a potential obstacle to achieving vaccine-induced immunity. Pegu et al . examined how viral variants, including the B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, affected the immune response in a small number of individuals who received the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. By analyzing sera obtained 6 months after the second shot in the primary vaccine series, the researchers found that neutralizing antibody titers persisted against all variants tested. However, neutralizing antibodies against the B1.351 variant had dropped considerably by 6 months, and some individuals had weak, and in some cases no, neutralizing activity. These data may help to guide public health policies regarding additional booster vaccinations. \u2014PNK",

Rational design of nanocatalysts that are stable against sintering is a grand challenge in heterogenous catalysis. Hu et al . present kinetic theories for two competing sintering mechanisms, Ostwald ripening and particle migration, which relate the rates of both processes to fundamental interaction energies in metal nanoparticle-support combinations. Using kinetic simulations for hundreds of such pairs, the authors show a universal volcano dependence of the sintering kinetics on the metal-support binding energy that can serve as a single descriptor to predict nanoparticle growth rates. The revealed scaling relations are a good start in the development of high-throughput screening computational approaches to drive discovery of sintering-resistant nanocatalysts. \u2014YS",

Three of these are associated with enhanced infectivity and transmissibility, and there are concerns that B.1.1.7 might compromise the effectiveness of the vaccine. Muik et al. compared the neutralization efficacy of sera from 40 subjects immunized with the BioNTech-Pfizer mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 against a pseudovirus bearing the Wuhan reference strain or the lineage B.1.1.7 spike protein (see the Perspective by Altmann et al. ). Serum was derived from 40 subjects in two age groups 21 days after the booster shot. The vaccine remained effective against B.1.1.7 with a slight but significant decrease in neutralization that was more apparent in participants under 55 years of age. Thus, the vaccine provides a significant \u201ccushion\u201d of protection against this variant. Science , this issue p. 1152 ; see also p. 1103",

    "abstract": "Getting around the blood\u2013brain barrier The meninges comprise three membranes that surround and protect the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies have noted the existence of myeloid cells resident there, but little is known about their ontogeny and function, and whether other meningeal immune cell populations have important roles remains unclear (see the Perspective by Nguyen and Kubes). Cugurra et al. found in mice that a large proportion of continuously replenished myeloid cells in the dura mater are not blood derived, but rather transit from cranial bone marrow through specialized channels. In models of CNS injury and neuroinflammation, the authors demonstrated that these myeloid cells have an immunoregulatory phenotype compared with their more inflammatory blood-derived counterparts. Similarly, Brioschi et al. show that the meninges host B cells that are also derived from skull bone marrow, mature locally, and likely acquire a tolerogenic phenotype. They further found that the brains of aging mice are infiltrated by a second population of age-associated B cells, which come from the periphery and may differentiate into autoantibody-secreting plasma cells after encountering CNS antigens. Together, these two studies may inform future treatment of neurological diseases. Science , abf7844, abf9277, this issue p. eabf7844 , p. eabf9277 ; see also abj8183, p. 396",

    "abstract": "Correlates of infectiousness The role that individuals with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have in transmission of the virus is not well understood. Jones et al. investigated viral load in patients, comparing those showing few, if any, symptoms with hospitalized cases. Approximately 400,000 individuals, mostly from Berlin, were tested from February 2020 to March 2021 and about 6% tested positive. Of the 25,381 positive subjects, about 8% showed very high viral loads. People became infectious within 2 days of infection, and in hospitalized individuals, about 4 days elapsed from the start of virus shedding to the time of peak viral load, which occurred 1 to 3 days before the onset of symptoms. Overall, viral load was highly variable, but was about 10-fold higher in persons infected with the B.1.1.7 variant. Children had slightly lower viral loads than adults, although this difference may not be clinically significant. Science , abi5273, this issue p. eabi5273",

Gudmundsson et al. analyzed thousands of time series of river flows and hydrological extremes across the globe and compared them with model simulations of the terrestrial water cycle (see the Perspective by Hall and Perdig\u00e3o).

Three papers used functional and structural studies to explore how mutations in the viral spike protein affect its ability to infect host cells and to evade host immunity. Gobeil et al . looked at a variant spike protein involved in transmission between minks and humans, as well as the B1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and P1 (gamma) spike variants; Cai et al . focused on the alpha and beta variants; and McCallum et al . discuss the properties of the spike protein from the B1.1.427/B.1.429 (epsilon) variant. Together, these papers show a balance among mutations that enhance stability, those that increase binding to the human receptor ACE2, and those that confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. \u2014VV",

An early variant with an aspartic acid (D) to glycine (G) mutation at position 614, D614G, rapidly became dominant and is maintained in current variants of concern. Zhang et al. investigated the structural basis for the increased spread of this variant, which does so even though it binds less tightly to the host receptor (see the Perspective by Choe and Farzan). Structural and biochemical studies on a full-length G614 spike trimer showed that there are interactions not present in D614 that prevent premature loss of the S1 subunit that binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This stabilization effectively increases the number of spikes that can facilitate infection. Science , this issue p. 525 ; see also p. 466",

Hao et al. constructed twisted trilayer graphene, in which the middle layer is twisted with respect to the bottom layer and the top layer is roughly parallel to the bottom layer (see the Perspective by Yazdani). Such trilayers exhibited superconductivity that was tunable by an external electric field and consistent with having an unconventional nature. Science , this issue p. 1133 ; see also p. 1098",

The United Kingdom has contributed more than 26,000 sequences to this effort. This volume of data allowed du Plessis et al. to develop a detailed picture of the influxes of virus reaching U.K. shores as the pandemic developed during the first months of 2020 (see the Perspective by Nelson). Before lockdown, high travel volumes and few restrictions on international travel allowed more than 1000 lineages to become established. This accelerated local epidemic growth and exceeded contact tracing capacity. The authors were able to quantify the abundance, size distribution, and spatial range of the lineages that were transmitted. Transmission was highly heterogeneous, favoring some lineages that became widespread and subsequently harder to eliminate. This dire history indicates that rapid or even preemptive responses should have been used as they were elsewhere where containment was successful. Science , this issue p. 708 ; see also p. 680",

The viral protein main protease is required for cleaving precursor polyproteins into functional viral proteins. This essential function makes it a key drug target. Qiao et al. designed 32 inhibitors based on either boceprevir or telaprevir, both of which are protease inhibitors approved to treat hepatitis C virus. Six compounds protected cells from viral infection with high potency, and two of these were selected for in vivo studies based on pharmokinetic experiments.

Cohen et al. constructed nanoparticles displaying the protein domain that binds the host cell receptor (receptor-binding domain or RBD), either a homotypic SARS-CoV-2 particle or mosaic particles displaying RBDs from four or eight different betacoronaviruses. In mice, antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were elicited just as well by mosaic particles as by homotypic nanoparticles. The mosaic nanoparticles elicited antibodies that, beyond recognizing the strains displayed, also recognized mismatched strains. Science , this issue p. 735",

This setting offers a window on how social factors propel the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in an economically vulnerable society with high levels of income inequality. Mena et al. analyzed incidence and mortality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 to understand spatial variations in disease burden. Infection fatality rates were higher in lower-income municipalities because of comorbidities and lack of access to health care. Disparities between municipalities in the quality of their health care delivery system became apparent in testing delays and capacity. These indicators explain a large part of the variation in COVID-19 underreporting and deaths and show that these inequalities disproportionately affected younger people.

Three papers used functional and structural studies to explore how mutations in the viral spike protein affect its ability to infect host cells and to evade host immunity. Gobeil et al . looked at a variant spike protein involved in transmission between minks and humans, as well as the B1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and P1 (gamma) spike variants; Cai et al . focused on the alpha and beta variants; and McCallum et al . discuss the properties of the spike protein from the B1.1.427/B.1.429 (epsilon) variant.

    "abstract": "Taming a pandemic One year after its emergence, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become so widespread that there is little hope of elimination. There are, however, several other human coronaviruses that are endemic and cause multiple reinfections that engender sufficient immunity to protect against severe adult disease. By making assumptions about acquired immunity from its already endemic relatives, Lavine et al. developed a model with which to analyze the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 into endemicity. The model accounts for SARS-CoV-2's age-structured disease profile and assesses the impact of vaccination. The transition from epidemic to endemic dynamics is associated with a shift in the age distribution of primary infections to younger age groups, which in turn depends on how fast the virus spreads. Longer-lasting sterilizing immunity will slow the transition to endemicity. Depending on the type of immune response it engenders, a vaccine could accelerate establishment of a state of mild disease endemicity. Science , this issue p. 741",

Overall, there seem to be consistent and reproducible patterns of within-host virus diversity. The authors observed only one or two variants in most samples, but a few carried many variants. Although the evidence indicates strong purifying selection, including in the spike protein responsible for viral entry, the authors also saw evidence for transmission clusters associated with households and other possible superspreader events. After transmission, most variants fizzled out, but occasionally some initiated ongoing transmission and wider dissemination. Science , this issue p. eabg0821",

However, these large proteins are difficult to produce in the needed quantities and at low cost. Attention has turned to nanobodies, which are aptly named, single-domain antibodies that are easier to produce and have the potential to be administered by inhalation. Koenig et al. describe four nanobodies that bind to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and prevent infection of cells (see the Perspective by Saelens and Schepens). Structures show that the nanobodies target two distinct epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Multivalent nanobodies neutralize virus much more potently than single nanobodies, and multivalent nanobodies that bind two epitopes prevent the emergence of viral escape mutants.

Current treatments can cause systemic immune suppression and side effects such as increased risk of infections. Krienke et al. designed a messenger RNA vaccine strategy that lacks adjuvant activity and delivers MS autoantigens into lymphoid dendritic cells. This approach expands a distinct type of antigen-specific effector regulatory T cell that suppresses autoreactivity against targeted autoantigens and promotes bystander suppression of autoreactive T cells against other myelin-specific autoantigens. In mouse models of MS, the vaccine delayed the onset and reduced the severity of established disease without showing overt symptoms of general immune suppression. Science , this issue p. 145",

    "abstract": "Targeting a range of betacoranaviruses In the past 20 years, three highly pathogenic \u03b2-coronaviruses have crossed from animals to humans, including the most recent: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A spike protein that decorates these viruses has an S1 domain that binds host cell receptors and an S2 domain that fuses the viral and cell membranes to allow cell entry. The S1 domain is the target of many neutralizing antibodies but is more genetically variable than S2, and antibodies can exert selective pressure, leading to resistant variants. Pinto et al . identified five monoclonal antibodies that interact with a helix in the S2 domain. The most broadly neutralizing antibody inhibited all \u03b2-coronavirus subgenera and reduced viral burden in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. \u2014VV",

    "abstract": "Targeting sarbecoviruses As we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, we must confront the possibility of new pathogenic coronaviruses emerging in humans in the future. With this in mind, Rappazzo et al. isolated antibodies from a survivor of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), used yeast display libraries to introduce diversity into these antibodies, and then screened for binding to SARS-CoV-2. One of the affinity-matured progeny strongly neutralized SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and two SARS-related viruses from bats. In addition, this antibody bound to the receptor-binding domains from a panel of sarbecoviruses, suggesting broader activity, and provided protection against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in mouse models.

    "abstract": "A boost from infection During clinical trials of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines, no one who had survived infection with the virus was tested. A year after the pandemic was declared, vaccination of previously infected persons is a reality. Reynolds et al. address the knowledge gap in a cohort of UK health care workers given the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in which half of the participants had experienced natural virus infections early in the pandemic (see the Perspective by Crotty). Genotyping indicated that a genetic component underlies heterogeneity in immune responses to vaccine and to natural infection. After vaccination, na\u00efve individuals developed antibody responses similar to those seen in naturally infected persons, but T cell responses were more limited and sometimes absent. However, antibody and memory responses in individuals vaccinated after infection were substantially boosted to the extent that a single vaccine dose is likely to protect against the more aggressive B.1.1.7 variant. It is possible that the messenger RNA vaccine has an adjuvant effect, biasing responses toward antibody generation. Science , abh1282, this issue p. 1418 ; see also abj2258, p. 1392",

    "abstract": "Getting around the blood\u2013brain barrier The meninges comprise three membranes that surround and protect the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies have noted the existence of myeloid cells resident there, but little is known about their ontogeny and function, and whether other meningeal immune cell populations have important roles remains unclear (see the Perspective by Nguyen and Kubes). Cugurra et al. found in mice that a large proportion of continuously replenished myeloid cells in the dura mater are not blood derived, but rather transit from cranial bone marrow through specialized channels. In models of CNS injury and neuroinflammation, the authors demonstrated that these myeloid cells have an immunoregulatory phenotype compared with their more inflammatory blood-derived counterparts. Similarly, Brioschi et al. show that the meninges host B cells that are also derived from skull bone marrow, mature locally, and likely acquire a tolerogenic phenotype. They further found that the brains of aging mice are infiltrated by a second population of age-associated B cells, which come from the periphery and may differentiate into autoantibody-secreting plasma cells after encountering CNS antigens. Together, these two studies may inform future treatment of neurological diseases. Science , abf7844, abf9277, this issue p. eabf7844 , p. eabf9277 ; see also abj8183, p. 396",

The sensitivity is sufficient to discriminate between nucleotide bases in nanopore sequencing, and other applications of this technology are promising. Brinkerhoff et al . developed a nanopore-based, single-molecule approach in which a protein was sequentially scanned in single-amino-acid steps through the narrow construction of a nanopore, and ion currents were monitored to resolve differences in the amino acid sequence along the peptide backbone (see the Perspective by Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 and Keyser). The peptide reader was capable of reliably detecting single-amino-acid substitutions within individual peptides. An individual protein could be re-read many times, yielding very high read accuracy in variant identification. These proof-of-concept nanopore experiments constitute a promising basis for the development of a single-molecule protein sequencer. \u2014DJ",

    "abstract": "Resilient secondary tropical forests? Although deforestation is rampant across the tropics, forest has a strong capacity to regrow on abandoned lands. These \u201csecondary\u201d forests may increasingly play important roles in biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and landscape restoration. Poorter et al . analyzed the patterns of recovery in forest attributes (related to soil, plant functioning, structure, and diversity) in 77 secondary forest sites in the Americas and West Africa. They found that different attributes recovered at different rates, with soil recovering in less than a decade and species diversity and biomass recovering in little more than a century. The authors discuss how these findings can be applied in efforts to promote forest restoration. \u2014AMS",

    "abstract": "Selective destruction of senescent cells Senescent cells are associated with a variety of age-related medical conditions and thus have been proposed as potential targets for therapy, but we do not yet have a full understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Johmura et al. used RNA interference to screen for enzymes essential to the survival of senescent cells (see the Perspective by Pan and Locasale). The authors identified a key role for glutamine metabolism, particularly the enzyme glutaminase 1, and demonstrated that inhibition of this pathway induced the death of senescent cells. Glutaminase targeting also ameliorated aging-related organ dysfunction and obesity-related disorders in mouse models, suggesting the potential therapeutic value of this approach.

Expansion microscopy has allowed for better visualization of small structures by expanding the tissues with a polymer- and hydrogel-based system. Alon et al. combined expansion microscopy with long-read in situ RNA sequencing, resulting in a more precise visualization of the location of specific transcripts. This method, termed \u201cExSeq\u201d for expansion sequencing, was used to detect RNAs, both new transcripts and those previously demonstrated to localize to neuronal dendrites. Unlike other in situ sequencing methods, ExSeq does not target sets of genes. This technology thus unites spatial resolution, multiplexing, and an unbiased approach to reveal insights into RNA localization and its physiological roles in developing and active tissue.

    "abstract": "Age-specific contact How can the resurgent epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during 2020 be explained? Are they a result of students going back to school? To address this question, Monod et al. created a contact matrix for infection based on data collected in Europe and China and extended it to the United States. Early in the pandemic, before interventions were widely implemented, contacts concentrated among individuals of similar age were the highest among school-aged children, between children and their parents, and between middle-aged adults and the elderly. However, with the advent of nonpharmaceutical interventions, these contact patterns changed substantially. By mid-August 2020, although schools reopening facilitated transmission, the resurgence in the United States was largely driven by adults 20 to 49 years of age. Thus, working adults who need to support themselves and their families have fueled the resurging epidemics in the United States. Science , this issue p. eabe8372",

    "abstract": "A closer look at centromeres Centromeres are key for anchoring chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, but they have been difficult to sequence because they can contain many repeating DNA elements. These repeats, however, carry regularly spaced, distinctive sequence markers because of sequence heterogeneity between the mostly, but not completely, identical DNA sequence repeats. Such differences aid sequence assembly. Naish et al . used ultra-long-read DNA sequencing to establish a reference assembly that resolves all five centromeres in the small mustard plant Arabidopsis . Their view into the subtly homogenized world of centromeres reveals retrotransposons that interrupt centromere organization and repressive DNA methylation that excludes centromeres from meiotic crossover repair. Thus, Arabidopsis centromeres evolve under the opposing forces of sequence homogenization and retrotransposon disruption. \u2014PJH",

White et al. explored the antiviral activity of the cyclic depsipeptide drug plitidepsin, which targets the hosts cell's translational machinery (see the Perspective by Wong and Damania). The authors show that in cells, the drug is substantially more potent than remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2, with limited cellular toxicity.

Despite a long history of successes, state-of-the-art DFT functionals have crucial limitations. In particular, significant systematic errors are observed for charge densities involving mobile charges and spins. Kirkpatrick et al . developed a framework to train a deep neural network on accurate chemical data and fractional electron constraints (see the Perspective by Perdew). The resulting functional outperforms traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. The present work offers a solution to a long-standing critical problem in DFT and demonstrates the success of combining DFT with the modern machine-learning methodology. \u2014YS",

However, for the production of olefins, a key feedstock for other chemicals, about 50% of the CO is transformed to carbon dioxide and methane. Xu et al. decreased the selectivity for these undesired by-products to under 25% by modifying their catalyst, nanoparticles of iron doped with manganese and coated with a silica, with methyl groups (see the Perspective by Xie). This hydrophobic surface shortens the retention time of water on the catalyst surface to avoid the unwanted side reactions, and also suppresses oxidation of the metal carbide catalyst that forms under reaction conditions.

    "abstract": "Unmitigated spread in Brazil Despite an extensive network of primary care availability, Brazil has suffered profoundly during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Using daily data from state health offices, Castro et al. analyzed the pattern of spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country from February to October 2020. Clusters of deaths before cases became apparent indicated unmitigated spread. SARS-CoV-2 circulated undetected in Brazil for more than a month as it spread north from S\u00e3 o Paulo. In Manaus, transmission reached unprecedented levels after a momentary respite in mid-2020. Faria et al. tracked the evolution of a new, more aggressive lineage called P.1, which has 17 mutations, including three (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) in the spike protein. After a period of accelerated evolution, this variant emerged in Brazil during November 2020. Coupled with the emergence of P.1, disease spread was accelerated by stark local inequalities and political upheaval, which compromised a prompt federal response.

    "abstract": "A large-scale screen to target SARS-CoV-2 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome is initially expressed as two large polyproteins. Its main protease, M pro , is essential to yield functional viral proteins, making it a key drug target. G\u00fcnther et al. used x-ray crystallography to screen more than 5000 compounds that are either approved drugs or drugs in clinical trials. The screen identified 37 compounds that bind to M pro . High-resolution structures showed that most compounds bind at the active site but also revealed two allosteric sites where binding of a drug causes conformational changes that affect the active site. In cell-based assays, seven compounds had antiviral activity without toxicity. The most potent, calpeptin, binds covalently in the active site, whereas the second most potent, pelitinib, binds at an allosteric site. Science , this issue p. 642",

    "abstract": "Masking out air sharing The effectiveness of masks in preventing the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been debated since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. One important question is whether masks are effective despite the forceful expulsion of respiratory matter during coughing and sneezing. Cheng et al. convincingly show that most people live in conditions in which the airborne virus load is low. The probability of infection changes nonlinearly with the amount of respiratory matter to which a person is exposed. If most people in the wider community wear even simple surgical masks, then the probability of an encounter with a virus particle is even further limited. In indoor settings, it is impossible to avoid breathing in air that someone else has exhaled, and in hospital situations where the virus concentration is the highest, even the best-performing masks used without other protective gear such as hazmat suits will not provide adequate protection.

Studies in animals indicate that replenishment of cellular NAD + can have beneficial effects on aging and age-related diseases, but the situation in humans is less clear. Yoshino et al. report the effects of supplementation with the NAD + precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide in overweight or obese postmenopausal women with prediabetes (see the Perspective by Hepler and Bass). The treatment improved insulin sensitivity in muscle, although a change in NAD + content was not detected. The treatment also increased the expression of platelet-derived growth factor b. The results support potential therapeutic action of NAD + supplementation in humans, but how various NAD+ precursors are processed in specific tissues remains to be fully explored.

The process works by depositing a mixed solvent containing nanostructured silver and/or gold, along with elastomer, onto deionized water. This results in a layer of nanoparticles residing at the interface coating with elastomer, which is further densified by the addition of surfactant. The process is scalable, and the resulting elastomer membranes can be transferred to other substrates. \u2014MSL",

Motagamwala et al. report that platinum\u2013tin nanoparticles interact more weakly with a silica support and the metals thus do not segregate. The use of undiluted reactants allowed the reaction to run near the thermodynamically limit of about 67% conversion with a selectivity to propylene of more than 99%. This catalyst also does not build up carbon and could run up to 30 hours without deactivation. Science , abg7894, this issue p. 217",

However, this is challenging because live virus can only be studied in a few laboratories that meet stringent safety standards. Syed et al . describe a virus-like particle (VLP) that comprises the four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, but instead of packaging viral RNA, it packages messenger RNA (mRNA) that expresses a reporter protein (see the Perspective by Johnson and Menachery). The amount of reporter expressed in receiver cells depends on the efficiency of packaging and assembly in the producer cells and the efficiency of entry into receiver cells. Mutations in the nucleocapsid protein that are found in more transmissible variants increase mRNA packaging and expression. The VLPs provide a platform for studying the effect of mutations in the structural proteins and for screening therapeutics. \u2014VV",

The Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor/Resistance class of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (known as TNLs) function in plants as immune receptors. These TNLs work together with a dedicated set of helper proteins. Jacob et al. reveal the structure of one of these helpers known as NRG1 (N REQUIREMENT GENE 1). The structure resembles a known animal cation channel. The authors demonstrate that helper NLRs directly control calcium ion influx to initiate host cell death, providing a mechanism for TNL outputs.

This process occurred when TDP-43 lost its ability to bind RNA through disease-causing mutation or posttranslational acetylation. Anisosomes have spherical shells of TDP-43 (with properties of a liquid crystal) surrounding centers of the protein chaperone HSP70. Chaperone activity was required to maintain liquidity.

Because liver donors are in short supply, Sampaziotis et al. used organoid technology to develop a cell-based therapy using human tissue (see the Perspective by Kurial and Willenbring). Cholangiocyte organoids were transplanted into the intrahepatic ducts of deceased human donor livers undergoing ex vivo normothermic perfusion.

    "abstract": "Tracing the origin of CRISPR-Cas CRISPR-Cas systems have transformed genome editing and other biotechnologies; however, the broader origins and diversity of RNA-guided nucleases have largely remained unexplored. Altae-Tran et al . show that three distinct transposon-encoded proteins, IscB, IsrB, and TnpB, are naturally occurring, reprogrammable RNA-guided DNA nucleases (see the Perspective by Rousset and Sorek). In addition to identifying diverse guide-encoding mechanisms, the authors elucidate the evolutionary relationship between IsrB, IscB, and CRISPR-Cas9. Overall, these newly characterized systems, called OMEGA (for obligate mobile element\u2013guided activity) systems, are found in all domains of life and may be harnessed for biotechnology development. \u2014DJ",

Whether low-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generate immune responses comparable to currently approved doses remains an open question, however. Mateus et al . report the results of a clinical trial comparing patients who received a 25-\u03bcg mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine to 100-\u03bcg mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccinees and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u2013infected individuals. The low-dose Moderna vaccine generated long-lived T cell immunity that was equivalent between younger and older patients and that could be enhanced by the presence of cross-reactive T cells. Moreover, antibody and T cell responses induced by the low-dose vaccine were comparable to natural infection and about half as strong as those seen with high-dose vaccination. \u2014STS",

To predict which mutations may lead to viral escape, Hie et al. used a machine learning technique for natural language processing with two components: grammar (or syntax) and meaning (or semantics) (see the Perspective by Kim and Przytycka). Three different unsupervised language models were constructed for influenza A hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein. Semantic landscapes for these viruses predicted viral escape mutations that produce sequences that are syntactically and/or grammatically correct but effectively different in semantics and thus able to evade the immune system.

Corbett et al . studied nonhuman primate (NHP) immune responses to various doses of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine to provide a range of immune responses and protective outcomes. They determined that circulating spike protein\u2013specific antibodies correlated with protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in the airways. Passively transferred NHP antibodies were sufficient to mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamsters, emphasizing that antibodies are mechanistic correlates. Protection of the lower respiratory tract required lower serum antibody concentrations, possibly explaining why most current vaccines are highly effective against severe lower airway disease.

Evolution experiments of Escherichia coli rely on growth-dependent selection, which may provide a limited view of the antibiotic resistance landscape. We sequenced and analyzed E. coli adapted to representative antibiotics at increasingly heightened metabolic states. This revealed various underappreciated noncanonical genes, such as those related to central carbon and energy metabolism, which are implicated in antibiotic resistance. These metabolic alterations lead to lower basal respiration, which prevents antibiotic-mediated induction of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, thus avoiding metabolic toxicity and minimizing drug lethality. Several of the identified metabolism-specific mutations are overrepresented in the genomes of >3500 clinical E. coli pathogens, indicating clinical relevance.",

In this method, ultraviolet light is used to control the local solubility of the polymer, which makes it possible to fabricate transistors on the micrometer scale. These devices can be made with high yield and excellent uniformity without compromising their electronic and mechanical characteristics. Science , abh3551, this issue p. 88",

Weiss et al. show that there may not be a missing sink after all. By reformulating how mass fluxes are calculated from observations of particle numbers, they demonstrate that those mass fluxes were overestimated by two to three orders of magnitude. This explains why the residence time of plastics in the ocean seemed so puzzlingly short and implies that ocean plastics may persist and degrade over longer periods than previously thought.

Dhar et al . collated a mixture of serosurveillance, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and genomic data, finding that waves of variants had passed through the Delhi population during 2020 and 2021. The alpha (B.1.1.7) variant dominated in March 2021 and was rapidly replaced by the delta (B.1.617.2) variant in April and May 2021. The delta variant outcompeted its predecessors by mutations that enhanced replication, immune evasion, and host receptor avidity, thus increasing transmissibility, reinfection, and vaccination breakthrough. \u2014CA",

    "abstract": "How the Delta variant evades defenses In the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to emerge, some of which evade immunity or increase transmission. In late 2020, the Delta and Kappa variants were detected, and the Delta variant became globally dominant by June 2021. McCallum et al . show that vaccine-elicited serum-neutralizing activity is reduced against these variants. Based on biochemistry and structural studies, the authors show that mutations in the domain that binds the ACE2 receptor abrogate binding to some monoclonal antibodies but do not improve ACE2 binding, suggesting that they emerged to escape immune recognition. Remodeling of the N-terminal domain allows the variants to escape recognition by most neutralizing antibodies that target it. The work could guide the development of next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies. \u2014VV",

Zhang et al . determined cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of the full-length spike protein trimers of the Delta, Kappa, and Gamma variants of SARS-CoV-2 and studied their function and antigenic properties. The Delta spike protein fused membranes more efficiently at low levels of the cellular receptor ACE2, and its pseudotyped viruses infected target cells substantially more rapidly than all other variants tested, possibly at least partly accounting for its heightened transmissibility. Mutations of each variant rearranged the antigenic surface of the N-terminal domain of the spike protein but only caused local changes in the receptor-binding domain, consistent with greater resistance to neutralizing antibodies. These findings elucidate the molecular events that have led these viruses to adapt in human communities and to evade host immunity. \u2014VV",

By implementing non-Hermitian lattice Hamiltonians along a frequency synthetic dimension formed by optical frequency modes in a modulated ring-resonator, they directly visualized the nontrivial topological band winding and showed that the winding can be controlled. Such control provides a route for the experimental synthesis, characterization, and control of topologically nontrivial phases in open physical systems. Science , this issue p. 1240",

Xiao et al . have developed a process for engineering hardwood that allows these sheets to be manipulated into complex structures (see the Perspective by Tajvidi and Gardner). The key is to manipulate the cell wall structure by shrinking and blasting open the fibers and vessels by drying and \u201cwater-shocking\u201d them. This process creates a window wherein the wood can be manipulated without ripping or tearing. Honeycomb, corrugated, or other complex structures are locked in once the wood dries. \u2014BG",

    "abstract": "A metabolic circuit in T cell immunity Na\u00efve T cells are metabolically reprogrammed when they differentiate into T effector (T eff ) cells, transitioning from a reliance on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Xu et al. found that lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a glycolytic enzyme that converts pyruvate to lactate, is a key player in this process. T eff cells that differentiate in mice infected with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes turned on LDHA through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. By promoting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, LDHA in turn facilitated PI3K-dependent inactivation of the transcription factor Foxo1 needed for effective T eff cell responses. Thus, glycolytic ATP acts like a rheostat that both gauges and regulates PI3K-dependent signaling. This type of positive feedback circuit may also provide a mechanistic explanation for the Warburg effect observed in cancer cells. Science , this issue p. 405",

Voss et al. took a different approach, using proteomic deconvolution of the serum immunoglobulin G antibody repertoire from four COVID-19 convalescent patients. They found that the nAb response was largely directed against epitopes such as the N-terminal domain (NTD), which lie outside the RBD. Several of these nAbs were shared among donors and targeted an NTD epitope that is frequently mutated by variants of concern. Science , abg5268, this issue p. 1108",

One way to minimize the cost of noble metals is to disperse them as single atoms. To model the reactivity of supported single atoms, Hulva et al. evaporated different transition metals such as nickel, silver, and iridium on an Fe 3 O 4 (001) support. Single atoms adsorbed in the same twofold site between underlying rows of surface iron atoms. In studies of CO adsorption as a proxy for reactivity, the d-band was strongly affected by the charge transfer to the support and CO-induced structural changes.

    "abstract": "Single seismometer structure Because of the lack of direct seismic observations, the interior structure of Mars has been a mystery. Khan et al. , Knapmeyer-Endrun et al. , and St\u00e4hler et al. used recently detected marsquakes from the seismometer deployed during the InSight mission to map the interior of Mars (see the Perspective by Cottaar and Koelemeijer). Mars likely has a 24- to 72-kilometer-thick crust with a very deep lithosphere close to 500 kilometers. Similar to the Earth, a low-velocity layer probably exists beneath the lithosphere. The crust of Mars is likely highly enriched in radioactive elements that help to heat this layer at the expense of the interior. The core of Mars is liquid and large, \u223c1830 kilometers, which means that the mantle has only one rocky layer rather than two like the Earth has. These results provide a preliminary structure of Mars that helps to constrain the different theories explaining the chemistry and internal dynamics of the planet.

    "abstract": "Memory and logic in the same device Future artificial intelligence applications and data-intensive computations require the development of neuromorphic systems beyond traditional heterogeneous device architectures. Physical separation between a peripheral signal-processing unit and a memory-operating unit is one of the main bottlenecks of heterogeneous architectures, blocking further improvements in efficient resistance matching, energy consumption, and integration compatibility. Tong et al . present a transistor-memory architecture based on a homogeneous tungsten selenide-on-lithium niobate device array (see the Perspective by Rao and Tao). Analog peripheral signal preprocessing and nonvolatile memory were possible within the same device structure, promising diverse neuromorphic functionalities and offering potential improvements in neuromorphic systems on-chip. \u2014YS",

To tackle this challenge, Kuchina et al. developed microbial split-pool ligation transcriptomics, or microSPLiT, a single-cell sequencing method for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Sequencing both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis showed differences in the heat shock response. Examining B. subtilis transcriptional patterns revealed that a small fraction of cells grown in laboratory medium express a myo-inositol catabolism pathway, which the cell could use in nonlaboratory environments, thus highlighting how microSPLiT can identify rare cellular states.

Although they can be highly deformed, they tend to be weak, and methods to strengthen or toughen them tend to reduce stretchability. Two papers now report strategies to create tough but deformable hydrogels (see the Perspective by Bosnjak and Silberstein). Wang et al . introduced a toughening mechanism by storing releasable extra chain length in the stiff part of a double-network hydrogel. A high applied force triggered the opening of cycling strands that were only activated at high chain extension. Kim et al . synthesized acrylamide gels in which dense entanglements could be achieved by using unusually low amounts of water, cross-linker, and initiator during the synthesis. This approach improves the mechanical strength in solid form while also improving the wear resistance once swollen as a hydrogel. \u2014MSL",

    "abstract": "Tailoring stress responses When faced with environmental stress, cells respond by shutting down cellular processes such as translation and nucleocytoplasmic transport. At the same time, cells preserve cytoplasmic messenger RNAs in structures known as stress granules, and many cellular proteins are modified by the covalent addition of ubiquitin, which has long been presumed to reflect degradation of stress-damaged proteins (see the Perspective by Dormann). Maxwell et al. show that cells generate distinct patterns of ubiquitination in response to different stressors. Rather than reflecting the degradation of stress-damaged proteins, this ubiquitination primes cells to dismantle stress granules and reinitiate normal cellular activities once the stress is removed. Gwon et al. show that persistent stress granules are degraded by autophagy, whereas short-lived granules undergo a process of disassembly that is autophagy independent. The mechanism of this disassembly depends on the initiating stress. Science , abc3593 and abf6548, this issue p. eabc3593 and p. eabf6548 ; see also abj2400, p. 1393",

Small-intestine mucus is laced with antimicrobial peptides and is permeable to small molecules; downstream, thicker mucus is generated that excludes bacteria and xenobiotics. Mucus oozes in thick plumes from goblet cells within the crypts to shield the stem cell niche. Between the crypts lie highly differentiated goblet cells producing permeable mucus. Together, both types of mucus form a network that shelters the gut epithelium.

During carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation at total pressures of a few millibars and 500\u00b0C, they observed that gold nanoparticles rotated by about 10\u00b0 but returned to their original position when CO was removed. Density function theory calculations indicated that rotation was induced by changes in the coverage of adsorbed molecular oxygen at the interface. Science , this issue p. 517",

Schulz et al. looked at the type, amount, and toxicity of pesticides applied over the last 25 years.

Using a global set of >1100 fossil pollen records, Mottl et al. explored the rates of vegetation change over the past 18,000 years (see the Perspective by Overpeck and Breshears). The authors show that the rates of change accelerated markedly during the Late Holocene (\u223c4.6 to 2.9 thousand years ago), even more rapidly than the climate-driven vegetation changes associated with the end of the last glacial period. In addition, the Late Holocene acceleration began for terrestrial communities as a whole, suggesting that the acceleration in turnover over the past two centuries is the tip of a deeper trend.

To study the role of electron-electron correlations in this state, Liu et al. placed another graphene bilayer, this one having a conventional arrangement of the graphene sheets, in the immediate vicinity of a sample of MATBG. By varying the carrier density in the conventional bilayer, the researchers controlled the strength of interactions in MATBG. Weakening the interactions strengthened superconductivity, consistent with scenarios in which the electron-phonon coupling competes against Coulomb interactions to stabilize the superconducting phase.

    "abstract": "Shifting frames to make more proteins Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 critically depends on the ribosomal frameshifting that occurs between two large open reading frames in its genomic RNA for expression of viral replicase. Programmed frameshifting occurs during translation, when the ribosome encounters a stimulatory pseudoknot RNA fold. Using a combination of cryo\u2013electron microscopy and biochemistry, Bhatt et al. revealed that the pseudoknot resists unfolding as it lodges at the entry of the ribosomal messenger RNA channel. This causes back slippage of the viral RNA, resulting in a minus-1 shift of the reading frame of translation. A partially folded nascent viral polyprotein forms specific interactions inside the ribosomal tunnel that can influence the efficiency of frameshifting. Science , abf3546, this issue p. 1306",

    "abstract": "Gut bugs and systemic disease risk What people eat has an immediate selective effect on the microbial populations resident in the gut. A high-fat diet is associated with the occurrence of microbes that catabolize choline and the accumulation of trimethylamine N -oxide (TMAO) in the bloodstream, a contributing factor for heart disease. Yoo et al . explored the microbial organisms and pathways that convert choline into TMAO in mice. Although gene clusters for choline metabolism are found widely among the microbiota, it is only the facultative anaerobes that become abundant in hosts on a high-fat diet. A high-fat diet impairs mitochondrial uptake of oxygen into host enterocytes and elevates nitrate in the mucus, which in turn weakens healthy anaerobic gut function. Facultative anaerobes such as the pathobiont Escherichia coli become dominant, which leads to an overall increase in the amount of choline catabolized into the precursor for TMAO. Whether this pathway plays a role in heart disease remains unclear. \u2014CA",

    "abstract": "Zoning in on liver growth For organ homeostasis or regrowth after injury or disease, one or more stem cell populations is needed to rebuild lost tissue. There is considerable debate about the source of new cells in the liver. Two groups now identify the source of new hepatocytes (see the Perspective by Andersson). Although the liver may seem to lack major variation across its structure, its lobule is organized into concentric zones where hepatocytes express different metabolic enzymes. Wei et al. sought to systematically define the source of new liver cells by comparing 14 fate-mapping mice that label different liver cell types. They found that different regions of the liver lobule exhibit differences in hepatocyte turnover, with zone 2 representing a primary source of new hepatocytes during homeostasis and regeneration. Similarly, He et al. designed a genetic approach to record cell proliferation in vivo with high spatial and temporal resolution to enable continuous recording of proliferative events of any specific cell type at the whole-cell population level. Using this method, they identified zone 2 as having the highest proliferative activity and contributing the most to liver regrowth. These findings have implications for the cellular basis of chronic disease pathogenesis, cancer development, and regenerative medicine strategies.

In a long-term study, Mack et al. analyzed wildfire impacts on the carbon balance of boreal forest in Alaska, with particular focus on forest-regeneration patterns. After fire, the species composition in most of the study sites changed from black spruce to a mixture of conifers and deciduous broadleaf tree species. The stands that had shifted to deciduous dominance stored fivefold more soil carbon than stands that returned to black spruce dominance. Therefore, the functional traits of deciduous trees compensated for the combustion loss of soil carbon, pointing to a potential mitigation of the feedback effect of boreal forest fire to climate warming.

Three papers used functional and structural studies to explore how mutations in the viral spike protein affect its ability to infect host cells and to evade host immunity. Gobeil et al . looked at a variant spike protein involved in transmission between minks and humans, as well as the B1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and P1 (gamma) spike variants; Cai et al . focused on the alpha and beta variants; and McCallum et al . discuss the properties of the spike protein from the B1.1.427/B.1.429 (epsilon) variant. Together, these papers show a balance among mutations that enhance stability, those that increase binding to the human receptor ACE2, and those that confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. \u2014VV",

Peterson et al. studied streamflow and precipitation in 161 watersheds in southeastern Australia across the Millennium Drought, which stuck the region during the first decade of the 21st century (see the Perspective by Tauro). They found that runoff in approximately one-third of the watersheds had not returned to predrought levels even after 7 years despite the resumption of more normal precipitation. The authors suggest that these longterm changes are due to water loss from increased transpiration. Watersheds may thus have multiple states and a finite resilience to transient disturbances, and hydrological droughts can persist long after meteorological droughts.

For two-dose vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, some jurisdictions have decided to delay the second dose to rapidly get the vaccine into more people. The consequences of deviating from manufacturer-prescribed dosing regimens are unknown but will depend on the strength of immune responses to the vaccines. Saad-Roy et al. took a modeling approach to tackling the inevitable uncertainties facing vaccine rollout. The authors found that although one-dose strategies generally reduce infections in the short term, in the long term, the outcome depends on immune robustness. A one-dose strategy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution if immune responses are suboptimal and the virus continues to replicate in some vaccinated people, potentially leading to immune-escape mutations. It is critical to gather serological data from vaccinated people and, to avoid negative outcomes, to ramp up vaccination efforts worldwide. Science , this issue p. 363",

However, studies of the conservation and evolutionary history of the mechanisms regulating genome structure across species are lacking. Hoencamp et al. mapped three-dimensional (3D) genome organization in 24 eukaryote species, including animals, fungi, and plants. At interphase, species' telomeres and centromeres either clustered across chromosomes or oriented in a polarized state maintaining individual chromosomal territories within the cell, a difference attributed to condensin II. An experimental loss of condensin II in human cells promotes the formation of centromere clusters but has no effect on loop or compartment formation. Whether the structure of the 3D genome varies across species may thus depend on whether they carry a functional condensin II gene. Science , abe2218, this issue p. 984",

Pernigoni et al . found that when the body was deprived of androgens during ADT, the gut microbiome could produce androgens from androgen precursors (see the Perspective by McCulloch and Trinchieri). Gut commensal microbiota in ADT-treated patients or castrated mice produced androgens that were absorbed into the systemic circulation.

Pandey et al. found that the problem is not, however, one of physical resistance but rather inhibition of growth through a signaling pathway. The volatile plant hormone ethylene will diffuse through aerated soil, but compacted soil reduces such diffusion, increasing the concentration of ethylene near root tissues. The cellular signaling cascades triggered by too much ethylene stop root growth. Therefore, gaseous diffusion serves as a readout of soil compaction for plant roots growing in search of productive nutrition. Science , this issue p. 276",

Applying a phylogenetic analysis and recent computational methods to the expanded diversity of bacterial sequences from metagenomic analyses, Coleman et al. infer the root of the eubacterial tree (see the Perspective by Katz). The root was determined without using the Archaea as an outgroup, to avoid the possibility of a false result due to long branch attraction. This method places the eubacterial root in the neighborhood of Fusobacteriota. Using this information, the authors reconstructed the eubacterial ancestor, identifying that this organism likely had a double-membrane cell envelope, flagellum-mediated motility, antiphage defense mechanisms, and diverse metabolic pathways.

The impact is so widespread that it has been suggested that only climate change reversal can save coral reefs globally. Donovan et al. looked at the interaction between local conditions and coral reef health and found that poor conditions magnify climate impacts (see the Perspective by Knowlton). Furthermore, reefs where human stressors such as overfishing or pollution were minimized fared better. Such results suggest that caring for reefs locally may help them to persist in our warming world. Science , abd9464, this issue p. 977 ; see also abi7286, p. 908",

With mathematical and real-world examples, they argue that evading tipping and enhancing resilience could be relevant for many ecosystems and Earth system components that until now were known as tipping prone. Many of these complex systems may be more resilient than currently thought because of overlooked spatial dynamics and multiple stable states, and may thus not undergo critical or catastrophic transitions with global change. \u2014AMS",

Khan et al. , Knapmeyer-Endrun et al. , and St\u00e4hler et al. used recently detected marsquakes from the seismometer deployed during the InSight mission to map the interior of Mars (see the Perspective by Cottaar and Koelemeijer). Mars likely has a 24- to 72-kilometer-thick crust with a very deep lithosphere close to 500 kilometers. Similar to the Earth, a low-velocity layer probably exists beneath the lithosphere. The crust of Mars is likely highly enriched in radioactive elements that help to heat this layer at the expense of the interior. The core of Mars is liquid and large, \u223c1830 kilometers, which means that the mantle has only one rocky layer rather than two like the Earth has. These results provide a preliminary structure of Mars that helps to constrain the different theories explaining the chemistry and internal dynamics of the planet.

Heart regeneration is thus limited after injury. The postmitotic nature of cardiomyocytes blocks cardiac tumor formation but at the same time minimizes cardiomyocyte renewal. Chen et al . report that cell type\u2013specific expression of pluripotency factors dedifferentiates adult cardiomyocytes to a state that resembles fetal cardiomyocytes, enabling adult cardiomyocytes to reenter mitosis (see the Perspective by Wang and Blau). Cardiomyocytes can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state when expression of pluripotency factors is sustained over an extended period. If cardiomyocytes are only partially reprogrammed, the heart regenerates without tumor formation. \u2014BAP",

Development of these communities, as revealed by mRNA composition, were followed in space and time. The results revealed a heterogeneous phenotypic landscape, with oxygen availability shaping the metabolism at a spatial scale of microns within a single contiguous biofilm segment.

    "abstract": "Back to school\u2014safely Severe COVID-19 in children is rare, but many schools remain closed because the transmission risk that school contact poses to adults and the wider community is unknown. Observing the heterogeneity of approaches taken among U.S. school districts, Lessler et al. investigated how different strategies influence COVID-19 transmission rates in the wider community using COVID-19 Symptom Survey data from Carnegie Mellon and Facebook. The authors found that when mitigation measures are in place, transmission within schools is limited and infection rates mirror that of the surrounding community.

    "abstract": "Localizing gene expression Single-cell RNA sequencing can provide information about cellular relationships based on shared transcriptomes, but most methods lose spatial information. Those methods that do retain spatial information can be limited to a specific set of genes and/or a small area. Srivatsan et al. introduce sci-Space, a spatial transcriptomic method that uses a grid of barcoded oligos on a slide that can be transferred to nuclei of an overlaid frozen tissue section to obtain both the spatial origin and the transcriptome of thousands of single cells per slide. The researchers used sci-Space to create a spatial atlas of mouse E14 sagittal sections, revealing spatially expressed genes across cell types. This application illustrates how sci-Space complements existing approaches in spatial genomics. Science , abb9536, this issue p. 111",

    "abstract": "Targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 Inside host cells, the RNA genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is translated into two polyproteins that are cleaved to give the individual viral proteins. The main viral protease, known as Mpro or 3CLpro, plays a key role in these cleavages, making it an important drug target. Drayman et al . identified eight drugs that target 3CLpro from a library of 1900 clinically safe drugs. Because of the challenge of working with SARS-CoV-2, they started by screening for drugs that inhibit the replication of a human coronavirus that causes the common cold. They then evaluated the top hits for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and for inhibiting 3CLpro. Masitinib, a broad antiviral, inhibited the main proteases of coronaviruses and picornaviruses and was effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication in mice. \u2014VV",

Studying psychotic disorders in animal models is difficult because the diagnosis relies on self-reported symptoms that can only be assessed in humans. Schmack et al. developed a paradigm to probe and rigorously measure experimentally controlled hallucinations in rodents (see the Perspective by Matamales). Using dopamine-sensor measurements and circuit and pharmacological manipulations, they demonstrated a brain circuit link between excessive dopamine and hallucination-like experience. This could potentially be useful as a translational model of common psychotic symptoms described in various psychiatric disorders. It may also help in the development of new therapeutic approaches based on anatomically selective modulation of dopamine function. Science , this issue p. eabf4740 ; see also p. 33",

    "abstract": "How genes affect human obesity Obesity is linked to many human diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. There is thus great interest in understanding how genes predispose individuals to, or protect individuals from, obesity. Akbari et al. sequenced more than 600,000 exomes from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Mexico and identified 16 rare coding variants (see the Perspective by Yeo and O'Rahilly). Some of the alleles associated with body mass index (BMI) were brain-expressed G protein\u2013coupled receptors. One variant allele was found in Mexican populations at low frequency and was associated with lower BMI. Deletion of this gene in mice resulted in a resistance to weight gain, suggesting that this gene provides an avenue of study for the prevention or treatment of obesity.

    "abstract": "The clock is ticking for senescent cells Senescent cells promote their own recognition and removal through the immune system by generating a bioactive secretome called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Sturmlechner et al . report that the cell cycle regulator p21 directs an early form of the SASP, which they call the p21-activated secretory phenotype (PASP) (see the Perspective by Reen and Gil). As part of the PASP, the chemokine CXCL14 attracts macrophages, which monitor stressed cells expressing elevated p21. If stressed cells recuperate and p21 levels return to normal within 4 days, then macrophages disengage from their targets. Otherwise, macrophages recruit cytotoxic T cells that facilitate target cell removal. Other cell cycle regulators such as p16 can induce many factors overlapping with the PASP, but p21 uniquely drives this CXCL14-mediated \u201ctimer\u201d mechanism of senescent cell immunosurveillance. \u2014STS",

    "abstract": "Fueling outbreaks The B.1.1.7 lineage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused fast-spreading outbreaks globally. Intrinsically, this variant has greater transmissibility than its predecessors, but this capacity has been amplified in some circumstances to tragic effect by a combination of human behavior and local immunity. What are the extrinsic factors that help or hinder the rapid dissemination of variants? Kraemer et al . explored the invasion dynamics of B.1.1.7. in fine detail, from its location of origin in Kent, UK, to its heterogenous spread around the country. A combination of mobile phone and virus data including more than 17,000 genomes shows how distinct phases of dispersal were related to intensity of mobility and the timing of lockdowns. As the local outbreaks grew, importation from the London source area became less important. Had B.1.1.7. emerged at a slightly different time of year, its impact might have been different. \u2014CA",

Jeon et al. observed the formation of gold crystals on a graphene substrate through the reduction of a precursor using an electron beam. Rather than the classic view, they instead observed a nucleation pathway that involves dynamic and reversible fluctuations of developing nuclei between disordered and crystalline states. The lifetime in the disordered state decreases with increasing cluster size, and at sufficiently small sizes, the binding energy per atom is large enough relative to the energy required to induce melting that the heat imparted upon binding is enough to drive partial collapse of an ordered cluster into the disordered state.

    "abstract": "Zoning in on liver growth For organ homeostasis or regrowth after injury or disease, one or more stem cell populations is needed to rebuild lost tissue. There is considerable debate about the source of new cells in the liver. Two groups now identify the source of new hepatocytes (see the Perspective by Andersson). Although the liver may seem to lack major variation across its structure, its lobule is organized into concentric zones where hepatocytes express different metabolic enzymes. Wei et al. sought to systematically define the source of new liver cells by comparing 14 fate-mapping mice that label different liver cell types. They found that different regions of the liver lobule exhibit differences in hepatocyte turnover, with zone 2 representing a primary source of new hepatocytes during homeostasis and regeneration. Similarly, He et al. designed a genetic approach to record cell proliferation in vivo with high spatial and temporal resolution to enable continuous recording of proliferative events of any specific cell type at the whole-cell population level. Using this method, they identified zone 2 as having the highest proliferative activity and contributing the most to liver regrowth. These findings have implications for the cellular basis of chronic disease pathogenesis, cancer development, and regenerative medicine strategies.

The inflammatory process causes the gut vascular barrier to become more permeable, resulting in the spread of inflammation beyond the intestine, while the vascular barrier in the choroid plexus shuts down, helping protect the brain from inflammation but also potentially impairing communication between organs and impairing some brain functions. \u2014YN",

Unfortunately, drugs that have an antiviral effect in cells through phospholipidosis are unlikely to be effective in vivo.

    "abstract": "Baboons inform on human gut microbiota Commensal bacteria are found throughout an organism, but it is not known whether associations between gut bacteria and their host are heritable. Grieneisen et al. examined changes in the microbiomes of 585 wild baboons from fecal samples collected over 14 years (see the Perspective by Cortes-Ortiz and Amato). Almost all microbiome traits tested demonstrated some level of statistically significant heritability. Most heritability values were low but varied over time correlating with the age of the host. Baboons live in an environment similar to that postulated for early humans and have a microbiome similar to that of humans. Thus, this heritability of the microbiome may reflect similar genetic determinants in humans, for which similar datasets are not available.

They found little change in mammal richness or occupancy but large declines across birds. They attribute these differences to differences in microclimate opportunities: Specifically, mammals can mitigate temperature impacts through burrowing, whereas birds are generally more exposed.

Carvalho et al. used fossilized pollen and leaves to characterize the changes that took place in northern South American forests at this time (see the Perspective by Jacobs and Currano). They not only found changes in species composition but were also able to infer changes in forest structure. Extinctions were widespread, especially among gymnosperms. Angiosperm taxa came to dominate the forests over the 6 million years of recovery, when the flora began to resemble that of modern lowland neotropical forest. The leaf data also imply that the forest canopy evolved from relatively open to closed and layered, leading to increased vertical stratification and a greater diversity of plant growth forms.

These inhibitors potentiated bactericidal antibiotics in vitro and in mouse infection models. They also suppressed persister bacteria and disrupted biofilm formation. This strategy of taking out persister cells may be promising for treating recalcitrant infections and holding the line against drug-resistant bacteria.

Upon virus infection, interferons (IFNs) generate the initial signals for cellular defenses. Knowing that defects in IFN signaling are associated with more severe COVID-19, Wickenhagen et al . used IFN-stimulated gene expression screening on human lung cells from which they identified a gene for 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) (see the Perspective by Schoggins). OAS1 stimulates RNase L to inhibit the virus with a surprising degree of specificity, targeting the membranous organelles in which it replicates. In most mammals, OAS1 is attached to membranes by a prenyl group. However, billions of humans do not have the prenylated OAS1 haplotype, including many experiencing severe COVID-19. The same is true for horseshoe bats, prolific sources of betacoronaviruses, because of an ancient retrotransposition event. \u2014CA",

    "abstract": "Looking for magnetic clues Thin films of the neodymium nickelate NdNiO 2 doped with strontium have recently been found to be superconducting. This materials class bears structural and electronic similarities to the famed cuprate superconductors, but how far the analogy goes remains unclear. Lu et al. used resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to look for magnetism, which exists in the cuprates, in Nd 1-x Sr x NiO 2 films (see the Perspective by Benckiser). The authors observed magnetic modes in the undoped compound that had a doping evolution consistent with the behavior of a doped Mott insulator.

    "abstract": "Keeping cGAS silent Cells detect microbial and self-DNA in the cytosol as a danger signal that triggers immune and inflammatory responses. Paradoxically, a large fraction of a DNA-sensing enzyme called cGAS is tightly associated with the chromatin, especially during mitosis. Li et al. uncovered two mechanisms that prevent cGAS from being activated by the chromatin DNA (see the Perspective by Ablasser). First, cGAS is hyperphosphorylated as cells enter mitosis, thereby inhibiting its DNA-binding and liquid-liquid phase separation, which promotes cGAS activation. Second, chromatin-bound cGAS is unable to oligomerize, a process required for its activation. Together, these mechanisms ensure cGAS inactivation during cell division to prevent autoimmune reactions.

Wilkinson et al . curated viral genomes collected in 2021 from several countries across the continent. Outbreaks during 2020 in each African country were initiated by imported cases, mostly from Europe. As the pandemic developed, case numbers in African countries were likely many times higher than reported, and subsequent waves of the pandemic appear to have been more severe. Consequently, high-transmission variants have emerged that have spread within the continent, and African countries must be included in global control efforts. \u2014CA",

Treatment strategies that are broadly protective against current and future SARS-like coronaviruses are needed. Martinez et al . take on this challenge by developing vaccines based on chimeras of the viral spike protein. The messenger RNA vaccines encode spike proteins composed of domain modules from epidemic and pandemic coronaviruses, as well as bat coronaviruses with the potential to cross to humans. In aged mice vulnerable to infection, the chimeric vaccines protected against challenge from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and tested variants of concern, and zoonotic coronaviruses with pandemic potential. \u2014VV",

Surveying the cell types in the freshwater sponge Spongilla lacustris , Musser et al . found that many genes important in synaptic communication are expressed in cells of the small digestive chambers. They found secretory machinery characteristic of the presynapse in small multipolar cells contacting all other cells and also the receptive apparatus of the postsynapse in the choanocytes that generate water flow and digest microbial food. These results suggest that the first directed communication in animals may have evolved to regulate feeding, serving as a starting point on the long path toward nervous system evolution. \u2014BAP",

    "abstract": "Go big or you'll get lost Rational mutagenesis is a common approach to investigating or engineering enzyme function in vitro, but the ease with which one can manipulate protein sequences belies many pitfalls in connecting sparse activity data to an enzyme's true functional landscape. Using a high-throughput platform, Markin et al. expressed, purified, and performed an array of kinetic measurements on a target esterase, collecting data from >1000 mutations spanning the entire protein (see the Perspective by Baumer and Whitehead). Protein misfolding into an inactive state, rather than decreased equilibrium stability, was a crucial factor in negatively affected variants spread throughout the protein. When combined with prior mechanistic understanding and structures, four \u201cfunctional components\u201d help to rationalize the otherwise complex spatial pattern of effects of mutations on different aspects of enzyme function, all of which would be invisible from mutagenesis of just a few residues.

However, it is highly unstable outside of ultrahigh vacuum conditions and oxidizes readily, which hampers exploration of its properties. Li et al. hydrogenated these materials with atomic hydrogen and showed that borophane has a lower local work function. This material is stable for days in air, and borophene can be recovered simply by thermally driving off the hydrogen. Science , this issue p. 1143",

    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement goes large Quantum entanglement occurs when two separate entities become strongly linked in a way that cannot be explained by classical physics; it is a powerful resource in quantum communication protocols and advanced technologies that aim to exploit the enhanced capabilities of quantum systems. To date, entanglement has generally been limited to microscopic quantum units such as pairs or multiples of single ions, atoms, photons, and so on. Kotler et al. and Mercier de L\u00e9pinay et al. demonstrate the ability to extend quantum entanglement to massive macroscopic systems (see the Perspective by Lau and Clerk). Entanglement of two mechanical oscillators on such a large length and mass scale is expected to find widespread use in both applications and fundamental physics to probe the boundary between the classical and quantum worlds.

    "abstract": "Defining tumor cell immune evasion Mouse models used to study cancer often lack a full immune system, allowing implantation of human tumors into the mice. By contrast, naturally evolving tumors must contend with a fully functional immune system and its destruction of some of the cells (see the Perspective by Ho and Wood). Two groups now report studies on mouse models with a fully intact immune system. Martin et al . started with preexisting murine tumor cell lines and examined their continued evolution in vivo, whereas Del Poggetto et al . examined the development of new pancreatic tumors in the context of inflammation, as is often seen in human patients. In each study, the authors found that the immune system exerted a selective pressure on cells that would give rise to tumors, promoting the survival of those that had lost expression of tumor suppressor genes or activated a specific oncogene. The findings suggest a major role for the immune system in driving tumor evolution across multiple types of cancer. \u2014YN",

Although the infection was maternally restricted and short-lived, the offspring harbored greater numbers of intestinal T helper 17 cells into adulthood. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) mediated this tissue-restricted effect by acting on fetal intestinal epithelium during development. Although offspring from mothers infected with YopM or injected with IL-6 showed enhanced resistance to oral infection with Salmonella Typhimurium, they also exhibited higher susceptibility toward enteric inflammatory disease. \u2014STS",

After adjusting for age and other variables, vaccine effectiveness for the new variant averaged 55% in June and July of 2020.

Either positive or negative ions can cause this effect. Chu et al. constructed an all-solid-state muscle that eliminated the need for an electrolyte bath, which may expand the potential for its use in applications. By infiltrating the yarns with charged polymers, the fibers start partially swollen, so the length can increase through the loss of ions. It is thus possible to increase the overall stroke of the muscle. Further, these composite materials show a surprising increase in stroke with scan rate. Science , this issue p. 494",

    "abstract": "Fungal aggravation The gut microbiota includes not only prokaryotes, viruses, protists, and occasionally helminths, but also fungi. The role that fungi play in this symbiosis has long been overlooked. While investigating alterations to the gut microbiota in mice with mucosal damage and human subjects with Crohn's disease, Jain et al. discovered the fungus Debaryomyces hansenii localized to wounds in inflamed mucosal tissue (see the Perspective by Chiaro and Round). Impaired healing was associated with antibiotic treatment, overgrowth of the fungus, and subsequent induction of a type I interferon\u2013CCL5 axis by macrophages. The fungus was observed within macrophages. Such persistent injury stimulus is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. It is not known whether this salt-tolerant fungus is a natural symbiont, but it is used in the food industry for surface ripening of cheese and meat products.

Newer multiplex immunofluorescent technologies provide the potential to visualize the expression patterns of many functionally relevant molecules but present numerous challenges in accurate image analysis and data handling, particularly over large tumor areas. Drawing from the field of astronomy, in which petabytes of imaging data are routinely analyzed across a wide spectral range, Berry et al. developed a platform for multispectral imaging of whole-tumor sections with high-fidelity single-cell resolution. The resultant AstroPath platform was used to develop a multiplex immunofluorescent assay highly predictive of responses and outcomes for melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy.

Liu et al. measured high-temporal-resolution brain signals using human magnetoencephalography combined with a new model-based, visually oriented, multipath reinforcement memory task. This task was designed to differentiate local versus nonlocal learning episodes within the subject. They found that reverse sequential replay in the human medial temporal lobe supports nonlocal reinforcement learning and is the underlying mechanism for solving complex credit assignment problems such as value learning.

Thus, if two large groups start out on the same side of the bond axis (a geometry known as a Z -olefin), they end up on opposite sides in the product. Jiang et al. report a chiral iridium catalyst that prevents this swiveling just long enough to substitute the adjacent carbon enantioselectively (see the Perspective by Malcolmson).

Superconducting circuits are the most advanced platform at present, but there is an issue with cross-talk between the qubits and the challenge of error correction as the systems are scaled up. Another approach being pursued is a modular platform in which the qubits are spatially separated. Daiss et al. demonstrate the operation of a quantum gate in which one qubit conditionally controls the state of another qubit spatially separated by 60 meters (see the Perspective by Hunger). Because the approach is platform independent, it could be extended from the demonstrated neutral atoms to ions, impurity vacancy centers, or even a combination of these qubits.

    "abstract": "Light makes light work of fatty acids Photosynthetic organisms are notable for their ability to capture light energy and use it to power biosynthesis. Some algae have gone a step beyond photosynthesis and can use light to initiate enzymatic photodecarboxylation of fatty acids, producing long-chain hydrocarbons. To understand this transformation, Sorigu\u00e9 et al. brought to bear an array of structural, computational, and spectroscopic techniques and fully characterized the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. These experiments are consistent with a mechanism starting with electron transfer from the fatty acid to a photoexcited oxidized flavin cofactor. Decarboxylation yields an alkyl radical, which is then reduced by back electron transfer and protonation rather than hydrogen atom transfer. The wealth of experimental data explains how algae harness light energy to produce alka(e)nes and provides an appealing model system for understanding enzyme-catalyzed photochemistry more generally.

    "abstract": "Early footsteps in the Americas Despite a plethora of archaeological research over the past century, the timing of human migration into the Americas is still far from resolved. In a study of exposed outcrops of Lake Otero in White Sands National Park in New Mexico, Bennett et al . reveal numerous human footprints dating to about 23,000 to 21,000 years ago. These finds indicate the presence of humans in North America for approximately two millennia during the Last Glacial Maximum south of the migratory barrier created by the ice sheets to the north. This timing coincided with a Northern Hemispheric abrupt warming event, Dansgaard-Oeschger event 2, which drew down lake levels and allowed humans and megafauna to walk on newly exposed surfaces, creating tracks that became preserved in the geologic record. \u2014AMS",

At the same time, cells preserve cytoplasmic messenger RNAs in structures known as stress granules, and many cellular proteins are modified by the covalent addition of ubiquitin, which has long been presumed to reflect degradation of stress-damaged proteins (see the Perspective by Dormann). Maxwell et al. show that cells generate distinct patterns of ubiquitination in response to different stressors. Rather than reflecting the degradation of stress-damaged proteins, this ubiquitination primes cells to dismantle stress granules and reinitiate normal cellular activities once the stress is removed. Gwon et al. show that persistent stress granules are degraded by autophagy, whereas short-lived granules undergo a process of disassembly that is autophagy independent. The mechanism of this disassembly depends on the initiating stress. Science , abc3593 and abf6548, this issue p. eabc3593 and p. eabf6548 ; see also abj2400, p. 1393",

    "abstract": "Single seismometer structure Because of the lack of direct seismic observations, the interior structure of Mars has been a mystery. Khan et al. , Knapmeyer-Endrun et al. , and St\u00e4hler et al. used recently detected marsquakes from the seismometer deployed during the InSight mission to map the interior of Mars (see the Perspective by Cottaar and Koelemeijer). Mars likely has a 24- to 72-kilometer-thick crust with a very deep lithosphere close to 500 kilometers. Similar to the Earth, a low-velocity layer probably exists beneath the lithosphere. The crust of Mars is likely highly enriched in radioactive elements that help to heat this layer at the expense of the interior. The core of Mars is liquid and large, \u223c1830 kilometers, which means that the mantle has only one rocky layer rather than two like the Earth has. These results provide a preliminary structure of Mars that helps to constrain the different theories explaining the chemistry and internal dynamics of the planet.

Therefore, they are important laboratories for the study of human impacts on natural vegetation and biodiversity. Nogu\u00e9 et al. provide a quantitative palaeoecological study of 27 islands around the world, focusing on pollen records of vegetation composition before and after human arrival. The authors found a consistent pattern of acceleration of vegetation turnover after human invasion, with median rates of change increasing by a factor of six. These changes occurred regardless of geographical and ecological features of the island and show how rapidly ecosystems can change and how island ecosystems are set on new trajectories.

The activity of the GTPase Rag and lysosomal tethering of Rag-Ragulator were required to recruit and activate the kinase RIPK1 and protease caspase-8 to cleave GSDMD, which causes cell death and limits infection.

Although HDL is mainly produced by the liver, the intestine is also a source. Han et al. show in mice that intestinal HDL is not routed to the systemic circulation. Rather, in the form of HDL3, it is directly transported to the liver through the hepatic portal vein. There, it sequesters bacterial lipopolysaccharide from the gut that can trigger inflammation and liver damage. In various models of liver injury, loss of enteric HDL exacerbated pathology. By contrast, drugs elevating intestinal HDL improved disease outcomes. HDL3 is enriched in human portal venous blood, suggesting that enteric HDL may be targetable for the treatment of liver disease.

Mutations in some genes caused clones to expand over time, resulting in clonal dominance.

    "abstract": "Cryo-EM helps engineer enhanced IL-10 Interleukin-10 (IL-10) binds to the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R), comprising two high-affinity \u03b1 chains and two low-affinity \u03b2 chains. Depending on the cellular context of its recognition, IL-10 can either suppress or activate immune responses. This pleiotropic behavior has complicated efforts to use IL-10 as an anti-inflammatory agent. Saxton et al. generated a high-affinity version of IL-10 (super-10), which allowed them to visualize IL-10 in complex with both IL-10R\u03b1 and IL-10R\u03b2 by cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This enabled them to engineer additional variants of IL-10 with variable IL-10R\u03b2\u2013binding affinities. Some of the partial agonists exhibited biased actions on myeloid cells, which exhibited anti-inflammatory properties without concomitant CD8 T cell activation. These findings may serve as a blueprint for future enhanced cytokine\u2013based therapeutics. Science , this issue p. eabc8433",

Xue et al. developed ion transistors from reduced graphene oxide membranes and observed a field-enhanced diffusivity of the ions (see the Perspective by Hinds). By applying electrical gating, the average surface potential on the graphene layer could be controlled, thus altering the energy barrier for ion intercalation into the channel and leading to very high diffusion rates. The authors observed selective ion transport two orders of magnitude faster than the ion diffusion in bulk water. Science , this issue p. 501 ; see also p. 459",

Efficacy can often be increased by clustering antibodies in multivalent assemblies. Divine et al. designed antibody nanocages from two components: One is an antibody-binding homo-oligomic protein and the other is the antibody itself. Computationally designed proteins drive the assembly of antibody nanocages in a range of architectures, allowing control of the symmetry and the antibody valency. The multivalent display enhances antibody-dependent signaling, and nanocages displaying antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein effectively neutralize pseudovirus.

The authors reassigned each codon to several noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs). This advance enables the efficient synthesis of proteins containing three distinct ncAAs and the encoded synthesis of entirely noncanonical polymers and macrocycles.

They found broad patterns of limitation consistent with an Earth system model and nutrient addition experiments.

Hernandez-Lopez et al. modified human T cells using a two-step mechanism that allowed them to kill cells expressing large amounts of cancer marker protein but not cells expressing a small amount of the same protein. A first synthetic receptor recognized the antigen with low affinity. That receptor signaled to increase expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with high affinity for the same antigen.

Klein et al. eliminated the protein RIF1, a master regulator of replication timing, in several human cell lines. RIF1 loss during the G1 phase of the cell cycle resulted in a heterogeneous, nearly random replication timing program from the first S phase that persisted even in stable RIF1-null clones. Altered replication timing was followed by replication-dependent redistribution of active and repressive histone modifications and alterations in genome architecture. These results support a model in which replication timing orchestrates the epigenetic state of newly replicated chromatin. Science , this issue p. 371",

    "abstract": "High-energy photons from the Crab Nebula The Crab Nebula contains a pulsar that excites the surrounding gas to emit high-energy radiation. The combination of the pulsar's youth and nearby location makes the nebula the brightest gamma-ray source in the sky. The LHAASO Collaboration report observations of this source at energies of tera\u2013 to peta\u2013electron volts, extending the spectrum of this prototypical object. They combine these data with observations at lower energies to model the physics of the emission process. The multiwave-length data can be explained by a combination of synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering. Science , abg5137, this issue p. 425",

Koning et al. examined US biomedical patents and found that although fewer women engage in commercial patenting compared with men, their patents are more likely to focus on women's health (see the Perspective by Murray). In an evaluation of biomedical articles, the researchers found that women were also more likely to make scientific discoveries that might lead to women's health patents. These findings demonstrate that a lack of representation among inventors translates into a lack of breadth in inventions. Science , aba6990, this issue p. 1345 ; see also abh3178, p. 1260",

    "abstract": "Wild phage evolution Bacteria possess a diversity of highly specific phage defense mechanisms that evolve rapidly and that account for a large proportion of bacterial genomes. These dynamics must be understood if phage therapy is to be seriously considered for clinical use. Hussain et al . studied a set of nearly clonal wild-caught Vibrio lentus hosts and their phage and found that the hosts segregated into two groups infected by different viruses (see the Perspective by Meaden and Fineran). Puzzlingly, both host groups have the same surface phage receptors. This apparent paradox was resolved by sequencing of the hosts, which revealed distinct suites of endogenous but mobile phage defense elements (PDEs) in the two host phenotypes. Indeed, the PDEs constitute a large fraction of the flexible noncore genome of the bacteria. This means the PDEs can evolve and transfer from cell to cell without interfering with metabolic processes required to synthesize essential cell surface molecules. \u2014CA",

Although the drivers of decline are complex, the authors found that climate change\u2014in particular, warmer months in the autumn\u2014explain a large portion, even as warming summers actually lead to increases.

Bald eagle mass death events in the southeastern United States may be one such downstream effect of human activity. After considerable effort, Breinlinger et al. identified the cause of these events as an insidious combination of factors. Colonization of waterways by an invasive, introduced plant provided a substrate for the growth of a previously unidentified cyanobacterium. Exposure of this cyanobacterium to bromide, typically anthropogenic in origin, resulted in the production of a neurotoxin that both causes neuropathy in animals that prey on the plants and also bioaccumulates to kill predators such as bald eagles.

The binding of TATA box\u2013binding protein (TBP) to the TATA box promoter has been thought to be a general rule in PIC assembly and transcription initiation. However, most coding genes lack a TATA box, and nearly all Pol II\u2013mediated gene transcription requires the TBP-containing multisubunit complex transcription factor IID (TFIID). Chen et al. determined the structures of human TFIID-based PIC in sequential assembly states and revealed that TFIID supports distinct PIC assembly on TATA-containing and TATA-lacking promoters. The finding resolves the long-standing mystery of how one set of general transcription machinery initiates transcription on diverse promoters. Science , this issue p. eaba8490",

Earlier orbital images showed that the crater contains an ancient river delta that was deposited by water flowing into a lake billions of years ago. Mangold et al . analyzed rover images taken shortly after landing that show distant cliff faces at the edge of the delta. The exposed stratigraphy and sizes of boulders allowed them to determine the past lake level and water discharge rates. An initially steady flow transitioned into intermittent floods as the planet dried out. This history of the delta\u2019s geology provides context for the rest of the mission and improves our understanding of Mars\u2019 ancient climate. \u2014KTS",

    "abstract": "An intrinsic gamma-ray burst afterglow Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are emitted by relativistic jets generated during the collapse of a massive star in a distant galaxy. The GRB itself lasts only a few seconds but is followed by an afterglow that can persist for hours or days. The H.E.S.S. Collaboration observed the afterglow of GRB 190829A, a nearby long GRB. The proximity of this burst allowed it to be detected at tera\u2013electron volt energies that would otherwise be absorbed in the intergalactic medium. By analyzing the spectrum and light curve at x-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths, the authors show that the afterglow cannot be explained by standard models. Science , abe8560, this issue p. 1081",

    "abstract": "Selectivity control in zeolite synthesis Zeolites are widely used in many industrial applications, but despite decades of research, their synthesis still relies on trial-and-error approaches. Complex nucleation mechanisms and topological diversity lead to strong phase competition, complicating the issue of rational design of zeolite synthesis. Using atomistic simulations, literature mining, human-computer interaction, synthesis, and characterization, Schwalbe-Koda et al . developed a computational strategy that enables a priori control of phase selectivity in zeolite synthesis (see the Perspective by Chaikittisilp and Okubo). This approach uses several metrics for designing organic structure\u2013directing agents to crystallize target zeolites with controlled phase competition and intergrowth. These results may have profound implications for the materials science community if this method is shown to be successful in the synthesis of practically useful uncommon zeolites. \u2014YS",

Cytochrome P-450 derivatives were effective catalysts, and a series of enzyme variants were generated by directed evolution to access the full range of enantiomer and diastereomer products for model substrates.

Furthermore, the alleles and frequencies of these repeated sequences differ between individuals of African and European descent, resulting in differences between the populations with clinical relevance for traits including lipoprotein(a) levels, a risk factor for coronary artery disease. \u2014LMZ",

The importins facilitate further MYB3R4 accumulation within the nucleus, accelerating the progression into mitosis. MYB3R4 and the importins dissipate when the nuclear membrane dissolves at prometaphase, so there is only one round of mitotic activation per cell cycle. Science , this issue p. 1350",

Morton et al. analyzed papillary thyroid tumors, normal thyroid tissue, and blood from hundreds of survivors of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and compared them against those of unexposed patients. The findings offer insight into the process of radiation-induced carcinogenesis and characteristic patterns of DNA damage associated with environmental radiation exposure. In a separate study, Yeager et al. analyzed the genomes of 130 children and parents from families in which one or both parents had experienced gonadal radiation exposure related to the Chernobyl accident and the children were conceived between 1987 and 2002.

Gadadhar et al. now demonstrate in mice that glycylation, although nonessential for the formation of cilia and flagella, coordinates the beat waveform of sperm flagella. This activity is a prerequisite for progressive sperm swimming and thus for male fertility. At the ultrastructural level, lack of glycylation perturbed the distribution of axonemal dynein conformations, which may explain the observed defects in flagellar beat.

These bacteria have integrative and conjugative elements called SXT ICEs, which are notorious for carrying antibiotic resistance genes but also contain genes that defend bacteria from phage. Phage have their own counterdefense mechanisms. One constitutes a 44\u2013amino acid peptide product in a phage lineage that inhibits the bacterium\u2019s SXT ICE defenses. In a further complication, SXT-ICEs also inhibit the lysogenic phage that transmit Vibrio virulence factors, including cholera toxin. Therefore, this process drives bacterial diversity as well as antibiotic resistance. \u2014CA",

    "abstract": "How the body regulates fear Although fear is important for survival, it is maladaptive if it is either too strong, as in anxiety disorders, or too weak, as in exaggerated risk taking. Working in mice, Klein et al . observed that the insular cortex has an unparalleled dual role in either enhancing or weakening the extinction of fear, depending on the internal fear state of the animal (see the Perspective by Christianson). This insula function helps to maintain fear within a homeostatic range and depends on bodily feedback signals: Fear-induced freezing behavior is associated with a slowed heart rate, which in turn dampens fear-evoked activity of the insular cortex. Two opposite signals, prediction of threat by fear-associated cues and negative feedback signals from the body, are thus integrated within the insular cortex. \u2014PRS",

How its biophysical properties are regulated has remained elusive. Wu et al . found that the RNA helicase DDX21 forms a shell coating each FC/DFC unit in the nucleolus (see the Perspective by Yamazaki and Hirose). The authors found that a long noncoding RNA called SLERT facilitates the transition from the open to the closed configuration of the helicase using a chaperone-like mechanism. DDX21 in the closed conformation forms loose clusters that confer the FC/DFC unit sufficient liquidity and space required for Pol I processivity. In addition, DDX21 within the loose clusters cannot approach and wrap rDNA, thus licensing rDNA for transcription. \u2014DJ",

Examination of KARABINER , a bat gene that arose through this process, shows how the retention of part of the TE within this gene allows the transcribed protein to bind throughout the genome and act as a transcriptional regulator. Thus, TEs interacting within their host genome provide the raw material to generate new combinations of functional domains that can be selected upon and incorporated within the hierarchical cellular network.

After sorting various CD4 + T cell subsets, they generated numerous T cell clones that reacted to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. A large number of T cell clones from almost all individuals recognized a small conserved immunodominant region within the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). The researchers isolated T cell clones that broadly reacted to the spike protein of other coronaviruses, providing evidence for the recall of preexisting cross-reactive memory T cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    "abstract": "Type 1 immunity gives fungi a foothold Type 17 immune responses play a vital role against fungal infections of the mucosa. It remains unclear whether other types of immune responses can also contribute to host defense against these pathogens. The yeast Candida albicans prominently infects patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy\u2013candidiasis\u2013ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), an inherited disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the AIRE gene. Break et al. report that the oral susceptibility of Aire -deficient mice to C. albicans is not due to aberrant type 17 responses. Rather, the overproduction of interferon-\u03b3 by local CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in these mice disrupts the epithelial barrier, which increases susceptibility to C. albicans invasion. Similar type 1 immune pathways are operational in APECED patients. Inhibition of interferon-\u03b3 or the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in mice ameliorates disease symptoms, suggesting potential future therapeutic interventions for certain classes of fungal disease.

Chen et al. determined the structures of human Mediator and Mediator-bound PIC in distinct conformational states, the latter of which represents a complete PIC-Mediator complex assembled on the 14-subunit transcription factor IID (TFIID). The structures show that Mediator undergoes reorganization during PIC-Mediator assembly, sandwiches and facilitates phosphorylation of Pol II CTD, and works with TFIID to organize TFIIH in PIC for transcription initiation.

    "abstract": "Defining tumor cell immune evasion Mouse models used to study cancer often lack a full immune system, allowing implantation of human tumors into the mice. By contrast, naturally evolving tumors must contend with a fully functional immune system and its destruction of some of the cells (see the Perspective by Ho and Wood). Two groups now report studies on mouse models with a fully intact immune system. Martin et al . started with preexisting murine tumor cell lines and examined their continued evolution in vivo, whereas Del Poggetto et al . examined the development of new pancreatic tumors in the context of inflammation, as is often seen in human patients. In each study, the authors found that the immune system exerted a selective pressure on cells that would give rise to tumors, promoting the survival of those that had lost expression of tumor suppressor genes or activated a specific oncogene. The findings suggest a major role for the immune system in driving tumor evolution across multiple types of cancer. \u2014YN",

    "abstract": "Eradicating the last vestiges of HIV After treatment with antiretroviral therapy, HIV-1 wild-type and escape variants can persist in a latent form, especially within CD4 + T cells, hindering efforts to eradicate the virus. Q. Wang et al. found that human CARD8, a member of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)\u2013containing family of innate immune sensors, is activatable by direct proteolysis of its N-terminus by HIV-1 protease. This cleavage should result in the programmed cell death of infected cells, but HIV-1 protease remains inactive and undetected as a subunit of the unprocessed Gag-Pol polyprotein. However, when infected cells were treated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, intracellular Gag-Pol dimerization was enhanced, resulting in CARD8-mediated caspase activation and pyroptosis. Targeting this pathway may be a promising way to eliminate residual HIV-1 in patients. Science , this issue p. eabe1707",

Scheller et al. propose that water could instead have been incorporated into minerals in the planet's crust, which were later buried (see the Perspective by Kurokawa).

The competent cells display higher levels of chromatin factors such as the protein ATAD2 compared with the less competent ones.

Synaptic plasticity underlies learning and plays a critical role in memory consolidation. However, it remains largely unknown where and when synaptic plasticity occurs and how it shapes the neuronal representation. Goto et al . developed a new tool for controlling early structural long-term potentiation (sLTP). By selectively manipulating sLTP, the authors showed that the local circuitry in hippocampal area CA1 is required for memory formation shortly after the encoding event. The local circuitry is also important for offline memory consolidation within 24 hours. The anterior cingulate cortex, another brain region directly connected with area CA1, is crucial for memory consolidation during sleep on the second night. \u2014PRS",

This self-organized toroidal texture is aligned perpendicularly to the axis of the polymer chains, allowing the authors to demonstrate selective absorption of infrared radiation and manipulation of terahertz radiation. This distinct structure in a polymer could be of interest for exploring and using other exotic effects. Science , this issue p. 1050 ; see also p. 992",

Cas9 is directed by RNA guides to cut matching viral DNA. Jiao et al. discovered that RNA guides can also originate from cellular RNAs unassociated with viral defense (see the Perspective by Abudayyeh and Gootenberg). They rendered this process programmable, linking the presence of virtually any RNA to cutting of matching DNA by Cas9. This capability is the basis of a new CRISPR diagnostic method developed by the authors that can detect many biomarkers at once. Named LEOPARD, this method can detect, for example, RNAs from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and other viruses, thereby translating a new CRISPR discovery into a powerful diagnostic tool.

    "abstract": "Jump starting pathogen evolution Mycobacteria are mostly environmental saprotrophs, but during human history, some have become our pathogens. In the past 50 years or so, intractable and virulent infections of Mycobacterium abscessus have emerged in people with cystic fibrosis. Bryant et al. investigated how these mycobacteria have evolved into human pathogens so quickly (see the Perspective by Brugha and Spencer). Chronic infections in the lung offer plenty of evolutionary scope for the emergence of virulent clones after horizontal gene transfer and hypermutation. Pathogens are acquired by environmental contamination, which leaves open a window for clinical control because the most virulent clones survive poorly outside the body. Therefore, immediate treatment and enhanced infection-control measures for M. abscessus cases could reduce opportunities for the evolution of direct person-to-person transmission.

Crystallization and chirality have been entangled since Pasteur's observations on chiral tartaric acid crystals, yet there is still limited understanding of how chiral compounds form chiral crystal morphologies.

Ben-Moshe et al. examined chiral nanocrystals of tellurium grown from solution using various electron microscopy and diffraction techniques (see the Perspective by Popov). They found that screw dislocation- mediated growth is responsible for chiral polyhedral shape formation, and chiral crystals can thus form even in the presence of achiral ligands.

The mouse Pvf3 ortholog, PDGFcc, was similarly required to store fat in newborn and adult mice. When PDGFcc was blocked or deleted, food intake and absorption were normal, but mice increased their energy expenditure partly due to enhanced brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. PDGFcc was produced exclusively by fat-resident macrophages rather than by those mediating inflammation and insulin resistance.

Using intravital imaging of mouse peritoneal cavities, Zindel et al. report that GATA6 + macrophages rapidly assemble clot-like structures in a process strongly analogous to thrombosis (see the Perspective by Herrick and Allen). The formation of these aggregates requires the expression of macrophage scavenger receptor domains and acts to plug wounds and promote healing. This pathway can be inadvertently activated during medical procedures, when macrophage aggregates can promote the generation of abdominal scar tissue known as adhesions. Inhibition of macrophage scavenger receptors may therefore be a useful therapeutic approach after surgeries that cause injury to body cavities. Science , this issue p. eabe0595 ; see also p. 993",

    "abstract": "Stopping the swarm Neutrophils play a major role in the early immune response and are recruited in large numbers into inflamed and infected tissues. By secreting chemoattractants that bind G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) on neighboring cells, neutrophils coordinate their behavior as a swarm. Less clear is how this auto-amplifying swarming activity is ultimately turned off. Kienle et al. show that desensitization of these GPCRs by the same chemoattractants by GPCR-kinase 2 (GRK2) is one way in which these swarms are shut down (see the Perspective by Rocha-Gregg and Huttenlocher). Unexpectedly, mice with GRK2-deficient neutrophils showed impaired rather than enhanced bacterial clearance. The heightened scanning ability of GRK2-deficient neutrophils may come at the cost of suboptimal phagocytosis and containment of bacteria.

    "abstract": "Mapping protein interactions driving cancer Cancer is a genetic disease, and much cancer research is focused on identifying carcinogenic mutations and determining how they relate to disease progression. Three papers demonstrate how mutations are processed through networks of protein interactions to promote cancer (see the Perspective by Cheng and Jackson). Swaney et al . focus on head and neck cancer and identify cancer-enriched interactions, demonstrating how point mutant\u2013dependent interactions of PIK3CA, a kinase frequently mutated in human cancers, are predictive of drug response. Kim et al . focus on breast cancer and identify two proteins functionally connected to the tumor-suppressor gene BRCA1 and two proteins that regulate PIK3CA. Zheng et al . developed a statistical model that identifies protein networks that are under mutation pressure across different cancer types, including a complex bringing together PIK3CA with actomyosin proteins.

Now, Modhiran et al. and Biering et al. describe two different antibodies that bind to the flavivirus NS1 protein and prevent it from disrupting epithelial cells, which is associated with severe disease. Both antibodies cross-react with multiple flavivirus NS1 proteins. The antibodies reduce viremia and increase survival in mouse models of flavivirus disease.

Although severe dengue symptoms are associated with increased levels of afucosylated IgG1 glycoforms, it is unclear whether this is simply a result of the infection or if it is a preexisting phenomenon that can dictate susceptibility to this disease. Bournazos et al. studied the Fab and Fc structures of anti-DENV antibodies from patients before and after infection and with variable disease outcomes (see the Perspective by de Alwis and Ooi). They found that DENV infection induced specific increases in IgG1 afucosylation, and levels of afucosylated IgG1 could indeed predict dengue disease severity, making IgG1 fucosylation status a potentially useful prognostic tool for the treatment of dengue patients.

The pluripotency factor Oct4 is required for the expansion of CNCC developmental potential to form facial mesenchyme. Analysis of the chromatin landscape of Oct4 + CNCC precursors showed that these cells resemble those of epiblast stem cells, with additional features suggestive of future priming for neural crest programs. Thus, to expand their cellular potency, CNCC precursors undergo a natural in vivo reprogramming event. Science , this issue p. eabb4776",

By comparing endocasts, representations of the inner surface of fossil brain cases, from early Homo from Africa, Georgia, and Southeast Asia, they show that these structural innovations emerged later than the first dispersal of the genus from Africa, and were probably in place by 1.7 to 1.5 million years ago. The modern humanlike brain organization emerged in cerebral regions thought to be related to toolmaking, social cognition, and language. Their findings suggest that brain reorganization was not a prerequisite for dispersals from Africa, and that there might have been more than one long-range dispersal of early Homo .

They chose these two species to compare, respectively, birds that do and do not display food-caching behavior. Place cells and typical hippocampal firing patterns that resembled rodent neuronal activity could be detected in the extreme memory specialists. Compared with titmice, however, spatial activity was noticeably weaker and less abundant in zebra finches. These findings provide evidence that the neural processes underlying spatial memory are remarkably conserved across widely divergent hippocampal circuits separated by millions of years of evolution.

    "abstract": "Vaccines get a help-MAIT Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a T cell subset important for mucosal homeostasis. These cells recognize derivatives of microbiota-derived vitamin B2 precursors but can also be activated by certain cytokines in the context of viral infections. Provine et al. report that a leading adenoviral vector vaccine, ChAdOx1, activated MAIT cells in immunized mice (see the Perspective by Juno and O'Connor). This activation required interferon-\u03b1 produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells as well as monocyte-derived interleukin-18 and tumor necrosis factor. MAIT cell activation positively correlated with vaccine-mediated T cell responses in human subjects, and mice deficient in MAIT cells showed impaired CD8 + T cell immunity to target antigens after vaccination. This work suggests an additional pathway that could be exploited to enhance the efficacy of vaccines. Science , this issue p. 521 ; see also p. 460",

Poirier et al. demonstrate that mammalian stem cells can protect themselves from some RNA viruses by expressing an alternatively spliced isoform of the enzyme Dicer called aviD, which potentiates antiviral RNA interference (see the Perspective by Shahrudin and Ding). aviD acts by cleaving long, base-paired viral RNAs to generate small interfering RNAs that direct the sequence-specific cleavage of homologous viral RNAs. This process is reminiscent of that in insects and worms, which also use Dicer-dependent RNA interference in antiviral defense, and contrasts with mammalian differentiated cells, which generally rely on the interferon system to combat virus infection.

Phenazines are commonly considered to be antibiotics, but they can also participate in environmental redox reactions, especially with iron. McRose and Newman found that phenazines, when added exogenously or made by bacteria in situ, can liberate phosphorous (P) in the form of phosphate from mineral surfaces, and that the production of these molecules is regulated by signaling pathways that respond to P limitation. Strains unable to produce these molecules grew more slowly under P limitation but could be rescued by the addition of exogenous phenazines. The authors hypothesize that reductive dissolution of iron oxides has the benefit of liberating P, and that this could be one mechanism of microbial P acquisition in some environments.

    "abstract": "Estimating resilience in complex systems Resilience is an important concept in the study of critical transitions and tipping points in complex systems and is defined by the size of the disturbance that a system can endure before tipping into an alternative stable state. Nevertheless, resilience has proved resistant to measurement. Arani et al. show how the mathematical concept of mean exit time, the time it takes for a system to cross a threshold, can help to solve this problem and characterize the resilience of complex systems. They derived a model approach to estimate exit time from time series data and applied it to examples from a grazed plant population model, lake cyanobacterial data, and Pleistocene-Holocene climate data. This approach may improve our understanding of the dynamical properties of complex systems under threat. Science , aay4895, this issue p. eaay4895",

The \u03c3-hole gives rise to the halogen-bonding mechanism, which is well known in supramolecular chemistry despite its existence being confirmed only indirectly. Mallada et al . developed Kelvin probe force microscopy with a specifically functionalized tip and report direct real-space visualization of the \u03c3-hole, revealing its strong anisotropic charge distribution.

Kolora et al . sequenced and performed a genomic analysis of 88 rockfish species, including long-read sequencing of the genomes of six species (see the Perspective by Lu et al .). From this analysis, the authors unmasked the genetic drivers of longevity evolution, including immunity and DNA repair\u2013related pathways. Copy number expansion in the butyrophilin gene family was shown to be positively associated with life span, and population historical dynamics and life histories correlated differently between long- and short-lived species.

Public health institutions will need early warning of any uptick in cases to prepare and deploy interventions as required. Riley et al. developed a community-wide program that was designed to detect resurgence at low prevalence and has been used to track SARS-CoV-2 virus across England. In the four rounds of sampling from May to September 2020, almost 600,000 people representative of all communities were monitored. The results revealed the greatest prevalence among 18- to 24-year-olds, with increasing incidence among older age groups and elevated odds of infection among some communities. This testing approach offers a model for the type of real-time, country-wide population-based surveillance work that needs to be conducted to monitor SARS-CoV-2.

It is critical that this process happens at the right times and for the right genes in cells, because disruptions cause diseases such as cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders. Mashtalir et al. uncovered molecular cues that direct complex activities on chromatin, informing specific interactions that may be amenable to therapeutic targeting.

The effect could be used to simplify infrared spectroscopy, possibly with single-molecule sensitivity. \u2014ISO",

This phenomenon also might affect the global cycles of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and trace metals in the oceans. Raven et al. show how ocean anoxia affects microbial sulfur processing in sinking marine particles. They observed cryptic microbial sulfate reduction, which forms organic sulfur that is resistant to acid hydrolysis, a process that could enhance carbon preservation in sediments underlying oxygen-deficient water columns. This may help explain some of the more extreme episodes of organic carbon preservation associated with marine anoxia in Earth's history. Science , this issue p. 178",

    "abstract": "A lipid-protein autoimmunity target Several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome, are characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). These molecules can activate the complement and coagulation cascades, which contributes to pathologies such as thrombosis, stroke, and pregnancy complications. M\u00fcller-Calleja et al. found that endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) in complex with lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) is the cell-surface target for aPL and mediates its internalization (see the Perspective by Kaplan). aPL binding to EPCR-LBPA resulted in the activation of tissue factor\u2013mediated coagulation and interferon-\u03b1 production by dendritic cells. Interferon-\u03b1, in turn, fueled the expansion of B1a cells, which secrete aPLs. The specific blockade of this target in mice inhibited the development of aPL autoimmunity, offering hope for future therapies for these conditions.

To better understand this process, Reid et al. developed Repair-seq, a method to locate DNA repair within the genome of stem cell\u2013derived neurons. DNA repair hotspots (DRHs) were more likely to occur within specific genomic features such as gene bodies as well as in genomic formations, open chromatin, and active regulatory regions. This method showed that repair was enriched at sites involved in neuronal function and identity. Furthermore, proteomic data indicated that genes in DRHs are enriched in Alzheimer's disease and that DRHs are more active in aging. These observations link neuronal DNA repair to aging and neurodegeneration. Science , this issue p. 91",

CTLs are particularly effective because they can sequentially kill multiple targets in a process called serial killing. Lisci et al . have identified mitochondria as important regulators of CTL killing. Mice lacking the deubiquitinase USP30 have CTLs acutely depleted of mitochondria, and these cells have reduced killing ability but normal motility, signaling, and secretion. Surprisingly, the mitochondria\u2019s metabolic functions were not required for this process. Rather, mitochondrial translation proved indispensable for CTL cytolytic protein synthesis and sustained CTL killing. \u2014STS",

They used gas and dust emission to measure its kinematics, and then modeled the mass distribution within the galaxy. The authors found that the galaxy contains a massive stellar bulge and a regularly rotating disk, features that models predict take billions of years to form.

Lezmy et al . examined the effects of adenosine on the functional properties of myelinated axons. They observed activity-dependent calcium rise in astrocyte processes, calcium-triggered ATP release from astrocytes, activation of adenosine receptors in the axon initial segment and the nodes of Ranvier, increased cyclic AMP concentration, activation of HCN2 channels, and depolarization of axons by 5 to 10 millivolts. This molecular pathway enabled astrocytes to increase the excitability of pyramidal neurons and to profoundly decrease the axonal conduction velocity. Astrocytes thus control signaling speed in myelinated axons. \u2014PRS",

Cooper et al. created a precisely dated radiocarbon record around the time of the Laschamps geomagnetic reversal about 41,000 years ago from the rings of New Zealand swamp kauri trees. This record reveals a substantial increase in the carbon-14 content of the atmosphere culminating during the period of weakening magnetic field strength preceding the polarity switch. The authors modeled the consequences of this event and concluded that the geomagnetic field minimum caused substantial changes in atmospheric ozone concentration that drove synchronous global climate and environmental shifts.

Around 6 months after the primary two-dose vaccine series, a third boost vaccination resulted in higher neutralizing antibody levels against VOCs in nonhuman primates.

Cornejo et al . used an array of techniques to investigate the degree of voltage attenuation by dendritic spine necks in pyramidal neurons of the mouse neocortex. Spines not only synchronously depolarized in response to backpropagating action potentials, but local and transient depolarization also occurred. Isolated depolarization in individual spines reflected localized synaptic activation. A significant voltage gradient between dendritic spine and dendrite indicated that spines may constitute elementary electric compartments. The spine neck resistance is thus not negligible and may substantially contribute to the regulation of synaptic efficacy in the central nervous system. \u2014PRS",

Now, Modhiran et al. and Biering et al. describe two different antibodies that bind to the flavivirus NS1 protein and prevent it from disrupting epithelial cells, which is associated with severe disease. Both antibodies cross-react with multiple flavivirus NS1 proteins. The antibodies reduce viremia and increase survival in mouse models of flavivirus disease.

Conversely, when there is upstream ice thickening, a transition to catastrophic collapse can occur. Science , abf6271, this issue p. 1342 ; see also abj3266, p. 1266",

Barsbai et al. compared more than 300 such foraging human populations with mammal and bird species living in the same environment across a wide array of environmental conditions (see the Perspective by Hill and Boyd). They found that all three groups converged with regard to foraging, social, and reproductive behaviors.

Dixon et al. performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in human embryonic stem cells to identify DNA methylation regulators (see the Perspective by Gu and Goodell). A top screen hit, QSER1, proved to be essential for maintaining low methylation at DNA methylation valleys, which overlap with developmental genes and broad H3K27me3 and EZH2 peaks. Mechanistic examination revealed that QSER1 and the demethylating enzyme TET1 cooperate to safeguard developmental programs from de novo methylation by the enzyme DNMT3.

They propose a model by which the thymidine analog IdU promotes binding of the base excision repair protein AP endonuclease to DNA, thereby inducing helical distortion of DNA and modulating transcriptional bursting. Such modulation of noise enhanced reprogramming of the embryonic stem cells. Thus, variation in gene expression noise could influence developmental or disease processes. \u2014LBR",

Assembly and budding are driven by a polyprotein called Gag, which consists of a matrix domain (MA) that is recruited to the plasma membrane, a capsid domain (CA) responsible for self-assembly, and a nucleocapsid domain (NC) that recruits the viral RNA genome. Gag cleavage results in a structural rearrangement that produces the mature virion. Qu et al . imaged mature and immature HIV particles by electron tomography and focused in on the MA domain (see the Perspective by Hikichi and Freed). They found that MA rearranges between two distinct hexameric lattices, and mature MA modulates the viral membrane by binding to a membrane lipid. This finding suggests that MA may play functional roles in the mature virion. \u2014VV",

In response to heavy poaching by armed forces, African elephant populations in Gorongosa National Park declined by 90%. As the population recovered after the war, a relatively large proportion of females were born tuskless. Further exploration revealed this trait to be sex linked and related to specific genes that generated a tuskless phenotype more likely to survive in the face of poaching. \u2014SNV",

There have been many calls for police reform, a process that in many countries has taken the form of increased police engagement with communities. Blair et al . report the results of a large-scale experiment testing the effectiveness of this approach across six countries in the Southern Hemisphere (see the Perspective by Tobon). They found that such community engagement did not increase trust in the police and it did not reduce crime. Improving relationships between police and community may require deeper structural changes before or in addition to approaches such as community policing. \u2014SNV",

    "abstract": "An IFN-\u03b3 feedback loop Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play important roles in tissue homeostasis and host defense. Type 1 ILCs (ILC1s) produce interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and require the transcriptional master regulator T-bet. The pathways underlying how these cells develop and differentiate have remained poorly understood. Bai et al. found that the adult mouse liver contains a population of Lin\u2013Sca-1 + Mac-1 + hematopoietic stem cells (LSM HSCs) that preferentially differentiate into tissue-resident liver ILC1s. They further show that IFN-\u03b3 produced by mature ILC1s promotes the expansion and differentiation of LSM HSCs into ILC1s but not natural killer cells. This work expands our understanding of extramedullary hematopoiesis and underscores the unique immune status of the liver. Science , this issue p. eaba4177",

However, very little is known about the neural representations that underlie the coding of such large spaces.

Many place cells had multiple place fields within this large environment. The place field sizes ranged from less than 1 meter up to 32 meters, and the sizes of the different place fields of an individual cell varied as much as 20-fold. Studying animals under naturalistic conditions can reveal new coding principles for the representation of their environment in the brain.

If such an experiment were done with a superfluid, it would decouple from the vessel and would not contribute to rotation. Tanzi et al. studied an intermediate case, a supersolid, which is predicted to only partially decouple, resulting in a moment of inertia smaller than the classical value. Whereas previous such experiments were done with helium, the authors used a gas of highly magnetic dysprosium atoms in an optical trapping potential that was suddenly changed, causing the gas to oscillate. Measuring the frequency of these oscillations provides evidence for a reduced moment of inertia. Science , this issue p. 1162",

Chang et al. show that a collection of graphene oxide fibers can fuse into a single stronger fiber upon immersion in a solvent, extraction, and drying under tension (see the Perspective by Cruz-Silva and El\u00edas). The geometrical deformation of the fibers during drying and swelling plays an important role in the reversible cycles, with a large volume change between the dried and swelled fibers. Moreover, fibers made from polymers, glass, metal, or silk can be given these abilities when coated with a micron-sized layer of graphene oxide. Science , this issue p. 614 ; see also p. 573",

Sequencing and analyses of these ancient viruses suggested a common ancestor between 12,000 and 20,000 years ago. There is no evidence indicating that HBV was present in the earliest humans as they spread out of Africa; however, HBV was likely present in human populations before farming. Furthermore, the virus was present in the Americas by about 9000 years ago, representing a lineage sister to the viral strains found in Eurasia that diverged about 20,000 years ago. \u2014LMZ",

    "abstract": "Cleansing the cytosol Most human cells, not just those belonging to the immune system, mount protective responses to infection when activated by the immune cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3). How IFN-\u03b3 confers this function in nonimmune cells and tissues is poorly understood. Gaudet et al. used genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to identify apolipoprotein L-3 (APOL3) as an IFN-\u03b3\u2013induced bactericidal protein that protects human epithelium, endothelium, and fibroblasts against infection (see the Perspective by Nathan). APOL3 directly targets bacteria in the host cell cytosol and kills them by dissolving their anionic membranes into lipoprotein complexes. This work reveals a detergent-like mechanism enlisted during human cell-autonomous immunity to combat intracellular pathogens. Science , abf8113, this issue p. eabf8113 ; see also abj5637, p. 276",

    "abstract": "Infections with many Gram-negative pathogens, including Escherichia coli , Salmonella , Shigella , and Yersinia , rely on type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors. We hypothesized that while hijacking processes within mammalian cells, the effectors operate as a robust network that can tolerate substantial contractions. This was tested in vivo using the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (encoding 31 effectors). Sequential gene deletions showed that effector essentiality for infection was context dependent and that the network could tolerate 60% contraction while maintaining pathogenicity. Despite inducing very different colonic cytokine profiles (e.g., interleukin-22, interleukin-17, interferon-\u03b3, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), different networks induced protective immunity. Using data from >100 distinct mutant combinations, we built and trained a machine learning model able to predict colonization outcomes, which were confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, reproducing the human-restricted enteropathogenic E. coli effector repertoire in C. rodentium was not sufficient for efficient colonization, which implicates effector networks in host adaptation. These results unveil the extreme robustness of both T3SS effector networks and host responses.",

    "abstract": "Biosynthesis and replication, from A to Z Four nucleobases. adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T), are usually thought to be invariable in DNA. In bacterial viruses, however, each of the DNA bases have variations that help them to escape degradation by bacterial restriction enzymes. In the genome of cyanophage S-2L, A is completely replaced by diaminopurine (Z), which forms three hydrogen bonds with T and thus creates non\u2013Watson-Crick base pairing in the DNA of this virus (see the Perspective by Grome and Isaacs). Zhou et al. and Sleiman et al. determined the biochemical pathway that produces Z, which revealed more Z genomes in viruses hosted in bacteria distributed widely in the environment and phylogeny. Pezo et al. identified a DNA polymerase that incorporates Z into DNA while rejecting A. These findings enrich our understanding of biodiversity and expand the genetic palette for synthetic biology.

    "abstract": "Making sense of TCR\u2013pMHC topology Most T cells use a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes major histocompatibility complex molecules bound to peptides (pMHCs) derived from both self- and foreign antigens. Although there is great variability in the interface because of the diversity of both partners, this interaction displays a canonical docking topology for reasons that remain contested. Zareie et al. tested an assortment of both canonical and reversed-polarity TCRs that were all specific for the same cognate pMHC-I bearing a peptide derived from influenza A virus (IAV) (see the Perspective by Horkova and Stepanek). The authors determined that docking topology was the primary driver of in vivo T cell activation and recruitment when mice were infected with IAV. The canonical topology was required for the formation of a functional signaling complex, suggesting that T cell signaling constraints dictate how TCR and pMHC meet.

Susila et al . now show that FT, which is produced in leaf cells, can be held in reserve if ambient temperatures are not favorable (see the Perspective by Jaillais and Parcy). At low temperatures, FT binds a membrane phosopholipid and is thus restricted in mobility. At higher temperatures, such binding is less favored, and FT is released to mobilize into the shoot apical meristem to drive flowering. Thus, temperature-sensitive lipid binding helps the plant time flowering with favorable ambient temperatures. \u2014PJH",

Li et al. identified previously unnoticed toxin-antitoxin RNA pairs embedded within diverse CRISPR-Cas loci. The antitoxin RNA mimics a CRISPR RNA and repurposes the CRISPR immunity effector to transcriptionally repress a toxin RNA that would otherwise arrest cell growth by sequestering a rare transfer RNA. These small RNAs thus form a symbiosis with CRISPR, rendering CRISPR addictive to the host despite its fitness cost. These findings reveal how CRISPR-Cas can operate as a selfish genetic element.

Cryo\u2013electron microscopy of the final design and intermediates revealed a stepwise expansion in size, enabled by destabilizing amino acid substitutions and a domain swap that results in a change of oligomerization interfaces for the base units of the cage. In addition to altering the protein, directed evolution resulted in changes to the encoding RNA structure that enabled efficient uptake versus other cellular RNAs.

In artificially designed metamaterials and in anisotropic layered materials, the dispersion can be hyperbolic, giving rise to subwavelength confinement of the light. Sternbach et al. show that the hyperbolic dispersion can be optically switched on and off on demand in the layered transition metal dichalcogenide tungsten diselenide (see the Perspective by Deng and Chen). Illuminating the material with ultrafast pulses of sub-bandgap light creates a transient waveguide, resulting in hyperbolic dispersion in the material. The ability to tune the dispersion characteristics on demand using optical pumping is an effective approach for developing ultrafast switching photonic devices and controlling the propagation of light on the nanoscale.

Its dynamic structure is regulated by allosteric factors including phosphorylation and binding of nucleotides and metabolites. Yan et al. developed conformation-specific antibodies that trap AMPK in a fully inactive state that has experienced a large, domain-level rotation. Biophysical experiments in cells and in vitro are consistent with the structural work and support a model in which the activation loop is fully exposed in the completely inactive, dephosphorylated state. These structures inform our understanding of the complex allosteric behavior in this crucial metabolic regulator. Science , abe7565, this issue p. 413",

In a behavioral experiment, they showed that learning a novel task that involves the use of a tool also improves performance in a complex language task. These results further support the hypothesis of a coevolution of tool use and language. \u2014PRS",

There are indications that the differential efficacy of the brain serotonin (5-HT) system may be involved in the vulnerability to drug addiction. However, the relevant circuits and underlying cellular processes remain elusive. Li et al . discovered a synaptic mechanism in mice that underlies the modulatory role of 5-HT in reducing the likelihood of transition to compulsion and eventually addiction (see the Perspective by Miyazaki and Miyazaki). Cocaine binds to 5-HT transporters to block 5-HT reuptake. The elevated extracellular 5-HT activates 5-HT 1B receptors and causes presynaptic depression of a projection from the orbitofrontal cortex to the dorsal striatum. These changes reduce the likelihood of inducing postsynaptic potentiation at these synapses, which ultimately drives compulsion. \u2014PRS",

Morton et al. analyzed papillary thyroid tumors, normal thyroid tissue, and blood from hundreds of survivors of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and compared them against those of unexposed patients. The findings offer insight into the process of radiation-induced carcinogenesis and characteristic patterns of DNA damage associated with environmental radiation exposure. In a separate study, Yeager et al. analyzed the genomes of 130 children and parents from families in which one or both parents had experienced gonadal radiation exposure related to the Chernobyl accident and the children were conceived between 1987 and 2002.

Removing most of the thermal vibrations\u2014or phonons\u2014such that the object reaches its motional quantum ground state has been achieved but typically with tiny, nanoscale objects. Using the suspended mirrors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) that form a 10-kg optomechanical oscillator, Whittle et al. demonstrate the ability to cool such a large-scale object to nearly the motional ground state. An upgrade to LIGO with such a modification could increase its sensitivity and range to gravitational waves but also extend studies of quantum mechanics to large-scale objects.

    "abstract": "AMPlifying type 2 immunity Antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) are a frontline defense against pathogenic microorganisms at mucosal surfaces. These cationic molecules inactivate their targets primarily by disrupting cell walls and membranes. Hu et al . found that small proline-rich protein 2A (SPRR2A) is a bactericidal protein produced in the gut that targets Gram-positive bacteria and is phylogenetically distinct from all other known AMPs (see the Perspective by Harris and Wickramasinghe). SPRR2A production is selectively enhanced by type 2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 and -13 that are elicited by helminth infection. Mice lacking SPRR2A are unable to prevent intestinal bacteria from invading the intestinal barrier after helminths damage the intestinal epithelium. SPRR2A is thus a critical component of type 2 immunity that protects against the bacterial invasion and dissemination that follow helminth infection. \u2014STS",

An increasing number of GPCR structures provide insight into function. However, the dynamics that link extracellular sensing to intracellular signaling are not completely understood, because GPCRs used in structure determination are generally modified to constrain their dynamics. Josephs et al. succeeded in determining the structures of an unmodified calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide receptor, which is implicated in migraines, both alone and bound to its neuropeptide ligand. Based on the structures and data from complementary biophysical techniques, they show that initial binding of the peptide causes only minor conformational changes of the GPCR, but dynamically causes changes at the intracellular side that facilitate G protein binding and activation.

    "abstract": "A cellular cholesterol sensor Cholesterol levels in cells are controlled by the sterol regulatory element\u2013binding protein (SREBP) pathway. When the cell has sufficient cholesterol, the transcription factor that regulates cholesterol metabolism is sequestered at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, but when cholesterol is depleted, the transcription factor is released to activate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake. Yan et al. determined the structure of a central complex in human SREBP containing the proteins Scap and Insig-2. These two membrane-embedded proteins undergo 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC)\u2013dependent association and must dissociate for the pathway to be activated. The structure shows that 25HC is sandwiched between Scap and Insig-2 to facilitate their association. A mutational analysis is consistent with the structural model. Science , this issue p. eabb2224",

Today, practices such as fines, fees, forfeitures, prison charges, and bail premiums transfer billions of dollars from oppressed communities to governments and corporations. Guided by scholarship on racial capitalism, we argue that to understand how and why criminal justice operates as it does today, one must attend to its predatory dimensions. Analytically and politically, the concept of predation connects diverse forms of criminal legal takings to one another, to the extractive regimes of earlier eras, and to contemporary businesses that financially exploit subjugated communities. Analyses that focus on predatory relations encourage a reconsideration of some dominant understandings in the study of criminal justice today.",

Chen et al. overcame these issues with ptychography, a technique that uses coherent scattering and multiple overlapping illumination spots to reconstruct an image from far-field diffraction patterns. This method works at a resolution that is limited, not by optics, but rather by the scattering strength of the sample, so it can work better with thicker samples. The authors achieved ultimate lateral resolution better than the thermal vibration of atoms in a PrScO 3 sample and showed that it is theoretically possible to identify single dopant atoms.

    "abstract": "A mind\u2019s-eye view of others Social interaction among groups of individuals is a complex proposition. Not only must an animal keep track of various vocalizations and direct interactions in the present but likely also their knowledge of every other individual and their history of interaction with that individual. Two papers begin to unravel the neuronal process by which such complexities are managed (see the Perspective by Sliwa). B\u00e1ez-Mendoza et al . tracked the interactional dynamics among three Rhesus macaques and found that neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex represent details of the interaction, such as identity, context, and interaction history. Rose et al . remotely recorded from freely interacting Egyptian fruit bats and similarly found coordinated neural activity among individuals, a relationship between brain activity patterns and social preference, and that single neurons in the prefrontal cortex distinguished between the vocalizations of specific individuals. Together these papers reveal clear evidence for neuronal encoding of social interaction and identity. \u2014SNV",

Oxides, halides, and chalcogenides all have large numbers of perovskite structured materials. Examples of perovskite nitrides are conspicuously absent, but Talley et al . managed to synthesize one (see the Perspective by Hong). Lanthanum tungsten nitride in the perovskite structure turns out to be piezoelectric, which is ideal for a variety of applications. Perovskite structured nitrides are very attractive because they could easily integrate with the large number of nitride-based semiconducting devices already in use. \u2014BG",

However, crosstalk and interference between different modes of the individual lasers are generally detrimental to performance, leading to instabilities, and could ultimately be damaging to the laser cavities. Qiao et al. worked with the mathematical framework of supersymmetry, a theory developed in high-energy physics to attempt to describe the makeup and properties of particles, to design a stable two-dimensional laser array. Based on symmetry arguments, the method is scalable and could prove to be a practical platform with which to design and develop complex photonic systems. Science , this issue p. 403",

Bang et al . identified LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a myeloid cell surface receptor for retinol. LRP1 binds retinol chaperoned by serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins, and SAA\u2013retinol complexes are then endocytosed and metabolized by myeloid cells. Mice lacking either Saa or myeloid-specific Lrp1 exhibited profound impairments in vitamin A\u2013mediated immunity.

In addition to the established superconducting qubits, topological qubits may one day be realized in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures. The superconductor most widely used in this context is aluminum, in which processes that cause decoherence are suppressed. Pendharkar et al. go beyond this paradigm to show that superconducting tin can be used in place of aluminum (see the Perspective by Fatemi and Devoret). The authors grew nanowires of indium antimonide, which is a semiconductor, and coated them with a thin layer of tin without using cumbersome epitaxial growth techniques. This process creates a well-defined, \u201chard\u201d superconducting gap in the nanowires, which is a prerequisite for using them as the basis for a potential topological qubit.

Self-replicating RNAs known as replicons have long been used to study pathogenic RNA viruses; however, developing replicons to study SARS-SoV-2 has been challenging because of its large genome. Ricardo-Lax et al . used a yeast-based system to construct SARS-CoV-2 replicons that cannot assemble infectious virus because they lack the spike protein required for host cell entry. Transfecting cells with a spike-expressing plasmid and separately with the replicon generates replicon delivery particles (RDPs) that are only capable of one cycle of infection. The replicons and the RDPs can be used in different contexts for drug screening, and viral assays. \u2014VV",

One side effect of this process is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). These molecules potentiate T cell receptor (TCR) signaling but can also result in detrimental oxidative stress (see the Perspective by Su and Dutta). Yue et al. describe one mechanism by which T cells can resolve this contradiction. Using mice with a T cell-specific deficiency in Schlafen 2 (SLFN2), they found that this protein binds to and protects transfer RNAs from oxidative stress-induced cleavage by the ribonuclease angiogenin. This process is downstream of ROS generation, which allows activated T cells to maintain protein synthesis despite the ROS that would otherwise inhibit translation.

The analysis is based on metabarcoding data from 129 stations in several oceanic provinces worldwide.

Male mosquitoes show species-specific swarming behaviors at certain times of the day to attract females for mating. Wang et al. found that transcriptional patterns of metabolic and immune function genes apparently showed a diurnal rhythm that correlated with the physiological demands of mating flight swarming (see the Perspective by Manoukis). By altering temperature and light regimes and by knocking out the master genes period and timeless for circadian clock regulation, the authors disrupted mating flight behavior in a combination of cage experiments and enclosed field conditions. Knocking out the rhythmically expressed desaturase enzyme reduced cuticular hydrocarbon pheromone production and limited mating success. These key interacting components of the diurnal regulation of mosquito mating behavior are potential targets for alternative malaria control strategies.

With development, an overabundance of synapses is winnowed down to refine efficiently connected circuits. Inactive synapses are prime targets for elimination, whereas active synapses tend to be retained. Gomez-Castro et al . took a closer look at how those choices are made (see the Perspective by Blum and Lopes). When postsynaptic adenosine receptors are muted or do not find enough extracellular adenosine, synapses get eliminated. Neurotransmitter-dependent signaling pathways drive protein kinase A to phosphorylate the postsynaptic scaffolding molecule gephyrin. Together with a partner synaptogenic membrane protein, gephyrin is required for the stabilization of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptors. Adenosine receptors thus detect synaptic activity and in turn drive the stabilization of synapses that produce such activity. \u2014PJH",

Theoretical calculations suggest several possibilities for the 5/2 ground state and associated topological order but distinguishing among them experimentally is tricky. Dutta et al . developed a method for doing so by interfacing a region in the 5/2 state with a region at an integer filling, and the measurements provided support for the particle-hole Pfaffian order.

    "abstract": "Down with leukemia Down syndrome is a congenital disorder caused by the trisomy of chromosome 21, and it is associated with a greatly increased risk of leukemia with origins in fetal development. Infants with Down syndrome are often born with a preleukemic condition, which later resolves in most cases. By using gene-edited human cells implanted into mouse models, Wagenblast et al. recapitulated the development of preleukemia and leukemia in the context of Down syndrome (see the Perspective by Roberts and Vyas). A specific mutation triggered a preleukemic condition in the context of trisomy 21 as expected, but progression to full-blown leukemia required a different genetic path and was not dependent on trisomy 21.

    "abstract": "Target site selection in CAST systems Exciting genomic engineering possibilities exist for natural integration systems called transposons, which have co-opted CRISPR/Cas systems. An unexplained feature of these systems involves how they direct insertions in a single orientation at a precise distance from the programmed target sequence. Park et al . show that orientation information is communicated to the transposase, TnsB, using the unidirectional growth of a helical filament made up of an AAA+ protein, TnsC. ATP hydrolysis trims the filament to a minimal unit that is marked by TniQ and defined by the Cas12k protein to provide spacing information. This finding may help future engineering of these systems for therapeutic applications. \u2014DJ",

Ogawa et al. show that Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 1 (Klf1/Eklf), a transcription factor well known for its role in red blood cell development, is an essential factor for heart regeneration in zebrafish. Klf1 is specifically expressed in cardiomyocytes after injury, and its activation is sufficient to stimulate new cardiomyocyte production without injury. This potent effect is achieved through reprogramming of gene networks regulating cardiomyocyte differentiation and mitochondrial metabolism. Science , this issue p. 201",

Many deleted or temperature-sensitive nonessential genes affected yeast fitness both positively and negatively under at least one of the environmental conditions tested. In these cases, up to 24% of yeast genes were affected. A minority of these differential interactions point to previously unknown genetic connections across functional networks, informing on how genetic architecture responds to environmental variation.

Protection was not mediated by eosinophils, regulatory T cells, or innate lymphoid cells. Rather, TLSP induced the migration of conventional T cells to sebaceous glands in the skin. Once there, these T cells promoted white adipose tissue loss by the hypersecretion of sebum, a lipid-rich substance that augments the skin\u2019s barrier function. This mechanism, which likely evolved to enhance cutaneous antimicrobial defenses, could be possibly targeted in future treatments for obesity. \u2014STS",

This RNA flavivirus exploits the presence of lower levels of heterotypic antibodies to infect immunoglobulin Fc\u03b3 receptor\u2013bearing cells. Many RNA viruses also exhibit antigenic variation, which classically allows evasion of immune responses. Katzelnick et al . investigated whether antigenic variation in DENV has a biological function in a virus that courts immune responses to enhance replication (see the Perspective by Rohani and Drake). Using antigenic cartography on a panel of more than 400 DENV1-4 subtype samples isolated in Bangkok, Thailand, the authors found that antigenic variation in virus populations oscillated between similarity and dissimilarity across subtypes over time, with outbreaks correlating with periods of antigenic dissimilarity within serotypes. This pattern may be at least in part a result of the conflicting evolutionary pressures of immune evasion and immune enhancement. \u2014CA",

One aspect of this change is to RNA expression and splicing isoforms, but how these differences affect tumor progression is not well characterized. Fish et al. developed a computational framework called pyTEISER that identifies structural cis-regulatory elements that control diverse types of RNA regulation. Applying pyTEISER to models of breast cancer metastasis, they discovered an RNA short-stem-loop element that forms a \u201cstructural splicing enhancer\u201d that acts in cis to regulate alternative splicing of RNA transcripts. One of these interactions encompasses the RNA-binding protein SNRPA1 and results in alternative exon inclusion that affects metastatic capacity in xenograft models. Thus, RNA element binding may play a role in splicing regulation and is potentially an important component of the cis-splicing code. Science , this issue p. eabc7531",

    "abstract": "A key complex in B cell activation A core component of the immune system are B cells, which are activated by infection and then mature to provide long-lived immunity. Activation is initiated when a cell surface B cell receptor, in association with its coreceptor, recognizes an antigen. Susa et al. report a structure of the B cell coreceptor signaling subunit CD19 in complex with CD81, a key regulator. CD81 alone binds to cholesterol, but the conformational changes associated with binding to CD19 occlude the cholesterol-binding pocket. Regulating cholesterol binding could play a role in the activation mechanism. The structure also provides a basis for the design of immunotherapies. Science , this issue p. 300",

    "abstract": "Moving targets of neurotoxins Proteases that cleave protein targets at specific sequences control many biological functions. The ability to reprogram proteases to cleave new sequences of our choosing would enable new therapeutic and biotechnological applications. Blum et al. report a laboratory evolution method to rapidly evolve proteases that cut new protein sequences and lose their ability to cut nontarget sequences (see the Perspective by Stenmark). Using this method, they evolved botulinum neurotoxin proteases, an important class of enzymes used in patients, to selectively cleave new targets, including a protein unrelated to those natively cleaved by these proteases. This work establishes a powerful approach to generate proteases with tailor-made specificities. Science , this issue p. 803 ; see also p. 782",

Lundgren et al. tested whether feral equids (horses and donkeys) reintroduced to desert regions in the North American southwest dig wells that provide ecosystem-level benefits. They found that equid-dug wells increased water availability, were used by a large number of species, and decreased distance between water sources. Abandoned wells also led to increased germination in key riparian tree species. Such equid-dug wells improve water availability, perhaps replacing a lost megafaunal function.

In bacterial viruses, however, each of the DNA bases have variations that help them to escape degradation by bacterial restriction enzymes. In the genome of cyanophage S-2L, A is completely replaced by diaminopurine (Z), which forms three hydrogen bonds with T and thus creates non\u2013Watson-Crick base pairing in the DNA of this virus (see the Perspective by Grome and Isaacs). Zhou et al. and Sleiman et al. determined the biochemical pathway that produces Z, which revealed more Z genomes in viruses hosted in bacteria distributed widely in the environment and phylogeny. Pezo et al. identified a DNA polymerase that incorporates Z into DNA while rejecting A. These findings enrich our understanding of biodiversity and expand the genetic palette for synthetic biology.

    "abstract": "Middle Pleistocene Homo in the Levant Our understanding of the origin, distribution, and evolution of early humans and their close relatives has been greatly refined by recent new information. Adding to this trend, Hershkovitz et al. have uncovered evidence of a previously unknown archaic Homo population, the \u201cNesher Ramla Homo \u201d (see the Perspective by Mirazon Lahr). The authors present comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses of fossilized remains from a site in Israel dated to 140,000 to 120,000 years ago indicating the presence of a previously unrecognized group of hominins representing the last surviving populations of Middle Pleistocene Homo in Europe, southwest Asia, and Africa. In a companion paper, Zaidner et al. present the radiometric ages, stone tool assemblages, faunal assemblages, and other behavioral and environmental data associated with these fossils. This evidence shows that these hominins had fully mastered technology that until only recently was linked to either Homo sapiens or Neanderthals. Nesher Ramla Homo was an efficient hunter of large and small game, used wood for fuel, cooked or roasted meat, and maintained fires. These findings provide archaeological support for cultural interactions between different human lineages during the Middle Paleolithic, suggesting that admixture between Middle Pleistocene Homo and H. sapiens had already occurred by this time.

    "abstract": "Mapping protein interactions driving cancer Cancer is a genetic disease, and much cancer research is focused on identifying carcinogenic mutations and determining how they relate to disease progression. Three papers demonstrate how mutations are processed through networks of protein interactions to promote cancer (see the Perspective by Cheng and Jackson). Swaney et al . focus on head and neck cancer and identify cancer-enriched interactions, demonstrating how point mutant\u2013dependent interactions of PIK3CA, a kinase frequently mutated in human cancers, are predictive of drug response. Kim et al . focus on breast cancer and identify two proteins functionally connected to the tumor-suppressor gene BRCA1 and two proteins that regulate PIK3CA. Zheng et al . developed a statistical model that identifies protein networks that are under mutation pressure across different cancer types, including a complex bringing together PIK3CA with actomyosin proteins. These papers provide a resource that will be helpful in interpreting cancer genomic data. \u2014VV",

Hoshina et al. studied mice with PCDH19 mutations, showing that a mismatch between PCDH19 and another cell-adhesion molecule causes trouble when mossy fibers of the brain are forming synapses (see the Perspective by Shohayeb and Cooper). In the heterozygous setting, mutant PCDG19 sequesters the partner cell-adhesion molecule into dysfunctional complexes. In the hemizygous setting, as in males, enough of that partner cell-adhesion molecule roams free to make functional interactions. Science , this issue p. eaaz3893 ; see also p. 235",

Gulluni et al . report that ESCRT recruitment at the cytokinetic bridge is mediated by the binding of an ESCRT-II subunit to the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (see the Perspective by Brill and Wilde). This pathway acts in parallel to a known cascade driven by a protein called ALIX, but its failure is sufficient to lead to premature senescence in the lens of fish, mouse, and human eyes, where ALIX is expressed at lower levels. These results point to an evolutionarily conserved pathway for the cell-specific control of cytokinesis that serves to protect from senescence and the early onset of cataracts. \u2014SMH",

Yang et al. analyzed blood samples from young children and adults, as well as tissues from deceased organ donors, characterizing the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires specific to six common pathogens and two viruses that they had not seen before: Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Children had higher frequencies of B cells with convergent BCR heavy chains against previously encountered pathogens and higher frequencies of class-switched convergent B cell clones against SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. These findings suggest that encounters with coronaviruses in early life may produce cross-reactive memory B cell populations that contribute to divergent COVID-19 susceptibilities.

Seabirds that forage and breed across oceans globally have been recognized as sentinels of ocean health.

Northern Hemisphere species exhibited greater signs of stress and reduced breeding success, indicative of low fish resources. Southern Hemisphere species showed less impact on reproductive output, suggesting that the fish populations there have thus far been less disturbed. The differences across hemispheres indicate different strategies for conservation, with active recovery needed in the north and enhanced protection in the south.

Helseth et al. developed a reporter to study ISR activation brainwide and found a class of cells that engage ISR for steady-state cell function (see the Perspective by Ingebretson and Lemos). In mice, cholinergic interneurons required the ISR to maintain properties of tonic firing and response to dopamine. Inhibiting the ISR in these cells changed dopamine neuromodulation and enhanced performance in learned tasks. Thus, ISR engagement can play a steady-state role that is independent of cell stress and important in learning. Science , this issue p. eabe1931 ; see also p. 345",

The extinction led to a reduction in shark diversity by more than 70% and an almost complete loss in total abundance. There is no known climatic and/or environmental driver of this extinction, and its cause remains a mystery. Modern shark forms began to diversify within 2 to 5 million years after the extinction, but they represent only a minor sliver of what sharks once were.

This ancient change facilitated sugar detection not just in nectar feeding birds, but also across the songbird group, and in a way that was different from, though convergent with, that in hummingbirds.

Therefore, mechanisms are in place to ensure that there is balanced gene dosage between the X chromosome and autosomes and between the sexes. Quite a bit is known about dosage compensation in mice; however, the mechanism in primates, including humans, is less clear. Okamoto et al . reveal that in cynomolgus monkeys, the X chromosomes display repressive modifications and compacted structure before being chosen as active or inactive X chromosomes (see the Perspective by Heard and Rougeulle). This work elucidates the pathway, timing, and progression of X chromosome dosage compensation during monkey development, creating a foundation for elucidating this mechanism in other primates, including humans. \u2014BAP",

Methyoxyl groups in this organic material, which are a potential source of methane, declined with maturity, whereas the carbon-13 fraction increased gradually.

Such infections would be expected to cause birth defects and fetal mortality, but maternal IAV infections rarely produce such effects, suggesting the presence of a protective mechanism in fetal tissues. Harding et al. used a CRISPR screen to uncover IFN regulators that can mediate differential IFN control across tissues in human cell lines. They found that G protein\u2013coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1), which is expressed in fetal tissues, acts as a protective suppressor of IFN responses in the placenta during maternal infection. In a mouse model, pharmacological activation of GPER1 shielded fetuses from maternal inflammation. Activation of GPER1 might be promising therapeutically to protect the fetus from both maternal and fetal infections. Science , this issue p. 271",

Ibrahim et al. show that MeCP2 is a hydroxymethylated cytosine-adenosine (CA) repeat-binding protein that modulates chromatin architecture at a distance from the transcription start site (see the Perspective by Zhou and Zoghbi). MeCP2 accumulates and spreads around modified CA repeats and competes for nucleosome occupancy. Loss of MeCP2 results in a widespread increase in nucleosome density inside lamina-associated domains and transcriptional dysregulation of genes enriched in CA repeats. These results shed light on the underlying molecular mechanism of Rett syndrome, a severe disease associated with mutations in MeCP2.

Second, individuals who will eventually have a family member incarcerated are worse off than those who never will, even before the incarceration takes place. Third, family member incarceration has negative effects on families above and beyond these preexisting disadvantages. And finally, policy interventions that address the precursors to family member incarceration and seek to minimize family member incarceration would best enhance family well-being. If the goal is to help all American families thrive, then the importance of simultaneous changes in social and criminal justice policy cannot be overstated.",

To understand how microbes take advantage of this energy and carbon source, Hahn et al. solved the x-ray crystal structures of an enzyme they call ethyl coenzyme-M reductase, which converts ethane into the thioether ethyl-coenzyme M as the entry point for catabolism. They found an expanded active site and, using a xenon gas derivatization experiment, a distinctive tunnel through the protein that is proposed to permit access of the gaseous substrate.

The plant-specific Pol IV forms a complex with RDR2 (an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) to produce double-stranded precursors of small interfering RNA essential for genomic DNA methylation. Huang et al . determined the cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of the Pol IV-RDR2 complex. The structures show that Pol IV and RDR2 connect their active centers through an inner RNA transfer channel and that Pol IV reverses transcription direction and hands over its transcript directly through the channel to RDR2 for the production of the second strand of the double-stranded RNA. \u2014DJ",

Using analog experiments, the authors found that organic matter from plants alone was sufficient for the formation of flocs\u2014aggregates of small silt and clay particles\u2014which are required to deposit mudrock.

Cilia beating is powered by arrays of dynein motors, the key force generators being the outer dynein arm (ODA) complexes. Using the protozoan Tetrahymena , Mali et al. identified a factor, which they name Shulin, that binds newly synthesized ODAs. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy revealed how Shulin locks the dynein motors together by shutting off motor activity and facilitating delivery of ODAs from the cytoplasm to their final position in the cilia.

Testing those predictions by comparing them with the isotopic record has been difficult. C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. examined two r-process isotopes, iodine-129 and curium-247, both of which have half-lives of 15.6 million years. Therefore, their ratio remains constant even long after the nucleosynthesis event. The ratio of those isotopes at the time of Solar System formation is recorded in meteorites. Comparing this value with nuclear astrophysics calculations shows that the most likely source was moderately neutron-rich material ejected from a binary neutron star merger.

Peng et al. tackled this challenge by developing a technique based on conducting atomic force microscopy to populate and track triplets in a single pentacene molecule, a model \u03d6-conjugated system, placed on a sodium chloride surface (see the Perspective by Li and Jiang). The authors show how the triplet-state lifetime can be quenched in controllable manner by atomic-scale manipulations with oxygen co-adsorbed in close vicinity. The presented single-molecule spectroscopy paves the way for further atomically resolved studies of triplet excited states that play an important role in many other fields, such as organic electronics, photocatalysis, and photodynamic therapy.

Using an in vivo chemical suppressor screen of a bloodless zebrafish mutant, Rossmann et al. show that the lineage-specific chromatin factor tif1\u03b3 directly regulates mitochondrial genes to drive red blood cell differentiation. Loss of tif1\u03b3 reduces coenzyme Q synthesis and function, impeding mitochondrial respiration and leading to epigenetic alterations and repression of erythropoiesis. The loss of blood in the mutant fish can be rescued by the addition of coenzyme Q. This work establishes a mechanism by which a chromatin factor tunes a metabolic pathway in a tissue-specific manner.

In Gram-negative bacteria, outer membrane biogenesis is aided by an ABC transporter called MsbA, which flips lipopolysaccharide from the inner face of the cell membrane to the periplasmic face. Th\u00e9lot et al . determined structures of two first-generation inhibitors bound to MsbA, TBT1 and G247, and found that they have distinct binding modes. Unlike most inhibitors, TBT1 triggers unproductive ATPase activity and induces a conformation similar to substrate bound. These structures will provide valuable information for the design of potential antimicrobial drugs. The authors have already identified a new lead compound from virtual screening based on the TBT1-induced conformation. \u2014MAF",

That is, the system separately controls whether gene expression is \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d and the extent of gene expression. The galactose-responsive pathway is activated when yeast need to switch from metabolizing glucose to metabolizing galactose. Ricci-Tam et al. found that, rather than using two separate elements for the switch and dimmer controls, yeast use a single transcription factor, Gal4p, separately regulating its abundance (through transcriptional regulation) and its catalytic activity (through interaction with a protein-binding partner). Such regulation may be common and can allow responses to the environment on physiological and evolutionary time scales. Science , this issue p. 292",

Bastiaans et al . used tunneling noise spectroscopy to measure the effective charge of current carriers in the disordered superconductor titanium nitride.

Bolton et al . used microwave observations from the Juno spacecraft to observe several storms and vortices. They found that the storms extended below the depths at which water and ammonia are expected to condense, implying a connection with the deep atmosphere. Parisi et al . analyzed gravity measurements taken while Juno flew over the GRS. They detected a perturbation in the planet\u2019s gravitational field caused by the storm, finding that it was no more than 500 kilometers deep.

Using fossil pollen data from Amazonian lake sediments with temporal resolution over the past millennium, Bush et al. found that forest recovery began 300 to 600 years before the population crash. The more recent nadir in atmospheric CO 2 was not associated with rapid reforestation at that time. The vegetation changes appear to be the result of changing patterns of land use in the centuries preceding the European arrival and the resulting devastation, whereas the cause of the CO 2 decline remains enigmatic.

    "abstract": "Taking the measure of a magnet The recent discovery of magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) materials has inspired efforts to understand its nature. Whereas the magnetism of monolayers of chromium iodide (CrI 3 ) can be understood in terms of out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, the related material chromium chloride (CrCl 3 ) has spins that lie in the plane. Bedoya-Pinto et al . used molecular beam epitaxy to grow monolayers of CrCl 3 on graphene and studied its magnetic properties. Using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements, the authors found that monolayer CrCl 3 is a ferromagnet, unlike bulk CrCl 3 , which is antiferromagnetic. The scaling of the signal in the critical region indicated that the material belongs to the 2D-XY universality class, distinct from Ising magnetism, which some other 2D magnets exhibit. \u2014JS",

Existing models have proposed that these were split by Jupiter forming first, which would open a gap in the protoplanetary disc. Lichtenberg et al. instead argue that the snow line, the boundary between regions containing water vapor and solid ice, migrated first outward and then inward, forming two separate populations of planetesimals. Those planetesimals then grew through collisions to form the planets. Their simulation of this model explains the meteorite data and is consistent with astronomical observations of protoplanetary disks around other stars. Science , this issue p. 365",

Specifically, Aquilolamna milarcae displays many features similar to modern manta rays, notably long, slender fins and a mouth seemingly adapted to filter feeding, suggesting that it was planktivorous.

    "abstract": "PreTCRs use horizontal docking geometry The T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHCs) and consists of an \u03b1 chain in association with a \u03b2 chain. Both chains have hypervariable complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) that inform whether a particular TCR can recognize a given pMHC. To successfully graduate from the thymus, aspiring \u03b1\u03b2T cells must generate a functional TCR. During one early checkpoint in this process, the \u03b2 chain is first paired with a preT\u03b2 chain to form the preTCR. Li et al. used x-ray crystallography to visualize how preTCRs recognize pMHCs. They report that the CDR3 loop of the preTCR \u03b2 chain contacts the pMHC with a distinctive lateral topography. This is in contrast to the established binding modality of mature TCRs, whereby all three CDR loops on both \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains bind in a vertical orientation. These complexes help solve the mystery of how only functionally rearranged \u03b2 chains using competent CDR3 loops can properly engage with pMHC at the preTCR stage. Science , this issue p. 181",

Ghosh et al. show that foraging Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms, which do not have eyes or opsins, can distinguish a blue color indicative of a toxin released by bacterial mats (see the Perspective by Neal and Vosshall). They suggest that the worms do this through the detection of the ratio between blue and amber light, a process dependent on at least two cellular stress-response genes. Different strains of C. elegans responded to different ratios, suggesting that this pathway plays an ecological role. Science , this issue p. 1059 ; see also p. 995",

These mice exhibited progressive severe autoimmune and inflammatory disease associated with the activation and accelerated differentiation of T cells. WAVE2's suppression of T cell activation was not mediated by the T cell receptor but rather by its inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) binding to RAPTOR and RICTOR. Accordingly, the autoimmune phenotype of these mice could be ameliorated by pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR signaling. Science , this issue p. eaaz4544 ; see also p. 1309",

Follow-up radio and optical spectroscopy show that it is an expanding supernova remnant slamming into surrounding material, probably ejected from the star centuries before it exploded.

Such dynamic control is expected to be useful for manipulating quantum systems and implementing quantum information protocols. \u2014ISO",

The XY system in mammals, however, has been evolutionarily stable across a wide array of species. Fifty years ago, a variation on this norm was described in the creeping vole ( Microtus oregoni ), but the details have remained mostly unknown. Couger et al. sequenced the sex chromosomes in this species and found that the Y chromosome has been lost, the male-determining chromosome is a second X that is largely homologous to the female X, and both the maternally inherited and male-specific sex chromosomes carry vestiges of the ancestral Y.

The structures of many such networks and the ecological forces that shape them are well known, but their deeper evolutionary history has received little attention. Burin et al. address this knowledge gap in a study of frugivorious bird species in documented seed-dispersal networks around the world (see the Perspective by Bello and Barreto). Species occupying central positions in frugivory networks, which thus interact with many plant species, tend to belong to lineages that are more stable over macroevolutionary time scales. These patterns are more evident in regions with warmer and wetter climates and provide evidence that evolutionary processes can leave a signal on the structure of current ecological networks.

Nissl staining identifies cell nuclei and has been used extensively to investigate parcellations of the cortical gray matter, but the white matter has largely been neglected with this technique. Schurr and Mezer now show that Nissl staining, together with structure tensor analysis, can be used to study white matter architecture and the organization of the glial cell framework around axons over the whole brain.

The largest storm is the Great Red Spot (GRS), which has persisted for more than a century. It has been unclear whether the storms are confined to a thin layer near the top of the atmosphere or if they extend deep into the planet. Bolton et al . used microwave observations from the Juno spacecraft to observe several storms and vortices. They found that the storms extended below the depths at which water and ammonia are expected to condense, implying a connection with the deep atmosphere. Parisi et al . analyzed gravity measurements taken while Juno flew over the GRS. They detected a perturbation in the planet\u2019s gravitational field caused by the storm, finding that it was no more than 500 kilometers deep.

Expression of similar patterning genes in the primordial zone is confined to a wedge for the eudicot leaf but expanded to concentric domains in the grass leaf, driving development of the cylindrical, encircling sheath characteristic of grass leaves. Addition or removal of gene expression in a marginal zone contributes to the development of the broader leaf characteristic of eudicots. Thus, grass and eudicot leaves are diversified elaborations of shared toolkits. \u2014PJH",

One such example is the wing spot seen in male Drosophila biarmipes flies but not the female flies. Galouzis and Prud'homme investigate the X-linked yellow gene and its enhancer. Investigating the genetics of the trait, they found evidence that the male-specific phenotype is caused by a trans interaction between the enhancer and gene that silences the gene when it is present in only one copy in the male (which only has a single X chromosome) versus the two copies found in the female. This gene thus appears to be regulated by differing genomic interactions in male and female flies and is an example of the phenomenon known as transvection. Science , this issue p. 396",

This approach was unsuccessful because mature huRBCs are rapidly destroyed in the mouse liver. They then used CRISPR-Cas9 to mutate these mice into a fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase\u2013deficient strain, allowing them to replace the mouse liver with engrafted human hepatocytes. These mice exhibited enhanced human erythropoiesis and circulating huRBC survival and could recapitulate SCD pathology when reconstituted with SCD-derived HSCs. Science , this issue p. 1019",

Vascular plant reproductive structures, such as flowers, are familiar examples of complex morphology. In this study, we use a simple approach based on the number of part types to analyze changes in complexity over time. We find that reproductive complexity increased in two pulses separated by ~250 million years of stasis, including an initial rise in the Devonian with the radiation of vascular plants and a pronounced increase in the Late Cretaceous that reflects flowering plant diversification. These pulses are associated with innovations that increased functional diversity, suggesting that shifts in complexity are linked to changes in function regardless of whether they occur early or late in the history of vascular plants.",

However, detecting this orbital magnetism is difficult because it is usually masked by the signal stemming from spins. Vallejo Bustamante et al . managed to capture this response by placing two giant magnetoresistance detectors below a sample of graphene sandwiched by layers of hexagonal boron nitride. These detectors picked up a strong diamagnetic response from an undoped sample, consistent with theoretical predictions. The technique may be useful in the investigation of other two-dimensional materials. \u2014JS",

Hsieh et al. show that, within this effector arsenal, the phospholipid kinase MavQ and the phosphatase SidP work together and self-organize on the intracellular membrane network of its eukaryotic host to promote membrane remodeling. The interactions between MavQ and SidP constitute positive and negative feedback loops, respectively, that orchestrate their spatiotemporal oscillation during infection.

Turner et al. examined uranium and thorium isotopes in several carbonaceous chondrites, finding nonequilibrium distributions that imply that uranium ions were transported by fluid flow. Because this signature disappears after several half-lives of the radioactive isotopes, the meteorites must have been exposed to liquid within the past million years. The authors suggest that ice may have melted during the impacts that ejected the meteorites from their parent bodies. Science , this issue p. 164",

    "abstract": "Middle Pleistocene Homo in the Levant Our understanding of the origin, distribution, and evolution of early humans and their close relatives has been greatly refined by recent new information. Adding to this trend, Hershkovitz et al. have uncovered evidence of a previously unknown archaic Homo population, the \u201cNesher Ramla Homo \u201d (see the Perspective by Mirazon Lahr). The authors present comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses of fossilized remains from a site in Israel dated to 140,000 to 120,000 years ago indicating the presence of a previously unrecognized group of hominins representing the last surviving populations of Middle Pleistocene Homo in Europe, southwest Asia, and Africa. In a companion paper, Zaidner et al. present the radiometric ages, stone tool assemblages, faunal assemblages, and other behavioral and environmental data associated with these fossils. This evidence shows that these hominins had fully mastered technology that until only recently was linked to either Homo sapiens or Neanderthals. Nesher Ramla Homo was an efficient hunter of large and small game, used wood for fuel, cooked or roasted meat, and maintained fires. These findings provide archaeological support for cultural interactions between different human lineages during the Middle Paleolithic, suggesting that admixture between Middle Pleistocene Homo and H. sapiens had already occurred by this time.

Through exome sequencing of an Old Order Amish population, Montasser et al . identified a genetic variant that results in an amino acid change in the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 protein and is correlated with lower levels of cardiovascular disease. Investigation of the mutant protein showed that it affects genes associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and mice engineered to express the mutant protein exhibited a 38% decrease in blood LDL-C levels. This study suggests that such genomic sequencing and analysis can link genotype to phenotype and identify potentially clinically actionable pathways to treat disease. \u2014LMZ",

Their genetic suppressor screens revealed that loss of an RNA adenosine deaminase, which catalyzes adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, rescued ciliary abnormalities. They found that kinase hyperactivation caused this RNA adenosine deaminase to edit kinase RNA and impair kinase RNA splicing and translation, thereby downregulating ciliary kinases from nuclei.

    "abstract": "A transiting rocky planet 8 parsecs away Most exoplanets have been detected using either the radial velocity (RV) method or the transit method, which provide only limited information on the planet's physical properties. In the rare cases in which both methods detect the same planet, the combination determines the planet's mass, radius, and density. Trifonov et al. identified a planet, Gliese 486 b, using both RV and transit data. The host star is a red dwarf only 8 parsecs away, making this one of the closest exoplanet systems known. A rocky super-Earth, Gliese 486 b has an equilibrium surface temperature of 700 kelvin. The authors say that it is observationally favorable for searches for an atmosphere.

However, application of small mechanical strains (\u223c0.5%) shifted the van Hove singularities and suppressed the nonradiative processes. Near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield at high exciton densities was seen in exfoliated monolayers of molybdenum sulfide, tungsten sulfide, and tungsten selenide, as well as centimeter-scale tungsten sulfide monolayers grown by chemical vapor deposition.

The model leverages transitions from active to abandoned stream channels to determine when and how drainage networks in these regions reorganize and allow quantification of both slip and bedload transport.

Both richness and redundancy increased in periods with warmer water, meaning that there were more species and that those species often filled similar ecological roles. Such ecological redundancy can increase ecosystem resilience, and understanding its relationship with temperature can help us see where human activities are driving change. \u2014SNV",

Enoto et al. observed the Crab Pulsar simultaneously with x-ray and radio telescopes. They found that x-ray emission during GRPs was slightly brighter than that during normal pulses.

Proposition 14 extends the 2004 ballot Proposition 71, which established the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) and authorized $3 billion in state-issued bonds for CIRM to fund stem cell and regenerative research and medicine (restricted to California). Proposition 14, which authorizes $5.5 billion over the next 10 years to continue CIRM's work, succeeded in part by informing voters of CIRM's successes and that its conflict-of-interest provisions are extremely strong. This state-level action is critical because, contrary to opponents' opinions, the overall policy environment for human stem cell research in the United States is in some ways worse now than when Proposition 71 passed.",
