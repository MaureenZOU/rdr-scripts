In particular, we show that quantum neural networks that satisfy a volume-law in the entanglement entropy will give rise to models not suitable for learning with high probability. Using arguments from quantum thermodynamics, we then show that this volume law is typical and that there exists a barren plateau in the optimization landscape due to entanglement. More precisely, we show that for any bounded objective function on the visible layers, the Lipshitz constants of the expectation value of that objective function will scale inversely with the dimension of the hidden-subsystem with high probability. We show how this can cause both gradient descent and gradient-free methods to fail. We note that similar problems can happen with quantum Boltzmann machines, although stronger assumptions on the coupling between the hidden/visible subspaces are necessary. We highlight how pretraining such generative models may provide a way to navigate these barren plateaus.",

    "abstract": "Quantum algorithms offer significant speedups over their classical counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms were recently tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In the seminal GSLW'19 paper on QSVT [Gily\\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe, ACM STOC 2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification, methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here, we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum eigenvalue transform, from which QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19, we then employ QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates how QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms, thus suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Quantum many-body systems subjected to local measurements at a nonzero rate can be in distinct dynamical phases, with differing entanglement properties. We introduce theoretical approaches to measurement-induced phase transitions (MPT) and also to entanglement transitions in random tensor networks. Many of our results are for \"all-to-all\" quantum circuits with unitaries and measurements, in which any qubit can couple to any other, and related settings where some of the complications of low-dimensional models are reduced. We also propose field theory descriptions for spatially local systems of finite dimensionality. To build intuition, we first solve the simplest \"minimal cut\" toy model for entanglement dynamics in all-to-all circuits, finding scaling forms and exponents within this approximation. We then show that certain all-to-all measurement circuits allow exact results by exploiting the circuit's local tree-like structure. For this reason, we make a detour to give universal results for entanglement phase transitions in a class of random tree tensor networks, making a connection with the classical theory of directed polymers on a tree. We then compare these results with numerics in all-to-all circuits, both for the MPT and for the simpler \"Forced Measurement Phase Transition\" (FMPT). We characterize the two different phases in all-to-all circuits using observables that are sensitive to the amount of information propagated between the initial and final time. We demonstrate signatures of the two phases that can be understood from simple models. Finally we propose Landau-Ginsburg-Wilson-like field theories for the MPT, the FMPT, and for entanglement transitions in tensor networks. This analysis shows a surprising difference between the MPT and the other cases. We discuss variants of the measurement problem with additional structure, and questions for the future.",

Quasi-probability methods can permit perfect error compensation at the cost of additional circuit executions, provided that the nature of the error model is fully understood and sufficiently local both spatially and temporally. Unfortunately these conditions are challenging to satisfy. Here we present a method by which the proper compensation strategy can instead be learned ab initio. Our training process uses multiple variants of the primary circuit where all non-Clifford gates are substituted with gates that are efficient to simulate classically. The process yields a configuration that is near-optimal versus noise in the real system with its non-Clifford gate set. Having presented a range of learning strategies, we demonstrate the power of the technique using emulated quantum computers that suffer a range of noise severities and types, including spatially and temporally correlated variants.",

Here, we report calculations of finite-temperature properties including energies, static and dynamical correlation functions, and excitation spectra of spin Hamiltonians with up to four sites on five-qubit IBM Quantum devices. These calculations are performed using the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm and made possible by several algorithmic improvements, including a method to exploit symmetries that reduces the quantum resources required by QITE, circuit optimization procedures to reduce circuit depth, and error mitigation techniques to improve the quality of raw hardware data. Our work demonstrates that the ansatz-independent QITE algorithm is capable of computing diverse finite-temperature observables on near-term quantum devices.",

The McLachlan variational principle for real-time dynamics governs the equations of motion of variational parameters, where the variational ansatz is automatically generated and dynamically expanded along the time-evolution path, such that the \"McLachlan distance\", which is a measure of the simulation accuracy, remains below a fixed threshold. The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) approach is applied to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis spin chain model, where it captures the finite-rate quantum quench dynamics to high accuracy. The AVQDS circuits that prepare the quantum states along the dynamical path are shallower than those obtained from naive Trotterization by over an order of magnitude. We envision that a wide range of dynamical simulations of quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum devices will be made possible through the AVQDS framework.",

    "abstract": "Time evolution of quantum many-body systems typically leads to a state with maximal entanglement allowed by symmetries. Two distinct routes to impede entanglement growth are inducing localization via spatial disorder, or subjecting the system to non-unitary evolution, e.g., via projective measurements. Here we employ the idea of space-time rotation of a circuit to explore the relation between systems that fall into these two classes. In particular, by space-time rotating unitary Floquet circuits that display a localization transition, we construct non-unitary circuits that display a rich variety of entanglement scaling and phase transitions. One outcome of our approach is a non-unitary circuit for free fermions in 1d that exhibits an entanglement transition from logarithmic scaling to volume-law scaling. This transition is accompanied by a 'purification transition' analogous to that seen in hybrid projective-unitary circuits. We follow a similar strategy to construct a non-unitary 2d Clifford circuit that shows a transition from area to volume-law entanglement scaling. Similarly, we space-time rotate a 1d spin chain that hosts many-body localization to obtain a non-unitary circuit that exhibits an entanglement transition. Finally, we introduce an unconventional correlator and argue that if a unitary circuit hosts a many-body localization transition, then the correlator is expected to be singular in its non-unitary counterpart as well.",

Does the model generalize? This is the main question in any data-driven strategy, namely the ability to predict the correct class even of previously unseen states. Here we establish a link between quantum machine learning classification and quantum hypothesis testing (state and channel discrimination) and then show that the accuracy and generalization capability of quantum classifiers depend on the (R\\'enyi) mutual informations $I(C{:}Q)$ and $I_2(X{:}Q)$ between the quantum state space $Q$ and the classical parameter space $X$ or class space $C$. Based on the above characterization, we then show how different properties of $Q$ affect classification accuracy and generalization, such as the dimension of the Hilbert space, the amount of noise, and the amount of neglected information from $X$ via, e.g., pooling layers. Moreover, we introduce a quantum version of the Information Bottleneck principle that allows us to explore the various tradeoffs between accuracy and generalization. Finally, in order to check our theoretical predictions, we study the classification of the quantum phases of an Ising spin chain, and we propose the Variational Quantum Information Bottleneck (VQIB) method to optimize quantum embeddings of classical data to favor generalization.",

In a measurement-only stabilizer circuit that maps exactly to two-dimensional critical percolation, we show that the mutual information and the mutual negativity are governed by boundary conformal fields of different scaling dimensions at long distances. We then consider a class of \"hybrid\" circuit models obtained by perturbing the measurement-only circuit with unitary gates of progressive levels of complexity. While other critical exponents vary appreciably for different choices of unitary gate ensembles at their respective critical points, the mutual negativity has scaling dimension 3 across remarkably many of the hybrid circuits, which is notably different from that in percolation. We contrast our results with limiting cases where a geometrical minimal-cut picture is available.",

Our method, called noise-aware circuit learning (NACL), applies to circuits designed to compute a unitary transformation, prepare a set of quantum states, or estimate an observable of a many-qubit state. Given a task and a device model that captures information about the noise and connectivity of qubits in a device, NACL outputs an optimized circuit to accomplish this task in the presence of noise. It does so by minimizing a task-specific cost function over circuit depths and circuit structures. To demonstrate NACL, we construct circuits resilient to a fine-grained noise model derived from gate set tomography on a superconducting-circuit quantum device, for applications including quantum state overlap, quantum Fourier transform, and W-state preparation.",

    "abstract": "The development of robust architectures capable of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation should consider both their quantum error-correcting codes and the underlying physical qubits upon which they are built, in tandem. Following this design principle, we demonstrate remarkable error-correction performance by concatenating the XZZX surface code with Kerr-cat qubits. We contrast several variants of fault-tolerant systems undergoing diﬀerent circuit-noise models that reﬂect the physics of Kerr-cat qubits. Our simulations show that our system is scalable below a threshold gate inﬁdelity of p CX ∼ 6.5% within a physically reasonable parameter regime, where p CX is the inﬁdelity of the noisiest gate of our system, the controlled- NOT gate. This threshold can be reached in a superconducting-circuit architecture with a Kerr nonlinearity of 10MHz, an approximately 6.25-photon cat qubit, single-photon lifetime of (cid:2) 64 μ s, and a thermal photon population (cid:3) 8%. Such parameters are routinely achieved in superconducting circuits. DOI:",

Because of the challenge of merely preparing the codewords, the GKP code was for a long time considered to be impractical.

Biased with a dc current, the KIT operates in a three-wave mixing fashion, thereby reducing by several orders of magnitude the power of the microwave pump tone compared to conventional four-wave mixing KIT devices. It is built in an artificial transmission line intrinsically matched to 50 Ohms, whose dispersion allows for a controlled amplification bandwidth. We experimentally measure $17.6^{+1.1}_{-1.4}$ dB of gain across a 2 GHz bandwidth, with an input 1 dB compression power of -63 dBm within that bandwidth, in qualitative agreement with theory. Using the KIT as the first amplifier in an amplification chain, we measure a system-added noise of $0.61\\pm0.08$ K between 3.5 and 5.5 GHz, about one eighth the noise obtained when using only a representative classical amplifier. The KIT contribution to this added noise is estimated to be $0.2\\pm0.1$ K, consistent with the quantum limit on amplifier added noise. This device is therefore suitable to read large arrays of microwave kinetic inductance detectors or thousands of superconducting qubits.",

Among them, implementations of circuits that harness intrinsic noise protection have been rapidly developed in recent years. These noise-protected devices constitute a new class of qubits in which the computational states are largely decoupled from local noise channels. The main challenges in engineering such systems are simultaneously guarding against both bit- and phase-flip errors, and also ensuring high-fidelity qubit control. Although partial noise protection is possible in superconducting circuits relying on a single quantum degree of freedom, the promise of complete protection can only be fulfilled by implementing multimode or hybrid circuits. This Perspective reviews the theoretical principles at the heart of these new qubits, describes recent experiments, and highlights the potential of robust encoding of quantum information in superconducting qubits.",

Although fault-tolerant devices likely remain years away, the noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices of today may be leveraged for other purposes. Leading candidates are variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which have been developed for applications including chemistry, optimization, and machine learning, but whose implementations on quantum devices have yet to demonstrate improvements over classical capabilities. In this Perspective, we propose a variety of ways that progress toward this potential crossover point could be informed by quantum optimal control theory. To set the stage, we identify VQAs and quantum optimal control as formulations of variational optimization at the circuit level and pulse level, respectively, where these represent just two levels in a broader hierarchy of abstractions that we consider. In this unified picture, we suggest several ways that the different levels of abstraction may be connected, in order to facilitate the application of quantum optimal control theory to VQA challenges associated with ansatz selection, optimization landscapes, noise, and robustness. A major theme throughout is the need for sufficient control resources in VQA implementations; we discuss different ways this need can manifest, outline a variety of open questions, and conclude with a look to the future.",

We show that by introducing quantum gates implementing unitary transformations generated by the symmetries of the system, one can induce destructive interference between the errors from different steps of the simulation, effectively giving faster quantum simulation by symmetry protection. We derive rigorous bounds on the error of a symmetry-protected simulation algorithm and identify conditions for optimal symmetry protection. In particular, when the symmetry transformations are chosen as powers of a unitary, the error of the algorithm is approximately projected to the so-called quantum Zeno subspaces. We prove a bound on this approximation error, exponentially improving a recent result of Burgarth, Facchi, Gramegna, and Pascazio. We apply our technique to the simulations of the XXZ Heisenberg interactions with local disorder and the Schwinger model in quantum field theory. For both systems, our algorithm can reduce the simulation error by several orders of magnitude over the unprotected simulation. Finally, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that our technique can also protect simulation against other types of coherent, temporally correlated errors, such as the $1/f$ noise commonly found in solid-state experiments.",

    "abstract": "To harness the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, it is paramount to find the best type of circuits to run hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Key candidates are parametrized quantum circuits that can be effectively implemented on current devices. Here, we evaluate the capacity and trainability of these circuits using the geometric structure of the parameter space via the effective quantum dimension, which reveals the expressive power of circuits in general as well as of particular initialization strategies. We assess the expressive power of various popular circuit types and find striking differences depending on the type of entangling gates used. Particular circuits are characterized by scaling laws in their expressiveness. We identify a transition in the quantum geometry of the parameter space, which leads to a decay of the quantum natural gradient for deep circuits. For shallow circuits, the quantum natural gradient can be orders of magnitude larger in value compared to the regular gradient; however, both of them can suffer from vanishing gradients. By tuning a fixed set of circuit parameters to randomized ones, we find a region where the circuit is expressive, but does not suffer from barren plateaus, hinting at a good way to initialize circuits. We show an algorithm that prunes redundant parameters of a circuit without affecting its effective dimension. Our results enhance the understanding of parametrized quantum circuits and can be immediately applied to improve variational quantum algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of noise in quantum computers is the dominant issue stymieing the push of quantum algorithms beyond their classical counterparts. We do not expect to be able to afford the overhead required for quantum error correction in the next decade, so in the meantime we must rely on low-cost, unscalable error mitigation techniques to bring quantum computing to its full potential. This paper presents a new error mitigation technique based on quantum phase estimation that can also reduce errors in expectation value estimation (e.g., for variational algorithms). The general idea is to apply phase estimation while effectively post-selecting for the system register to be in the starting state, which allows us to catch and discard errors which knock us away from there. We refer to this technique as \"verified phase estimation\" (VPE) and show that it can be adapted to function without the use of control qubits in order to simplify the control circuitry for near-term implementations. Using VPE, we demonstrate the estimation of expectation values on numerical simulations of intermediate scale quantum circuits with multiple orders of magnitude improvement over unmitigated estimation at near-term error rates (even after accounting for the additional complexity of phase estimation). Our numerical results suggest that VPE can mitigate against any single errors that might occur; i.e., the error in the estimated expectation values often scale as O(p^2), where p is the probability of an error occurring at any point in the circuit. This property, combined with robustness to sampling noise reveal VPE as a practical technique for mitigating errors in near-term quantum experiments.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers promise tremendous impact across applications -- and have shown great strides in hardware engineering -- but remain notoriously error prone. Careful design of low-level controls has been shown to compensate for the processes which induce hardware errors, leveraging techniques from optimal and robust control. However, these techniques rely heavily on the availability of highly accurate and detailed physical models which generally only achieve sufficient representative fidelity for the most simple operations and generic noise modes. In this work, we use deep reinforcement learning to design a universal set of error-robust quantum logic gates on a superconducting quantum computer, without requiring knowledge of a specific Hamiltonian model of the system, its controls, or its underlying error processes. We experimentally demonstrate that a fully autonomous deep reinforcement learning agent can design single qubit gates up to $3\\times$ faster than default DRAG operations without additional leakage error, and exhibiting robustness against calibration drifts over weeks. We then show that $ZX(-\\pi/2)$ operations implemented using the cross-resonance interaction can outperform hardware default gates by over $2\\times$ and equivalently exhibit superior calibration-free performance up to 25 days post optimization using various metrics. We benchmark the performance of deep reinforcement learning derived gates against other black box optimization techniques, showing that deep reinforcement learning can achieve comparable or marginally superior performance, even with limited hardware access.",

We show that this protocol is highly robust to typical thermal noise sources. The sensitivity can moreover be increased both using an initial thermal state and/or an initial phase of entangling via a non-gravitational interaction. We outline a concrete implementation testing the ability of the gravitational field to generate entanglement between an atomic interferometer and mechanical oscillator.

    "abstract": "Discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution with homodyne detection is widely recognized for its ease of implementation, efficiency with respect to error correction, and its compatibility with modern optical communication devices. However, recent studies report that the application of homodyne detection obtains poor tolerance to excess noise and insufficient transmission distance, hence seriously restricting the large-scale deployment of quantum secure communication networks. In this paper, we propose a homodyne detection protocol using the quadrature phase shift keying technique. By limiting information leakage, our proposed protocol enhances excess noise tolerance to a high level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that homodyne detection performs better than heterodyne detection in quaternary-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution under the untrusted detector noise scenario. The security is analyzed using the tight numerical method against collective attacks in the asymptotic regime. Our results imply that the current protocol is able to distribute keys in nearly intercity area and thus paves the way for constructing low-cost quantum secure communication networks.",

The presence of these sweet spots is a result of the interplay between the anisotropy of the material and the triangular shape of the FinFET cross-section, and it does not require an extreme fine-tuning of the electrostatics of the device. We present how the sweet spots appear in FinFETs grown along different crystallographic axes and we study in detail how the behaviour of these devices change when the cross-section area and aspect ratio are varied.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in the realm of noisy, intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices represents an exciting opportunity for many-body physics, by introducing new laboratory platforms with unprecedented control and measurement capabilities. We explore the implications of NISQ platforms for many-body physics in a practical sense: we ask which {\\it physical phenomena}, in the domain of quantum statistical mechanics, they may realize more readily than traditional experimental platforms. As a particularly well-suited target, we identify discrete time crystals (DTCs), novel non-equilibrium states of matter that break time translation symmetry. These can only be realized in the intrinsically out-of-equilibrium setting of periodically driven quantum systems stabilized by disorder induced many-body localization. While precursors of the DTC have been observed across a variety of experimental platforms - ranging from trapped ions to nitrogen vacancy centers to NMR crystals - none have \\emph{all} the necessary ingredients for realizing a fully-fledged incarnation of this phase, and for detecting its signature long-range \\emph{spatiotemporal order}. We show that a new generation of quantum simulators can be programmed to realize the DTC phase and to experimentally detect its dynamical properties, a task requiring extensive capabilities for programmability, initialization and read-out. Specifically, the architecture of Google's Sycamore processor is a remarkably close match for the task at hand. We also discuss the effects of environmental decoherence, and how they can be distinguished from `internal' decoherence coming from closed-system thermalization dynamics. Already with existing technology and noise levels, we find that DTC spatiotemporal order would be observable over hundreds of periods, with parametric improvements to come as the hardware advances.",

    "abstract": "Quantum simulations of chemistry in first quantization offer important advantages over approaches in second quantization including faster convergence to the continuum limit and the opportunity for practical simulations outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. However, as all prior work on quantum simulation in first quantization has been limited to asymptotic analysis, it has been impossible to compare the resources required for these approaches to those for more commonly studied algorithms in second quantization. Here, we analyze and optimize the resources required to implement two first quantized quantum algorithms for chemistry from Babbush et al that realize block encodings for the qubitization and interaction picture frameworks of Low et al. The two algorithms we study enable simulation with gate complexities $\\tilde{\\cal O}(\\eta^{8/3}N^{1/3}t+\\eta^{4/3}N^{2/3}t)$ and $\\tilde{\\cal O}(\\eta^{8/3} N^{1/3} t)$ where $\\eta$ is the number of electrons, $N$ is the number of plane wave basis functions, and $t$ is the duration of time-evolution ($t$ is inverse to target precision when the goal is to estimate energies). In addition to providing the first explicit circuits and constant factors for any first quantized simulation and introducing improvements which reduce circuit complexity by about a thousandfold over naive implementations for modest sized systems, we also describe new algorithms that asymptotically achieve the same scaling in a real space representation. We assess the resources required to simulate various molecules and materials and conclude that the qubitized algorithm will often be more practical than the interaction picture algorithm. We demonstrate that our qubitized algorithm often requires much less surface code spacetime volume for simulating millions of plane waves than the best second quantized algorithms require for simulating hundreds of Gaussian orbitals.",

    "abstract": "Many prominent quantum computing algorithms with applications in fields such as chemistry and materials science require a large number of measurements, which represents an important roadblock for future real-world use cases. We introduce a novel approach to tackle this problem through an adaptive measurement scheme. We present an algorithm that optimizes informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) on the fly in order to minimize the statistical fluctuations in the estimation of relevant cost functions. We show its advantage by improving the efficiency of the variational quantum eigensolver in calculating ground-state energies of molecular Hamiltonians with extensive numerical simulations. Our results indicate that the proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art measurement-reduction approaches in terms of efficiency. In addition, the informational completeness of the approach offers a crucial advantage, as the measurement data can be reused to infer other quantities of interest. We demonstrate the feasibility of this prospect by reusing ground-state energy-estimation data to perform high-fidelity reduced state tomography.",

    "abstract": "Just as classical information technology rests on a foundation built of interconnected information-processing systems, quantum information technology (QIT) must do the same. A critical component of such systems is the interconnect, a device or process that allows transfer of information between disparate physical media, for example, semiconductor electronics, individual atoms, light pulses in optical fiber, or microwave fields. While interconnects have been well engineered for decades in the realm of classical information technology, quantum interconnects (QuICs) present special challenges, as they must allow the transfer of fragile quantum states between different physical parts or degrees of freedom of the system. The diversity of QIT platforms (superconducting, atomic, solid-state color center, optical, etc.) that will form a quantum internet poses additional challenges. As quantum systems scale to larger size, the quantum interconnect bottleneck is imminent, and is emerging as a grand challenge for QIT. For these reasons, it is the position of the community represented by participants of the NSF workshop on Quantum Interconnects that accelerating QuIC research is crucial for sustained development of a national quantum science and technology program. Given the diversity of QIT platforms, materials used, applications, and infrastructure required, a convergent research program including partnership between academia, industry and national laboratories is required.",

The resulting expressions are fully determined by properties of the associated equilibrium density matrix, and are hence independent of the details of the initial state, while also being manifestly consistent with unitary time-evolution. For equilibrated pure states in gravity systems, such as those involving black holes, this approximation gives a prescription for calculating entanglement entropies using Euclidean path integrals which is consistent with unitarity and hence can be used to address the information loss paradox of Hawking. Applied to recent models of evaporating black holes and eternal black holes coupled to baths, it provides a derivation of replica wormholes, and elucidates their mathematical and physical origins. In particular, it shows that replica wormholes can arise in a system with a fixed Hamiltonian, without the need for ensemble averages.",

    "abstract": "Quantum-simulator hardware promises new insights into problems from particle and nuclear physics. A major challenge is to reproduce gauge invariance, as violations of this quintessential property of lattice gauge theories can have dramatic consequences, e.g., the generation of a photon mass in quantum electrodynamics. Here, we introduce an experimentally friendly method to protect gauge invariance in $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ lattice gauge theories against coherent errors in a controllable way. Our method employs only single-body energy-penalty terms, thus enabling practical implementations. As we derive analytically, some sets of penalty coefficients render undesired gauge sectors inaccessible by unitary dynamics for exponentially long times, and, for few-body error terms, with resources independent of system size. These findings constitute an exponential improvement over previously known results from energy-gap protection or perturbative treatments. In our method, the gauge-invariant subspace is protected by an emergent global symmetry, meaning it can be immediately applied to other symmetries. In our numerical benchmarks for continuous-time and digital quantum simulations, gauge protection holds for all calculated evolution times (up to $t>10^{10}/J$ for continuous time, with $J$ the relevant energy scale). Crucially, our gauge-protection technique is simpler to realize than the associated ideal gauge theory, and can thus be readily implemented in current ultracold-atom analog simulators as well as digital noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices.",

    "abstract": "Quantum simulators are a promising technology on the spectrum of quantum devices from specialized quantum experiments to universal quantum computers. These quantum devices utilize entanglement and many-particle behaviors to explore and solve hard scientific, engineering, and computational problems. Rapid development over the last two decades has produced more than 300 quantum simulators in operation worldwide using a wide variety of experimental platforms. Recent advances in several physical architectures promise a golden age of quantum simulators ranging from highly optimized special purpose simulators to flexible programmable devices. These developments have enabled a convergence of ideas drawn from fundamental physics, computer science, and device engineering. They have strong potential to address problems of societal importance, ranging from understanding vital chemical processes, to enabling the design of new materials with enhanced performance, to solving complex computational problems. It is the position of the community, as represented by participants of the NSF workshop on \"Programmable Quantum Simulators,\" that investment in a national quantum simulator program is a high priority in order to accelerate the progress in this field and to result in the first practical applications of quantum machines. Such a program should address two areas of emphasis: (1) support for creating quantum simulator prototypes usable by the broader scientific community, complementary to the present universal quantum computer effort in industry; and (2) support for fundamental research carried out by a blend of multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary collaborations with resources for quantum simulator software, hardware, and education.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computation relies on accurate measurements of qubits not only for reading the output of the calculation, but also to perform error correction. Most proposed scalable silicon architectures utilize Pauli blockade of triplet states for spin-to-charge conversion. In recent experiments, there have been instances when instead of conventional triplet blockade readout, Pauli blockade is sustained only between parallel spin configurations, with $|T_0\\rangle$ relaxing quickly to the singlet state and leaving $|T_+\\rangle$ and $|T_-\\rangle$ states blockaded -- which we call \\textit{parity readout}. Both types of blockade can be used for readout in quantum computing, but it is crucial to maximize the fidelity and understand in which regime the system operates. We devise and perform an experiment in which the crossover between parity and singlet-triplet readout can be identified by investigating the underlying physics of the $|T_0\\rangle$ relaxation rate. This rate is tunable over four orders of magnitude by controlling the Zeeman energy difference between the dots induced by spin-orbit coupling, which in turn depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field. We suggest a theoretical model incorporating charge noise and relaxation effects that explains quantitatively our results. Investigating the model both analytically and numerically, we identify strategies to obtain on-demand either singlet-triplet or parity readout consistently across large arrays of dots. We also discuss how parity readout can be used to perform full two-qubit state tomography and its impact on quantum error detection schemes in large-scale silicon quantum computers.",

    "abstract": "Quantum information processing is steadily progressing from a purely academic discipline towards applications throughout science and industry. Transitioning from lab-based, proof-of-concept experiments to robust, integrated realizations of quantum information processing hardware is an important step in this process. However, the nature of traditional laboratory setups does not offer itself readily to scaling up system sizes or allow for applications outside of laboratory-grade environments. This transition requires overcoming challenges in engineering and integration without sacrificing the state-of-the-art performance of laboratory implementations. Here, we present a 19-inch rack quantum computing demonstrator based on $^{40}\\textrm{Ca}^+$ optical qubits in a linear Paul trap to address many of these challenges. We outline the mechanical, optical, and electrical subsystems. Further, we describe the automation and remote access components of the quantum computing stack. We conclude by describing characterization measurements relevant to digital quantum computing including entangling operations mediated by the Molmer-Sorenson interaction. Using this setup we produce maximally-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with up to 24 ions without the use of post-selection or error mitigation techniques; on par with well-established conventional laboratory setups.",

By reconstructing the lattice occupation, we measure an imaging fidelity of ∼ 98%.

Recent years have witnessed a significant development in cavity magnonics based on collective spin excitations in ferrimagnetic crystals, such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Magnonic systems are considered to be a promising building block for a future quantum network. However, a major limitation of the system is that the coherence time of the magnon excitations is limited by their intrinsic loss (typically in the order of 1 μs for YIG). Here, we show that by coupling the magnonic system to a mechanical system using optical pulses, an arbitrary magnonic state (either classical or quantum) can be transferred to and stored in a distant long-lived mechanical resonator. The fidelity depends on the pulse parameters and the transmission loss. We further show that the magnonic and mechanical nodes can be prepared in a macroscopic entangled state. These demonstrate the quantum state transfer and entanglement distribution in such a novel quantum network of magnonic and mechanical nodes. Our work shows the possibility to connect two separate fields of optomagnonics and optomechanics, and to build a long-distance quantum network based on magnonic and mechanical systems.",

However, the achievable fidelities are limited by the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states, as well as technical imperfections such as atomic motion. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Rydberg atom arrays using long-lived circular Rydberg states in optical traps. Based on the extremely long lifetime of these states, exceeding seconds in cryogenic microwave cavities that suppress radiative transitions, and gate protocols that are robust to finite atomic temperature, we project that arrays of hundreds of circular Rydberg atoms with two-qubit gate errors around 10−5 can be realized using current technology. This approach combines several key elements, including a quantum nondemolition detection technique for circular Rydberg states, local manipulation using the ponderomotive potential of focused optical beams, a gate protocol using multiple circular levels to encode qubits, and robust dynamical decoupling sequences to suppress unwanted interactions and errors from atomic motion. This represents a significant improvement on the current state-of-the-art in quantum computing and simulation with neutral atoms.",

    "abstract": "The entanglement properties of random pure states are relevant to a variety of problems ranging from chaotic quantum dynamics to black hole physics. The averaged bipartite entanglement entropy of such states admits a volume law and upon increasing the subregion size follows the Page curve. In this paper, we generalize this setup to random mixed states by coupling the system to a bath and use the partial transpose to study their entanglement properties. We develop a diagrammatic method to incorporate partial transpose within random matrix theory and formulate a perturbation theory in $1/L$, the inverse of the Hilbert space dimension. We compute several quantities including the spectral density of partial transpose (or entanglement negativity spectrum), two-point correlator of eigenvalues, and the logarithmic negativity. As long as the bath is smaller than the system, we find that upon sweeping the subregion size, the logarithmic negativity shows an initial increase and a final decrease similar to the Page curve, while it admits a plateau in the intermediate regime where the logarithmic negativity only depends on the size of the system and of the bath but not on how the system is partitioned. This intermediate phase has no analog in random pure states, and is separated from the two other regimes by a critical point. We further show that when the bath is larger than the system by at least two extra qubits the logarithmic negativity is identically zero which implies that there is no distillable entanglement. Using the diagrammatic approach, we provide a simple derivation of the semi-circle law of the entanglement negativity spectrum in the latter two regimes. We show that despite the appearance of a semicircle distribution, reminiscent of Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), the higher order corrections to the negativity spectrum and two-point correlator deviate from those of GUE.",

    "abstract": "Experimental results are presented on the efficiency limits for a quantum interface between a matterbased qubit and a photonic qubit. Using a trapped ion in an optical cavity, we obtain a single ion-entangled photon at the cavity output with a probability of 0.69(3). The performance of our system is shown to saturate the upper limit to photon-collection probability from a quantum emitter in a cavity, set by the emitter’s electronic structure and by the cavity parameters. The probability for generating and detecting the ion-entangled fiber-coupled photon is 0.462(3), a fivefold increase over the previous best performance. Finally, the generation and detection of up to 15 sequential polarized photons demonstrates the ability of a trapped ion to serve as a multiphoton source. The comparison between measured probabilities and predicted bounds is relevant for quantum emitters beyond trapped ions, in particular, for the design of future systems optimizing photon collection from, and absorption in, quantum matter.",

    "abstract": "Modular networks are a promising paradigm for increasingly complex quantum devices based on the ability to transfer qubits and generate entanglement between modules. These tasks require a low-loss, high-speed intermodule link that enables extensible network connectivity. Satisfying these demands simultaneously remains an outstanding goal for long-range optical quantum networks as well as modular superconducting processors within a single cryostat. We demonstrate communication and entanglement in a superconducting network with a microwave-actuated beamsplitter transformation between two bosonic qubits, which are housed in separate modules and joined by a demountable coaxial bus resonator. We transfer a qubit in a multi-photon encoding and track photon loss events to improve the fidelity, making it as high as in a single-photon encoding. Furthermore, generating entanglement with two-photon interference and postselection against loss errors produces a Bell state with success probability 79% and fidelity 0.94, halving the error obtained with a single photon. These capabilities demonstrate several promising methods for faithful operations between modules, including novel possibilities for resource-efficient direct gates.",

    "abstract": "Quantum random access memory (QRAM)--memory which stores classical data but allows queries to be performed in superposition--is required for the implementation of numerous quantum algorithms. While naive implementations of QRAM are highly susceptible to decoherence and hence not scalable, it has been argued that the bucket brigade QRAM architecture [Giovannetti et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 160501 (2008)] is highly resilient to noise, with the infidelity of a query scaling only logarithmically with the memory size. In prior analyses, however, this favorable scaling followed directly from the use of contrived noise models, thus leaving open the question of whether experimental implementations would actually enjoy the purported scaling advantage. In this work, we study the effects of decoherence on QRAM in full generality. Our main result is a proof that this favorable infidelity scaling holds for arbitrary error channels (including, e.g., depolarizing noise and coherent errors). Our proof identifies the origin of this noise resilience as the limited entanglement among the memory's components, and it also reveals that significant architectural simplifications can be made while preserving the noise resilience. We verify these results numerically using a novel classical algorithm for the efficient simulation of noisy QRAM circuits. Our findings indicate that QRAM can be implemented with existing hardware in realistically noisy devices, and that high-fidelity queries are possible without quantum error correction. Furthermore, we also prove that the benefits of the bucket-brigade architecture persist when quantum error correction is used, in which case the scheme offers improved hardware efficiency and resilience to logical errors.",

In this paper we propose a coherent excitation scheme using off-resonant pulses. In the usual Rabi scheme, these pulses would not lead to a significant occupation. This is overcome by using a frequency modulated pulse to swing up the excited state population. The same effect can be obtained using two pulses with different strong detunings of the same sign. We theoretically analyze the applicability of the scheme to a semiconductor quantum dot. In this case the excitation is several meV below the band gap, i.e., far away from the detection frequency allowing for easy spectral filtering, and does not rely on any auxiliary particles such as phonons. Our scheme has the potential to lead to the generation of close-to-ideal photons.",

In the pursuit of the tantalizing promises of a universal quantum computer, a multitude of new knowledge and expertise has been developed, enabling the construction of novel quantum algorithms as well as increasingly robust quantum hardware. In particular, we have witnessed rapid progress in the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) technology, which has emerged as one of the most promising physical systems that is capable of addressing the key challenges in realizing full-stack quantum computing on a large scale.

    "abstract": "Optically addressable paramagnetic defects in wide-band-gap semiconductors are promising platforms for quantum communications and sensing. The presence of avoided crossings between the electronic levels of these defects can substantially alter their quantum dynamics and be both detrimental and beneficial for quantum information applications. Avoided crossings give rise to clock transitions, which can significantly improve protection from magnetic noise and favorably increase coherence time. However, the reduced coupling between electronic and nuclear spins at an avoided crossing may be detrimental to applications where nuclear spins act as quantum memories. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental study of the quantum dynamics of paramagnetic defects interacting with a nuclear spin bath at avoided crossings. We develop a computational approach based on a generalization of the cluster expansion technique, which can account for processes beyond pure dephasing and describe the dynamics of any solid-state spin-qubits near avoided crossings. Using this approach and experimental validation, we determine the change in nature and source of noise at avoided crossings for divacancies in SiC. We find that we can condition the clock transition of the divacancies in SiC on multiple adjacent nuclear spins states. In our experiments, we demonstrate that one can suppress the effects of fluctuating charge impurities with depletion techniques, leading to an increased coherence time at clock transition, limited purely by magnetic noise. Combined with ab-initio predictions of spin Hamiltonian parameters, the proposed theoretical approach paves the way to designing the coherence properties of spin qubits from first principles.",

The adaptive Bayesian approach to parameter estimation allows for an efficient use of resources thanks to adaptive experiment design. For its practical success fast numerical solutions for the Bayesian update and the adaptive experiment design are crucial. Here we show that neural networks can be trained to become fast and strong experiment-design heuristics using a combination of an evolutionary strategy and reinforcement learning. Neural-network heuristics are shown to outperform established heuristics for the technologically important example of frequency estimation of a qubit that suffers from dephasing. Our method of creating neural-network heuristics is very general and complements the well-studied sequential Monte-Carlo method for Bayesian updates to form a complete framework for adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, the field of quantum machine learning has drawn significant attention due to the prospect of bringing genuine computational advantages to now widespread algorithmic methods. However, not all domains of machine learning have benefited equally from quantum enhancements. Notably, deep learning and reinforcement learning, despite their tremendous success in the classical domain, both individually and combined, remain relatively unaddressed by the quantum community. Arguably, one reason behind this is the systematic use in these domains of models and methods without prominent computational bottlenecks, leaving little room for quantum improvements. In this work, we study the state-of-the-art neural-network approaches for reinforcement learning with quantum enhancements in mind. We demonstrate the substantial learning advantage that models with a sampling bottleneck can provide over conventional neural network architectures in complex learning environments. These so-called energy-based models, like deep energy-based reinforcement learning, and deep projective simulation that we also introduce in this work, effectively allow to trade off learning performance for efficiency of computation. To alleviate the additional computational costs, we propose to leverage future and near-term quantum algorithms, resulting in overall more advantageous learning algorithms. This is achieved using cutting-edge and new quantum computing machinery to speed-up classical sampling methods and by employing generalized models to gain an additional quantum advantage.",

Our approach encodes the field theory as an Ising model, which is then solved by a quantum annealer. As a proof-of-concept, we encode a scalar field theory and measure the probability for it to tunnel from the false to the true vacuum for various tunnelling times, vacuum displacements and potential profiles. The results are in accord with those predicted theoretically, showing that a quantum annealer is a genuine quantum system that can be used as a quantum laboratory. This is the first time it has been possible to experimentally measure instanton processes in a freely chosen quantum field theory. This novel and flexible method to study the dynamics of quantum systems can be applied to any field theory of interest. Experimental measurements of the dynamical behaviour of field theories are independent of theoretical calculations and can be used to infer their properties without being limited by the availability of suitable perturbative or nonperturbative computational methods. In the near future, measurements in such a quantum laboratory could therefore be used to improve theoretical and computational methods conceptually and may enable the measurement and detailed study of previously unobserved quantum phenomena.",

In order to do so, we first put forward a novel method to implement the so called two point measurement scheme, which is at the basis of the study of non-equilibrium energetic exchanges in quantum systems. Like the well-established interferometric method, our method uses an ancillary system, but at variance with it, it provides direct access to the energy exchange statistics, rather than its Fourier transform, thus being extremely more effective. We first experimentally validate our ancilla-assisted two point measurement scheme, and then apply it to i) experimentally verify that fluctuation theorems are robust against projective measurements, a theoretical prediction which was not validated so far, ii) experimentally verify the so called heat engine fluctuation relation, by implementing a SWAP quantum heat engine. iii) experimentally verify that the heat engine fluctuation relation continues to hold in presence of intermediate measurements, by implementing the design at the basis of the so called quantum-measurement-cooling concept. For both engines, we report the measured average heat and work exchanged and single out their operation mode. Our experiments constitute the experimental basis for the understanding of the non-equilibrium energetics of quantum computation and for the implementation of energy management devices on quantum processors.",

Together with significant circuit reduction optimizations and number-preserving post-selection/echo-sequencing error mitigation strategies, the method is found to provide accurate predictions for low-lying eigenspectra in a number of representative molecular systems, while requiring reasonably short circuit depths and modest measurement costs.

Our computer consists of three modules: a 2D array of probabilistic sources of GKP states; a depth-four circuit of static beamsplitters, phase shifters, and single-time-step delay lines; and a 2D array of homodyne detectors. The symmetry of our proposed circuit allows us to combine the effects of finite squeezing and uniform photon loss within the noise model, resulting in more comprehensive threshold estimates.

    "abstract": "Quantum simulation has wide applications in quantum chemistry and physics. Recently, scientists have begun exploring the use of randomized methods for accelerating quantum simulation. Among them, a simple and powerful technique, called qDRIFT, is known to generate random product formulas for which the average quantum channel approximates the ideal evolution. qDRIFT achieves a gate count that does not explicitly depend on the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, which contrasts with Suzuki formulas. This work aims to understand the origin of this speed-up by comprehensively analyzing a single realization of the random product formula produced by qDRIFT. The main results prove that a typical realization of the randomized product formula approximates the ideal unitary evolution up to a small diamond-norm error. The gate complexity is already independent of the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, but it depends on the system size and the sum of the interaction strengths in the Hamiltonian. Remarkably, the same random evolution starting from an arbitrary, but fixed, input state yields a much shorter circuit suitable for that input state. In contrast, in deterministic settings, such an improvement usually requires initial state knowledge. The proofs depend on concentration inequalities for vector and matrix martingales, and the framework is applicable to other randomized product formulas. Our bounds are saturated by certain commuting Hamiltonians.",

    "abstract": "An arbitrary operator corresponding to a physical observable cannot be measured in a single measurement on currently available quantum hardware. To obtain the expectation value of the observable, one needs to partition its operator to measurable fragments. The number of such fragments can grow quite rapidly with the size of the system, thus, finding grouping techniques minimizing the number of fragments is crucial for efficient extraction of information from the quantum system. We provide a unified Lie algebraic framework for developing efficient measurement schemes for quantum observables, it is based on two elements: 1) embedding the observable operator in a Lie algebra and 2) transforming Lie algebra elements into those of a Cartan sub-algebra (CSA) using unitary operators from the corresponding Lie group. The CSA plays the central role because all its elements are mutually commutative and thus can be measured simultaneously. We illustrate the framework on measuring expectation values of Hamiltonians appearing in the Variational Quantum Eigensolver approach to quantum chemistry. The CSA approach puts many recently proposed methods for the measurement optimization within a single framework. It also allowed us to reduce the number of measurable groups up to three-fold compared to the best previous method by Huggins $et~ al.$ arXiv:1907.13117.",

    "abstract": "We present a numerically exact method to compute the full counting statistics of heat transfer in non-Markovian open quantum systems, which is based on the time-evolving matrix product operator algorithm. This approach is applied to the paradigmatic spin-boson model in order to calculate the mean and fluctuations of the heat transferred to the environment during thermal equilibration. We show that system-reservoir correlations make a significant contribution to the heat statistics at low temperature and present a variational theory that quantitatively explains our numerical results. We also demonstrate a fluctuation-dissipation relation connecting the mean and variance of the heat distribution at high temperature. Our results reveal that system-bath interactions make a significant contribution to heat transfer even when the dynamics of the open system is effectively Markovian. The method presented here provides a flexible and general tool to predict the fluctuations of heat transfer in open quantum systems in nonperturbative regimes.",

Their practical applicability, however, strongly depends on how many times their circuits need to be executed for sufficiently reducing shot-noise. We consider metric-aware quantum algorithms: variational algorithms that use a quantum computer to efficiently estimate both a matrix and a vector object. For example, the recently introduced quantum natural gradient approach uses the quantum Fisher information matrix as a metric tensor to correct the gradient vector for the co-dependence of the circuit parameters. We rigorously characterise and upper bound the number of measurements required to determine an iteration step to a fixed precision, and propose a general approach for optimally distributing samples between matrix and vector entries. Finally, we establish that the number of circuit repetitions needed for estimating the quantum Fisher information matrix is asymptotically negligible for an increasing number of iterations and qubits.",

In this paradigm, it is postulated that all information entering a black hole is rapidly and chaotically distributed across the event horizon making it impossible to reconstruct the information by means of any local measurement. However, in this scenario the effects of decoherence are typically ignored, which may render information scrambling moot in cosmological settings. In this work, we develop key steps towards a thermodynamic description of information scrambling in open quantum systems. In particular, we separate the entropy production into contributions arising from scrambling and decoherence, for which we derive statements of the second law. This is complemented with a numerical study of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev, Maldacena-Qi, XXX, mixed field Ising, Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models in the presence of decoherence in energy or computational basis.",

    "abstract": "Quantum supermaps are transformations that map quantum operations to quantum operations. It is known that quantum supermaps which respect a definite, predefined causal order between their input operations correspond to fixed-order quantum circuits. A systematic understanding of the physical interpretation of more general types of quantum supermaps--in particular, those incompatible with a definite causal structure--is however lacking. Here we identify two new types of circuits that naturally generalise the fixed-order case and that likewise correspond to distinct classes of quantum supermaps, which we fully characterise. We first introduce\"quantum circuits with classical control of causal order\", in which the order of operations is still well-defined, but not necessarily fixed in advance: it can in particular be established dynamically, in a classically-controlled manner, as the circuit is being used. We then consider\"quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order\", in which the order of operations is controlled coherently. The supermaps described by these classes of circuits are physically realisable, and the latter encompasses all known examples of physically realisable processes with indefinite causal order, including the celebrated\"quantum switch\". Interestingly, it also contains new examples arising from the combination of dynamical and coherent control of causal order, and we detail explicitly one such process. Nevertheless, we show that quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order can only generate\"causal\"correlations, compatible with a well-defined causal order. We furthermore extend our considerations to probabilistic circuits that produce also classical outcomes, and we demonstrate by an example how our characterisations allow us to identify new advantages for quantum information processing tasks that could be demonstrated in practice.",

Contrary to variational quantum algorithms, PQE optimizes a trial state using residuals (projections of the Schrödinger equation) rather than energy gradients. We show that the residuals may be evaluated by simply measuring two energy expectation values per element. We also introduce a selected variant of PQE (SPQE) that uses an adaptive ansatz built from arbitrary-order particle-hole operators and circumvents the expensive gradient-based selection procedures used in adaptive variational quantum algorithms. PQE and SPQE are tested on a set of molecular systems covering both the weak and strong correlation regimes, including hydrogen clusters with 4–10 atoms and the BeH2 molecule. When employing a fixed ansatz, we find that PQE can converge UCC wave functions to essentially identical energies as variational optimization while requiring fewer computational resources. A comparison of SPQE and adaptive variational quantum algorithms shows that—for ansätze containing the same number of parameters—the two methods yield results of comparable accuracy. Finally, we show that SPQE performs similar to, and in some cases, better than selected configuration interaction and the density matrix renormalization group on 1–3 dimensional strongly correlated H10 systems.",

Remarkably, we demonstrate that this EP corresponds to a regime of critical decay for the quantum thermal machine towards its steady state, bearing a striking resemblance with a critically damped harmonic oscillator.

    "abstract": "Despite being at the heart of the theory of the \"Big Bang\" and cosmic inflation, the quantum field theory prediction of false vacuum tunneling has not been tested. To address the exponential complexity of the problem, a table-top quantum simulator in the form of an engineered Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) has been proposed to give dynamical solutions of the quantum field equations. In this paper, we give a numerical feasibility study of the BEC quantum simulator under realistic conditions and temperatures, with an approximate truncated Wigner (tW) phase-space method. We report the observation of false vacuum tunneling in these simulations, and the formation of multiple bubble 'universes' with distinct topological properties. The tunneling gives a transition of the relative phase of coupled Bose fields from a metastable to a stable 'vacuum'. We include finite temperature effects that would be found in a laboratory experiment and also analyze the cut-off dependence of modulational instabilities in Floquet space. Our numerical phase-space model does not use thin-wall approximations, which are inapplicable to cosmologically interesting models. It is expected to give the correct quantum treatment including superpositions and entanglement during dynamics. By analyzing a nonlocal observable called the topological phase entropy (TPE), our simulations provide information about phase structure in the true vacuum. We observe a cooperative effect in which the true vacua bubbles representing distinct universes each have one or the other of two distinct topologies. The TPE initially increases with time, reaching a peak as the multiple universes are formed, and then decreases with time to the phase-ordered vacuum state. This gives a model for the formation of universes with one of two distinct phases, which is a possible solution to the problem of particle-antiparticle asymmetry.",

In the dispersive regime, the large coupling strength at the DQD hybridisation point produces a frequency shift comparable to the resonator linewidth, the optimal setting for maximum state visibility. We exploit this regime to demonstrate rapid gate-based readout of the charge degree of freedom, with an SNR of 3.3 in 50 ns.

In this work, we develop intuitive constructions for a large class of these algorithms based on connections to simple dynamics of quantum systems, quantum walks, and classical continuous relaxations. We focus on developing a language and tools connected with kinetic energy on a graph for understanding the physical mechanisms of success and failure to guide algorithmic improvement. This physical language, in combination with uniqueness results related to unitarity, allow us to identify some potential pitfalls from kinetic energy fundamentally opposing the goal of optimization. This is connected to effects from wavefunction confinement, phase randomization, and shadow defects lurking in the objective far away from the ideal solution. As an example, we explore the surprising deficiency of many quantum methods in solving uncoupled spin problems and how this is both predictive of performance on some more complex systems while immediately suggesting simple resolutions. Further examination of canonical problems like the Hamming ramp or bush of implications show that entanglement can be strictly detrimental to performance results from the underlying mechanism of solution in approaches like QAOA. Kinetic energy and graph Laplacian perspectives provide new insights to common initialization and optimal solutions in QAOA as well as new methods for more effective layerwise training. Connections to classical methods of continuous extensions, homotopy methods, and iterated rounding suggest new directions for research in quantum optimization. Throughout, we unveil many pitfalls and mechanisms in quantum optimization using a physical perspective, which aim to spur the development of novel quantum optimization algorithms and refinements.",

    "abstract": "The existence of quantum error correcting codes is one of the most counterintuitive and potentially technologically important discoveries of quantum information theory. However, standard error correction refers to abstract quantum information, i.e., information that is independent of the physical incarnation of the systems used for storing the information. There are, however, other forms of information that are physical - one of the most ubiquitous being reference frame information. Here we analyze the problem of error correcting physical information. The basic question we seek to answer is whether or not such error correction is possible and, if so, what limitations govern the process. The main challenge is that the systems used for transmitting physical information, in addition to any actions applied to them, must necessarily obey these limitations. Encoding and decoding operations that obey a restrictive set of limitations need not exist a priori. We focus on the case of erasure errors, and we first show that the problem is equivalent to quantum error correction using group-covariant encodings. We prove a no-go theorem showing that that no finite dimensional, group-covariant quantum codes exist for Lie groups with an infinitesimal generator (e.g., U(1), SU(2), and SO(3)). We then explain how one can circumvent this no-go theorem using infinite dimensional codes, and we give an explicit example of a covariant quantum error correcting code using continuous variables for the group U(1). Finally, we demonstrate that all finite groups have finite dimensional codes, giving both an explicit construction and a randomized approximate construction with exponentially better parameters.",

Here, we derive a master equation that explicitly accounts for system-bath correlations and includes, at a coarse-grained level, a dynamically evolving bath. Such a master equation applies to a wide variety of physical systems including those described by Random Matrix Theory or the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. We obtain a local detailed balance condition which, interestingly, does not forbid the emergence of stable negative temperature states in unison with the definition of temperature through the Boltzmann entropy. We benchmark the master equation against the exact evolution and observe a very good agreement in a situation where the conventional Born-Markov-secular master equation breaks down. Interestingly, the present description of the dynamics is robust and it remains accurate even if some of the assumptions are relaxed. Even though our master equation describes a dynamically evolving bath not described by a Gibbs state, we provide a consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic framework and derive the first and second law as well as the Clausius inequality. Our work paves the way for studying a variety of nanoscale quantum technologies including engines, refrigerators, or heat pumps beyond the conventionally employed assumption of a static thermal bath.",

It is usually challenging to obtain analytical expressions for it because most calculation methods rely on the diagonalization of the density matrix. In this paper, we derive general expressions for the quantum Fisher information matrix which bypass matrix diagonalization and do not require the expansion of operators on an orthonormal set of states. Additionally, we can tackle density matrices of arbitrary rank. The methods presented here simplify analytical calculations considerably when, for example, the density matrix is more naturally expressed in terms of non-orthogonal states, such as coherent states. Our derivation relies on two matrix inverses which, in principle, can be evaluated analytically even when the density matrix is not diagonalizable in closed form. We demonstrate the power of our approach by deriving novel results in the timely field of discrete quantum imaging: the estimation of positions and intensities of incoherent point sources. We find analytical expressions for the full estimation problem of two point sources with different intensities, and for specific examples with three point sources. We expect that our method will become standard in quantum metrology.",

Here, we show how the Hamiltonian operator can be approximated as a sum propagators using a differential representation. We describe how this strategy can be used in the hybrid quantum-classical workflow, and perform energy measurements. Benchmarking the measurement scheme, we discuss the relevance of discretization step size, stencil order, number of measurements, and noise. We also use the proposed Hamiltonian operator approximation (HOA) to prepare ground states of complex material science models with direct iteration and quantum filter diagonalization, finding the lowest energy for the 12-qubit Hamiltonian of hydrogen chain H$_6$ with $10^{-5}$ Hartree precision using 11 time-evolved reference states.",

    "abstract": "In most quantum sensing schemes, interactions between the constituent particles of the sensor are expected to lead to thermalisation and degraded sensitivity. However, recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that the phenomenon of quantum many-body scarring can slow down, or even prevent thermalisation. We show that scarring can be exploited for quantum sensing that is robust against certain strong interactions. In the ideal case of perfect scars with harmonic energy gaps, the optimal sensing time can diverge despite the strong interactions. We demonstrate the idea with two examples: a spin-1 model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and a spin-1/2 mixed-field Ising model. We also briefly discuss some non-ideal perturbations, and the addition of periodic controls to suppress their effect on sensing.",

    "abstract": "While artificially fabricated patterned metasurfaces are providing paradigm-shifting optical components for classical light manipulation, strongly interacting, controllable, and deterministic quantum interfaces between light and matter in free space remain an outstanding challenge. Here we theoretically demonstrate how to achieve quantum control of both the electric and magnetic components of an incident single-photon pulse by engineering the collective response of a two-dimensional atomic array. High-fidelity absorption and storage in a long-lived subradiant state, and its subsequent retrieval, are achieved by controlling classically or quantum mechanically the ac Stark shifts of the atomic levels and suppressing the scattering during the absorption. Quantum wavefront control of the transmitted photon with nearly zero reflection is prepared by coupling the collective state of the array to another photon in a cavity and by engineering a Huygens' surface of atoms using only a single coherent standing wave. The proposed schemes allow for the generation of entanglement between the cavity, the lattice, and hence the state of the stored, reflected or transmitted light, and for quantum-state transfer between the cavity and propagating photons. Bipartite entanglement generation is explicitly calculated between a stored single-photon excitation of the array and the cavity photon. We illustrate the control by manipulating the phase, phase superposition, polarization, and direction of a transmitted or reflected photon, providing quantum-optical switches and functional quantum interfaces between light and atoms that could form links in a larger quantum information platform.",

We present a two-by-two array of four singlet-triplet qubits in gallium arsenide and show simultaneous coherent operations and four-qubit measurements via exchange oscillations and frequency-multiplexed single-shot measurements.

Here, we present a general procedure that combines two types of geometry -- holonomy loops on the Bloch sphere and geometric space curves in three dimensions -- to design gates that simultaneously suppress pulse errors and transverse noise errors. We demonstrate this doubly geometric control technique by designing explicit examples of such dynamically corrected holonomic gates.",

    "abstract": "Near-term quantum computers are limited by the decoherence of qubits to only being able to run low-depth quantum circuits with acceptable ﬁdelity. This severely restricts what quantum algorithms can be compiled and implemented on such devices. One way to overcome these limitations is to expand the available gate set from single- and two-qubit gates to multiqubit gates, which entangle three or more qubits in a single step. Here, we show that such multiqubit gates can be realized by the simultaneous application of multiple two-qubit gates to a group of qubits where at least one qubit is involved in two or more of the two-qubit gates. Multiqubit gates implemented in this way are as fast as, or sometimes even faster than, the constituent two-qubit gates. Furthermore, these multiqubit gates do not require any modiﬁcation of the quantum processor, but are ready to be used in current quantum-computing platforms. We demonstrate this idea for two speciﬁc cases: simultaneous controlled- Z gates and simultaneous i SWAP gates. We show how the resulting multiqubit gates relate to other well-known multiqubit gates and demonstrate through numerical simulations that they would work well in available quantum hardware, reaching gate ﬁdelities well above 99%. We also present schemes for using these simultaneous two-qubit gates to swiftly create large entangled states like Dicke and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. DOI: 10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040348",

They are, of course, also very well studied in biology, chemistry, ecology, geology, finance, physics, and many more fields of natural and social sciences. When it comes to quantum stochastic processes, however, the topic is plagued with pathological issues that have led to fierce debates amongst researchers. Recent developments have begun to untangle these issues and paved the way for generalizing the theory of classical stochastic processes to the quantum domain without ambiguities. This tutorial details the structure of quantum stochastic processes, in terms of the modern language of quantum combs, and is aimed at students in quantum physics and quantum information theory. We begin with the basics of classical stochastic processes and generalize the same ideas to the quantum domain. Along the way, we discuss the subtle structure of quantum physics that has led to troubles in forming an overarching theory for quantum stochastic processes. We close the tutorial by laying out many exciting problems that lie ahead in this branch of science.",

One of the most important classes of noise channels is the class of Pauli channels, for reasons of both theoretical tractability and experimental relevance. Here we present a practical algorithm for estimating the $s$ nonzero Pauli error rates in an $s$-sparse, $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel, or more generally the $s$ largest Pauli error rates. The algorithm comes with rigorous recovery guarantees and uses only $O(n^2)$ measurements, $O(s n^2)$ classical processing time, and Clifford quantum circuits. We experimentally validate a heuristic version of the algorithm that uses simplified Clifford circuits on data from an IBM 14-qubit superconducting device and our open source implementation. These data show that accurate and precise estimation of the probability of arbitrary-weight Pauli errors is possible even when the signal is two orders of magnitude below the measurement noise floor.",

    "abstract": "Fault-tolerant quantum computation is the only known route to large-scale, accurate quantum computers. Fault tolerance schemes prescribe how, by investing more physical resources and scaling up the size of the computer, we can keep the computational errors in check and carry out more and more accurate calculations. Underlying all such schemes is the assumption that the error per physical gate is independent of the size of the quantum computer. This, unfortunately, is not reflective of current quantum computing experiments. Here, we examine the general consequences on fault-tolerant quantum computation when constraints on physical resources, such as limited energy input, result in physical error rates that grow as the computer grows. In this case, fault tolerance schemes can no longer reduce computational error to an arbitrarily small number, even if one starts below the so-called fault tolerance noise threshold. Instead, there is a minimum attainable computational error, beyond which further growth of the computer in an attempt to reduce the error becomes counter-productive. We discuss simple, but rather generic, situations in which this effect can arise, and highlight the areas of future developments needed for experiments to overcome this limitation.",

Nevertheless, there remain physical properties of such models for which analytic results are unavailable, and which are also not well-described by approximate numerical methods. Preparing Bethe ansatz eigenstates directly on a quantum computer would allow straightforward extraction of these quantities via measurement. We present a quantum algorithm for preparing Bethe ansatz eigenstates of the spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain that correspond to real-valued solutions of the Bethe equations. The algorithm is polynomial in the number of T gates and circuit depth, with modest constant prefactors. Although the algorithm is probabilistic, with a success rate that decreases with increasing eigenstate energy, we employ amplitude amplification to boost the success probability. The resource requirements for our approach are lower than other state-of-the-art quantum simulation algorithms for small error-corrected devices, and thus may offer an alternative and computationally less-demanding demonstration of quantum advantage for physically relevant problems.",

    "abstract": "The ability to perform gates in multiqubit systems that are robust to noise is of crucial importance for the advancement of quantum information technologies. However, finding control pulses that cancel noise while performing a gate is made difficult by the intractability of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, especially in multiqubit systems. Here, we show that this issue can be sidestepped by using a formalism in which the cumulative error during a gate is represented geometrically as a curve in a multi-dimensional Euclidean space. Cancellation of noise errors to leading order corresponds to closure of the curve, a condition that can be satisfied without solving the Schrodinger equation. We develop and uncover general properties of this geometric formalism, and derive a recursion relation that maps control fields to curvatures for Hamiltonians of arbitrary dimension. We demonstrate examples by using the geometric method to design dynamically corrected gates for a class of two-qubit Hamiltonians that is relevant for both superconducting transmon qubits and semiconductor spin qubits. We propose this geometric formalism as a general technique for pulse-induced error suppression in quantum computing gate operations.",

In addition, the device is robust against a wide variety of signal variations (e.g. wavelength, pulse width), which is important for implementation security. Moreover, we experimentally show that the proposed device does not compromise quantum communication signals, in that it has only a very minimal impact (if not, negligible impact) on the intensity, phase, or polarization degrees of freedom of the photon, thus making it suitable for general communication purposes. To show its practical utility for quantum cryptography, we demonstrate and discuss three potential applications: (1) measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with enhanced security against a general class of Trojan-horse attacks, (2) using the power limiter as a countermeasure against bright illumination attacks, and (3) the application of power limiters to potentially enhance the implementation security of plug-and-play quantum key distribution.",

    "abstract": "Quantum many-body systems are characterized by patterns of correlations that define highly-non trivial manifolds when interpreted as data structures. Physical properties of phases and phase transitions are typically retrieved via simple correlation functions, that are related to observable response functions. Recent experiments have demonstrated capabilities to fully characterize quantum many-body systems via wave-function snapshots, opening new possibilities to analyze quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce a method to data mine the correlation structure of quantum partition functions via their path integral (or equivalently, stochastic series expansion) manifold. We characterize path-integral manifolds generated via state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo methods utilizing the intrinsic dimension (ID) and the variance of distances from nearest neighbors (NN): the former is related to dataset complexity, while the latter is able to diagnose connectivity features of points in configuration space. We show how these properties feature universal patterns in the vicinity of quantum criticality, that reveal how data structures {\\it simplify} systematically at quantum phase transitions. This is further reflected by the fact that both ID and variance of NN-distances exhibit universal scaling behavior in the vicinity of second-order and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical points. Finally, we show how non-Abelian symmetries dramatically influence quantum data sets, due to the nature of (non-commuting) conserved charges in the quantum case. Complementary to neural network representations, our approach represents a first, elementary step towards a systematic characterization of path integral manifolds before any dimensional reduction is taken, that is informative about universal behavior and complexity, and can find immediate application to both experiments and Monte Carlo simulations.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the quantum complexity of local random quantum circuits is a very deep problem with implications to the seemingly disparate fields of quantum information theory, quantum many-body physics and high energy physics. While our theoretical understanding of these systems has progressed in recent years, numerical approaches for studying these models remains severely limited. In this paper, we discuss a special class of numerically tractable quantum circuits, known as quantum automaton circuits, which may be particularly well suited for this task. These are circuits which preserve the computational basis, yet can produce highly entangled output wave functions. Using ideas from quantum complexity theory, especially those concerning unitary designs, we argue that automaton wave functions have high quantum state complexity. We look at a wide variety of metrics, including measurements of the output bit-string distribution and characterization of the generalized entanglement properties of the quantum state, and find that automaton wave functions closely approximate the behavior of fully Haar random states. In addition to this, we identify the generalized out-of-time ordered 2k-point correlation functions as a particularly useful probe of complexity in automaton circuits. Using these correlators, we are able to numerically study the growth of complexity well beyond the scrambling time for very large systems. As a result, we are able to present evidence of a linear growth of design complexity in local quantum circuits, consistent with conjectures from quantum information theory.",

    "abstract": "We discuss conditions under which it would be possible for a modest fault-tolerant quantum computer to realize a runtime advantage by executing a quantum algorithm with only a small polynomial speedup over the best classical alternative. The challenge is that the computation must finish within a reasonable amount of time while being difficult enough that the small quantum scaling advantage would compensate for the large constant factor overheads associated with error-correction. We compute several examples of such runtimes using state-of-the-art surface code constructions for superconducting qubits under a variety of assumptions. We conclude that quadratic speedups will not enable quantum advantage on early generations of such fault-tolerant devices unless there is a significant improvement in how we would realize quantum error-correction. While this conclusion persists even if we were to increase the rate of logical gates in the surface code by more than an order of magnitude, we also repeat this analysis for speedups by other polynomial degrees and find that quartic speedups look significantly more practical.",

    "abstract": "We describe quantum circuits with only $\\widetilde{\\cal O}(N)$ Toffoli complexity that block encode the spectra of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians in a basis of $N$ arbitrary (e.g., molecular) orbitals. With ${\\cal O}(\\lambda / \\epsilon)$ repetitions of these circuits one can use phase estimation to sample in the molecular eigenbasis, where $\\lambda$ is the 1-norm of Hamiltonian coefficients and $\\epsilon$ is the target precision. This is the lowest complexity that has been shown for quantum computations of chemistry within an arbitrary basis. Furthermore, up to logarithmic factors, this matches the scaling of the most efficient prior block encodings that can only work with orthogonal basis functions diagonalizing the Coloumb operator (e.g., the plane wave dual basis). Our key insight is to factorize the Hamiltonian using a method known as tensor hypercontraction (THC) and then to transform the Coulomb operator into an isospectral diagonal form with a non-orthogonal basis defined by the THC factors. We then use qubitization to simulate the non-orthogonal THC Hamiltonian, in a fashion that avoids most complications of the non-orthogonal basis. We also reanalyze and reduce the cost of several of the best prior algorithms for these simulations in order to facilitate a clear comparison to the present work. In addition to having lower asymptotic scaling spacetime volume, compilation of our algorithm for challenging finite-sized molecules such as FeMoCo reveals that our method requires the least fault-tolerant resources of any known approach. By laying out and optimizing the surface code resources required of our approach we show that FeMoCo can be simulated using about four million physical qubits and under four days of runtime, assuming $1\\,${\\textmu}s cycle times and physical gate error rates no worse than $0.1\\%$.",

We present a passivity deformation methodology that sets constraints on the evolution of such quantum devices. The approach yields bounds that are often tighter, and thus more predictive, than the quantum microscopic analogue of the second law of thermodynamics. In particular, (i) it yields tight bounds even when the environment is microscopic; (ii) it successfully handles the ultracold limit; (iii) it enables one to account for constrained dynamics; and (iv) it bounds observables that do not appear in the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, this framework provides insights into nonthermal environments, correlated environments, coarse graining in microscopic setups, and the ability to detect heat leaks. Our findings can be explored and used in physical setups such as trapped ions, superconducting circuits, neutral atoms in optical lattices, and more.7 MoreReceived 5 March 2020Revised 4 September 2020Accepted 26 January 2021DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.010336Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

These approaches so far lacked a rigorous mathematical justification, since existing approximations to thermal states and time evolution demand a bond dimension growing with system size. To address this problem, we construct PEPOs that approximate, for all local observables, $i)$ their thermal expectation values and $ii)$ their Heisenberg time evolution. The bond dimension required does not depend on system size, but only on the temperature or time. We also show how these can be used to approximate thermal correlation functions and expectation values in quantum quenches.",

    "abstract": "Methods for modeling large driven dissipative quantum systems are becoming increasingly urgent due to recent experimental progress in a number of photonic platforms. We demonstrate the positive-P method to be ideal for this purpose across a wide range of parameters, focusing on the archetypal driven dissipative Bose-Hubbard model. Notably, these parameters include intermediate regimes where interactions and dissipation are comparable, and especially cases with low occupations for which common semiclassical approximations can break down. The presence of dissipation can alleviate instabilities in the method that are known to occur for closed systems, allowing the simulation of dynamics up to and including the steady state. Throughout the parameter space of the model, we determine the magnitude of dissipation that is sufficient to make the method useful and stable, finding its region of applicability to be complementary to that of truncated Wigner. We then demonstrate its use in a number of examples with nontrivial quantum correlations, including a demonstration of solving the urgent open problem of large and highly non-uniform systems with even tens of thousands of sites.",

We show that such systems can nonetheless exhibit a hidden time-reversal symmetry which most directly manifests itself in a doubled version of the original system prepared in an appropriate entangled thermofield double state. This hidden time-reversal symmetry has a direct operational utility: it provides a general method for finding exact solutions of non-trivial steady states. Special cases of this approach include the coherent quantum absorber and complex-$P$ function methods from quantum optics. We also show that hidden TRS has observable consequences even in single-system experiments, and can be broken by the non-trivial combination of nonlinearity, thermal fluctuations, and driving. To illustrate our ideas, we analyze concrete examples of driven qubits and nonlinear cavities. These systems exhibit hidden time-reversal symmetry but not conventional detailed balance.",

More generally, we can see the violation of a Bell inequality as witnessing the impossibility of explaining quantum correlations with classical causal models. The violation of a Bell inequality, however, does not exclude classical models where some level of measurement dependence is allowed, that is, the choice made by observers can be correlated with the source generating the systems to be measured. Here, we show that the level of measurement dependence can be quantitatively upper bounded if we arrange the Bell test within a network. Furthermore, we also prove that these results can be adapted in order to derive nonlinear Bell inequalities for a large class of causal networks and to identify quantumly realizable correlations that violate them.",

Lett. 126, 171603 (2021)], where the relative entropy was used to distinguish random states drawn from the Wishart ensemble as well as black hole microstates. In this work, we expand these ideas by computing many generalizations including the Petz Rényi relative entropy, sandwiched Rényi relative entropy, fidelities, and trace distances. These generalized quantities are able to teach us about new structures in the space of random states and black hole microstates where the von Neumann and relative entropies were insufficient. We further generalize to generic random tensor networks where new phenomena arise due to the locality in the networks. These phenomena sharpen the relationship between holographic states and random tensor networks. We discuss the implications of our results on the black hole information problem using replica wormholes, specifically the state dependence (hair) in Hawking radiation. Understanding the differences between Hawking radiation of distinct evaporating black holes is an important piece of the information problem that was not addressed by entropy calculations using the island formula. We interpret our results in the language of quantum hypothesis testing and the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), deriving that chaotic (including holographic) systems obey subsystem ETH for all subsystems less than half the total system size. ar X iv :2 10 8. 00 01 1v 1 [ he pth ] 3 0 Ju l 2 02 1",

    "abstract": "Bosonic qubits are a promising route to building fault-tolerant quantum computers on a variety of physical platforms. Studying the performance of bosonic qubits under realistic gates and measurements is challenging with existing analytical and numerical tools. We present a novel formalism for simulating classes of states that can be represented as linear combinations of Gaussian functions in phase space. This formalism allows us to analyze and simulate a wide class of non-Gaussian states, transformations and measurements. We demonstrate how useful classes of bosonic qubits— Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP), cat, and Fock states—can be simulated using this formalism, opening the door to investigating the behaviour of bosonic qubits under Gaussian channels and measurements, non-Gaussian transformations such as those achieved via gate teleportation, and important non-Gaussian measurements such as threshold and photon-number detection. Our formalism enables simulating these situations with levels of accuracy that are not feasible with existing methods. Finally, we use a method informed by our formalism to simulate circuits critical to the study of fault-tolerant quantum computing with bosonic qubits but beyond the reach of existing techniques. Specifically, we examine how finite-energy GKP states transform under realistic qubit phase gates; interface with a CV cluster state; and transform under non-Clifford T gate teleportation using magic states. We implement our simulation method as a part of the open-source Strawberry Fields Python library.",

    "abstract": "The concept of quantum complexity has far-reaching implications spanning theoretical computer science, quantum many-body physics, and high energy physics. The quantum complexity of a unitary transformation or quantum state is defined as the size of the shortest quantum computation that executes the unitary or prepares the state. It is reasonable to expect that the complexity of a quantum state governed by a chaotic many-body Hamiltonian grows linearly with time for a time that is exponential in the system size; however, because it is hard to rule out a short-cut that improves the efficiency of a computation, it is notoriously difficult to derive lower bounds on quantum complexity for particular unitaries or states without making additional assumptions. To go further, one may study more generic models of complexity growth. We provide a rigorous connection between complexity growth and unitary $k$-designs, ensembles which capture the randomness of the unitary group. This connection allows us to leverage existing results about design growth to draw conclusions about the growth of complexity. We prove that local random quantum circuits generate unitary transformations whose complexity grows linearly for a long time, mirroring the behavior one expects in chaotic quantum systems and verifying conjectures by Brown and Susskind. Moreover, our results apply under a strong definition of quantum complexity based on optimal distinguishing measurements.",

    "abstract": "Numerous conceptually important quantum algorithms rely on a black-box device known as an oracle, which is typically difficult to construct without knowing the answer to the problem that the algorithm is intended to solve. A notable example is Grover's search algorithm. Here we propose a Grover search for solutions to a class of NP-complete decision problems known as subset sum problems, including the special case of number partitioning. Each problem instance is encoded in the couplings of a set of qubits to a central spin or boson, which enables a realization of the oracle without knowledge of the solution. The algorithm provides a quantum speedup across a known phase transition in the computational complexity of the partition problem, and we identify signatures of the phase transition in the simulated performance. We propose and analyze implementation schemes with cold atoms, including Rydberg-atom and cavity-QED platforms.",

    "abstract": "The number of measurements demanded by hybrid quantum-classical algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is prohibitively high for many problems of practical value. For such problems, realizing quantum advantage will require methods which dramatically reduce this cost. Previous quantum algorithms that reduce the measurement cost (e.g. quantum amplitude and phase estimation) require error rates that are too low for near-term implementation. Here we propose methods that take advantage of the available quantum coherence to maximally enhance the power of sampling on noisy quantum devices, reducing measurement number and runtime compared to the standard sampling method of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our scheme derives inspiration from quantum metrology, phase estimation, and the more recent \"alpha-VQE\" proposal, arriving at a general formulation that is robust to error and does not require ancilla qubits. The central object of this method is what we call the \"engineered likelihood function\" (ELF), used for carrying out Bayesian inference. We show how the ELF formalism enhances the rate of information gain in sampling as the physical hardware transitions from the regime of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers into that of quantum error corrected ones. This technique speeds up a central component of many quantum algorithms, with applications including chemistry, materials, finance, and beyond. Similar to VQE, we expect small-scale implementations to be realizable on today's quantum devices.",

While recovering the standard frequency-based filter-function formalism as a special instance, this control-adapted generalization affords intrinsic flexibility and allows us to overcome important limitations of existing approaches.

We propose a scheme using two leakage-reduction units (LRUs) that mitigate these issues for a transmon-based surface code, without requiring an overhead in terms of hardware or QEC-cycle time as in previous proposals. For data qubits we consider a microwave drive to transfer leakage to the readout resonator, where it quickly decays, ensuring that this negligibly affects the coherence within the computational subspace for realistic system parameters. For ancilla qubits we apply a $|1\\rangle\\leftrightarrow|2\\rangle$ $\\pi$ pulse conditioned on the measurement outcome. Using density-matrix simulations of the distance-3 surface code we show that the average leakage lifetime is reduced to almost 1 QEC cycle, even when the LRUs are implemented with limited fidelity. Furthermore, we show that this leads to a significant reduction of the logical error rate. This LRU scheme opens the prospect for near-term scalable QEC demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental achievements motivate an ever-growing interest from companies starting to feel the limitations of classical computing. Yet, in light of ongoing privacy scandals, the future availability of quantum computing through remotely accessible servers pose peculiar challenges: Clients with quantum-limited capabilities want their data and algorithms to remain hidden, while being able to verify that their computations are performed correctly. Research in blind and verifiable delegation of quantum computing attempts to address this question. However, available techniques suffer not only from high overheads but also from over-sensitivity: When running on noisy devices, imperfections trigger the same detection mechanisms as malicious attacks, resulting in perpetually aborted computations. Hence, while malicious quantum computers are rendered harmless by blind and verifiable protocols, inherent noise severely limits their usability. \nWe address this problem with an efficient, robust, blind, verifiable scheme to delegate deterministic quantum computations with classical inputs and outputs. We show that: 1) a malicious Server can cheat at most with an exponentially small success probability; 2) in case of sufficiently small noise, the protocol succeeds with a probability exponentially close to 1; 3) the overhead is barely a polynomial number of repetitions of the initial computation interleaved with test runs requiring the same physical resources in terms of memory and gates; 4) the amount of tolerable noise, measured by the probability of failing a test run, can be as high as 25% for some computations and will be generally bounded by 12.5% when using a planar graph resource state. The key points are that security can be provided without universal computation graphs and that, in our setting, full fault-tolerance is not needed to amplify the confidence level exponentially close to 1.",

The precision in the estimation of the range (through the time of arrival) and the velocity (through Doppler frequency shifts) of a target are inversely related to each other, and dictated by the bandwidth of the signal. Here we use the theoretical toolbox of multi-parameter quantum metrology to determine the ultimate precision of the simultaneous estimation of range and velocity. We consider the case of a single target as well as a pair of closely separated targets. In the latter case, we focus on the relative position and velocity. We show that the trade-off between the estimation precision of position and velocity is relaxed for entangled probe states, and is completely lifted in the limit of infinite entanglement. In the regime where the two targets are close to each other, the relative position and velocity can be estimated nearly optimally and jointly, even without entanglement, using the measurements determined by the symmetric logarithmic derivatives.",

Embedding fully-connected graphs - typically found in industrial applications - incurs a quadratic space overhead and thus a significant overhead in the time to solution. Here we investigate this embedding penalty of established planar embedding schemes such as minor embedding on a square lattice, minor embedding on a Chimera graph, and the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller scheme using simulated quantum annealing on classical hardware. Large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation suggest a polynomial time-to-solution overhead. Our results demonstrate that standard analog quantum annealing hardware is at a disadvantage in comparison to classical digital annealers, as well as gate-model quantum annealers and could also serve as benchmark for improvements of the standard quantum annealing protocol.",

    "abstract": "Randomized benchmarking (RB) is a powerful method for determining the error rate of experimental quantum gates. Traditional RB, however, is restricted to gatesets, such as the Clifford group, that form a unitary 2-design. The recently introduced character RB can benchmark more general gates using techniques from representation theory; up to now, however, this method has only been applied to \"multiplicity-free\" groups, a mathematical restriction on these groups. In this paper, we extend the original character RB derivation to explicitly treat non-multiplicity-free groups, and derive several applications. First, we derive a rigorous version of the recently introduced subspace RB, which seeks to characterize a set of one- and two-qubit gates that are symmetric under SWAP. Second, we develop a new leakage RB protocol that applies to more general groups of gates. Finally, we derive a scalable RB protocol for the matchgate group, a group that like the Clifford group is non-universal but becomes universal with the addition of one additional gate. This example provides one of the few examples of a scalable non-Clifford RB protocol. In all three cases, compared to existing theories, our method requires similar resources, but either provides a more accurate estimate of gate fidelity, or applies to a more general group of gates. In conclusion, we discuss the potential, and challenges, of using non-multiplicity-free character RB to develop new classes of scalable RB protocols and methods of characterizing specific gates.",

In particular, we have compared the Ising ($k=2$) anyon and Fibonacci ($k=3$) anyon models, motivated by their potential for future realizations based on Majorana fermion quasiparticles or exotic fractional quantum-Hall states, respectively. The quantum computational performance of the different anyon models is quantified at single qubit level by the difference between a target unitary operator and its approximation realised by anyon braiding. To facilitate efficient comparisons, we have developed a Monte Carlo enhanced Solovay-Kitaev quantum compiler algorithm that finds optimal braid words in polynomial time from the exponentially large search tree. Since universal quantum computation cannot be achieved within the Ising anyon model by braiding alone, we have introduced an additional elementary phase gate to model a non-topological measurement process, which restores universality of the anyon model at the cost of breaking the full topological protection. We model conventional kinds of decoherence processes algorithmically by introducing a controllable noise term to all non-topological gate operations. We find that for reasonable levels of decoherence, even the hybrid Ising anyon model retains a significant topological advantage over a conventional, non-topological, quantum computer. Furthermore, we find that only surprisingly short anyon braids are ever required to be compiled due to the gate noise exceeding the intrinsic error of the braid words already for word lengths of the order of $100$ elementary braids. We conclude that the future for hybrid topological quantum computation remains promising.",

These definitions are shown to satisfy the phenomenological laws of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for a large class of states and processes. The consistency with previous results is demonstrated. The framework applies to multiple baths including particle transport and accounts for processes with, e.g., a changing temperature of the bath, which is determined microscopically.

Here we motivate several, closely related, short depth continuous variable algorithms for quantum compilation. We analyse the trainability of our proposed cost functions and numerically demonstrate our algorithms by learning arbitrary Gaussian operations and Kerr non-linearities. We further make connections between this framework and quantum learning theory in the continuous variable setting by deriving No-Free-Lunch theorems.

Inspired by this paradigm, we consider superconducting architectures and extend the cross-resonance effect, up to first order in perturbation theory, from a pair of qubits to 1D chains and 2D square lattices. In an appropriate reference frame, this results in a purely two-local Hamiltonian comprised of non-commuting interactions. By augmenting the analog Hamiltonian dynamics with single-qubit gates, we generate new families of locally transformed analog Hamiltonians. Toggling between these Hamiltonians, as needed, we design unitary sequences simulating the dynamics of Ising, $XY$, and Heisenberg spin models. Our dynamics simulations are Trotter error-free for the Ising and $XY$ models in 1D. We also show that the Trotter errors for 2D $XY$ and 1D Heisenberg chains are reduced, with respect to a digital decomposition, by a constant factor. Our Hamiltonian toggling techniques could be extended to derive new analog Hamiltonians which may be of use in more complex digital-analog quantum simulations for various models of interacting spins.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Monte Carlo and quantum simulation are both important tools for understanding quantum many-body systems. As a classical algorithm, quantum Monte Carlo suffers from the sign problem, preventing its application to most fermion systems and real time dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel non-variational algorithm using quantum simulation as a subroutine to accelerate quantum Monte Carlo by easing the sign problem. The quantum subroutine can be implemented with shallow circuits and, by incorporating error mitigation, can reduce the Monte Carlo variance by several orders of magnitude even when the circuit noise is significant. As such, the proposed quantum algorithm is applicable to near-term noisy quantum hardware.",

    "abstract": "Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is one of the most important subroutines in quantum computing. In general applications, current QPE algorithms either suffer an exponential time overload or require a set of - notoriously quite fragile - GHZ states. These limitations have prevented so far the demonstration of QPE beyond proof-of-principles. Here we propose a new QPE algorithm that scales linearly with time and is implemented with a cascade of Gaussian spin states (GSS). GSS are renownedly resilient and have been created experimentally in a variety of platforms, from hundreds of ions up to millions of cold/ultracold neutral atoms. We show that our protocol achieves a QPE sensitivity overcoming previous bounds, including those obtained with GHZ states, and is robustly resistant to several sources of noise and decoherence. Our work paves the way toward realistic quantum advantage demonstrations of the QPE, as well as applications of atomic squeezed states for quantum computation.",

    "abstract": "With gate error rates in multiple technologies now below the threshold required for fault-tolerant quantum computation, the major remaining obstacle to useful quantum computation is scaling, a challenge greatly amplified by the huge overhead imposed by quantum error correction itself. We propose a fault-tolerant quantum computing scheme that can nonetheless be assembled from a small number of experimental components, potentially dramatically reducing the engineering challenges associated with building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Our scheme has a threshold of 0.39% for depolarising noise, assuming that memory errors are negligible. In the presence of memory errors, the logical error rate decays exponentially with $\\sqrt{T/\\tau}$, where $T$ is the memory coherence time and $\\tau$ is the timescale for elementary gates. Our approach is based on a novel procedure for fault-tolerantly preparing three-dimensional cluster states using a single actively controlled qubit and a pair of delay lines. Although a circuit-level error may propagate to a high-weight error, the effect of this error on the prepared state is always equivalent to that of a constant-weight error. We describe how the requisite gates can be implemented using existing technologies in quantum photonic and phononic systems. With continued improvements in only a few components, we expect these systems to be promising candidates for demonstrating fault-tolerant quantum computation with a comparatively modest experimental effort.",

We optimize the time steps of the evolution based on the Hamiltonian's dynamical characteristics, leading to a gate count that scales with an $L^1$-norm-like scaling with respect only to the norm of the interaction Hamiltonian, rather than that of the total Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that the cost of the algorithm is independent of the Hamiltonian's frequencies, implying its advantage for systems with highly oscillating components, and for time-decaying systems the cost does not scale with the total evolution time asymptotically. In addition, our algorithm retains the near optimal $\\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\log\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ scaling with simulation error $\\epsilon$.",

Once our neural network has been trained it can be used to efficiently sample measurements of the state in measurement bases not contained in the training data. These samples can be used calculate expectation values and other useful quantities. We refer to this process as\"state sample tomography\". We encode the state's measurement outcome distributions using an efficiently parameterized generative neural network. This allows each stage in the tomography process to be performed efficiently even for large systems. Our scheme is demonstrated on recent IBM Quantum devices, producing a model for a 6-qubit state's measurement outcomes with a predictive accuracy (classical fidelity)>95% for all test cases using only 100 random measurement settings as opposed to the 729 settings required for standard full tomography using local measurements. This reduction in the required number of measurements scales favourably, with training data in 200 measurement settings yielding a predictive accuracy>92% for a 10 qubit state where 59,049 settings are typically required for full local measurement-based quantum state tomography. A reduction in number of measurements by a factor, in this case, of almost 600 could allow for estimations of expectation values and state fidelities in practicable times on current quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the features of noise is the first step in a chain of protocols that will someday lead to fault-tolerant quantum computers. The randomized benchmarking (RB) protocol is designed with this exact mindset, estimating the average strength of noise in a quantum processor with relative ease in practice. However, RB, along with most other benchmarking and characterization methods, is limited in scope because it assumes that the noise is temporally uncorrelated (Markovian), which is increasingly evident not to be the case. Here, we combine the RB protocol with a recent framework describing non-Markovian quantum phenomena to derive a general analytical expression of the average sequence fidelity (ASF) for non-Markovian RB with the Clifford group. We show that one can identify non-Markovian features of the noise directly from the ASF through its deviations from the Markovian case, proposing a set of methods to collectively estimate these deviations, non-Markovian memory time scales, and diagnose (in)coherence of non-Markovian noise in a RB experiment. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal by means of several proof-of-principle examples. Our methods are directly implementable and pave the way for a better understanding of correlated noise in quantum processors.7 MoreReceived 23 July 2021Revised 19 October 2021Accepted 5 November 2021DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040351Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Quantum control, which refers to the active manipulation of physical systems described by the laws of quantum mechanics, constitutes an essential ingredient for the development of quantum technology. Here we apply Differentiable Programming (DP) and Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) to the optimal transport of Majorana zero modes in large superconducting nano-wires, a key element to the success of Majorana-based topological quantum computation. We formulate the motion control of Majorana fermions as an optimization problem for which we propose a new categorization of four different regimes with respect to the critical velocity of the system and the total transport time. In addition to correctly recovering the anticipated smooth protocols in the adiabatic regime, our algorithms uncover efficient but strikingly counter-intuitive motion strategies in the non-adiabatic regime. The emergent picture reveals a simple but high fidelity strategy that makes use of pulse-like jumps at the beginning and the end of the protocol with a period of constant velocity in between the jumps, which we dub the jump-move-jump protocol. We provide a transparent semi-analytical picture, which uses the sudden approximation and a reformulation of the Majorana motion in a moving frame, to illuminate the key characteristics of the jump-move-jump control strategy. Our results demonstrate that machine learning for quantum control can be applied efficiently to quantum many-body dynamical systems with performance levels that make it relevant to the realization of large-scale quantum technology.",

Here, we introduce a method of scan rate enhancement in which an axion-sensitive cavity is coupled to an auxiliary resonant circuit through simultaneous two-mode squeezing (entangling) and state-swapping interactions. We show analyt-ically that when combined, these interactions can amplify an axion signal before it becomes polluted by vacuum noise introduced by measurement. This internal ampliﬁcation yields a wider bandwidth of axion sensitivity, increasing the rate at which the detector can search through frequency space. With interaction rates predicted by circuit simulations of this system, we show that this technique can increase the scan rate up to 15-fold relative to the scan rate of a detector limited by vacuum noise.",

In normal conditions, random-receiver quantum communication requires a noiseless quantum communication channel from the sender to each of the n receivers. In contrast, we show that random-receiver quantum communication can take place through entanglement-breaking channels if the order of such channels is controlled by a quantum bit that is accessible through quantum measurements. Notably, this phenomenon cannot be mimicked by allowing free quantum communication between the sender and any subset of k",

Unfortunately, analytically constructing shortcuts to adiabaticity for systems having complex interactions and more than a few levels is a challenging task. This is usually overcome by assuming an idealized Hamiltonian [e.g., only a limited subset of energy levels are retained, and the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is made]. Here we develop an analytic approach that allows one to go beyond these limitations. Our method is general and results in analytically derived pulse shapes that correct both nonadiabatic errors as well as non-RWA errors. We also show that our approach can yield pulses requiring a smaller driving power than conventional nonadiabatic protocols. We show in detail how our ideas can be used to analytically design high-fidelity single-qubit “tripod” gates in a realistic superconducting fluxonium qubit.",

    "abstract": "Gauge theories are the most successful theories for describing nature at its fundamental level, but obtaining analytical or numerical solutions often remains a challenge. We propose an experimental quantum simulation scheme to study ground state properties in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (2D QED) using existing quantum technology. The proposal builds on a formulation of lattice gauge theories as effective spin models in arXiv:2006.14160, which reduces the number of qubits needed by eliminating redundant degrees of freedom and by using an efficient truncation scheme for the gauge fields. The latter endows our proposal with the perspective to take a well-controlled continuum limit. Our protocols allow in principle scaling up to large lattices and offer the perspective to connect the lattice simulation to low energy observable quantities, e.g. the hadron spectrum, in the continuum theory. By including both dynamical matter and a non-minimal gauge field truncation, we provide the novel opportunity to observe 2D effects on present-day quantum hardware. More specifically, we present two Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) based protocols for the study of magnetic field effects, and for taking an important first step towards computing the running coupling of QED. For both instances, we include variational quantum circuits for qubit-based hardware, which we explicitly apply to trapped ion quantum computers. We simulate the proposed VQE experiments classically to calculate the required measurement budget under realistic conditions. While this feasibility analysis is done for trapped ions, our approach can be easily adapted to other platforms. The techniques presented here, combined with advancements in quantum hardware pave the way for reaching beyond the capabilities of classical simulations by extending our framework to include fermionic potentials or topological terms.",

A meaningful set of states that can be efﬁciently prepared in experiments are ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians, which are well approximated by matrix product states. In this work, we introduce a picture of generic states within the trivial phase of matter with respect to their non-equilibrium and entropic properties: We do so by rigorously exploring non-translation-invariant matrix product states drawn from a local i.i.d. Haar-measure. We arrive at these results by exploiting techniques for computing moments of random unitary matrices and by exploiting a mapping to partition functions of classical statistical models, a method that has lead to valuable insights on local random quantum circuits. Speciﬁcally, we prove that such disordered random matrix product states equilibrate exponentially well with overwhelming probability under the time evolution of Hamiltonians featuring a non-degenerate spectrum. Moreover, we prove two results about the entanglement Rényi entropy: The entropy with respect to sufﬁciently disconnected subsystems is generically extensive in the system-size, and for small connected systems the entropy is almost maximal for sufﬁciently large bond dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Secret sharing is a multi-party cryptographic primitive that can be applied to a network of partially distrustful parties for encrypting data that is both sensitive (it must remain secure) and important (it must not be lost or destroyed). When sharing classical secrets (as opposed to quantum states), one can distinguish between protocols that leverage bi-partite quantum key distribution (QKD) and those that exploit multi-partite entanglement. The latter class are known to be vulnerable to so-called participant attacks and, while progress has been made recently, there is currently no analysis that quantifies their performance in the composable, finite-size regime which has become the gold standard for QKD security. Given this - and the fact that distributing multi-partite entanglement is typically challenging - one might well ask: Is there any virtue in pursuing multi-partite entanglement based schemes? Here, we answer this question in the affirmative for a class of secret sharing protocols based on continuous variable graph states. We establish security in a composable framework and identify a network topology, specifically a bottleneck network of lossy channels, and parameter regimes within the reach of present day experiments for which a multi-partite scheme outperforms the corresponding QKD based method in the asymptotic and finite-size setting. Finally, we establish experimental parameters where the multi-partite schemes outperform any possible QKD based protocol. This one of the first concrete compelling examples of multi-partite entangled resources achieving a genuine advantage over point-to-point protocols for quantum communication and represents a rigorous, operational benchmark to assess the usefulness of such resources.",

    "abstract": "Consumption of magic states promotes the stabilizer model of computation to universal quantum computation. Here, we propose three different classical algorithms for simulating such universal quantum circuits. Our first simulator introduces a new class of quasiprobability distributions and connects its runtime to a generalized notion of negativity. We prove that this algorithm is exponentially faster than all prior quasiprobability simulators for qubits. Our second simulator is a new variant of the stabilizer-rank simulation algorithm, extended to work with mixed states and with significantly improved runtime bounds. Our third simulator trades precision for speed by discarding negative quasiprobabilities. We connect each algorithm's performance to a corresponding magic monotone and, by comprehensively characterizing the monotones, we obtain a precise understanding of the simulation runtime and error bounds. Our analysis reveals a deep connection between all three seemingly unrelated simulation techniques and their associated monotones. For tensor products of single-qubit states, we prove that our monotones are all equal to each other, multiplicative and efficiently computable, allowing us to make clear-cut comparisons of the simulators' performance scaling. Furthermore, our monotones establish several asymptotic and non-asymptotic bounds on state interconversion and distillation rates. Beyond the theory of magic states, our classical simulators can be adapted to other resource theories under certain axioms, which we demonstrate through an explicit application to the theory of quantum coherence.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been much interest in the efficient preparation of complex quantum states using low-depth quantum circuits, such as Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). While it has been numerically shown that such algorithms prepare certain correlated states of quantum spins with surprising accuracy, a systematic way of quantifying the efficiency of QAOA in general classes of models has been lacking. Here, we propose that the success of QAOA in preparing ordered states is related to the interaction distance of the target state, which measures how close that state is to the manifold of all Gaussian states in an arbitrary basis of single-particle modes. We numerically verify this for the ground state of the quantum Ising model with arbitrary transverse and longitudinal field strengths, a canonical example of a non-integrable model. Our results suggest that the structure of the entanglement spectrum, as witnessed by the interaction distance, correlates with the success of QAOA state preparation. We conclude that QAOA typically finds a solution that perturbs around the closest free-fermion state.",

    "abstract": "Violating Bell's inequalities (BIs) allows one to certify the preparation of entangled states from minimal assumptions -- in a device-independent manner. Finding BIs tailored to many-body correlations as prepared in present-day quantum computers and simulators is however a highly challenging endeavour. In this work, we focus on BIs violated by very coarse-grain features of the system: two-body correlations averaged over all permutations of the parties. For two-outcomes measurements, specific BIs of this form have been theoretically and experimentally studied in the past, but it is practically impossible to explicitly test all such BIs. Data-driven methods -- reconstructing a violated BI from the data themselves -- have therefore been considered. Here, inspired by statistical physics, we develop a novel data-driven approach specifically tailored to such coarse-grain data. Our approach offers two main improvements over the existing literature: 1) it is directly designed for any number of outcomes and settings; 2) the obtained BIs are quadratic in the data, offering a fundamental scaling advantage for the precision required in experiments. This very flexible method, whose complexity does not scale with the system size, allows us to systematically improve over all previously-known Bell's inequalities robustly violated by ensembles of quantum spin-$1/2$; and to discover novel families of Bell's inequalities, tailored to spin-squeezed states and many-body spin singlets of arbitrary spin-$j$ ensembles.",

Space-division multiplexing (SDM) enhanced channel capacities in classical telecommunication and bears the potential to transfer the idea to quantum communication using current infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate an SDM of polarization-entangled photons over a 411m long 19-core multicore fiber distributing polarization-entangled photon pairs through up to 12 channels simultaneously. The quality of the multiplexed transfer is evidenced by high polarization visibility and CHSH Bell inequality violation for each pair of opposite cores. Our distribution scheme shows high stability over 24 hours without any active polarization stabilization and can be effortlessly adapted to a higher number of channels. This technique increases the quantum-channel capacity and allows the reliable implementation of quantum networks of multiple users based on a single entangled-photon pair source.",

    "abstract": "We consider a quantum algorithm to compute expectation values of observables in a finite energy interval for many-body problems. It is based on a filtering operator, similar to quantum phase estimation, which projects out energies outside that interval. However, instead of performing this operation on a physical state, it recovers the physical values by performing interferometric measurements without the need to prepare the filtered state. We show that the computational time scales polynomially with the number of qubits, the inverse of the prescribed variance, and the inverse error. In practice, the algorithm does not require the evolution for long times, but instead a significant number of measurements in order to obtain sensible results. We then propose a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to compute other quantities which approach the expectation values for the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. They utilize classical Monte Carlo techniques, where the sampling algorithms use the quantum computer as a resource. All algorithms can be used with small quantum computers and analog quantum simulators, as long as they can perform the interferometric measurements. We also show that this last task can be greatly simplified at the expense of performing more measurements.",

    "abstract": "Multiparty quantum cryptography based on distributed entanglement will find its natural application in the upcoming quantum networks. The security of many multipartite device-independent (DI) protocols, such as DI conference key agreement, relies on bounding the von Neumann entropy of the parties' outcomes conditioned on the eavesdropper's information, given the violation of a multipartite Bell inequality. We consider three parties testing the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality and certify the privacy of their outcomes by bounding the conditional entropy of a single party's outcome and the joint conditional entropy of two parties' outcomes. From the former bound, we show that genuine multipartite entanglement is necessary to certify the privacy of a party's outcome, while the latter significantly improve previous results. We obtain the entropy bounds thanks to two general results of independent interest. The first one drastically simplifies the quantum setup of an $N$-partite Bell scenario. The second one provides an upper bound on the violation of the MABK inequality by an arbitrary $N$-qubit state, as a function of the state's parameters.",

Signatures of these “anyons” have been detected in two-dimensional quasiparticle excitations of the fractional quantum Hall effect, however experimental access to these quasiparticles remains limited. As an alternative to these “topological anyons,” we propose “statistical anyons” realized through a statistical mixture of particles with bosonic and fermionic symmetry. We show that the framework of statistical anyons is equivalent to the generalized exclusion statistics (GES) pioneered by Haldane, significantly broadening the range of systems to which GES apply. We develop the full thermodynamic characterizations of these statistical anyons, including both equilibrium and nonequilibrium behavior. To develop a complete picture, we compare the performance of quantum heat engines with working mediums of statistical anyons and traditional topological anyons, demonstrating the effects of the anyonic phase in both local equilibrium and fully nonequilibrium regimes. In addition, methods of optimizing engine performance through shortcuts to adiabaticity are investigated, using both linear response and fast forward techniques.",

In one, the inductor is replaced by a nonlinear Josephson junction to realize the widely used charge qubits with a compact phase variable and a discrete charge wave function. In the other, the junction is added in parallel, which gives rise to an extended phase variable, continuous wave functions, and a rich energy-level structure due to the loop topology. While the corresponding rf superconducting quantum interference device Hamiltonian was introduced as a quadratic quasi-one-dimensional potential approximation to describe the fluxonium qubit implemented with long Josephson-junction arrays, in this work we implement it directly using a linear superinductor formed by a single uninterrupted aluminum wire. We present a large variety of qubits, all stemming from the same circuit but with drastically different characteristic energy scales. This includes flux and fluxonium qubits but also the recently introduced quasicharge qubit with strongly enhanced zero-point phase fluctuations and a heavily suppressed flux dispersion. The use of a geometric inductor results in high reproducibility of the inductive energy as guaranteed by top-down lithography—a key ingredient for intrinsically protected superconducting qubits.",

    "abstract": "Many experiments in the field of quantum foundations seek to adjudicate between quantum theory and speculative alternatives to it. To do so, one must analyse the experimental data in a manner that does not presume the correctness of the quantum formalism. The mathematical framework of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) provides a means of doing so. We present a scheme for determining what GPTs are consistent with a given set of experimental data. It proceeds by performing tomography on the preparations and measurements in a self-consistent manner, i.e., without presuming a prior characterization of either. We illustrate the scheme by analyzing experimental data for a large set of preparations and measurements on the polarization degree of freedom of a single photon. We find that the smallest and largest GPT state spaces consistent with our data are a pair of polytopes, each approximating the shape of the Bloch Sphere and having a volume ratio of $0.977 \\pm 0.001$, which provides a quantitative bound on the scope for deviations from quantum theory. We also demonstrate how our scheme can be used to bound the extent to which nature might be more nonlocal than quantum theory predicts, as well as the extent to which it might be more or less contextual. Specifically, we find that the maximal violation of the CHSH inequality can be at most $1.3\\% \\pm 0.1$ greater than the quantum prediction, and the maximal violation of a particular noncontextuality inequality can not differ from the quantum prediction by more than this factor on either side.",

The quantum power method is formulated on the fact that the Hamiltonian power $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}^{n}$ can generally be approximated by a linear combination of time-evolution operators $\\hat{U}(t)=\\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i} \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}t}$ at $n+1$ different time ($t$) variables.

In the quantum power method, the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition is employed to evaluate each time-evolution operator $\\hat{U}(t)$ separately at different time $t$ close to zero on quantum computers, while a linear combination of these time-evolution operators is treated on classical computers. The number of gates required for approximating $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}^n$ is $O(N n)$, where $N$ is the number of qubits assuming a local Hamiltonian $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}$.

We test this algorithm with a XXZ spin chain, an electronic H$_{4}$ Hamiltonian and a single-transmon quantum simulation. In all cases, the meta-VQE is able to learn the shape of the energy functional and, in some cases, resulted in improved accuracy in comparison to individual VQE optimization.

This interplay consequently serves as a potential platform for interdisciplinary studies. To continue this line, we analyze the role of dynamical resources in a communication setup, and further apply our analysis to thermodynamics. To start with, we study classical communication scenarios constrained by a given resource, in the sense that the information processing channel is unable to supply additional amounts of the resource. We show that the one-shot classical capacity is upper bounded by resource preservability, which is a measure of the ability to preserve the resource. A lower bound can be further obtained when the resource is asymmetry. As an application, unexpectedly, under a recently-studied thermalization model, we found that the smallest bath size needed to thermalize all outputs of a Gibbs-preserving coherence-annihilating channel upper bounds its one-shot classical capacity. In this sense, bath sizes can be interpreted as the thermodynamic cost of transmitting classical information. This finding provides a dynamical analog of Landauer's principle, and therefore bridges classical communication and thermodynamics. As another implication, we show that, in bipartite settings, classically correlated local baths can admit classical communication even when both local systems are completely thermalized. Hence, thermalizations can transmit information by accessing only classical correlation as a resource. Our results demonstrate interdisciplinary applications enabled by dynamical resource theory.",

    "abstract": "Precision magnetometry is fundamental to the development of novel magnetic materials and devices. Recently, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a promising probe for static magnetism in 2D van der Waals materials, capable of quantitative imaging with nanoscale spatial resolution. However, the dynamic character of magnetism, crucial for understanding the magnetic phase transition and achieving technological applications, has rarely been experimentally accessible in single 2D crystals. Here, we coherently control the NV center’s spin precession to achieve ultra-sensitive, quantitative ac susceptometry of a 2D ferromagnet. Combining dc hysteresis with ac susceptibility measurements varying temperature, field, and frequency, we illuminate the formation, mobility, and consolidation of magnetic domain walls in few-layer CrBr3. We show that domain wall mobility is enhanced in ultrathin CrBr3, with minimal decrease for excitation frequencies exceeding hundreds of kilohertz, and is influenced by the domain morphology and local pinning of the flake. Our technique extends NV magnetometry to the multi-functional ac and dc magnetic characterization of wide-ranging spintronic materials at the nanoscale.",

    "abstract": "We propose a family of microwave-activated entangling gates on two capacitively coupled fluxonium qubits. A microwave pulse applied to either qubit at a frequency near the half-frequency of the $|00\\rangle - |11\\rangle$ transition induces two-photon Rabi oscillations with a negligible leakage outside the computational subspace, owing to the strong anharmonicity of fluxoniums. By adjusting the drive frequency, amplitude, and duration, we obtain the gate family that is locally equivalent to the fermionic-simulation gates such as $\\sqrt{\\rm SWAP}$-like and controlled-phase gates. The gate error can be tuned below $10^{-4}$ for a pulse duration under 100 ns without excessive circuit parameter matching. Given that the fluxonium coherence time can exceed 1 ms, our gate scheme is promising for large-scale quantum processors.",

It facilitates the study of strong light-matter interaction, polaritonic physics and presents a powerful interface for quantum communication and computing. A pivotal aspect in the progress of light-matter interaction with solid-state systems is the challenge of combining the requirements of cryogenic temperature and high mechanical stability against vibrations while maintaining sufficient degrees of freedom for in-situ tunability. Here, we present a fiber-based open Fabry-P\\'{e}rot cavity in a closed-cycle cryostat exhibiting ultra-high mechanical stability while providing wide-range tunability in all three spatial directions.

Finally, we benchmark the cavity performance by demonstrating the strong-coupling formation of exciton-polaritons in monolayer WSe$_2$ with a cooperativity of $1.6$.

    "abstract": "Ensuring the correct functioning of quantum error correction (QEC) circuits is crucial to achieve fault tolerance in realistic quantum processors subjected to noise. The first checkpoint for a fully operational QEC circuit is to create genuine multipartite entanglement across all subsystems of physical qubits. We introduce a conditional witnessing technique to certify genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) that is efficient in the number of subsystems and, importantly, robust against experimental noise and imperfections. Specifically, we prove that the detection of entanglement in a linear number of bipartitions by a number of measurements that also scales linearly, suffices to certify GME. Moreover, our method goes beyond the standard procedure of separating the state from the convex hull of biseparable states, yielding an improved finesse and robustness compared to previous techniques. We apply our method to the noisy readout of stabilizer operators of the distance-three topological color code and its flag-based fault-tolerant version. In particular, we subject the circuits to combinations of three types of noise, namely, uniform depolarizing noise, two-qubit gate depolarizing noise, and bit-flip measurement noise. We numerically compare our method with the standard, yet generally inefficient, fidelity test and to a pair of efficient witnesses, verifying the increased robustness of our method. Last but not least, we provide the full translation of our analysis to a trapped-ion native gate set that makes it suitable for experimental applications.",

    "abstract": "Continuous variable measurement-based quantum computation on cluster states has in recent years shown great potential for scalable, universal, and fault-tolerant quantum computation when combined with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code and quantum error correction. However, no complete fault-tolerant architecture exists that includes everything from cluster state generation with finite squeezing to gate implementations with realistic noise and error correction. In this work, we propose a simple architecture for the preparation of a cluster state in three dimensions in which gates by gate teleportation can be efficiently implemented. To accommodate scalability, we propose architectures that allow for both spatial and temporal multiplexing, with the temporal encoded version requiring as little as two squeezed light sources. Due to its three-dimensional structure, the architecture supports topological qubit error correction, while GKP error correction is efficiently realized within the architecture by teleportation. To validate fault-tolerance, the architecture is simulated using surface-GKP codes, including noise from GKP-states as well as gate noise caused by finite squeezing in the cluster state. We find a fault-tolerant squeezing threshold of 12.7 dB with room for further improvement.",

The key ingredient of the CCR gate is simultaneously driving both of the coupled qubits at the frequency of another qubit, wherein the fast two-qubit interaction roughly equivalent to the XY entangling gates is realized without strongly driving the qubits. We develop the calibration technique for the CCR gate and evaluate the performance of iSWAP and SWAP gates The CCR gate shows roughly two-fold improvement in the average gate error and more than 10~\\% reduction in gate times from the conventional decomposition based on the cross resonance gate.",

Remarkably, topology can manifest itself even in higher-dimensional spaces in which control parameters play the role of extra, synthetic dimensions. However, so far, a very limited number of implementations of higher-dimensional topological systems have been proposed, a notable example being the so-called 4D quantum Hall effect. Here we show that mesoscopic superconducting systems can implement higher-dimensional topology and represent a formidable platform to study a quantum system with a purely nontrivial second Chern number. We demonstrate that the integrated absorption intensity in designed microwave spectroscopy is quantized and the integer is directly related to the second Chern number. Finally, we show that these systems also admit a non-Abelian Berry phase. Hence, they also realize an enlightening paradigm of topological non-Abelian systems in higher dimensions.",

    "abstract": "To make precise the sense in which the operational predictions of quantum theory conflict with a classical worldview, it is necessary to articulate a notion of classicality within an operational framework. A widely applicable notion of classicality of this sort is whether or not the predictions of a given operational theory can be explained by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. We here explore what notion of classicality this implies for the generalized probabilistic theory (GPT) that arises from a given operational theory, focusing on prepare-measure scenarios. We first show that, when mapping an operational theory to a GPT by quotienting relative to operational equivalences, the constraint of explainability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model is mapped to the constraint of explainability by an ontological model. We then show that, under the additional assumption that the ontic state space is of finite cardinality, this constraint on the GPT can be expressed as a geometric condition which we term simplex embeddability. Whereas the traditional notion of classicality for a GPT is that its state space be a simplex and its effect space be the dual of this simplex, simplex embeddability merely requires that its state space be embeddable in a simplex and its effect space in the dual of that simplex. We argue that simplex embeddability constitutes an intuitive and freestanding notion of classicality for GPTs. Our result also has applications to witnessing nonclassicality in prepare-measure experiments.Received 27 January 2020Revised 28 July 2020Accepted 11 January 2021DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.010331Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Mistrustful cryptography includes important tasks like bit commitment, oblivious transfer, coin flipping, secure computations, position authentication, digital signatures and secure unforgeable tokens. Practical quantum implementations presently use photonic setups. In many such implementations, Alice sends photon pulses encoding quantum states and Bob chooses measurements on these states. In practice, Bob generally uses single photon threshold detectors, which cannot distinguish the number of photons in detected pulses. Also, losses and other imperfections require Bob to report the detected pulses. Thus, malicious Alice can send and track multiphoton pulses and thereby gain information about Bob's measurement choices, violating the protocols' security. Here, we provide a theoretical framework for analysing such multiphoton attacks, and present known and new attacks. We illustrate the power of these attacks with an experiment, and study their application to earlier experimental demonstrations of mistrustful quantum cryptography. We analyse countermeasures based on selective reporting and prove them inadequate. We also discuss side-channel attacks where Alice controls further degrees of freedom or sends other physical systems.",

These ideas go under the general name of shadow tomography. Here we provide an experimental demonstration of property estimation based on classical shadows proposed in [H.-Y. Huang, R. Kueng, J.

    "abstract": "Estimating and reducing the overhead of fault tolerance (FT) schemes is a crucial step toward realizing scalable quantum computers. Of particular interest are schemes based on two-dimensional (2D) topological codes such as the surface and color codes which have high thresholds but lack a natural implementation of a non-Clifford gate. In this work, we directly compare two leading FT implementations of the T gate in 2D color codes under circuit noise across a wide range of parameters in regimes of practical interest. We report that implementing the T gate via code switching to a 3D color code does not offer substantial savings over state distillation in terms of either space or space-time overhead. We find a circuit noise threshold of 0.07(1)% for the T gate via code switching, almost an order of magnitude below that achievable by state distillation in the same setting. To arrive at these results, we provide and simulate an optimized code switching procedure, and bound the effect of various conceivable improvements. Many intermediate results in our analysis may be of independent interest. For example, we optimize the 2D color code for circuit noise yielding its largest threshold to date 0.37(1)%, and adapt and optimize the restriction decoder finding a threshold of 0.80(5)% for the 3D color code with perfect measurements under Z noise. Our work provides a much-needed direct comparison of the overhead of state distillation and code switching, and sheds light on the choice of future FT schemes and hardware designs.",

We extend these results to approximate encodings, locality-preserving gates, certain codes whose logical algebras have non-trivial centers, and discuss cases where restrictions can be made to other levels of the Clifford hierarchy. A few auxiliary results may also be of interest, including a general definition of entanglement wedge map for any subsystem code, and a thorough classification of different correctability properties for regions in a subsystem code.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in the coherent manipulation of electrons in ballistic conductors include the generation of time-periodic electrical currents involving one to few electronic excitations per period. However, using individual electrons as carrier of quantum information for flying qubit computation or quantum metrology applications calls for a general method to unravel the single-particle excitations embedded in a quantum electrical current and how quantum information is encoded within it. Here, we propose a general signal processing algorithm to extract the elementary single-particle states, called electronic atoms of signal, present in any periodic quantum electrical current. These excitations and their mutual quantum coherence describe the excess single-electron coherence in the same way musical notes and score describe a sound signal emitted by a music instrument. This method, which is the first step towards the development of signal processing of quantum electrical currents is illustrated by assessing the quality of experimentally relevant single electron sources. The example of randomized quantum electrical currents obtained by regularly clocked but randomly injected unit charge Lorentzian voltage pulses enables us to discuss how interplay of the coherence of the applied voltage and of the Pauli principle alter the quantum coherence between the emitted single particle excitations.",

    "abstract": "The out-of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) and entanglement are two physically motivated and widely used probes of the\"scrambling\"of quantum information, a phenomenon that has drawn great interest recently in quantum gravity and many-body physics. We argue that the corresponding notions of scrambling can be fundamentally different, by proving an asymptotic separation between the time scales of the saturation of OTOC and that of entanglement entropy in a random quantum circuit model defined on graphs with a tight bottleneck, such as tree graphs. Our result counters the intuition that a random quantum circuit mixes in time proportional to the diameter of the underlying graph of interactions. It also provides a more rigorous justification for an argument in our previous work arXiv:1807.04363, that black holes may be slow information scramblers, which in turn relates to the black hole information problem. The bounds we obtained for OTOC are interesting in their own right in that they generalize previous studies of OTOC on lattices to the geometries on graphs in a rigorous and general fashion.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic modelling of complex systems plays an essential, yet often computationally intensive role across the quantitative sciences. Recent advances in quantum information processing have elucidated the potential for quantum simulators to exhibit memory advantages for such tasks. Heretofore, the focus has been on lossless memory compression, wherein the advantage is typically in terms of lessening the amount of information tracked by the model, while -- arguably more practical -- reductions in memory dimension are not always possible. Here we address the case of lossy compression for quantum stochastic modelling of continuous-time processes, introducing a method for coarse-graining in quantum state space that drastically reduces the requisite memory dimension for modelling temporal dynamics whilst retaining near-exact statistics. In contrast to classical coarse-graining, this compression is not based on sacrificing temporal resolution, and brings memory-efficient, high-fidelity stochastic modelling within reach of present quantum technologies.",

By adding an experimentally friendly calibration stage to the standard shadow estimation scheme, our robust shadow estimation algorithm can obtain an unbiased estimate of the classical shadow of a quantum system and hence extract many useful properties in a sample-efficient and noise-resilient manner given only minimal assumptions on the experimental conditions. We give rigorous bounds on the sample complexity of our protocol and demonstrate its performance with several numerical experiments.",

Experimental studies of molecular systems in condensed-phase environments, however, face difficulties to independently control the parameters that govern the transfer mechanism with high precision. We show that trapped-ion experiments instead allow to reproduce and continuously connect vastly different regimes of molecular charge transfer through precise tuning of, e.g., phonon temperature, electron-phonon interactions, and electronic couplings. Such a setting allows not only to reproduce widely-used transport models, such as Marcus theory. It also provides access to transfer regimes that are unattainable for molecular experiments, while controlling and measuring the relevant observables on the level of individual quanta. Our numerical simulations predict an unconventional quantum transfer regime, featuring a transition from quantum adiabatic- to resonance-assisted transfer as a function of the donor-acceptor energy gap, that can be reached by increasing the electronic coupling at low temperatures. Trapped ion-based quantum simulations thus promise to enhance our microscopic understanding of molecular electron transfer processes, and may help to reveal efficient design principles for synthetic devices.",

However, extracting accurate noise spectra from typical time-dynamics measurements on qubits is intractable using standard methods. Here, we propose to address this challenge using deep learning algorithms, leveraging the remarkable progress made in the field of image recognition, natural language processing, and more recently, structured data. We demonstrate a neural network based methodology that allows for extraction of the noise spectrum associated with any qubit surrounded by an arbitrary bath, with significantly greater accuracy than the current state-of-the-art. The technique requires only a two-pulse echo decay curve as input data and can further be extended either for constructing customized optimal dynamical decoupling protocols or for obtaining critical qubit attributes such as its proximity to the sample surface. Our results can be applied to a wide range of qubit platforms, and provide a framework for improving qubit performance with applications not only in quantum computing and nanoscale sensing but also in material characterization techniques such as magnetic resonance.",

We also analyze the number of copies of $\\left| b \\right&gt;$ required by verification procedures of the prepare and measure type. In this case, the lower bounds are quadratically worse, being $Ω(κ^2)$ in the worst case and $Ω(κ)$ in typical instances with high probability. We discuss the implications of our results to known variational and related approaches to this problem, where state preparation, gate, and measurement errors will need to decrease rapidly with $κ$ for worst-case and typical instances if error correction is not used, and present some open problems.",

Active qubit reset increases the speed at which data can be gathered but requires additional hardware and/or calibration. The experimental apparatus can, however, be operated at elevated repetition rates without reset. In this case, the outcome of a first measurement serves as the initial state for the next experiment. Rol. $\\textit{et al.}$ used this restless operation mode to accelerate the calibration of a single-qubit gate by measuring fixed-length sequences of Clifford gates which compose to $X$ gates [Phys. Rev. Appl. $7$, 041001 (2017)]. However, we find that, when measuring pulse sequences which compose to arbitrary operations, a distortion appears in the measured data. Here, we extend the restless methodology by showing how to efficiently analyze restless measurements and correct distortions to achieve an identical outcome and accuracy as compared to measurements in which the superconducting qubits are reset. This allows us to rapidly characterize and calibrate qubits. We illustrate our data collection and analysis method by measuring a Rabi oscillation at a $250~\\rm{kHz}$ repetition rate without any reset, for a qubit with a decay rate of $1/2\\pi T_1=3~\\rm{kHz}$. \nWe also show that we can measure a single- and a two-qubit average gate fidelity with Randomized Benchmarking 20 and 8 times faster, respectively, than measurements that reset the qubits through $T_1$-decay.",

However, cryogenic circulators and isolators are prohibitive in scalable superconducting architectures because they rely on magnetic materials. Here, we perform a fast (750 ns) high-fidelity (95%) quantum nondemolition readout of a coherent superconducting qubit (T1 = 52 μs, T2E = 35 μs) without any nonreciprocal magnetic devices. We employ in our readout chain a microwave-controlled qubit-Readout Multi-Chip Module (qRMCM) that integrates interferometric directional Josephson devices consisting of an isolator and a reconfigurable isolator/amplifier device and an off-chip low-pass filter. Using the qRMCM, we demonstrate isolation up to 45 dB within 13 MHz, when both directional devices are operated as isolators, and low-noise amplification in excess of 10 dB within a dynamical bandwidth of 10 MHz, when the reconfigurable device is operated as an amplifier. We also demonstrate using the variable isolation of the qRMCM an in-situ enhancement of the qubit coherence times Tφ and T2E by two orders of magnitude (i.e., from Tφ = T2E = 0.5 μs to Tφ = 90 μs and T2E = 50 μs). Furthermore, by directly comparing the qRMCM performance to a state-of-art configuration (with T2E ≈ 2T1) that employs a pair of wideband magnetic isolators, we find that the excess pure dephasing measured with the qRMCM (for which T2E ≈ T1) is likely limited by residual thermal photon population in the readout resonator. Improved versions of the qRMCM could replace magnetic circulators and isolators in large superconducting quantum processors.",

The (entanglement-assisted) QFI of a quantum channel is defined to be the maximum QFI of the output state assuming an entangled input state over a single probe and an ancilla. In quantum metrology, people are interested in calculating the QFI of $N$ identical copies of a quantum channel when $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, which we call the asymptotic QFI. It was known that the asymptotic QFI grows either linearly or quadratically with $N$. Here we obtain a simple criterion that determines whether the scaling is linear or quadratic. In both cases, the asymptotic QFI and a quantum error correction protocol to achieve it are solvable via a semidefinite program. When the scaling is quadratic, the Heisenberg limit, a feature once thought unique to unitary quantum channels, is recovered. When the scaling is linear, we show the asymptotic QFI is still in general larger than $N$ times the single-channel QFI and furthermore, sequential estimation strategies provide no advantage over parallel ones.",

It is well known that optimal thermometry requires projective measurements of the total energy of the sample. However, this is infeasible in even moderately-sized systems, where realistic energy measurements will necessarily involve some coarse graining. Here, we explore the precision limits for temperature estimation when only coarse-grained measurements are available. Utilizing tools from signal processing, we derive the structure of optimal coarse-grained measurements and find that good temperature estimates can generally be attained even with a small number of outcomes. We apply our results to many-body systems and non-equilibrium thermometry. For the former, we focus on interacting spin lattices, both at and away from criticality, and find that the Fisher-information scaling with system size is unchanged after coarse-graining. For the latter, we consider a probe of given dimension interacting with the sample, followed by a measurement of the probe. We derive an upper bound on arbitrary, non-equilibrium strategies for such probe-based thermometry and illustrate it for thermometry on a Bose-Einstein condensate using an atomic quantum-dot probe.",

We use a perturbative analytical approach to study the dynamics of exchange-coupled quantum dots with valley degrees of freedom. We show that if the valley splitting is large and electrons are not properly initialized to valley eigenstates, then time evolution of the system will lead to spin-valley entanglement. Spin-valley entanglement will also occur if the valley splitting is small and electrons are not initialized to the same valley state. Additionally, we show that for small valley splitting, spin-valley entanglement does not affect measurement probabilities of two-qubit systems; however, systems with more qubits will be affected. This means that two-qubit gate fidelities measured in two-qubit systems may miss the effects of valley degrees of freedom.

The proposed circuit exhibits rich features: in the classical limit of large capacitances its ground state consists of two superimposed loop structures; one is a crystal of small loops containing disordered $U(1)$ degrees of freedom, and the other is a gas of loops of all sizes associated to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. We show that these classical results carry over to the quantum case, where phase fluctuations arise from the presence of finite capacitances, yielding ${\\mathbb Z}_2$ quantum topological order. A key feature of the exact gauge symmetry is that amplitudes connecting different ${\\mathbb Z}_2$ loop states arise from paths having zero classical energy cost. As a result, these amplitudes are controlled by dimensional confinement rather than tunneling through energy barriers. We argue that this effect may lead to larger energy gaps than previous proposals which are limited by such barriers, potentially making it more likely for a topological phase to be experimentally observable. Finally, we discuss how our superconducting circuit realization of combinatorial gauge symmetry can be implemented in practice.",

    "abstract": "Quantum simulators have made a remarkable progress towards exploring the dynamics of many-body systems, many of which offer a formidable challenge to both theoretical and numerical methods. While state-of-the-art quantum simulators are in principle able to simulate quantum dynamics well outside the domain of classical computers, they are noisy and limited in the variability of the initial state of the dynamics and the observables that can be measured. Despite these limitations, here we show that such a quantum simulator can be used to in-effect solve for the dynamics of a many-body system. We develop an efficient numerical technique that facilitates classical simulations in regimes not accessible to exact calculations or other established numerical techniques. The method is based on approximations that are well suited to describe localized one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems. Since this new method does not have an error estimate and the approximations do not hold in general, we use a neutral-atom Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator with $L_{\\text{exp}}\\simeq290$ lattice sites to benchmark its performance in terms of accuracy and convergence for evolution times up to $700$ tunnelling times. We then use these approximations in order to derive a simple prediction of the behaviour of interacting Bloch oscillations for spin-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard systems, which we show to be in quantitative agreement with experimental results. Finally, we demonstrate that the convergence of our method is the slowest when the entanglement depth developed in the many-body system we consider is neither too small nor too large. This represents a promising regime for near-term applications of quantum simulators.",

    "abstract": "In this perspective we discuss verification of quantum devices in the context of specific examples formulated as proposed experiments. Our first example is verification of analog quantum simulators as Hamiltonian learning, where the input Hamiltonian as the design goal is compared with the parent Hamiltonian for the quantum states prepared on the device. The second example discusses cross-device verification on the quantum level (i.e., by comparing quantum states prepared on different quantum devices). We focus in particular on protocols using randomized measurements, and we propose establishing a central data repository, where existing experimental devices and platforms can be compared. In our final example, we address verification of the output of a quantum device from a computer science perspective, addressing the question of how a user of a quantum processor can be certain of the correctness of its output, and propose minimal demonstrations on present-day devices.Received 19 January 2021DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.010102Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

    "abstract": "Quantum dots (QDs) defined with electrostatic gates are a leading platform for a scalable quantum computing implementation. However, with increasing numbers of qubits, the complexity of the control parameter space also grows. Traditional measurement techniques, relying on complete or near-complete exploration via two-parameter scans (images) of the device response, quickly become impractical with increasing numbers of gates. Here we propose to circumvent this challenge by introducing a measurement technique relying on one-dimensional projections of the device response in the multidimensional parameter space. Dubbed the \"ray-based classification (RBC) framework,\" we use this machine learning approach to implement a classifier for QD states, enabling automated recognition of qubit-relevant parameter regimes. We show that RBC surpasses the 82% accuracy benchmark from the experimental implementation of image-based classification techniques from prior work, while reducing the number of measurement points needed by up to 70%. The reduction in measurement cost is a significant gain for time-intensive QD measurements and is a step forward toward the scalability of these devices. We also discuss how the RBC-based optimizer, which tunes the device to a multiqubit regime, performs when tuning in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional parameter spaces defined by plunger and barrier gates that control the QDs. This work provides experimental validation of both efficient state identification and optimization with machine learning techniques for non-traditional measurements in quantum systems with high-dimensional parameter spaces and time-intensive measurements.",

Here, we introduce randomized linear gate set tomography, an easy-to-implement gate set tomography procedure that combines the idea of state-preparation-and-measurement-error-free characterization of standard gate set tomography with no-design randomized tomographic circuits and computational ease brought about by an appropriate linear approximation. We demonstrate the performance of our scheme through simulated examples as well as experiments done on the IBM Quantum Experience Platform. In each case, we see that the performance of our procedure is comparable with that of standard gateset tomography, while requiring no complicated tomographic circuit design and taking much less computational time in deducing the estimate of the noise parameters. This allows for straightforward on-the-fly characterization of the gate operations in an experiment.",

More recently, it has become a widely used method to improve process performance in quantum technologies by means of highly efficient control of quantum dynamics. This tutorial aims at providing an introduction to key concepts of optimal control theory which is accessible to physicists and engineers working in quantum control or in related fields. The different mathematical results are introduced intuitively, before being rigorously stated. This tutorial describes modern aspects of optimal control theory, with a particular focus on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, which is the main tool for determining open-loop control laws without experimental feedback. The different steps to solve an optimal control problem are discussed, before moving on to more advanced topics such as the existence of optimal solutions or the definition of the different types of extremals, namely normal, abnormal, and singular. The tutorial covers various quantum control issues and describes their mathematical formulation suitable for optimal control. The connection between the Pontryagin Maximum Principle and gradient-based optimization algorithms used for high-dimensional quantum systems is described. The optimal solution of different low-dimensional quantum systems is presented in detail, illustrating how the mathematical tools are applied in a practical way.",

Hinging upon the explicit stationary state, we reveal the presence of sink and source terms in the spin-flow continuity equation and compare their behaviour with that of the stationary heat flow. Moreover, we also obtain analytic expressions for the steady state two-spin reduced density matrices and for their concurrence.

    "abstract": "Generalized contextuality refers to our inability of explaining measurement statistics using a context-independent probabilistic and ontological model. On the other hand, measurement statistics can also be modeled using the framework of general probabilistic theories (GPTs). Here, starting from a construction of GPTs based on a Gleason-type theorem, we fully characterize these structures with respect to their permission and rejection of generalized (non)contextual ontological models. It follows that in any GPT construction the three insistence of (i) the no-restriction hypothesis, (ii) the ontological noncontextuality, and (iii) multiple nonrefinable measurements for any fixed number of outcomes are incompatible. Hence, any GPT satisfying the no-restriction hypothesis is ontologically noncontextual if and only if it is simplicity. We give a detailed discussion of GPTs for which the no-restriction hypothesis is violated, and show that they can always be considered as subtheories (subGPTs) of GPTs satisfying the hypothesis. It is shown that subGPTs are ontologically noncontextual if and only if they are subtheories of simplicial GPTs of the same dimensionality. Finally, we establish as a corollary the necessary and sufficient condition for a single resourceful measurement or state to promote an ontologically noncontextual (i.e. classical) general probabilistic theory to an ontologically contextual (i.e. nonclassical) one under the no-restriction hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a method of choice to solve the electronic structure problem for molecules on near-term gate-based quantum computers. However, the circuit depth is expected to grow significantly with problem size. Increased depth can both degrade the accuracy of the results and reduce trainability. In this work, we propose a novel approach to reduce ansatz circuit depth. Our approach, called PermVQE, adds an additional optimization loop to VQE that permutes qubits in order to solve for the qubit Hamiltonian that minimizes long-range correlations in the ground state. The choice of permutations is based on mutual information, which is a measure of interaction between electrons in spin-orbitals. Encoding strongly interacting spin-orbitals into proximal qubits on a quantum chip naturally reduces the circuit depth needed to prepare the ground state. For representative molecular systems, LiH, H$_2$, (H$_2$)$_2$, H$_4$, and H$_3^+$, we demonstrate for linear qubit connectivity that placing entangled qubits in close proximity leads to shallower depth circuits required to reach a given eigenvalue-eigenvector accuracy. This approach can be extended to any qubit connectivity and can significantly reduce the depth required to reach a desired accuracy in VQE. Moreover, our approach can be applied to other variational quantum algorithms beyond VQE.",

Here, we propose a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) architecture integrated with solid-state memories as a viable platform for constructing a qRAM. We also present an alternative scheme based on quantum teleportation and extend it to the context of quantum networks. Both implementations rely on already demonstrated components: electro-optic modulators, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) network, and nanocavities coupled to artificial atoms for spin-based memory writing and retrieval. Our approaches furthermore benefit from built-in error-detection based on photon heralding. Detailed theoretical analysis of the qRAM efficiency and query fidelity shows that our proposal presents viable near-term designs for a general qRAM.",

    "abstract": "The field of materials for quantum information science is rapidly growing with a focus on scaling and integrating new solid-state qubits. However, despite the extraordinary progress, major challenges must still be overcome for scaling. Specifically, there is a critical need for efficient coupling of tens to hundreds of solid-state qubits and multiqubit error correction to mitigate environmental interactions. This Perspective looks forward to the challenges ahead in the realization of multiqubit operations and collective phenomena with a focus on solid-state quantum materials. We provide a theorists' point of view on the modeling and rational design of these multiqubit systems. Our Perspective identifies a path for bridging the gap between the model Hamiltonians used to develop quantum algorithms and control sequences and the ab initio calculations used to understand and characterize single solid-state-based qubits.Received 9 February 2021Revised 21 July 2021DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.030102Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

In contrast, noise is typically considered as being inimical to quantum many-body correlations, ultimately leading the system to a classically tractable state. This work shows that noise represented by two-body processes, such as pair loss, plays the same role as many-body interactions and makes otherwise classically simulable systems universal for quantum computing. We analyze such processes in detail and establish a complexity transition between simulable and nonsimulable systems as a function of a tuning parameter. We determine important classes of simulable and nonsimulable two-body dissipation. Finally, we show how using resonant dissipation in cold atoms can enhance the performance of two-qubit gates.",

    "abstract": "There are well developed theoretical tools to analyse how quantum dynamics can solve computational problems by varying Hamiltonian parameters slowly, near the adiabatic limit. On the other hand, there are relatively few tools to understand the opposite limit of rapid quenches, as used in quantum annealing and (in the limit of infinitely rapid quenches) in quantum walks. In this paper, we develop several tools which are applicable in the rapid quench regime. Firstly, we analyse the energy expectation value of different elements of the Hamiltonian. From this, we show that monotonic quenches, where the strength of the problem Hamiltonian is consistently increased relative to fluctuation (driver) terms, will yield a better result on average than random guessing. Secondly, we develop methods to determine whether dynamics will occur locally under rapid quench Hamiltonians, and identify cases where a rapid quench will lead to a substantially improved solution. In particular, we find that a technique we refer to as \"pre-annealing\" can significantly improve the performance of quantum walks. We also show how these tools can provide efficient heuristic estimates for Hamiltonian parameters, a key requirement for practical application of quantum annealing.",

    "abstract": "Most proof-of-principle experiments for spin qubits have been performed using GaAs-based quantum dots because of the excellent control they offer over tunneling barriers and the orbital and spin degrees of freedom. Here, we present the first realization of high-quality single and double quantum dots hosted in an InAs two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), demonstrating accurate control down to the few-electron regime, where we observe a clear Kondo effect and singlet-triplet spin blockade. We measure an electronic $g$-factor of $16$ and a typical magnitude of the random hyperfine fields on the dots of $\\sim 0.6\\, \\mathrm{mT}$. We estimate the spin-orbit length in the system to be $\\sim 5-10\\, \\mu \\mathrm{m}$, which is almost two orders of magnitude longer than typically measured in InAs nanostructures, achieved by a very symmetric design of the quantum well. These favorable properties put the InAs 2DEG on the map as a compelling host for studying fundamental aspects of spin qubits. Furthermore, having weak spin-orbit coupling in a material with a large Rashba coefficient potentially opens up avenues for engineering structures with spin-orbit coupling that can be controlled locally in space and/or time.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian states have played on important role in the physics of continuous-variable quantum systems. They are appealing for the experimental ease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and elegant mathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies require us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian elements. In this Tutorial, we provide a roadmap for the physics of non-Gaussian quantum states. We introduce the phase-space representations as a framework to describe the different properties of quantum states in continuous-variable systems. We then use this framework in various ways to explore the structure of the state space. We explain how non-Gaussian states can be characterised not only through the negative values of their Wigner function, but also via other properties such as quantum non-Gaussianity and the related stellar rank. For multimode systems, we are naturally confronted with the question of how non-Gaussian properties behave with respect to quantum correlations. To answer this question, we first show how non-Gaussian states can be created by performing measurements on a subset of modes in a Gaussian state. Then, we highlight that these measured modes must be correlated via specific quantum correlations to the remainder of the system to create quantum non-Gaussian or Wigner-negative states. On the other hand, non-Gaussian operations are also shown to enhance or even create quantum correlations. Finally, we will demonstrate that Wigner negativity is a requirement to violate Bell inequalities and to achieve a quantum computational advantage. At the end of the Tutorial, we also provide an overview of several experimental realisations of non-Gaussian quantum states in quantum optics and beyond.",

We introduce a general concept of confinement for quantum codes, which roughly stipulates qubit errors cannot grow without triggering more measurement syndromes. We prove confinement is sufficient for single-shot decoding of adversarial errors. Further to this, we prove that all three-dimensional homological product codes exhibit confinement in their $X$-components and are therefore single-shot for adversarial phase-flip noise. For stochastic phase-flip noise, we numerically explore these codes and again find evidence of single-shot protection. Our Monte-Carlo simulations indicate sustainable thresholds of $3.08(4)\\%$ and $2.90(2)\\%$ for 3D surface and toric codes respectively, the highest observed single-shot thresholds to date. To demonstrate single-shot error correction beyond the class of topological codes, we also run simulations on a randomly constructed 3D homological product code.",

The generalized adiabatic theorems show that a sufficiently slow modulation conserves the dynamical modes of time dependent reference Hamiltonians. In the limiting case of modulations of static fields, the standard adiabatic theorems are recovered. Applying these results to periodic fields shows that they remain in Floquet states rather than in energy eigenstates. More generally, these adiabatic theorems can be applied to transformations of arbitrary time-dependent fields, by accounting for the rapidly varying part of the field through the dynamical normal modes, and treating the slow modulation adiabatically. As examples, we apply the generalized theorem to (a) predict the dynamics of a two level system driven by a frequency modulated resonant oscillation, a pathological situation beyond the applicability of earlier results, and (b) to show that open quantum systems driven by slowly turned-on incoherent light, such as biomolecules under natural illumination conditions, can only display coherences that survive in the steady state. ∗ adodin@mit.edu † Paul.Brumer@utoronto.ca",

    "abstract": "We propose a new way to use optical tools from quantum imaging and quantum communication to search for physics beyond the standard model. Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) is a commonly used source of entangled photons in which pump photons convert to a signal-idler pair. We propose to search for \"dark SPDC\" (dSPDC) events in which a new dark sector particle replaces the idler. Though it does not interact, the presence of a dark particle can be inferred by the properties of the signal photon. Examples of dark states include axion-like-particles and dark photons. We show that the presence of an optical medium opens the phase space of the down-conversion process, or decay, which would be forbidden in vacuum. Search schemes are proposed which employ optical imaging and/or spectroscopy of the signal photons. The signal rates in our proposal scales with the second power of the feeble coupling to new physics, as opposed to light-shining-through-wall experiments whose signal scales with coupling to the fourth. We analyze the characteristics of optical media needed to enhance dSPDC and estimate the rate. A bench-top demonstration of a high resolution ghost imaging measurement is performed employing a Skipper-CCD to demonstrate its utility in a dSPDC search.",

    "abstract": "Electrons confined in silicon quantum dots exhibit orbital, spin, and valley degrees of freedom. The valley degree of freedom originates from the bulk bandstructure of silicon, which has six degenerate electronic minima. The degeneracy can be lifted in silicon quantum wells due to strain and electronic confinement, but the “valley splitting” of the two lowest lying valleys is known to be sensitive to atomic-scale disorder. Large valley splittings are desirable to have a well-defined spin qubit. In addition, an understanding of the inter-valley tunnel coupling that couples different valleys in adjacent quantum dots is extremely important, as the resulting gaps in the energy level diagram may affect the fidelity of charge and spin transfer protocols in silicon quantum dot arrays. Here we use microwave spectroscopy to probe spatial variations in the valley splitting, and the intraand inter-valley tunnel couplings (tij and t ′ ij) that couple dots i and j in a triple quantum dot (TQD). We uncover large spatial variations in the ratio of inter-valley to intra-valley tunnel couplings t12/t12 = 0.90 and t ′ 23/t23 = 0.56. By tuning the interdot tunnel barrier we also show that t ′ ij scales linearly with tij , as expected from theory. The results indicate strong interactions between different valley states on neighboring dots, which we attribute to local inhomogeneities in the silicon quantum well.",

Using an ancillary superconducting qubit as a probe allows us to perform a direct Wigner tomography of the intra-resonator state. The raw measurement provides a lower bound on the squeezing at about (6.7± 0.2) dB below the zero-point level. Further, we show how to correct for resonator evolution during the Wigner tomography and obtain a squeezing as high as (8.2± 0.8) dB.

These oscillations have been attributed to a special set of non-ergodic states, referred to as quantum many-body scars. Although a significant amount of research has been invested to understand these special states, it has remained unclear how stable scar states are against disorder. We address this question by studying numerically and analytically the magnetization and spatio-temporal correlators of a model of interacting Rydberg atoms in the presence of disorder. While the oscillation amplitudes of these observables decay with time as the disorder strength is increased, their oscillation frequency remains remarkably constant. We show that this stability stems from resonances in the disordered spectrum that are approximately centered at the same scar energies of the clean system. We also find that multiple additional sets of scar resonances become accessible due to the presence of disorder and further enhance the oscillation amplitudes. Our results show the robustness of non-ergodic dynamics in scar systems, and opens the door to understanding the behavior of experimentally realistic systems.",

Lock-in amplifiers are detectors that can extract alternating signals with a known carrier frequency from an extremely noisy environment. Here, we present a protocol for achieving an entanglement-enhanced lock-in amplifier via empoying many-body quantum interferometry and periodic multiple pulses. Generally, quantum interferometry includes three stages: initialization, interrogation, and readout. The many-body quantum lock-in amplifier can be achieved via adding suitable periodic multiple-$\\pi$-pulse sequence during the interrogation. Our analytical results show that, by selecting suitable input states and readout operations, the frequency and amplitude of an unknown alternating field can be simultaneously extracted via population measurements. In particular, if we input spin cat states and apply interaction-based readout operations, the measurement precisions for frequency and amplitude can both approach the Heisenberg limit. Moreover, our many-body quantum amplifier is robust against extreme stochastic noises. Our study may point out a new direction for measuring time-dependent signals with many-body quantum systems, and provides a feasible way for achieving Heisenberg-limited detection of alternating signals.",

We show that these axioms are sufficient to give enough structure also in the channel domain, leading to numerous properties that are applicable to all channel divergences. These include faithfulness, continuity, a type of triangle inequality, and boundedness between the min and max channel relative entropies. In addition, we prove a uniqueness theorem showing that the Kullback-Leibler divergence has only one extension to classical channels. For quantum channels, with the exception of the max relative entropy, this uniqueness does not hold. Instead we prove the optimality of the amortized channel extension of the Umegaki relative entropy, by showing that it provides a lower bound on all channel relative entropies that reduce to the Kullback-Leibler divergence on classical states. We also introduce the maximal channel extension of a given classical state divergence and study its properties.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computation has been growing rapidly in both theory and experiments. In particular, quantum computing devices with a large number of qubits have been developed by IBM, Google, IonQ, and others. The current quantum computing devices are noisy intermediate-scale quantum $($NISQ$)$ devices, and so approaches to validate quantum processing on these quantum devices are needed. One of the most common ways of validation for an n-qubit quantum system is quantum tomography, which tries to reconstruct a quantum system's density matrix by a complete set of observables. However, the inherent noise in the quantum systems and the intrinsic limitations poses a critical challenge to precisely know the actual measurement operators which make quantum tomography impractical in experiments. Here, we propose an alternative approach to quantum tomography, based on the maximal information entropy, that can predict the values of unknown observables based on the available mean measurement data. This can then be used to reconstruct the density matrix with high fidelity even though the results for some observables are missing. Of additional contexts, a practical approach to the inference of the quantum mechanical state using only partial information is also needed.",

This constitutes a simple and versatile tool for bounding the magnitude of quantum contextuality in general experiments. To illustrate its utility, we use it to determine the maximal quantum violation of several noncontextuality inequalities whose maximum violations were previously unknown. We then go further and use it to prove that certain contextual correlations cannot be explained with pure states, thereby showing that mixed states are an indispensable resource for contextuality. In the second part of the paper, we turn our attention to the simulation of contextual correlations in general operational theories. We introduce the information cost of simulating contextuality, which quantifies the additional, otherwise forbidden, information required to simulate contextual correlations in either classical or quantum models. In both cases, we show that the simulation cost can be efficiently bounded using a variant of our hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations, and we calculate it exactly in the simplest contextuality scenario of parity-oblivious multiplexing.",

Then, by extending previous self-testing techniques we provide device-independent lower bounds on the fidelity between the generated states and an ideal state made by the tensor product of two maximally entangled two-qubit states.

    "abstract": "Recent years have enjoyed an overwhelming interest in quantum thermodynamics, a field of research aimed at understanding thermodynamic tasks performed in the quantum regime. Further progress, however, seems to be obstructed by the lack of experimental implementations of thermal machines in which quantum effects play a decisive role. In this work, we introduce a blueprint of quantum field machines, which - once experimentally realized - would fill this gap. We provide a detailed proposal how to realize a quantum machine in one-dimensional ultra-cold atomic gases using a set of modular operations giving rise to a piston that can be coupled sequentially to thermal baths with the innovation that a quantum field takes up the role of the working fluid. We study the operational primitives numerically in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid framework proposing how to model the compression of the system during strokes of a piston and the coupling to a bath giving rise to a valve controlling phononic heat flow. By composing the numerically modeled operational primitives we design complete quantum thermodynamic cycles that are shown to enable cooling and hence giving rise to a quantum field refrigerator. The active cooling achieved in this way can operate in regimes where existing cooling methods become ineffective. We describe the consequences of operating the machine at the quantum level and give an outlook of how this work serves as a road map to explore open questions in quantum information, quantum thermodynamics and the study of non-Markovian quantum dynamics.",

A known resource enabling universal quantum computation is the cubic phase state, a non-Gaussian state whose experimental implementation has so far remained elusive. In this paper, we introduce two Gaussian conversion protocols that allow for the conversion of a non-Gaussian state that has been achieved experimentally, namely the trisqueezed state [Sandbo Changet al., Phys. Rev. X10, 011011 (2020)],to a cubic phase state. The first protocol is deterministic and it involves active (in-line) squeezing, achieving large fidelities that saturate the bound for deterministic Gaussian protocols. The second protocol is probabilistic and it involves an auxiliary squeezed state, thus removing the necessity of in-line squeezing but still maintaining significant success probabilities and fidelities even larger than for the deterministic case. The success of these protocols provides strong evidence for using trisqueezed states as resources for universal quantum computation.",

Here, we advance a new paradigm for secure quantum communication by combining backscattering concepts with covert communication in the microwave regime. Our protocol allows communication between Alice, who uses only discrete phase modulations, and Bob, who has access to cryogenic microwave technology. Using notions of quantum channel discrimination and quantum metrology, we find the ultimate bounds for the receiver performance, proving that quantum correlations can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by up to 6 dB. We show that security can be reached by covering the carrier signal through the presence of the thermal noise in the environment. We complement our information-theoretic results with a feasible experimental proposal in a circuit QED platform. This work makes a decisive step toward implementing secure quantum communication concepts in\nthe previously uncharted 1 − 10 GHz frequency range, in the relevant scenario when the available power is severely constrained.",

    "abstract": "Computational physics is an important tool for analysing, verifying, and -- at times -- replacing physical experiments. Nevertheless, simulating quantum systems and analysing quantum data has so far resisted an efficient classical treatment in full generality. While programmable quantum systems have been developed to address this challenge, the resources required for classically intractable problems still lie beyond our reach. In this work, we consider a new target for quantum simulation algorithms; analysing the data arising from physics experiments -- specifically, muon spectroscopy experiments. These experiments can be used to probe the quantum interactions present in condensed matter systems. However, fully analysing their results can require classical computational resources scaling exponentially with the simulated system size, which can limit our understanding of the studied system. We show that this task may be a natural fit for the coming generations of quantum computers. We use classical emulations of our quantum algorithm on systems of up to 29 qubits to analyse real experimental data, and to estimate both the near-term and error corrected resources required for our proposal. We find that our algorithm exhibits good noise resilience, stemming from our desire to extract global parameters from a fitted curve, rather than targeting any individual data point. In some respects, our resource estimates go further than some prior work in quantum simulation, by estimating the resources required to solve a complete task, rather than just to run a given circuit. Taking the overhead of observable measurement and calculating multiple datapoints into account, we find that significant challenges still remain if our algorithm is to become practical for analysing muon spectroscopy data.",

This is the core physics of circulators and other elements used in a variety of microwave and optical settings. Commercial circulators in the microwave domain typically use ferromagnetic materials and wave interference, requiring large devices and large fields. However, quantum information devices for sensing and computation require small sizes, lower fields, and better on-chip integration. Equivalences to ferromagnetic order---such as the XY model---can be realized at much lower magnetic fields by using arrays of superconducting islands connected by Josephson junctions. Here we show that the quantum-coherent motion of a single vortex in such an array suffices to induce nonreciprocal behavior, enabling a small-scale, moderate-bandwidth, and low insertion loss circulator at very low magnetic fields and at microwave frequencies relevant for experiments with qubits.",

This demonstrates that high-level coherence can be veriﬁed and investigated with simple, nonideal control methods well-suited to noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. numerically.

On the other hand, broad wave-packets can act as a source of coherences for Y , even in the case of an ensemble of incident wave-packets given by the effusion distribution, preventing thermalization.

    "abstract": "Today's quantum computers are comprised of tens of qubits interacting with each other and the environment in increasingly complex networks. In order to achieve the best possible performance when operating such systems, it is necessary to have accurate knowledge of all parameters in the quantum computer Hamiltonian. In this article, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally a method to efficiently learn the parameters of resonant interactions for quantum computers consisting of frequency-tunable superconducting qubits. Such interactions include, for example, those to other qubits, resonators, two-level state defects, or other unwanted modes. Our method is based on a significantly improved swap spectroscopy calibration and consists of an offline data collection algorithm, followed by an online Bayesian learning algorithm. The purpose of the offline algorithm is to detect and roughly estimate resonant interactions from a state of zero knowledge. It produces a square-root reduction in the number of measurements. The online algorithm subsequently refines the estimate of the parameters to comparable accuracy as traditional swap spectroscopy calibration, but in constant time. We perform an experiment implementing our technique with a superconducting qubit. By combining both algorithms, we observe a reduction of the calibration time by one order of magnitude. We believe the method investigated will improve present medium-scale superconducting quantum computers and will also scale up to larger systems. Finally, the two algorithms presented here can be readily adopted by communities working on different physical implementations of quantum computing architectures.",
