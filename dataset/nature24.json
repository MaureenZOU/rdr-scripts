    "abstract": "The introduction of AlphaFold 21 has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and design2–6. Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein–ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein–nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody–antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8. Together, these results show that high-accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unified deep-learning framework. AlphaFold 3 has a substantially updated architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues with greatly improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools.",

    "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells with an inverted architecture provide a key pathway for commercializing this emerging photovoltaic technology because of the better power conversion efficiency and operational stability compared with the normal device structure. Specifically, power conversion efficiencies of the inverted perovskite solar cells have exceeded 25% owing to the development of improved self-assembled molecules1–5 and passivation strategies6–8. However, poor wettability and agglomeration of self-assembled molecules9–12 cause interfacial losses, impeding further improvement in the power conversion efficiency and stability. Here we report a molecular hybrid at the buried interface in inverted perovskite solar cells that co-assembled the popular self-assembled molecule [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz) with the multiple aromatic carboxylic acid 4,4′,4″-nitrilotribenzoic acid (NA) to improve the heterojunction interface. The molecular hybrid of Me-4PACz with NA could substantially improve the interfacial characteristics. The resulting inverted perovskite solar cells demonstrated a record certified steady-state efficiency of 26.54%. Crucially, this strategy aligns seamlessly with large-scale manufacturing, achieving one of the highest certified power conversion efficiencies for inverted mini-modules at 22.74% (aperture area 11.1 cm2). Our device also maintained 96.1% of its initial power conversion efficiency after more than 2,400 h of 1-sun operation in ambient air. High efficiency in perovskite solar cells is achieved by using a molecular hybrid of a self-assembled monolayer with nitrilotribenzoic acid.",

The All of Us Research Program is a longitudinal cohort study aiming to enrol a diverse group of at least one million individuals across the USA to accelerate biomedical research and improve human health5,6. Here we describe the programme’s genomics data release of 245,388 clinical-grade genome sequences. This resource is unique in its diversity as 77% of participants are from communities that are historically under-represented in biomedical research and 46% are individuals from under-represented racial and ethnic minorities. All of Us identified more than 1 billion genetic variants, including more than 275 million previously unreported genetic variants, more than 3.9 million of which had coding consequences. Leveraging linkage between genomic data and the longitudinal electronic health record, we evaluated 3,724 genetic variants associated with 117 diseases and found high replication rates across both participants of European ancestry and participants of African ancestry. Summary-level data are publicly available, and individual-level data can be accessed by researchers through the All of Us Researcher Workbench using a unique data passport model with a median time from initial researcher registration to data access of 29 hours. We anticipate that this diverse dataset will advance the promise of genomic medicine for all. A study describes the release of clinical-grade whole-genome sequence data for 245,388 diverse participants by the All of Us Research Program and characterizes the properties of the dataset.",

Here we present ModelAngelo, a machine-learning approach for automated atomic model building in cryo-EM maps. By combining information from the cryo-EM map with information from protein sequence and structure in a single graph neural network, ModelAngelo builds atomic models for proteins that are of similar quality to those generated by human experts. For nucleotides, ModelAngelo builds backbones with similar accuracy to those built by humans. By using its predicted amino acid probabilities for each residue in hidden Markov model sequence searches, ModelAngelo outperforms human experts in the identification of proteins with unknown sequences. ModelAngelo will therefore remove bottlenecks and increase objectivity in cryo-EM structure determination. ModelAngelo builds atomic models and identifies proteins with unknown sequences in cryo-EM maps.",

    "abstract": "The sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) plays a central role in high-capacity lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The SRR involves an intricate, 16-electron conversion process featuring multiple lithium polysulfide intermediates and reaction branches1–3. Establishing the complex reaction network is essential for rational tailoring of the SRR for improved Li-S batteries, but represents a daunting challenge4–6. Herein we systematically investigate the electrocatalytic SRR to decipher its network using the nitrogen, sulfur, dual-doped holey graphene framework as a model electrode to understand the role of electrocatalysts in acceleration of conversion kinetics. Combining cyclic voltammetry, in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we identify and directly profile the key intermediates (S8, Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4 and Li2S) at varying potentials and elucidate their conversion pathways. Li2S4 and Li2S6 were predominantly observed, in which Li2S4 represents the key electrochemical intermediate dictating the overall SRR kinetics. Li2S6, generated (consumed) through a comproportionation (disproportionation) reaction, does not directly participate in electrochemical reactions but significantly contributes to the polysulfide shuttling process. We found that the nitrogen, sulfur dual-doped holey graphene framework catalyst could help accelerate polysulfide conversion kinetics, leading to faster depletion of soluble lithium polysulfides at higher potential and hence mitigating the polysulfide shuttling effect and boosting output potential. These results highlight the electrocatalytic approach as a promising strategy for tackling the fundamental challenges regarding Li-S batteries. We investigate the mechanism underlying the sulfur reduction reaction that plays a central role in high-capacity lithium sulfur batteries, highlighting the electrocatalytic approach as a promising strategy for tackling the fundamental challenges associated with these batteries.",

    "abstract": "Lifted Kramers spin degeneracy (LKSD) has been among the central topics of condensed-matter physics since the dawn of the band theory of solids1,2. It underpins established practical applications as well as current frontier research, ranging from magnetic-memory technology3–7 to topological quantum matter8–14. Traditionally, LKSD has been considered to originate from two possible internal symmetry-breaking mechanisms. The first refers to time-reversal symmetry breaking by magnetization of ferromagnets and tends to be strong because of the non-relativistic exchange origin15. The second applies to crystals with broken inversion symmetry and tends to be comparatively weaker, as it originates from the relativistic spin–orbit coupling (SOC)16–19. A recent theory work based on spin-symmetry classification has identified an unconventional magnetic phase, dubbed altermagnetic20,21, that allows for LKSD without net magnetization and inversion-symmetry breaking. Here we provide the confirmation using photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. We identify two distinct unconventional mechanisms of LKSD generated by the altermagnetic phase of centrosymmetric MnTe with vanishing net magnetization20–23. Our observation of the altermagnetic LKSD can have broad consequences in magnetism. It motivates exploration and exploitation of the unconventional nature of this magnetic phase in an extended family of materials, ranging from insulators and semiconductors to metals and superconductors20,21, that have been either identified recently or perceived for many decades as conventional antiferromagnets21,24,25. Using photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, evidence is given of two distinct unconventional mechanisms of lifted Kramers spin degeneracy generated by the altermagnetic phase of centrosymmetric MnTe with vanishing net magnetization.",

    "abstract": "Li-ion batteries (LIBs) for electric vehicles and aviation demand high energy density, fast charging and a wide operating temperature range, which are virtually impossible because they require electrolytes to simultaneously have high ionic conductivity, low solvation energy and low melting point and form an anion-derived inorganic interphase1–5. Here we report guidelines for designing such electrolytes by using small-sized solvents with low solvation energy. The tiny solvent in the secondary solvation sheath pulls out the Li+ in the primary solvation sheath to form a fast ion-conduction ligand channel to enhance Li+ transport, while the small-sized solvent with low solvation energy also allows the anion to enter the first Li+ solvation shell to form an inorganic-rich interphase. The electrolyte-design concept is demonstrated by using fluoroacetonitrile (FAN) solvent. The electrolyte of 1.3 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in FAN exhibits ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 40.3 mS cm−1 at 25 °C and 11.9 mS cm−1 even at −70 °C, thus enabling 4.5-V graphite||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells (1.2 Ah, 2.85 mAh cm−2) to achieve high reversibility (0.62 Ah) when the cells are charged and discharged even at −65 °C. The electrolyte with small-sized solvents enables LIBs to simultaneously achieve high energy density, fast charging and a wide operating temperature range, which is unattainable for the current electrolyte design but is highly desired for extreme LIBs. This mechanism is generalizable and can be expanded to other metal-ion battery electrolytes. An electrolyte design using small-sized fluoroacetonitrile solvents to form a ligand channel produces lithium-ion batteries simultaneously achieving high energy density, fast charging and wide operating temperature range, desirable features for batteries working in extreme conditions.",

    "abstract": "Groundwater resources are vital to ecosystems and livelihoods. Excessive groundwater withdrawals can cause groundwater levels to decline1–10, resulting in seawater intrusion11, land subsidence12,13, streamflow depletion14–16 and wells running dry17. However, the global pace and prevalence of local groundwater declines are poorly constrained, because in situ groundwater levels have not been synthesized at the global scale. Here we analyse in situ groundwater-level trends for 170,000 monitoring wells and 1,693 aquifer systems in countries that encompass approximately 75% of global groundwater withdrawals18. We show that rapid groundwater-level declines (>0.5 m year−1) are widespread in the twenty-first century, especially in dry regions with extensive croplands. Critically, we also show that groundwater-level declines have accelerated over the past four decades in 30% of the world’s regional aquifers. This widespread acceleration in groundwater-level deepening highlights an urgent need for more effective measures to address groundwater depletion. Our analysis also reveals specific cases in which depletion trends have reversed following policy changes, managed aquifer recharge and surface-water diversions, demonstrating the potential for depleted aquifer systems to recover. Analysis of about 170,000 monitoring wells and 1,693 aquifer systems worldwide shows that extensive and often accelerating groundwater declines are widespread in the twenty-first century, but that groundwater levels are recovering in some cases.",

Graphene-based moiré superlattices are believed to host FQAHE with the potential advantage of superior material quality and higher electron mobility. Here we report the observation of integer and fractional QAH effects in a rhombohedral pentalayer graphene–hBN moiré superlattice. At zero magnetic field, we observed plateaus of quantized Hall resistance \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${R}_{xy}=\\frac{h}{v{{\\rm{e}}}^{2}}$$\n                \n               at v = 1, 2/3, 3/5, 4/7, 4/9, 3/7 and 2/5 of the moiré superlattice, respectively, accompanied by clear dips in the longitudinal resistance Rxx. Rxy equals \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$\\frac{2h}{{{\\rm{e}}}^{2}}$$\n                \n               at v = 1/2 and varies linearly with v, similar to the composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled lowest Landau level at high magnetic fields14–16. By tuning the gate-displacement field D and v, we observed phase transitions from composite Fermi liquid and FQAH states to other correlated electron states. Our system provides an ideal platform for exploring charge fractionalization and (non-Abelian) anyonic braiding at zero magnetic field7–9,17–19, especially considering a lateral junction between FQAHE and superconducting regions in the same device20–22. Integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in a rhombohedral pentalayer graphene–hBN moiré superlattice are observed, providing an ideal platform for exploring charge fractionalization and (non-Abelian) anyonic braiding at zero magnetic field.",

    "abstract": "Several genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease implicate genes involved in lipid metabolism and many of these lipid genes are highly expressed in glial cells1. However, the relationship between lipid metabolism in glia and Alzheimer’s disease pathology remains poorly understood. Through single-nucleus RNA sequencing of brain tissue in Alzheimer’s disease, we have identified a microglial state defined by the expression of the lipid droplet-associated enzyme ACSL1 with ACSL1-positive microglia being most abundant in patients with Alzheimer’s disease having the APOE4/4 genotype. In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, fibrillar Aβ induces ACSL1 expression, triglyceride synthesis and lipid droplet accumulation in an APOE-dependent manner. Additionally, conditioned media from lipid droplet-containing microglia lead to Tau phosphorylation and neurotoxicity in an APOE-dependent manner. Our findings suggest a link between genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease with microglial lipid droplet accumulation and neurotoxic microglia-derived factors, potentially providing therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer’s disease. A microglial state, featuring lipid droplets and secretion of neurotoxic factors, is shown to be most prominent in people with Alzheimer’s disease who have the APOE4 genotype.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease that develops through diverse pathophysiological processes1,2 and molecular mechanisms that are often specific to cell type3,4. Here, to characterize the genetic contribution to these processes across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7% not of European ancestry), including 428,452 cases of T2D. We identify 1,289 independent association signals at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are, to our knowledge, previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals that are characterized by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial cells and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores5 in a further 279,552 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 30,288 cases of T2D, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores are associated with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes. Our findings show the value of integrating multi-ancestry genome-wide association study data with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity that drives the development and progression of T2D. This might offer a route to optimize global access to genetically informed diabetes care. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of type 2 diabetes (T2D) identifies more than 600 T2D-associated loci; integrating physiological trait and single-cell chromatin accessibility data at these loci sheds light on heterogeneity within the T2D phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The possibility that the Amazon forest system could soon reach a tipping point, inducing large-scale collapse, has raised global concern1–3. For 65 million years, Amazonian forests remained relatively resilient to climatic variability. Now, the region is increasingly exposed to unprecedented stress from warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and fires, even in central and remote parts of the system1. Long existing feedbacks between the forest and environmental conditions are being replaced by novel feedbacks that modify ecosystem resilience, increasing the risk of critical transition. Here we analyse existing evidence for five major drivers of water stress on Amazonian forests, as well as potential critical thresholds of those drivers that, if crossed, could trigger local, regional or even biome-wide forest collapse. By combining spatial information on various disturbances, we estimate that by 2050, 10% to 47% of Amazonian forests will be exposed to compounding disturbances that may trigger unexpected ecosystem transitions and potentially exacerbate regional climate change. Using examples of disturbed forests across the Amazon, we identify the three most plausible ecosystem trajectories, involving different feedbacks and environmental conditions. We discuss how the inherent complexity of the Amazon adds uncertainty about future dynamics, but also reveals opportunities for action. Keeping the Amazon forest resilient in the Anthropocene will depend on a combination of local efforts to end deforestation and degradation and to expand restoration, with global efforts to stop greenhouse gas emissions. Analyses of drivers of water stress are used to predict likely trajectories of the Amazon forest system and suggests potential actions that could prevent system collapse.",

    "abstract": "The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus clade 2.3.4.4b has caused the death of millions of domestic birds and thousands of wild birds in the USA since January 2022 (refs. 1–4). Throughout this outbreak, spillovers to mammals have been frequently documented5–12. Here we report spillover of the HPAI H5N1 virus to dairy cattle across several states in the USA. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered faecal consistency, respiratory distress and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and viral RNA were consistently detected in milk from affected cows. Viral distribution in tissues via immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Whole viral genome sequences recovered from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats and a raccoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiological and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after apparently healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers. Spillover of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus to dairy cattle and the findings of a clinical, pathological and epidemiological investigation in nine affected farms are reported.",

    "abstract": "Electrolysis that reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) to useful chemicals can, in principle, contribute to a more sustainable and carbon-neutral future1–6. However, it remains challenging to develop this into a robust process because efficient conversion typically requires alkaline conditions in which CO2 precipitates as carbonate, and this limits carbon utilization and the stability of the system7–12. Strategies such as physical washing, pulsed operation and the use of dipolar membranes can partially alleviate these problems but do not fully resolve them11,13–15. CO2 electrolysis in acid electrolyte, where carbonate does not form, has therefore been explored as an ultimately more workable solution16–18. Herein we develop a proton-exchange membrane system that reduces CO2 to formic acid at a catalyst that is derived from waste lead–acid batteries and in which a lattice carbon activation mechanism contributes. When coupling CO2 reduction with hydrogen oxidation, formic acid is produced with over 93% Faradaic efficiency. The system is compatible with start-up/shut-down processes, achieves nearly 91% single-pass conversion efficiency for CO2 at a current density of 600 mA cm−2 and cell voltage of 2.2 V and is shown to operate continuously for more than 5,200 h. We expect that this exceptional performance, enabled by the use of a robust and efficient catalyst, stable three-phase interface and durable membrane, will help advance the development of carbon-neutral technologies. We develop a proton-exchange membrane system that reduces CO2 to formic acid at a catalyst that is derived from waste lead–acid batteries and in which a lattice carbon activation mechanism contributes.",

    "abstract": "Defects at the top and bottom interfaces of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite photoabsorbers diminish the performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells owing to charge recombination, ion migration and electric-field inhomogeneities1–5. Here we demonstrate that long alkyl amine ligands can generate near-phase-pure 2D perovskites at the top and bottom 3D perovskite interfaces and effectively resolve these issues. At the rear-contact side, we find that the alkyl amine ligand strengthens the interactions with the substrate through acid–base reactions with the phosphonic acid group from the organic hole-transporting self-assembled monolayer molecule, thus regulating the 2D perovskite formation. With this, inverted perovskite solar cells with double-side 2D/3D heterojunctions achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.6% (certified 25.0%), retaining 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 1,000 h of 1-sun illumination at 85 °C in air. A study presents a technique to sandwich 3D perovskite with 2D perovskites at the top and bottom, improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells.",

    "abstract": "Connections between neurons can be mapped by acquiring and analysing electron microscopic brain images. In recent years, this approach has been applied to chunks of brains to reconstruct local connectivity maps that are highly informative1–6, but nevertheless inadequate for understanding brain function more globally. Here we present a neuronal wiring diagram of a whole brain containing 5 × 107 chemical synapses7 between 139,255 neurons reconstructed from an adult female Drosophila melanogaster8,9. The resource also incorporates annotations of cell classes and types, nerves, hemilineages and predictions of neurotransmitter identities10–12. Data products are available for download, programmatic access and interactive browsing and have been made interoperable with other fly data resources. We derive a projectome—a map of projections between regions—from the connectome and report on tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs (sensory and ascending neurons) to outputs (motor, endocrine and descending neurons) across both hemispheres and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviours. The technologies and open ecosystem reported here set the stage for future large-scale connectome projects in other species. FlyWire presents a neuronal wiring diagram of the whole fly brain with annotations for cell types, classes, nerves, hemilineages and predicted neurotransmitters, with data products and an open ecosystem to facilitate exploration and browsing.",

    "abstract": "Wearable electronics with great breathability enable a comfortable wearing experience and facilitate continuous biosignal monitoring over extended periods1–3. However, current research on permeable electronics is predominantly at the stage of electrode and substrate development, which is far behind practical applications with comprehensive integration with diverse electronic components (for example, circuitry, electronics, encapsulation)4–8. Achieving permeability and multifunctionality in a singular, integrated wearable electronic system remains a formidable challenge. Here we present a general strategy for integrated moisture-permeable wearable electronics based on three-dimensional liquid diode (3D LD) configurations. By constructing spatially heterogeneous wettability, the 3D LD unidirectionally self-pumps the sweat from the skin to the outlet at a maximum flow rate of 11.6 ml cm−2 min−1, 4,000 times greater than the physiological sweat rate during exercise, presenting exceptional skin-friendliness, user comfort and stable signal-reading behaviour even under sweating conditions. A detachable design incorporating a replaceable vapour/sweat-discharging substrate enables the reuse of soft circuitry/electronics, increasing its sustainability and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrated this fundamental technology in both advanced skin-integrated electronics and textile-integrated electronics, highlighting its potential for scalable, user-friendly wearable devices. Incorporation of a ‘liquid diode’ into a wearable electronic platform enhances comfort and stability by shunting away sweat as it accumulates.",

    "abstract": "Digital pathology poses unique computational challenges, as a standard gigapixel slide may comprise tens of thousands of image tiles1–3. Prior models have often resorted to subsampling a small portion of tiles for each slide, thus missing the important slide-level context4. Here we present Prov-GigaPath, a whole-slide pathology foundation model pretrained on 1.3 billion 256 × 256 pathology image tiles in 171,189 whole slides from Providence, a large US health network comprising 28 cancer centres. The slides originated from more than 30,000 patients covering 31 major tissue types. To pretrain Prov-GigaPath, we propose GigaPath, a novel vision transformer architecture for pretraining gigapixel pathology slides. To scale GigaPath for slide-level learning with tens of thousands of image tiles, GigaPath adapts the newly developed LongNet5 method to digital pathology. To evaluate Prov-GigaPath, we construct a digital pathology benchmark comprising 9 cancer subtyping tasks and 17 pathomics tasks, using both Providence and TCGA data6. With large-scale pretraining and ultra-large-context modelling, Prov-GigaPath attains state-of-the-art performance on 25 out of 26 tasks, with significant improvement over the second-best method on 18 tasks. We further demonstrate the potential of Prov-GigaPath on vision–language pretraining for pathology7,8 by incorporating the pathology reports. In sum, Prov-GigaPath is an open-weight foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various digital pathology tasks, demonstrating the importance of real-world data and whole-slide modelling. Prov-GigaPath, a whole-slide pathology foundation model pretrained on a large dataset containing around 1.3 billion pathology images, attains state-of-the-art performance in cancer classification and pathomics tasks.",

    "abstract": "The uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) by terrestrial ecosystems is critical for moderating climate change1. To provide a ground-based long-term assessment of the contribution of forests to terrestrial CO2 uptake, we synthesized in situ forest data from boreal, temperate and tropical biomes spanning three decades. We found that the carbon sink in global forests was steady, at 3.6 ± 0.4 Pg C yr−1 in the 1990s and 2000s, and 3.5 ± 0.4 Pg C yr−1 in the 2010s. Despite this global stability, our analysis revealed some major biome-level changes. Carbon sinks have increased in temperate (+30 ± 5%) and tropical regrowth (+29 ± 8%) forests owing to increases in forest area, but they decreased in boreal (−36 ± 6%) and tropical intact (−31 ± 7%) forests, as a result of intensified disturbances and losses in intact forest area, respectively. Mass-balance studies indicate that the global land carbon sink has increased2, implying an increase in the non-forest-land carbon sink. The global forest sink is equivalent to almost half of fossil-fuel emissions (7.8 ± 0.4 Pg C yr−1 in 1990–2019). However, two-thirds of the benefit from the sink has been negated by tropical deforestation (2.2 ± 0.5 Pg C yr−1 in 1990–2019). Although the global forest sink has endured undiminished for three decades, despite regional variations, it could be weakened by ageing forests, continuing deforestation and further intensification of disturbance regimes1. To protect the carbon sink, land management policies are needed to limit deforestation, promote forest restoration and improve timber-harvesting practices1,3. Data from boreal, temperate and tropical forests over the past three decades reveal that the global forest carbon sink has remained steady during that time, despite considerable regional variation.",

    "abstract": "The Warburg effect is a hallmark of cancer that refers to the preference of cancer cells to metabolize glucose anaerobically rather than aerobically1,2. This results in substantial accumulation of lacate, the end product of anaerobic glycolysis, in cancer cells3. However, how cancer metabolism affects chemotherapy response and DNA repair in general remains incompletely understood. Here we report that lactate-driven lactylation of NBS1 promotes homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair. Lactylation of NBS1 at lysine 388 (K388) is essential for MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 (MRN) complex formation and the accumulation of HR repair proteins at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks. Furthermore, we identify TIP60 as the NBS1 lysine lactyltransferase and the ‘writer’ of NBS1 K388 lactylation, and HDAC3 as the NBS1 de-lactylase. High levels of NBS1 K388 lactylation predict poor patient outcome of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and lactate reduction using either genetic depletion of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) or stiripentol, a lactate dehydrogenase A inhibitor used clinically for anti-epileptic treatment, inhibited NBS1 K388 lactylation, decreased DNA repair efficacy and overcame resistance to chemotherapy. In summary, our work identifies NBS1 lactylation as a critical mechanism for genome stability that contributes to chemotherapy resistance and identifies inhibition of lactate production as a promising therapeutic cancer strategy. Lactylation of NBS1 by TIP60 promotes homologous recombination-driven DNA repair and resistance to chemotherapy in cancer cells and links altered cancer cell metabolism to increase genome stability.",

    "abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a bacterium present in the human oral cavity and rarely found in the lower gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals1, is enriched in human colorectal cancer (CRC) tumours2–5. High intratumoural Fn loads are associated with recurrence, metastases and poorer patient prognosis5–8. Here, to delineate Fn genetic factors facilitating tumour colonization, we generated closed genomes for 135 Fn strains; 80 oral strains from individuals without cancer and 55 unique cancer strains cultured from tumours from 51 patients with CRC. Pangenomic analyses identified 483 CRC-enriched genetic factors. Tumour-isolated strains predominantly belong to Fn subspecies animalis (Fna). However, genomic analyses reveal that Fna, considered a single subspecies, is instead composed of two distinct clades (Fna C1 and Fna C2). Of these, only Fna C2 dominates the CRC tumour niche. Inter-Fna analyses identified 195 Fna C2-associated genetic factors consistent with increased metabolic potential and colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. In support of this, Fna C2-treated mice had an increased number of intestinal adenomas and altered metabolites. Microbiome analysis of human tumour tissue from 116 patients with CRC demonstrated Fna C2 enrichment. Comparison of 62 paired specimens showed that only Fna C2 is tumour enriched compared to normal adjacent tissue. This was further supported by metagenomic analysis of stool samples from 627 patients with CRC and 619 healthy individuals. Collectively, our results identify the Fna clade bifurcation, show that specifically Fna C2 drives the reported Fn enrichment in human CRC and reveal the genetic underpinnings of pathoadaptation of Fna C2 to the CRC niche. A study reveals that Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies animalis is bifurcated into two distinct clades, and shows that only one of these dominates the colorectal cancer niche, probably through increased colonization of the human gastrointestinal tract.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically stretchable electronics with skin-like mechanical properties have been identified as a promising platform for emerging applications ranging from continuous physiological monitoring to real-time analysis of health conditions, to closed-loop delivery of autonomous medical treatment1–7. However, current technologies could only reach electrical performance at amorphous-silicon level (that is, charge-carrier mobility of about 1 cm2 V−1 s−1), low integration scale (for example, 54 transistors per circuit) and limited functionalities8–11. Here we report high-density, intrinsically stretchable transistors and integrated circuits with high driving ability, high operation speed and large-scale integration. They were enabled by a combination of innovations in materials, fabrication process design, device engineering and circuit design. Our intrinsically stretchable transistors exhibit an average field-effect mobility of more than 20 cm2 V−1 s−1 under 100% strain, a device density of 100,000 transistors per cm2, including interconnects and a high drive current of around 2 μA μm−1 at a supply voltage of 5 V. Notably, these achieved parameters are on par with state-of-the-art flexible transistors based on metal-oxide, carbon nanotube and polycrystalline silicon materials on plastic substrates12–14. Furthermore, we realize a large-scale integrated circuit with more than 1,000 transistors and a stage-switching frequency greater than 1 MHz, for the first time, to our knowledge, in intrinsically stretchable electronics. Moreover, we demonstrate a high-throughput braille recognition system that surpasses human skin sensing ability, enabled by an active-matrix tactile sensor array with a record-high density of 2,500 units per cm2, and a light-emitting diode display with a high refreshing speed of 60 Hz and excellent mechanical robustness. The above advancements in device performance have substantially enhanced the abilities of skin-like electronics. High-density, intrinsically stretchable transistors with high driving ability and integrated circuits with high operation speed and large-scale integration were enabled by a combination of innovations in materials, fabrication process design, device engineering and circuit design.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death that is driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, has been implicated in multiple diseases, including cancer1–3, degenerative disorders4 and organ ischaemia–reperfusion injury (IRI)5,6. Here, using genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening, we identified that the enzymes involved in distal cholesterol biosynthesis have pivotal yet opposing roles in regulating ferroptosis through dictating the level of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC)—an intermediate metabolite of distal cholesterol biosynthesis that is synthesized by sterol C5-desaturase (SC5D) and metabolized by 7-DHC reductase (DHCR7) for cholesterol synthesis. We found that the pathway components, including MSMO1, CYP51A1, EBP and SC5D, function as potential suppressors of ferroptosis, whereas DHCR7 functions as a pro-ferroptotic gene. Mechanistically, 7-DHC dictates ferroptosis surveillance by using the conjugated diene to exert its anti-phospholipid autoxidation function and shields plasma and mitochondria membranes from phospholipid autoxidation. Importantly, blocking the biosynthesis of endogenous 7-DHC by pharmacological targeting of EBP induces ferroptosis and inhibits tumour growth, whereas increasing the 7-DHC level by inhibiting DHCR7 effectively promotes cancer metastasis and attenuates the progression of kidney IRI, supporting a critical function of this axis in vivo. In conclusion, our data reveal a role of 7-DHC as a natural anti-ferroptotic metabolite and suggest that pharmacological manipulation of 7-DHC levels is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer and IRI. 7-Dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) is a natural anti-ferroptotic metabolite and pharmacological manipulation of 7-DHC levels shows promise as a therapeutic strategy for cancer and ischaemia–reperfusion injury.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demands for more efficient and brighter thin-film light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in flat-panel display and solid-state lighting applications have promoted research into three-dimensional (3D) perovskites. These materials exhibit high charge mobilities and low quantum efficiency droop1–6, making them promising candidates for achieving efficient LEDs with enhanced brightness. To improve the efficiency of LEDs, it is crucial to minimize nonradiative recombination while promoting radiative recombination. Various passivation strategies have been used to reduce defect densities in 3D perovskite films, approaching levels close to those of single crystals3. However, the slow radiative (bimolecular) recombination has limited the photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) of 3D perovskites to less than 80% (refs. 1,3), resulting in external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of LED devices of less than 25%. Here we present a dual-additive crystallization method that enables the formation of highly efficient 3D perovskites, achieving an exceptional PLQE of 96%. This approach promotes the formation of tetragonal FAPbI3 perovskite, known for its high exciton binding energy, which effectively accelerates the radiative recombination. As a result, we achieve perovskite LEDs with a record peak EQE of 32.0%, with the efficiency remaining greater than 30.0% even at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2. These findings provide valuable insights for advancing the development of high-efficiency and high-brightness perovskite LEDs. A dual-additive crystallization method using PyNI and 5AVA as additives results in highly efficient 3D perovskite films with enhanced photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and external quantum efficiencies, and hence increased LED performance.",

GPT-2 (ref. 1), GPT-3(.5) (ref. 2) and GPT-4 (ref. 3) demonstrated high performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the public. It is now clear that generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as large language models (LLMs) is here to stay and will substantially change the ecosystem of online text and images. Here we consider what may happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the text found online. We find that indiscriminate use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, in which tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as ‘model collapse’ and show that it can occur in LLMs as well as in variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity among all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it must be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of LLM-generated content in data crawled from the Internet.  Analysis shows that indiscriminately training generative artificial intelligence on real and generated content, usually done by scraping data from the Internet, can lead to a collapse in the ability of the models to generate diverse high-quality output.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has emerged as a major global pathogen with limited treatment options1. No new antibiotic chemical class with activity against A. baumannii has reached patients in over 50 years1. Here we report the identification and optimization of tethered macrocyclic peptide (MCP) antibiotics with potent antibacterial activity against CRAB. The mechanism of action of this molecule class involves blocking the transport of bacterial lipopolysaccharide from the inner membrane to its destination on the outer membrane, through inhibition of the LptB2FGC complex. A clinical candidate derived from the MCP class, zosurabalpin (RG6006), effectively treats highly drug-resistant contemporary isolates of CRAB both in vitro and in mouse models of infection, overcoming existing antibiotic resistance mechanisms. This chemical class represents a promising treatment paradigm for patients with invasive infections due to CRAB, for whom current treatment options are inadequate, and additionally identifies LptB2FGC as a tractable target for antimicrobial drug development. A tethered macrocyclic peptide antibiotic class described here—which shows potent antibacterial activity against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii—blocks the transport of bacterial lipopolysaccharide from the inner membrane to its destination on the outer membrane through inhibition of the LptB2FGC complex.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that has received considerable attention not only as a means to eradicate defined tumour entities but also because it provides unforeseen insights into the metabolic adaptation that tumours exploit to counteract phospholipid oxidation1,2. Here, we identify proferroptotic activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) and an unexpected prosurvival function of its substrate, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Although previous studies suggested that high concentrations of 7-DHC are cytotoxic to developing neurons by favouring lipid peroxidation3, we now show that 7-DHC accumulation confers a robust prosurvival function in cancer cells. Because of its far superior reactivity towards peroxyl radicals, 7-DHC effectively shields (phospho)lipids from autoxidation and subsequent fragmentation. We provide validation in neuroblastoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma xenografts where we demonstrate that the accumulation of 7-DHC is capable of inducing a shift towards a ferroptosis-resistant state in these tumours ultimately resulting in a more aggressive phenotype. Conclusively, our findings provide compelling evidence of a yet-unrecognized antiferroptotic activity of 7-DHC as a cell-intrinsic mechanism that could be exploited by cancer cells to escape ferroptosis. Proferroptotic activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase is shown along with an unexpected prosurvival function of its substrate, 7-dehydrocholesterol, indicating a cell-intrinsic mechanism that could be used by cancer cells to protect phospholipids from oxidative damage and escape ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Angiosperms are the cornerstone of most terrestrial ecosystems and human livelihoods1,2. A robust understanding of angiosperm evolution is required to explain their rise to ecological dominance. So far, the angiosperm tree of life has been determined primarily by means of analyses of the plastid genome3,4. Many studies have drawn on this foundational work, such as classification and first insights into angiosperm diversification since their Mesozoic origins5–7. However, the limited and biased sampling of both taxa and genomes undermines confidence in the tree and its implications. Here, we build the tree of life for almost 8,000 (about 60%) angiosperm genera using a standardized set of 353 nuclear genes8. This 15-fold increase in genus-level sampling relative to comparable nuclear studies9 provides a critical test of earlier results and brings notable change to key groups, especially in rosids, while substantiating many previously predicted relationships. Scaling this tree to time using 200 fossils, we discovered that early angiosperm evolution was characterized by high gene tree conflict and explosive diversification, giving rise to more than 80% of extant angiosperm orders. Steady diversification ensued through the remaining Mesozoic Era until rates resurged in the Cenozoic Era, concurrent with decreasing global temperatures and tightly linked with gene tree conflict. Taken together, our extensive sampling combined with advanced phylogenomic methods shows the deep history and full complexity in the evolution of a megadiverse clade. Phylogenomic analysis of 7,923 angiosperm species using a standardized set of 353 nuclear genes produced an angiosperm tree of life dated with 200 fossil calibrations, providing key insights into evolutionary relationships and diversification.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (collectively, IDRs) are pervasive across proteomes in all kingdoms of life, help to shape biological functions and are involved in numerous diseases. IDRs populate a diverse set of transiently formed structures and defy conventional sequence–structure–function relationships1. Developments in protein science have made it possible to predict the three-dimensional structures of folded proteins at the proteome scale2. By contrast, there is a lack of knowledge about the conformational properties of IDRs, partly because the sequences of disordered proteins are poorly conserved and also because only a few of these proteins have been characterized experimentally. The inability to predict structural properties of IDRs across the proteome has limited our understanding of the functional roles of IDRs and how evolution shapes them. As a supplement to previous structural studies of individual IDRs3, we developed an efficient molecular model to generate conformational ensembles of IDRs and thereby to predict their conformational properties from sequences4,5. Here we use this model to simulate nearly all of the IDRs in the human proteome. Examining conformational ensembles of 28,058 IDRs, we show how chain compaction is correlated with cellular function and localization. We provide insights into how sequence features relate to chain compaction and, using a machine-learning model trained on our simulation data, show the conservation of conformational properties across orthologues. Our results recapitulate observations from previous studies of individual protein systems and exemplify how to link—at the proteome scale—conformational ensembles with cellular function and localization, amino acid sequence, evolutionary conservation and disease variants. Our freely available database of conformational properties will encourage further experimental investigation and enable the generation of hypotheses about the biological roles and evolution of IDRs. A computational model generates conformational ensembles of 28,058 intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDRs) in the human proteome and sheds light on the relationship between sequence, conformational properties and functions of IDRs.",

    "abstract": "Several theories have been proposed to describe the formation of black hole seeds in the early Universe and to explain the emergence of very massive black holes observed in the first thousand million years after the Big Bang1–3. Models consider different seeding and accretion scenarios4–7, which require the detection and characterization of black holes in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang to be validated. Here we present an extensive analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at z = 10.6, revealing the detection of the [Neiv]λ2423 and CII*λ1335 transitions (typical of active galactic nuclei), as well as semi-forbidden nebular lines tracing gas densities higher than 109 cm−3, typical of the broad line region of active galactic nuclei. These spectral features indicate that GN-z11 hosts an accreting black hole. The spectrum also reveals a deep and blueshifted CIVλ1549 absorption trough, tracing an outflow with velocity 800−1,000 km s−1, probably driven by the active galactic nucleus. Assuming local virial relations, we derive a black hole mass of \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$\\log ({M}_{{\\rm{BH}}}/{M}_{\\odot })=6.2\\pm 0.3$$\n                \n              , accreting at about five times the Eddington rate. These properties are consistent with both heavy seeds scenarios and scenarios considering intermediate and light seeds experiencing episodic super-Eddington phases. Our finding explains the high luminosity of GN-z11 and can also provide an explanation for its exceptionally high nitrogen abundance. An extensive analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11 shows a supermassive black hole of a few million solar masses in a galaxy 440 million years after the Big Bang.",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) systems, such as ChatGPT1 or Gemini2, can show impressive reasoning and question-answering capabilities but often ‘hallucinate’ false outputs and unsubstantiated answers3,4. Answering unreliably or without the necessary information prevents adoption in diverse fields, with problems including fabrication of legal precedents5 or untrue facts in news articles6 and even posing a risk to human life in medical domains such as radiology7. Encouraging truthfulness through supervision or reinforcement has been only partially successful8. Researchers need a general method for detecting hallucinations in LLMs that works even with new and unseen questions to which humans might not know the answer. Here we develop new methods grounded in statistics, proposing entropy-based uncertainty estimators for LLMs to detect a subset of hallucinations—confabulations—which are arbitrary and incorrect generations. Our method addresses the fact that one idea can be expressed in many ways by computing uncertainty at the level of meaning rather than specific sequences of words. Our method works across datasets and tasks without a priori knowledge of the task, requires no task-specific data and robustly generalizes to new tasks not seen before. By detecting when a prompt is likely to produce a confabulation, our method helps users understand when they must take extra care with LLMs and opens up new possibilities for using LLMs that are otherwise prevented by their unreliability. Hallucinations (confabulations) in large language model systems can be tackled by measuring uncertainty about the meanings of generated responses rather than the text itself to improve question-answering accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In the field of semiconductors, three-dimensional (3D) integration not only enables packaging of more devices per unit area, referred to as ‘More Moore’1 but also introduces multifunctionalities for ‘More than Moore’2 technologies. Although silicon-based 3D integrated circuits are commercially available3–5, there is limited effort on 3D integration of emerging nanomaterials6,7 such as two-dimensional (2D) materials despite their unique functionalities7–10. Here we demonstrate (1) wafer-scale and monolithic two-tier 3D integration based on MoS2 with more than 10,000 field-effect transistors (FETs) in each tier; (2) three-tier 3D integration based on both MoS2 and WSe2 with about 500 FETs in each tier; and (3) two-tier 3D integration based on 200 scaled MoS2 FETs (channel length, LCH = 45 nm) in each tier. We also realize a 3D circuit and demonstrate multifunctional capabilities, including sensing and storage. We believe that our demonstrations will serve as the foundation for more sophisticated, highly dense and functionally divergent integrated circuits with a larger number of tiers integrated monolithically in the third dimension. Monolithic three-dimensional integration of two-dimensional field-effect transistors enables improved integration density and multifunctionality to realize ‘More Moore’ and ‘More than Moore’ technologies.",

    "abstract": "Silicon solar cells are a mainstay of commercialized photovoltaics, and further improving the power conversion efficiency of large-area and flexible cells remains an important research objective1,2. Here we report a combined approach to improving the power conversion efficiency of silicon heterojunction solar cells, while at the same time rendering them flexible. We use low-damage continuous-plasma chemical vapour deposition to prevent epitaxy, self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth to develop doped contacts, and contact-free laser transfer printing to deposit low-shading grid lines. High-performance cells of various thicknesses (55–130 μm) are fabricated, with certified efficiencies of 26.06% (57 μm), 26.19% (74 μm), 26.50% (84 μm), 26.56% (106 μm) and 26.81% (125 μm). The wafer thinning not only lowers the weight and cost, but also facilitates the charge migration and separation. It is found that the 57-μm flexible and thin solar cell shows the highest power-to-weight ratio (1.9 W g−1) and open-circuit voltage (761 mV) compared to the thick ones. All of the solar cells characterized have an area of 274.4 cm2, and the cell components ensure reliability in potential-induced degradation and light-induced degradation ageing tests. This technological progress provides a practical basis for the commercialization of flexible, lightweight, low-cost and highly efficient solar cells, and the ability to bend or roll up crystalline silicon solar cells for travel is anticipated. A study reports a combination of processing, optimization and low-damage deposition methods for the production of silicon heterojunction solar cells exhibiting flexibility and high performance.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of physical errors1–3 prevents the execution of large-scale algorithms in current quantum computers. Quantum error correction4 promises a solution by encoding k logical qubits onto a larger number n of physical qubits, such that the physical errors are suppressed enough to allow running a desired computation with tolerable fidelity. Quantum error correction becomes practically realizable once the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on the choice of quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit and decoding algorithm5. We present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes6. Our approach achieves an error threshold of 0.7% for the standard circuit-based noise model, on par with the surface code7–10 that for 20 years was the leading code in terms of error threshold. The syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-8 circuit with CNOT gates, qubit initializations and measurements. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph composed of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. In particular, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for nearly 1 million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of 0.1%, whereas the surface code would require nearly 3,000 physical qubits to achieve said performance. Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors. An end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes shows the possibility of low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.",

    "abstract": "Global projections of macroeconomic climate-change damages typically consider impacts from average annual and national temperatures over long time horizons1–6. Here we use recent empirical findings from more than 1,600 regions worldwide over the past 40 years to project sub-national damages from temperature and precipitation, including daily variability and extremes7,8. Using an empirical approach that provides a robust lower bound on the persistence of impacts on economic growth, we find that the world economy is committed to an income reduction of 19% within the next 26 years independent of future emission choices (relative to a baseline without climate impacts, likely range of 11–29% accounting for physical climate and empirical uncertainty). These damages already outweigh the mitigation costs required to limit global warming to 2 °C by sixfold over this near-term time frame and thereafter diverge strongly dependent on emission choices. Committed damages arise predominantly through changes in average temperature, but accounting for further climatic components raises estimates by approximately 50% and leads to stronger regional heterogeneity. Committed losses are projected for all regions except those at very high latitudes, at which reductions in temperature variability bring benefits. The largest losses are committed at lower latitudes in regions with lower cumulative historical emissions and lower present-day income. Analysis of projected sub-national damages from temperature and precipitation show an income reduction of 19% of the world economy within the next 26 years independent of future emission choices.",

    "abstract": "The body–brain axis is emerging as a principal conductor of organismal physiology. It senses and controls organ function1,2, metabolism3 and nutritional state4–6. Here we show that a peripheral immune insult strongly activates the body–brain axis to regulate immune responses. We demonstrate that pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines communicate with distinct populations of vagal neurons to inform the brain of an emerging inflammatory response. In turn, the brain tightly modulates the course of the peripheral immune response. Genetic silencing of this body–brain circuit produced unregulated and out-of-control inflammatory responses. By contrast, activating, rather than silencing, this circuit affords neural control of immune responses. We used single-cell RNA sequencing, combined with functional imaging, to identify the circuit components of this neuroimmune axis, and showed that its selective manipulation can effectively suppress the pro-inflammatory response while enhancing an anti-inflammatory state. The brain-evoked transformation of the course of an immune response offers new possibilities in the modulation of a wide range of immune disorders, from autoimmune diseases to cytokine storm and shock. The body–brain axis regulates body pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune responses following an immune insult.",

In the spring of 2024, an unprecedented outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in bovine herds occurred in the USA, with virus spread within and between herds, infections in poultry and cats, and spillover into humans, collectively indicating an increased public health risk1–4. Here we characterize an HPAI H5N1 virus isolated from infected cow milk in mice and ferrets. Like other HPAI H5N1 viruses, the bovine H5N1 virus spread systemically, including to the mammary glands of both species, however, this tropism was also observed for an older HPAI H5N1 virus isolate. Bovine HPAI H5N1 virus bound to sialic acids expressed in human upper airways and inefficiently transmitted to exposed ferrets (one of four exposed ferrets seroconverted without virus detection). Bovine HPAI H5N1 virus thus possesses features that may facilitate infection and transmission in mammals. HPAI H5N1 virus isolated from infected cow milk is characterized in mice and ferrets, was inefficiently transmitted in ferrets, and bound to sialic acids expressed in human upper airways, showing features that may facilitate infection in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Floods are one of the most common natural disasters, with a disproportionate impact in developing countries that often lack dense streamflow gauge networks1. Accurate and timely warnings are critical for mitigating flood risks2, but hydrological simulation models typically must be calibrated to long data records in each watershed. Here we show that artificial intelligence-based forecasting achieves reliability in predicting extreme riverine events in ungauged watersheds at up to a five-day lead time that is similar to or better than the reliability of nowcasts (zero-day lead time) from a current state-of-the-art global modelling system (the Copernicus Emergency Management Service Global Flood Awareness System). In addition, we achieve accuracies over five-year return period events that are similar to or better than current accuracies over one-year return period events. This means that artificial intelligence can provide flood warnings earlier and over larger and more impactful events in ungauged basins. The model developed here was incorporated into an operational early warning system that produces publicly available (free and open) forecasts in real time in over 80 countries. This work highlights a need for increasing the availability of hydrological data to continue to improve global access to reliable flood warnings. Artificial intelligence-based forecasting improves the reliability of predicting extreme flood events in ungauged watersheds, with predictions at five days lead time that are as good as current systems are for same-day predictions.",

    "abstract": "Body-centred cubic refractory multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), with several refractory metal elements as constituents and featuring a yield strength greater than one gigapascal, are promising materials to meet the demands of aggressive structural applications1–6. Their low-to-no tensile ductility at room temperature, however, limits their processability and scaled-up application7–10. Here we present a HfNbTiVAl10 alloy that shows remarkable tensile ductility (roughly 20%) and ultrahigh yield strength (roughly 1,390 megapascals). Notably, these are among the best synergies compared with other related alloys. Such superb synergies derive from the addition of aluminium to the HfNbTiV alloy, resulting in a negative mixing enthalpy solid solution, which promotes strength and favours the formation of hierarchical chemical fluctuations (HCFs). The HCFs span many length scales, ranging from submicrometre to atomic scale, and create a high density of diffusive boundaries that act as effective barriers for dislocation motion. Consequently, versatile dislocation configurations are sequentially stimulated, enabling the alloy to accommodate plastic deformation while fostering substantial interactions that give rise to two unusual strain-hardening rate upturns. Thus, plastic instability is significantly delayed, which expands the plastic regime as ultralarge tensile ductility. This study provides valuable insights into achieving a synergistic combination of ultrahigh strength and large tensile ductility in MPEAs. A HfNbTiVAl10 alloy shows tensile ductility and ultrahigh yield strength from the addition of aluminium to a HfNbTiV alloy, resulting in a negative mixing enthalpy solid solution, which promotes strength and favours formation of hierarchical chemical fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "RAS oncogenes (collectively NRAS, HRAS and especially KRAS) are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, with common driver mutations occurring at codons 12, 13 and 611. Small molecule inhibitors of the KRAS(G12C) oncoprotein have demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with multiple cancer types and have led to regulatory approvals for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer2,3. Nevertheless, KRASG12C mutations account for only around 15% of KRAS-mutated cancers4,5, and there are no approved KRAS inhibitors for the majority of patients with tumours containing other common KRAS mutations. Here we describe RMC-7977, a reversible, tri-complex RAS inhibitor with broad-spectrum activity for the active state of both mutant and wild-type KRAS, NRAS and HRAS variants (a RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor). Preclinically, RMC-7977 demonstrated potent activity against RAS-addicted tumours carrying various RAS genotypes, particularly against cancer models with KRAS codon 12 mutations (KRASG12X). Treatment with RMC-7977 led to tumour regression and was well tolerated in diverse RAS-addicted preclinical cancer models. Additionally, RMC-7977 inhibited the growth of KRASG12C cancer models that are resistant to KRAS(G12C) inhibitors owing to restoration of RAS pathway signalling. Thus, RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitors can target multiple oncogenic and wild-type RAS isoforms and have the potential to treat a wide range of RAS-addicted cancers with high unmet clinical need. A related RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor, RMC-6236, is currently under clinical evaluation in patients with KRAS-mutant solid tumours (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05379985). RMC-7977, a compound that exhibits potent inhibition of the active states of mutant and wild-type KRAS, NRAS and HRAS variants has a strong anti-tumour effect on RAS-addicted tumours and is well tolerated in preclinical models.",

    "abstract": "Computational pathology1,2 has witnessed considerable progress in the development of both task-specific predictive models and task-agnostic self-supervised vision encoders3,4. However, despite the explosive growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI), there have been few studies on building general-purpose multimodal AI assistants and copilots5 tailored to pathology. Here we present PathChat, a vision-language generalist AI assistant for human pathology. We built PathChat by adapting a foundational vision encoder for pathology, combining it with a pretrained large language model and fine-tuning the whole system on over 456,000 diverse visual-language instructions consisting of 999,202 question and answer turns. We compare PathChat with several multimodal vision-language AI assistants and GPT-4V, which powers the commercially available multimodal general-purpose AI assistant ChatGPT-4 (ref. 6). PathChat achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple-choice diagnostic questions from cases with diverse tissue origins and disease models. Furthermore, using open-ended questions and human expert evaluation, we found that overall PathChat produced more accurate and pathologist-preferable responses to diverse queries related to pathology. As an interactive vision-language AI copilot that can flexibly handle both visual and natural language inputs, PathChat may potentially find impactful applications in pathology education, research and human-in-the-loop clinical decision-making. PathChat, a multimodal generative AI copilot for human pathology, has been trained on a large dataset of visual-language instructions to interactively assist users with diverse pathology tasks.",

    "abstract": "The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a key model organism in neuroscience, in large part due to the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular, genetic and digital resources available for it. Here we complement the approximately 140,000 neuron FlyWire whole-brain connectome1 with a systematic and hierarchical annotation of neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units (hemilineages). Of 8,453 annotated cell types, 3,643 were previously proposed in the partial hemibrain connectome2, and 4,581 are new types, mostly from brain regions outside the hemibrain subvolume. Although nearly all hemibrain neurons could be matched morphologically in FlyWire, about one-third of cell types proposed for the hemibrain could not be reliably reidentified. We therefore propose a new definition of cell type as groups of cells that are each quantitatively more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain, and we validate this definition through joint analysis of FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for the reliability of connections between brains, revealed broad stereotypy and occasional variability in neuron count and connectivity, and provided evidence for functional homeostasis in the mushroom body through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation/inhibition ratio. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open-source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics. A consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain provides both an intellectual framework and open-source toolchains for brain-scale comparative connectomics.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association analyses using high-throughput metabolomics platforms have led to novel insights into the biology of human metabolism1–7. This detailed knowledge of the genetic determinants of systemic metabolism has been pivotal for uncovering how genetic pathways influence biological mechanisms and complex diseases8–11. Here we present a genome-wide association study for 233 circulating metabolic traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in up to 136,016 participants from 33 cohorts. We identify more than 400 independent loci and assign probable causal genes at two-thirds of these using manual curation of plausible biological candidates. We highlight the importance of sample and participant characteristics that can have significant effects on genetic associations. We use detailed metabolic profiling of lipoprotein- and lipid-associated variants to better characterize how known lipid loci and novel loci affect lipoprotein metabolism at a granular level. We demonstrate the translational utility of comprehensively phenotyped molecular data, characterizing the metabolic associations of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Finally, we observe substantial genetic pleiotropy for multiple metabolic pathways and illustrate the importance of careful instrument selection in Mendelian randomization analysis, revealing a putative causal relationship between acetone and hypertension. Our publicly available results provide a foundational resource for the community to examine the role of metabolism across diverse diseases. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for 233 circulating metabolites from 33 cohorts reveals more than 400 loci and suggests probable causal genes, providing insights into metabolic pathways and disease aetiology.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative detection of various molecules at very low concentrations in complex mixtures has been the main objective in many fields of science and engineering, from the detection of cancer-causing mutagens and early disease markers to environmental pollutants and bioterror agents1–5. Moreover, technologies that can detect these analytes without external labels or modifications are extremely valuable and often preferred6. In this regard, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy can detect molecular species in complex mixtures on the basis only of their intrinsic and unique vibrational signatures7. However, the development of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for this purpose has been challenging so far because of uncontrollable signal heterogeneity and poor reproducibility at low analyte concentrations8. Here, as a proof of concept, we show that, using digital (nano)colloid-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, reproducible quantification of a broad range of target molecules at very low concentrations can be routinely achieved with single-molecule counting, limited only by the Poisson noise of the measurement process. As metallic colloidal nanoparticles that enhance these vibrational signatures, including hydroxylamine–reduced-silver colloids, can be fabricated at large scale under routine conditions, we anticipate that digital (nano)colloid-enhanced Raman spectroscopy will become the technology of choice for the reliable and ultrasensitive detection of various analytes, including those of great importance for human health. Research published in Nature shows that surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy carried out with colloids can quantify a range of molecules down to concentrations at the femtomolar level.",

    "abstract": "Two-terminal monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells demonstrate huge advantages in power conversion efficiency compared with their respective single-junction counterparts1,2. However, suppressing interfacial recombination at the wide-bandgap perovskite/electron transport layer interface, without compromising its superior charge transport performance, remains a substantial challenge for perovskite/silicon tandem cells3,4. By exploiting the nanoscale discretely distributed lithium fluoride ultrathin layer followed by an additional deposition of diammonium diiodide molecule, we have devised a bilayer-intertwined passivation strategy that combines efficient electron extraction with further suppression of non-radiative recombination. We constructed perovskite/silicon tandem devices on a double-textured Czochralski-based silicon heterojunction cell, which featured a mildly textured front surface and a heavily textured rear surface, leading to simultaneously enhanced photocurrent and uncompromised rear passivation. The resulting perovskite/silicon tandem achieved an independently certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 33.89%, accompanied by an impressive fill factor of 83.0% and an open-circuit voltage of nearly 1.97 V. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first reported certified efficiency of a two-junction tandem solar cell exceeding the single-junction Shockley–Queisser limit of 33.7%. A power conversion efficiency of 33.89% is achieved in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells by using a bilayer passivation strategy to enhance electron extraction and suppress recombination.",

    "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are among the most promising photovoltaic technologies owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties1,2. However, the lower efficiency, poor stability and reproducibility issues of large-area PSCs compared with laboratory-scale PSCs are notable drawbacks that hinder their commercialization3. Here we report a synergistic dopant-additive combination strategy using methylammonium chloride (MACl) as the dopant and a Lewis-basic ionic-liquid additive, 1,3-bis(cyanomethyl)imidazolium chloride ([Bcmim]Cl). This strategy effectively inhibits the degradation of the perovskite precursor solution (PPS), suppresses the aggregation of MACl and results in phase-homogeneous and stable perovskite films with high crystallinity and fewer defects. This approach enabled the fabrication of perovskite solar modules (PSMs) that achieved a certified efficiency of 23.30% and ultimately stabilized at 22.97% over a 27.22-cm2 aperture area, marking the highest certified PSM performance. Furthermore, the PSMs showed long-term operational stability, maintaining 94.66% of the initial efficiency after 1,000 h under continuous one-sun illumination at room temperature. The interaction between [Bcmim]Cl and MACl was extensively studied to unravel the mechanism leading to an enhancement of device properties. Our approach holds substantial promise for bridging the benchtop-to-rooftop gap and advancing the production and commercialization of large-area perovskite photovoltaics. A synergistic dopant-additive combination strategy using methylammonium chloride as the dopant and a Lewis-basic ionic-liquid additive is shown to enable the fabrication of perovskite solar modules achieving record certified performance and long-term operational stability.",

    "abstract": "Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on metal halide perovskites (PeLEDs) with high colour quality and facile solution processing are promising candidates for full-colour and high-definition displays1–4. Despite the great success achieved in green PeLEDs with lead bromide perovskites5, it is still challenging to realize pure-red (620–650 nm) LEDs using iodine-based counterparts, as they are constrained by the low intrinsic bandgap6. Here we report efficient and colour-stable PeLEDs across the entire pure-red region, with a peak external quantum efficiency reaching 28.7% at 638 nm, enabled by incorporating a double-end anchored ligand molecule into pure-iodine perovskites. We demonstrate that a key function of the organic intercalating cation is to stabilize the lead iodine octahedron through coordination with exposed lead ions and enhanced hydrogen bonding with iodine. The molecule synergistically facilitates spectral modulation, promotes charge transfer between perovskite quantum wells and reduces iodine migration under electrical bias. We realize continuously tunable emission wavelengths for iodine-based perovskite films with suppressed energy loss due to the decrease in bond energy of lead iodine in ionic perovskites as the bandgap increases. Importantly, the resultant devices show outstanding spectral stability and a half-lifetime of more than 7,600 min at an initial luminance of 100 cd m−2. Red-emitting perovskite LEDs were fabricated by stabilizing their octahedral structure with a ligand to yield devices with enhanced efficiency, spectral stability and lifetime.",

    "abstract": "The glymphatic movement of fluid through the brain removes metabolic waste1–4. Noninvasive 40 Hz stimulation promotes 40 Hz neural activity in multiple brain regions and attenuates pathology in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease5–8. Here we show that multisensory gamma stimulation promotes the influx of cerebrospinal fluid and the efflux of interstitial fluid in the cortex of the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Influx of cerebrospinal fluid was associated with increased aquaporin-4 polarization along astrocytic endfeet and dilated meningeal lymphatic vessels. Inhibiting glymphatic clearance abolished the removal of amyloid by multisensory 40 Hz stimulation. Using chemogenetic manipulation and a genetically encoded sensor for neuropeptide signalling, we found that vasoactive intestinal peptide interneurons facilitate glymphatic clearance by regulating arterial pulsatility. Our findings establish novel mechanisms that recruit the glymphatic system to remove brain amyloid. Audio and visual stimulation at 40 Hz promote cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid flux in mouse brain and result in amyloid clearance via the glymphatic system in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.",

    "abstract": "General circulation models (GCMs) are the foundation of weather and climate prediction1,2. GCMs are physics-based simulators that combine a numerical solver for large-scale dynamics with tuned representations for small-scale processes such as cloud formation. Recently, machine-learning models trained on reanalysis data have achieved comparable or better skill than GCMs for deterministic weather forecasting3,4. However, these models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate simulations. Here we present a GCM that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with machine-learning components and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and climate on par with the best machine-learning and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is competitive with machine-learning models for one- to ten-day forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for one- to fifteen-day forecasts. With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate metrics for multiple decades, and climate forecasts with 140-kilometre resolution show emergent phenomena such as realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude computational savings over conventional GCMs, although our model does not extrapolate to substantially different future climates. Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional GCMs and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system. A hybrid model that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with machine-learning components is capable of weather forecasts and climate simulations on par with the best machine-learning and physics-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Despite tremendous efforts in the past decades, relationships among main avian lineages remain heavily debated without a clear resolution. Discrepancies have been attributed to diversity of species sampled, phylogenetic method and the choice of genomic regions1–3. Here we address these issues by analysing the genomes of 363 bird species4 (218 taxonomic families, 92% of total). Using intergenic regions and coalescent methods, we present a well-supported tree but also a marked degree of discordance. The tree confirms that Neoaves experienced rapid radiation at or near the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary. Sufficient loci rather than extensive taxon sampling were more effective in resolving difficult nodes. Remaining recalcitrant nodes involve species that are a challenge to model due to either extreme DNA composition, variable substitution rates, incomplete lineage sorting or complex evolutionary events such as ancient hybridization. Assessment of the effects of different genomic partitions showed high heterogeneity across the genome. We discovered sharp increases in effective population size, substitution rates and relative brain size following the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event, supporting the hypothesis that emerging ecological opportunities catalysed the diversification of modern birds. The resulting phylogenetic estimate offers fresh insights into the rapid radiation of modern birds and provides a taxon-rich backbone tree for future comparative studies. Using intergenic regions and coalescent methods to analyse the genomes of 363 bird species, the authors present a well-supported tree confirming that Neoaves experienced rapid radiation at or near the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary.",

    "abstract": "Replacement of liquid electrolytes with polymer gel electrolytes is recognized as a general and effective way of solving safety problems and achieving high flexibility in wearable batteries1–6. However, the poor interface between polymer gel electrolyte and electrode, caused by insufficient wetting, produces much poorer electrochemical properties, especially during the deformation of the battery7–9. Here we report a strategy for designing channel structures in electrodes to incorporate polymer gel electrolytes and to form intimate and stable interfaces for high-performance wearable batteries. As a demonstration, multiple electrode fibres were rotated together to form aligned channels, while the surface of each electrode fibre was designed with networked channels. The monomer solution was effectively infiltrated first along the aligned channels and then into the networked channels. The monomers were then polymerized to produce a gel electrolyte and form intimate and stable interfaces with the electrodes. The resulting fibre lithium-ion battery (FLB) showed high electrochemical performances (for example, an energy density of about 128 Wh kg−1). This strategy also enabled the production of FLBs with a high rate of 3,600 m h−1 per winding unit. The continuous FLBs were woven into a 50 cm × 30 cm textile to provide an output capacity of 2,975 mAh. The FLB textiles worked safely under extreme conditions, such as temperatures of −40 °C and 80 °C and a vacuum of −0.08 MPa. The FLBs show promise for applications in firefighting and space exploration. A fibre lithium-ion battery that can potentially be woven into textiles shows enhanced battery performance and safety compared with liquid electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "Western Eurasia witnessed several large-scale human migrations during the Holocene1–5. Here, to investigate the cross-continental effects of these migrations, we shotgun-sequenced 317 genomes—mainly from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods—from across northern and western Eurasia. These were imputed alongside published data to obtain diploid genotypes from more than 1,600 ancient humans. Our analyses revealed a ‘great divide’ genomic boundary extending from the Black Sea to the Baltic. Mesolithic hunter-gatherers were highly genetically differentiated east and west of this zone, and the effect of the neolithization was equally disparate. Large-scale ancestry shifts occurred in the west as farming was introduced, including near-total replacement of hunter-gatherers in many areas, whereas no substantial ancestry shifts happened east of the zone during the same period. Similarly, relatedness decreased in the west from the Neolithic transition onwards, whereas, east of the Urals, relatedness remained high until around 4,000 bp, consistent with the persistence of localized groups of hunter-gatherers. The boundary dissolved when Yamnaya-related ancestry spread across western Eurasia around 5,000 bp, resulting in a second major turnover that reached most parts of Europe within a 1,000-year span. The genetic origin and fate of the Yamnaya have remained elusive, but we show that hunter-gatherers from the Middle Don region contributed ancestry to them. Yamnaya groups later admixed with individuals associated with the Globular Amphora culture before expanding into Europe. Similar turnovers occurred in western Siberia, where we report new genomic data from a ‘Neolithic steppe’ cline spanning the Siberian forest steppe to Lake Baikal. These prehistoric migrations had profound and lasting effects on the genetic diversity of Eurasian populations. An analysis involving the shotgun sequencing of more than 300 ancient genomes from Eurasia reveals a deep east–west genetic divide from the Black Sea to the Baltic, and provides insight into the distinct effects of the Neolithic transition on either side of this boundary.",

    "abstract": "The cost of drug discovery and development is driven primarily by failure1, with only about 10% of clinical programmes eventually receiving approval2–4. We previously estimated that human genetic evidence doubles the success rate from clinical development to approval5. In this study we leverage the growth in genetic evidence over the past decade to better understand the characteristics that distinguish clinical success and failure. We estimate the probability of success for drug mechanisms with genetic support is 2.6 times greater than those without. This relative success varies among therapy areas and development phases, and improves with increasing confidence in the causal gene, but is largely unaffected by genetic effect size, minor allele frequency or year of discovery. These results indicate we are far from reaching peak genetic insights to aid the discovery of targets for more effective drugs. Human genetic evidence increases the success rate of drugs from clinical development to approval but we are still far from reaching peak genetic insights to aid the discovery of targets for more effective drugs.",

    "abstract": "Regular exercise promotes whole-body health and prevents disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood1–3. Here, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium4 profiled the temporal transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, lipidome, phosphoproteome, acetylproteome, ubiquitylproteome, epigenome and immunome in whole blood, plasma and 18 solid tissues in male and female Rattus norvegicus over eight weeks of endurance exercise training. The resulting data compendium encompasses 9,466 assays across 19 tissues, 25 molecular platforms and 4 training time points. Thousands of shared and tissue-specific molecular alterations were identified, with sex differences found in multiple tissues. Temporal multi-omic and multi-tissue analyses revealed expansive biological insights into the adaptive responses to endurance training, including widespread regulation of immune, metabolic, stress response and mitochondrial pathways. Many changes were relevant to human health, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular health and tissue injury and recovery. The data and analyses presented in this study will serve as valuable resources for understanding and exploring the multi-tissue molecular effects of endurance training and are provided in a public repository (\n                https://motrpac-data.org/\n                \n              ). Temporal multi-omic analysis of tissues from rats undergoing up to eight weeks of endurance exercise training reveals widespread shared, tissue-specific and sex-specific changes, including immune, metabolic, stress response and mitochondrial pathways.",

    "abstract": "Molecule-based selective contacts have become a crucial component to ensure high-efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells1–5. These molecules always consist of a conjugated core with heteroatom substitution to render the desirable carrier-transport capability6–9. So far, the design of successful conjugation cores has been limited to two N-substituted π-conjugated structures, carbazole and triphenylamine, with molecular optimization evolving around their derivatives2,5,10–12. However, further improvement of the device longevity has been hampered by the concomitant limitations of the molecular stability induced by such heteroatom-substituted structures13,14. A more robust molecular contact without sacrificing the electronic properties is in urgent demand, but remains a challenge. Here we report a peri-fused polyaromatic core structure without heteroatom substitution that yields superior carrier transport and selectivity over conventional heteroatom-substituted core structures. This core structure produced a relatively chemically inert and structurally rigid molecular contact, which considerably improved the performance of perovskite solar cells in terms of both efficiency and durability. The champion device showed an efficiency up to 26.1% with greatly improved longevity under different accelerated-ageing tests. A peri-fused polyaromatic core structure is used to produce a relatively chemically inert and structurally rigid molecular contact that improves the efficiency and durability of perovskite solar cells.",

    "abstract": "The pace of human brain development is highly protracted compared with most other species1–7. The maturation of cortical neurons is particularly slow, taking months to years to develop adult functions3–5. Remarkably, such protracted timing is retained in cortical neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) during in vitro differentiation or upon transplantation into the mouse brain4,8,9. Those findings suggest the presence of a cell-intrinsic clock setting the pace of neuronal maturation, although the molecular nature of this clock remains unknown. Here we identify an epigenetic developmental programme that sets the timing of human neuronal maturation. First, we developed a hPSC-based approach to synchronize the birth of cortical neurons in vitro which enabled us to define an atlas of morphological, functional and molecular maturation. We observed a slow unfolding of maturation programmes, limited by the retention of specific epigenetic factors. Loss of function of several of those factors in cortical neurons enables precocious maturation. Transient inhibition of EZH2, EHMT1 and EHMT2 or DOT1L, at progenitor stage primes newly born neurons to rapidly acquire mature properties upon differentiation. Thus our findings reveal that the rate at which human neurons mature is set well before neurogenesis through the establishment of an epigenetic barrier in progenitor cells. Mechanistically, this barrier holds transcriptional maturation programmes in a poised state that is gradually released to ensure the prolonged timeline of human cortical neuron maturation. The slow maturation of human neurons is regulated by epigenetic modification in nascent neurons, mediated by EZH2, EHMT1, EHMT2 and DOT1L.",

    "abstract": "Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is the common effector for cytokine secretion and pyroptosis downstream of inflammasome activation and was previously shown to form large transmembrane pores after cleavage by inflammatory caspases to generate the GSDMD N-terminal domain (GSDMD-NT)1–10. Here we report that GSDMD Cys191 is S-palmitoylated and that palmitoylation is required for pore formation. S-palmitoylation, which does not affect GSDMD cleavage, is augmented by mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cleavage-deficient GSDMD (D275A) is also palmitoylated after inflammasome stimulation or treatment with ROS activators and causes pyroptosis, although less efficiently than palmitoylated GSDMD-NT. Palmitoylated, but not unpalmitoylated, full-length GSDMD induces liposome leakage and forms a pore similar in structure to GSDMD-NT pores shown by cryogenic electron microscopy. ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC9 are the major palmitoyltransferases that mediate GSDMD palmitoylation, and their expression is upregulated by inflammasome activation and ROS. The other human gasdermins are also palmitoylated at their N termini. These data challenge the concept that cleavage is the only trigger for GSDMD activation. They suggest that reversible palmitoylation is a checkpoint for pore formation by both GSDMD-NT and intact GSDMD that functions as a general switch for the activation of this pore-forming family. Gasdermin D Cys191 is S-palmitoylated, and palmitoylation is required for pore formation.",

    "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) comprise a solid perovskite absorber sandwiched between several layers of different charge-selective materials, ensuring unidirectional current flow and high voltage output of the devices1,2. A ‘buffer material’ between the electron-selective layer and the metal electrode in p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) PSCs (also known as inverted PSCs) enables electrons to flow from the electron-selective layer to the electrode3–5. Furthermore, it acts as a barrier inhibiting the inter-diffusion of harmful species into or degradation products out of the perovskite absorber6–8. Thus far, evaporable organic molecules9,10 and atomic-layer-deposited metal oxides11,12 have been successful, but each has specific imperfections. Here we report a chemically stable and multifunctional buffer material, ytterbium oxide (YbOx), for p-i-n PSCs by scalable thermal evaporation deposition. We used this YbOx buffer in the p-i-n PSCs with a narrow-bandgap perovskite absorber, yielding a certified power conversion efficiency of more than 25%. We also demonstrate the broad applicability of YbOx in enabling highly efficient PSCs from various types of perovskite absorber layer, delivering state-of-the-art efficiencies of 20.1% for the wide-bandgap perovskite absorber and 22.1% for the mid-bandgap perovskite absorber, respectively. Moreover, when subjected to ISOS-L-3 accelerated ageing, encapsulated devices with YbOx exhibit markedly enhanced device stability. Ytterbium oxide buffer layer for use in perovskite solar cells yields a certified power conversion efficiency of more than 25%, which enhances stability across a wide variety of perovskite compositions.",

    "abstract": "The immune system has a critical role in orchestrating tissue healing. As a result, regenerative strategies that control immune components have proved effective1,2. This is particularly relevant when immune dysregulation that results from conditions such as diabetes or advanced age impairs tissue healing following injury2,3. Nociceptive sensory neurons have a crucial role as immunoregulators and exert both protective and harmful effects depending on the context4–12. However, how neuro–immune interactions affect tissue repair and regeneration following acute injury is unclear. Here we show that ablation of the NaV1.8 nociceptor impairs skin wound repair and muscle regeneration after acute tissue injury. Nociceptor endings grow into injured skin and muscle tissues and signal to immune cells through the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) during the healing process. CGRP acts via receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) on neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages to inhibit recruitment, accelerate death, enhance efferocytosis and polarize macrophages towards a pro-repair phenotype. The effects of CGRP on neutrophils and macrophages are mediated via thrombospondin-1 release and its subsequent autocrine and/or paracrine effects. In mice without nociceptors and diabetic mice with peripheral neuropathies, delivery of an engineered version of CGRP accelerated wound healing and promoted muscle regeneration. Harnessing neuro–immune interactions has potential to treat non-healing tissues in which dysregulated neuro–immune interactions impair tissue healing. Experiments in mouse models show that NaV1.8+ nociceptors innervate sites of injury and provide wound repair signals to immune cells by releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).",

    "abstract": "Histopathology image evaluation is indispensable for cancer diagnoses and subtype classification. Standard artificial intelligence methods for histopathology image analyses have focused on optimizing specialized models for each diagnostic task1,2. Although such methods have achieved some success, they often have limited generalizability to images generated by different digitization protocols or samples collected from different populations3. Here, to address this challenge, we devised the Clinical Histopathology Imaging Evaluation Foundation (CHIEF) model, a general-purpose weakly supervised machine learning framework to extract pathology imaging features for systematic cancer evaluation. CHIEF leverages two complementary pretraining methods to extract diverse pathology representations: unsupervised pretraining for tile-level feature identification and weakly supervised pretraining for whole-slide pattern recognition. We developed CHIEF using 60,530 whole-slide images spanning 19 anatomical sites. Through pretraining on 44 terabytes of high-resolution pathology imaging datasets, CHIEF extracted microscopic representations useful for cancer cell detection, tumour origin identification, molecular profile characterization and prognostic prediction. We successfully validated CHIEF using 19,491 whole-slide images from 32 independent slide sets collected from 24 hospitals and cohorts internationally. Overall, CHIEF outperformed the state-of-the-art deep learning methods by up to 36.1%, showing its ability to address domain shifts observed in samples from diverse populations and processed by different slide preparation methods. CHIEF provides a generalizable foundation for efficient digital pathology evaluation for patients with cancer. A study describes the development of a generalizable foundation machine learning framework to extract pathology imaging features for cancer diagnosis and prognosis prediction.",

We combine satellite imagery, vessel GPS data and deep-learning models to map industrial vessel activities and offshore energy infrastructure across the world’s coastal waters from 2017 to 2021. We find that 72–76% of the world’s industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked, with much of that fishing taking place around South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa. We also find that 21–30% of transport and energy vessel activity is missing from public tracking systems. Globally, fishing decreased by 12 ± 1% at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels by 2021. By contrast, transport and energy vessel activities were relatively unaffected during the same period. Offshore wind is growing rapidly, with most wind turbines confined to small areas of the ocean but surpassing the number of oil structures in 2021. Our map of ocean industrialization reveals changes in some of the most extensive and economically important human activities at sea. Satellite imagery, vessel GPS data and deep-learning models are used to map industrial fishing vessel activities missing from public tracking systems and changes in offshore energy infrastructure in the world’s coastal waters during 2017–2021.",

    "abstract": "Emerging spatial computing systems seamlessly superimpose digital information on the physical environment observed by a user, enabling transformative experiences across various domains, such as entertainment, education, communication and training1–3. However, the widespread adoption of augmented-reality (AR) displays has been limited due to the bulky projection optics of their light engines and their inability to accurately portray three-dimensional (3D) depth cues for virtual content, among other factors4,5. Here we introduce a holographic AR system that overcomes these challenges using a unique combination of inverse-designed full-colour metasurface gratings, a compact dispersion-compensating waveguide geometry and artificial-intelligence-driven holography algorithms. These elements are co-designed to eliminate the need for bulky collimation optics between the spatial light modulator and the waveguide and to present vibrant, full-colour, 3D AR content in a compact device form factor. To deliver unprecedented visual quality with our prototype, we develop an innovative image formation model that combines a physically accurate waveguide model with learned components that are automatically calibrated using camera feedback. Our unique co-design of a nanophotonic metasurface waveguide and artificial-intelligence-driven holographic algorithms represents a significant advancement in creating visually compelling 3D AR experiences in a compact wearable device. We develop a method for providing high-quality, holographic, three-dimensional augmented-reality images in a small form factor suitable for incorporation in eyeglass-scale wearables, using high-refraction-index glass waveguides with nanoscale metasurfaces, and incorporating artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract produce amino acid bile acid amidates that can affect host-mediated metabolic processes1–6; however, the bacterial gene(s) responsible for their production remain unknown. Herein, we report that bile salt hydrolase (BSH) possesses dual functions in bile acid metabolism. Specifically, we identified a previously unknown role for BSH as an amine N-acyltransferase that conjugates amines to bile acids, thus forming bacterial bile acid amidates (BBAAs). To characterize this amine N-acyltransferase BSH activity, we used pharmacological inhibition of BSH, heterologous expression of bsh and mutants in Escherichia coli and bsh knockout and complementation in Bacteroides fragilis to demonstrate that BSH generates BBAAs. We further show in a human infant cohort that BBAA production is positively correlated with the colonization of bsh-expressing bacteria. Lastly, we report that in cell culture models, BBAAs activate host ligand-activated transcription factors including the pregnane X receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. These findings enhance our understanding of how gut bacteria, through the promiscuous actions of BSH, have a significant role in regulating the bile acid metabolic network. We find that bile salt hydrolase N-acyltransferase activity can form bacterial bile acid amidates that are positively correlated with the colonization of gut bacteria that assist in the regulation of the bile acid metabolic network.",

    "abstract": "The advantage of 3D printing—that is, additive manufacturing (AM) of structural materials—has been severely compromised by their disappointing fatigue properties1,2. Commonly, poor fatigue properties appear to result from the presence of microvoids induced by current printing process procedures3,4. Accordingly, the question that we pose is whether the elimination of such microvoids can provide a feasible solution for marked enhancement of the fatigue resistance of void-free AM (Net-AM) alloys. Here we successfully rebuild an approximate void-free AM microstructure in Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy by development of a Net-AM processing technique through an understanding of the asynchronism of phase transformation and grain growth. We identify the fatigue resistance of such AM microstructures and show that they lead to a high fatigue limit of around 1 GPa, exceeding the fatigue resistance of all AM and forged titanium alloys as well as that of other metallic materials. We confirm the high fatigue resistance of Net-AM microstructures and the potential advantages of AM processing in the production of structural components with maximum fatigue strength, which is beneficial for further application of AM technologies in engineering fields. We successfully rebuild an approximate void-free additive manufacturing microstructure in Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy by the development of a void-free additive manufacturing processing technique through an understanding of the asynchronism of phase transformation and grain growth.",

    "abstract": "The blood–brain barrier (BBB) protects the central nervous system from infections or harmful substances1; its impairment can lead to or exacerbate various diseases of the central nervous system2–4. However, the mechanisms of BBB disruption during infection and inflammatory conditions5,6 remain poorly defined. Here we find that activation of the pore-forming protein GSDMD by the cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensor caspase-11 (refs. 7–9), but not by TLR4-induced cytokines, mediates BBB breakdown in response to circulating LPS or during LPS-induced sepsis. Mice deficient in the LBP–CD14 LPS transfer and internalization pathway10–12 resist BBB disruption. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that brain endothelial cells (bECs), which express high levels of GSDMD, have a prominent response to circulating LPS. LPS acting on bECs primes Casp11 and Cd14 expression and induces GSDMD-mediated plasma membrane permeabilization and pyroptosis in vitro and in mice. Electron microscopy shows that this features ultrastructural changes in the disrupted BBB, including pyroptotic endothelia, abnormal appearance of tight junctions and vasculature detachment from the basement membrane. Comprehensive mouse genetic analyses, combined with a bEC-targeting adeno-associated virus system, establish that GSDMD activation in bECs underlies BBB disruption by LPS. Delivery of active GSDMD into bECs bypasses LPS stimulation and opens the BBB. In CASP4-humanized mice, Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae infection disrupts the BBB; this is blocked by expression of a GSDMD-neutralizing nanobody in bECs. Our findings outline a mechanism for inflammatory BBB breakdown, and suggest potential therapies for diseases of the central nervous system associated with BBB impairment. Lipopolysaccharide-induced breakdown of the blood–brain barrier requires activation of GSDMD-mediated plasma membrane permeabilization and pyroptosis in brain endothelial cells.",

Except for the computational discovery of high-entropy carbides, performed with the entropy-forming-ability descriptor4, most innovation has been slowly driven by experimental means1–3. Hence, advancement in the field needs more theoretical contributions. Here we introduce disordered enthalpy–entropy descriptor (DEED), a descriptor that captures the balance between entropy gains and enthalpy costs, allowing the correct classification of functional synthesizability of multicomponent ceramics, regardless of chemistry and structure. To make our calculations possible, we have developed a convolutional algorithm that drastically reduces computational resources. Moreover, DEED guides the experimental discovery of new single-phase high-entropy carbonitrides and borides. This work, integrated into the AFLOW computational ecosystem, provides an array of potential new candidates, ripe for experimental discoveries.

    "abstract": "The arachnoid barrier delineates the border between the central nervous system and dura mater. Although the arachnoid barrier creates a partition, communication between the central nervous system and the dura mater is crucial for waste clearance and immune surveillance1,2. How the arachnoid barrier balances separation and communication is poorly understood. Here, using transcriptomic data, we developed transgenic mice to examine specific anatomical structures that function as routes across the arachnoid barrier. Bridging veins create discontinuities where they cross the arachnoid barrier, forming structures that we termed arachnoid cuff exit (ACE) points. The openings that ACE points create allow the exchange of fluids and molecules between the subarachnoid space and the dura, enabling the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and limited entry of molecules from the dura to the subarachnoid space. In healthy human volunteers, magnetic resonance imaging tracers transit along bridging veins in a similar manner to access the subarachnoid space. Notably, in neuroinflammatory conditions such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, ACE points also enable cellular trafficking, representing a route for immune cells to directly enter the subarachnoid space from the dura mater. Collectively, our results indicate that ACE points are a critical part of the anatomy of neuroimmune communication in both mice and humans that link the central nervous system with the dura and its immunological diversity and waste clearance systems. Arachnoid cuff exit points create openings in the arachnoid barrier enabling the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and exchange of molecules and cells between the dura and the subarachnoid space, therefore physically connecting the brain and the dura.",

    "abstract": "Spatial, momentum and energy separation of electronic spins in condensed-matter systems guides the development of new devices in which spin-polarized current is generated and manipulated1–3. Recent attention on a set of previously overlooked symmetry operations in magnetic materials4 leads to the emergence of a new type of spin splitting, enabling giant and momentum-dependent spin polarization of energy bands on selected antiferromagnets5–10. Despite the ever-growing theoretical predictions, the direct spectroscopic proof of such spin splitting is still lacking. Here we provide solid spectroscopic and computational evidence for the existence of such materials. In the noncoplanar antiferromagnet manganese ditelluride (MnTe2), the in-plane components of spin are found to be antisymmetric about the high-symmetry planes of the Brillouin zone, comprising a plaid-like spin texture in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Such an unconventional spin pattern, further found to diminish at the high-temperature paramagnetic state, originates from the intrinsic AFM order instead of spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Our finding demonstrates a new type of quadratic spin texture induced by time-reversal breaking, placing AFM spintronics on a firm basis and paving the way for studying exotic quantum phenomena in related materials. Examining the in-plane spin components of the noncoplanar antiferromagnet manganese ditelluride provides spectroscopic and computational evidence of materials with a new type of plaid-like spin splitting in the antiferromagnetic ground state.",

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7−δ under high pressure with a transition temperature around 80 K (ref. 1) has sparked extensive experimental2–6 and theoretical efforts7–12. Several key questions regarding the pairing mechanism remain to be answered, such as the most relevant atomic orbitals and the role of atomic deficiencies. Here we develop a new, energy-filtered, multislice electron ptychography technique, assisted by electron energy-loss spectroscopy, to address these critical issues. Oxygen vacancies are directly visualized and are found to primarily occupy the inner apical sites, which have been proposed to be crucial to superconductivity13,14. We precisely determine the nanoscale stoichiometry and its correlation to the oxygen K-edge spectra, which reveals a significant inhomogeneity in the oxygen content and electronic structure within the sample. The spectroscopic results also reveal that stoichiometric La3Ni2O7 has strong charge-transfer characteristics, with holes that are self-doped from Ni sites into O sites. The ligand holes mainly reside on the inner apical O and the planar O, whereas the density on the outer apical O is negligible. As the concentration of O vacancies increases, ligand holes on both sites are simultaneously annihilated. These observations will assist in further development and understanding of superconducting nickelate materials. Our imaging technique for quantifying atomic deficiencies can also be widely applied in materials science and condensed-matter physics. Direct visualization of oxygen vacancies and self-doped ligand holes reveals the role of ligand oxygen in La3Ni2O7−δ and provides further understanding of superconducting nickelate materials.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics contribute to cancer development1,2, and increased stiffness is known to promote HCC progression in cirrhotic conditions3,4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by an accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in the ECM; however, how this affects HCC in non-cirrhotic conditions is unclear. Here we find that, in patients and animal models, AGEs promote changes in collagen architecture and enhance ECM viscoelasticity, with greater viscous dissipation and faster stress relaxation, but not changes in stiffness. High AGEs and viscoelasticity combined with oncogenic β-catenin signalling promote HCC induction, whereas inhibiting AGE production, reconstituting the AGE clearance receptor AGER1 or breaking AGE-mediated collagen cross-links reduces viscoelasticity and HCC growth. Matrix analysis and computational modelling demonstrate that lower interconnectivity of AGE-bundled collagen matrix, marked by shorter fibre length and greater heterogeneity, enhances viscoelasticity. Mechanistically, animal studies and 3D cell cultures show that enhanced viscoelasticity promotes HCC cell proliferation and invasion through an integrin-β1–tensin-1–YAP mechanotransductive pathway. These results reveal that AGE-mediated structural changes enhance ECM viscoelasticity, and that viscoelasticity can promote cancer progression in vivo, independent of stiffness. Structural changes mediated by advanced glycation end-products enhance extracellular matrix viscoelasticity, and that viscoelasticity can promote cancer progression in vivo, independent of stiffness.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine that can limit immune cell activation and cytokine production in innate immune cell types1. Loss of IL-10 signalling results in life-threatening inflammatory bowel disease in humans and mice—however, the exact mechanism by which IL-10 signalling subdues inflammation remains unclear2–5. Here we find that increased saturated very long chain (VLC) ceramides are critical for the heightened inflammatory gene expression that is a hallmark of IL-10 deficiency. Accordingly, genetic deletion of ceramide synthase 2 (encoded by Cers2), the enzyme responsible for VLC ceramide production, limited the exacerbated inflammatory gene expression programme associated with IL-10 deficiency both in vitro and in vivo. The accumulation of saturated VLC ceramides was regulated by a decrease in metabolic flux through the de novo mono-unsaturated fatty acid synthesis pathway. Restoring mono-unsaturated fatty acid availability to cells deficient in IL-10 signalling limited saturated VLC ceramide production and the associated inflammation. Mechanistically, we find that persistent inflammation mediated by VLC ceramides is largely dependent on sustained activity of REL, an immuno-modulatory transcription factor. Together, these data indicate that an IL-10-driven fatty acid desaturation programme rewires VLC ceramide accumulation and aberrant activation of REL. These studies support the idea that fatty acid homeostasis in innate immune cells serves as a key regulatory node to control pathologic inflammation and suggests that ‘metabolic correction’ of VLC homeostasis could be an important strategy to normalize dysregulated inflammation caused by the absence of IL-10. IL-10 exerts its anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages by increasing the expression of enzymes that promote fatty acid desaturation and downstream regulation of the transcription factor REL.",

    "abstract": "For healthspan and lifespan, ERK, AMPK and mTORC1 represent critical pathways and inflammation is a centrally important hallmark1–7. Here we examined whether IL-11, a pro-inflammatory cytokine of the IL-6 family, has a negative effect on age-associated disease and lifespan. As mice age, IL-11 is upregulated across cell types and tissues to regulate an ERK–AMPK–mTORC1 axis to modulate cellular, tissue- and organismal-level ageing pathologies. Deletion of Il11 or Il11ra1 protects against metabolic decline, multi-morbidity and frailty in old age. Administration of anti-IL-11 to 75-week-old mice for 25 weeks improves metabolism and muscle function, and reduces ageing biomarkers and frailty across sexes. In lifespan studies, genetic deletion of Il11 extended the lives of mice of both sexes, by 24.9% on average. Treatment with anti-IL-11 from 75 weeks of age until death extends the median lifespan of male mice by 22.5% and of female mice by 25%. Together, these results demonstrate a role for the pro-inflammatory factor IL-11 in mammalian healthspan and lifespan. We suggest that anti-IL-11 therapy, which is currently in early-stage clinical trials for fibrotic lung disease, may provide a translational opportunity to determine the effects of IL-11 inhibition on ageing pathologies in older people. IL-11 is identified as a key regulator of ERK–AMPK–mTORC1 signalling, metabolism, inflammation and age-related disease and lifespan in mouse and human.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has transformed the treatment of haematological malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, B cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma1–4, but the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in solid tumours has been limited5. This is owing to a number of factors, including the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment that gives rise to poorly persisting and metabolically dysfunctional T cells. Analysis of anti-CD19 CAR T cells used clinically has shown that positive treatment outcomes are associated with a more ‘stem-like’ phenotype and increased mitochondrial mass6–8. We therefore sought to identify transcription factors that could enhance CAR T cell fitness and efficacy against solid tumours. Here we show that overexpression of FOXO1 promotes a stem-like phenotype in CAR T cells derived from either healthy human donors or patients, which correlates with improved mitochondrial fitness, persistence and therapeutic efficacy in vivo. This work thus reveals an engineering approach to genetically enforce a favourable metabolic phenotype that has high translational potential to improve the efficacy of CAR T cells against solid tumours. Increased effectiveness of anti-cancer chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy is associated with a stem-like phenotype through increased expression of FOXO1.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) perovskite heterostructures have played a key role in advancing the performance of perovskite solar cells1,2. However, the migration of cations between 2D and 3D layers results in the disruption of octahedral networks, leading to degradation in performance over time3,4. We hypothesized that perovskitoids, with robust organic–inorganic networks enabled by edge- and face-sharing, could impede ion migration. We explored a set of perovskitoids of varying dimensionality and found that cation migration within perovskitoid–perovskite heterostructures was suppressed compared with the 2D–3D perovskite case. Increasing the dimensionality of perovskitoids improves charge transport when they are interfaced with 3D perovskite surfaces—this is the result of enhanced octahedral connectivity and out-of-plane orientation. The 2D perovskitoid (A6BfP)8Pb7I22 (A6BfP: N-aminohexyl-benz[f]-phthalimide) provides efficient passivation of perovskite surfaces and enables uniform large-area perovskite films. Devices based on perovskitoid–perovskite heterostructures achieve a certified quasi-steady-state power conversion efficiency of 24.6% for centimetre-area perovskite solar cells. We removed the fragile hole transport layers and showed stable operation of the underlying perovskitoid–perovskite heterostructure at 85 °C for 1,250 h for encapsulated large-area devices in ambient air. We find that 2D–3D perovskitoid passivation applied to perovskite solar cells impedes cation migration and decreases carrier recombination at the interface, providing enhanced operating stability at elevated temperatures and increased power conversion efficiencies.",

Here we demonstrate a two-node quantum network composed of multi-qubit registers based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) centres in nanophotonic diamond cavities integrated with a telecommunication fibre network. Remote entanglement is generated by the cavity-enhanced interactions between the electron spin qubits of the SiVs and optical photons. Serial, heralded spin-photon entangling gate operations with time-bin qubits are used for robust entanglement of separated nodes. Long-lived nuclear spin qubits are used to provide second-long entanglement storage and integrated error detection. By integrating efficient bidirectional quantum frequency conversion of photonic communication qubits to telecommunication frequencies (1,350 nm), we demonstrate the entanglement of two nuclear spin memories through 40 km spools of low-loss fibre and a 35-km long fibre loop deployed in the Boston area urban environment, representing an enabling step towards practical quantum repeaters and large-scale quantum networks.

    "abstract": "Ageing of the immune system is characterized by decreased lymphopoiesis and adaptive immunity, and increased inflammation and myeloid pathologies1,2. Age-related changes in populations of self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to underlie these phenomena3. During youth, HSCs with balanced output of lymphoid and myeloid cells (bal-HSCs) predominate over HSCs with myeloid-biased output (my-HSCs), thereby promoting the lymphopoiesis required for initiating adaptive immune responses, while limiting the production of myeloid cells, which can be pro-inflammatory4. Ageing is associated with increased proportions of my-HSCs, resulting in decreased lymphopoiesis and increased myelopoiesis3,5,6. Transfer of bal-HSCs results in abundant lymphoid and myeloid cells, a stable phenotype that is retained after secondary transfer; my-HSCs also retain their patterns of production after secondary transfer5. The origin and potential interconversion of these two subsets is still unclear. If they are separate subsets postnatally, it might be possible to reverse the ageing phenotype by eliminating my-HSCs in aged mice. Here we demonstrate that antibody-mediated depletion of my-HSCs in aged mice restores characteristic features of a more youthful immune system, including increasing common lymphocyte progenitors, naive T cells and B cells, while decreasing age-related markers of immune decline. Depletion of my-HSCs in aged mice improves primary and secondary adaptive immune responses to viral infection. These findings may have relevance to the understanding and intervention of diseases exacerbated or caused by dominance of the haematopoietic system by my-HSCs. Antibody-mediated depletion of myeloid-biased haematopoietic stem cells in aged mice restores characteristic features of a more youthful immune system.",

Current machine-learning approaches, however, are not applicable to most mathematical domains owing to the high cost of translating human proofs into machine-verifiable format. The problem is even worse for geometry because of its unique translation challenges1,5, resulting in severe scarcity of training data. We propose AlphaGeometry, a theorem prover for Euclidean plane geometry that sidesteps the need for human demonstrations by synthesizing millions of theorems and proofs across different levels of complexity. AlphaGeometry is a neuro-symbolic system that uses a neural language model, trained from scratch on our large-scale synthetic data, to guide a symbolic deduction engine through infinite branching points in challenging problems. On a test set of 30 latest olympiad-level problems, AlphaGeometry solves 25, outperforming the previous best method that only solves ten problems and approaching the performance of an average International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) gold medallist. Notably, AlphaGeometry produces human-readable proofs, solves all geometry problems in the IMO 2000 and 2015 under human expert evaluation and discovers a generalized version of a translated IMO theorem in 2004. A new neuro-symbolic theorem prover for Euclidean plane geometry trained from scratch on millions of synthesized theorems and proofs outperforms the previous best method and reaches the performance of an olympiad gold medallist.",

With about 180 million tonnes produced per year1, red mud has amassed to one of the largest environmentally hazardous waste products, with the staggering amount of 4 billion tonnes accumulated on a global scale1. Here we present how this red mud can be turned into valuable and sustainable feedstock for ironmaking using fossil-free hydrogen-plasma-based reduction, thus mitigating a part of the steel-related carbon dioxide emissions by making it available for the production of several hundred million tonnes of green steel. The process proceeds through rapid liquid-state reduction, chemical partitioning, as well as density-driven and viscosity-driven separation between metal and oxides. We show the underlying chemical reactions, pH-neutralization processes and phase transformations during this surprisingly simple and fast reduction method. The approach establishes a sustainable toxic-waste treatment from aluminium production through using red mud as feedstock to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from steelmaking. Red mud is shown to yield green steel through fossil-free hydrogen-plasma-based reduction, a simple and fast method involving rapid liquid-state reduction, chemical partitioning, and density-driven and viscosity-driven separation.",

    "abstract": "Lignocellulose is mainly composed of hydrophobic lignin and hydrophilic polysaccharide polymers, contributing to an indispensable carbon resource for green biorefineries1,2. When chemically treated, lignin is compromised owing to detrimental intra- and intermolecular crosslinking that hampers downstream process3,4. The current valorization paradigms aim to avoid the formation of new C–C bonds, referred to as condensation, by blocking or stabilizing the vulnerable moieties of lignin5–7. Although there have been efforts to enhance biomass utilization through the incorporation of phenolic additives8,9, exploiting lignin’s proclivity towards condensation remains unproven for valorizing both lignin and carbohydrates to high-value products. Here we leverage the proclivity by directing the C–C bond formation in a catalytic arylation pathway using lignin-derived phenols with high nucleophilicity. The selectively condensed lignin, isolated in near-quantitative yields while preserving its prominent cleavable β-ether units, can be unlocked in a tandem catalytic process involving aryl migration and transfer hydrogenation. Lignin in wood is thereby converted to benign bisphenols (34–48 wt%) that represent performance-advantaged replacements for their fossil-based counterparts. Delignified pulp from cellulose and xylose from xylan are co-produced for textile fibres and renewable chemicals. This condensation-driven strategy represents a key advancement complementary to other promising monophenol-oriented approaches targeting valuable platform chemicals and materials, thereby contributing to holistic biomass valorization. By controlling C–C bond formation in catalytic arylation, lignin can be efficiently extracted from biomass and converted into benign bisphenols that can be used as replacements for their fossil-based counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Individuals differ widely in their immune responses, with age, sex and genetic factors having major roles in this inherent variability1–6. However, the variables that drive such differences in cytokine secretion—a crucial component of the host response to immune challenges—remain poorly defined. Here we investigated 136 variables and identified smoking, cytomegalovirus latent infection and body mass index as major contributors to variability in cytokine response, with effects of comparable magnitudes with age, sex and genetics. We find that smoking influences both innate and adaptive immune responses. Notably, its effect on innate responses is quickly lost after smoking cessation and is specifically associated with plasma levels of CEACAM6, whereas its effect on adaptive responses persists long after individuals quit smoking and is associated with epigenetic memory. This is supported by the association of the past smoking effect on cytokine responses with DNA methylation at specific signal trans-activators and regulators of metabolism. Our findings identify three novel variables associated with cytokine secretion variability and reveal roles for smoking in the short- and long-term regulation of immune responses. These results have potential clinical implications for the risk of developing infections, cancers or autoimmune diseases. A survey of 136 factors that may influence cytokine secretion identify smoking, cytomegalovirus latent infection and body mass index as influential factors, with varying effects on innate and adaptive immunity.",

    "abstract": "Ammonia is crucial as a fertilizer and in the chemical industry and is considered to be a carbon-free fuel1. Ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrogen under ambient conditions offers an attractive alternative to the Haber–Bosch process2,3, and lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction represents a promising approach to continuous-flow ammonia electrosynthesis, coupling nitrogen reduction with hydrogen oxidation4. However, tetrahydrofuran, which is commonly used as a solvent, impedes long-term ammonia production owing to polymerization and volatility problems. Here we show that a chain-ether-based electrolyte enables long-term continuous ammonia synthesis. We find that a chain-ether-based solvent exhibits non-polymerization properties and a high boiling point (162 °C) and forms a compact solid-electrolyte interphase layer on the gas diffusion electrode, facilitating ammonia release in the gas phase and ensuring electrolyte stability. We demonstrate 300 h of continuous operation in a flow electrolyser with a 25 cm2 electrode at 1 bar pressure and room temperature, and achieve a current-to-ammonia efficiency of 64 ± 1% with a gas-phase ammonia content of approximately 98%. Our results highlight the crucial role of the solvent in long-term continuous ammonia synthesis. Use of a chain-ether-based solvent instead of tetrahydrofuran for lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction enables long-term continuous ammonia electrosynthesis with high efficiency and improved gas-phase ammonia distribution.",

    "abstract": "Prime editing enables the precise modification of genomes through reverse transcription of template sequences appended to the 3′ ends of CRISPR–Cas guide RNAs1. To identify cellular determinants of prime editing, we developed scalable prime editing reporters and performed genome-scale CRISPR-interference screens. From these screens, a single factor emerged as the strongest mediator of prime editing: the small RNA-binding exonuclease protection factor La. Further investigation revealed that La promotes prime editing across approaches (PE2, PE3, PE4 and PE5), edit types (substitutions, insertions and deletions), endogenous loci and cell types but has no consistent effect on genome-editing approaches that rely on standard, unextended guide RNAs. Previous work has shown that La binds polyuridine tracts at the 3′ ends of RNA polymerase III transcripts2. We found that La functionally interacts with the 3′ ends of polyuridylated prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs). Guided by these results, we developed a prime editor protein (PE7) fused to the RNA-binding, N-terminal domain of La. This editor improved prime editing with expressed pegRNAs and engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs), as well as with synthetic pegRNAs optimized for La binding. Together, our results provide key insights into how prime editing components interact with the cellular environment and suggest general strategies for stabilizing exogenous small RNAs therein. Genome-scale genetic screens identify the small RNA-binding protein La as a strong mediator of prime editing.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease is the leading cause of dementia worldwide, but the cellular pathways that underlie its pathological progression across brain regions remain poorly understood1–3. Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of six different brain regions in the aged human brain, covering 1.3 million cells from 283 post-mortem human brain samples across 48 individuals with and without Alzheimer’s disease. We identify 76 cell types, including region-specific subtypes of astrocytes and excitatory neurons and an inhibitory interneuron population unique to the thalamus and distinct from canonical inhibitory subclasses. We identify vulnerable populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are depleted in specific brain regions in Alzheimer’s disease, and provide evidence that the Reelin signalling pathway is involved in modulating the vulnerability of these neurons. We develop a scalable method for discovering gene modules, which we use to identify cell-type-specific and region-specific modules that are altered in Alzheimer’s disease and to annotate transcriptomic differences associated with diverse pathological variables. We identify an astrocyte program that is associated with cognitive resilience to Alzheimer’s disease pathology, tying choline metabolism and polyamine biosynthesis in astrocytes to preserved cognitive function late in life. Together, our study develops a regional atlas of the ageing human brain and provides insights into cellular vulnerability, response and resilience to Alzheimer’s disease pathology. A regional atlas of the ageing human brain—spanning six distinct anatomical regions from individuals with and without Alzheimer’s dementia—provides insights into cellular vulnerability, response and resilience to Alzheimer’s disease pathology",

    "abstract": "The wealth of complex polar topologies1–10 recently found in nanoscale ferroelectrics results from a delicate balance between the intrinsic tendency of the materials to develop a homogeneous polarization and the electric and mechanical boundary conditions imposed on them. Ferroelectric–dielectric interfaces are model systems in which polarization curling originates from open circuit-like electric boundary conditions, to avoid the build-up of polarization charges through the formation of flux-closure11–14 domains that evolve into vortex-like structures at the nanoscale15–17 level. Although ferroelectricity is known to couple strongly with strain (both homogeneous18 and inhomogeneous19,20), the effect of mechanical constraints21 on thin-film nanoscale ferroelectrics has been comparatively less explored because of the relative paucity of strain patterns that can be implemented experimentally. Here we show that the stacking of freestanding ferroelectric perovskite layers with controlled twist angles provides an opportunity to tailor these topological nanostructures in a way determined by the lateral strain modulation associated with the twisting. Furthermore, we find that a peculiar pattern of polarization vortices and antivortices emerges from the flexoelectric coupling of polarization to strain gradients. This finding provides opportunities to create two-dimensional high-density vortex crystals that would enable us to explore previously unknown physical effects and functionalities. The stacking of freestanding ferroelectric perovskite layers with controlled twist angles results in a peculiar pattern of polarization vortices and antivortices that emerges from the flexoelectric coupling of polarization to strain gradients.",

    "abstract": "Ordered layered structures serve as essential components in lithium (Li)-ion cathodes1–3. However, on charging, the inherently delicate Li-deficient frameworks become vulnerable to lattice strain and structural and/or chemo-mechanical degradation, resulting in rapid capacity deterioration and thus short battery life2,4. Here we report an approach that addresses these issues using the integration of chemical short-range disorder (CSRD) into oxide cathodes, which involves the localized distribution of elements in a crystalline lattice over spatial dimensions, spanning a few nearest-neighbour spacings. This is guided by fundamental principles of structural chemistry and achieved through an improved ceramic synthesis process. To demonstrate its viability, we showcase how the introduction of CSRD substantially affects the crystal structure of layered Li cobalt oxide cathodes. This is manifested in the transition metal environment and its interactions with oxygen, effectively preventing detrimental sliding of crystal slabs and structural deterioration during Li removal. Meanwhile, it affects the electronic structure, leading to improved electronic conductivity. These attributes are highly beneficial for Li-ion storage capabilities, markedly improving cycle life and rate capability. Moreover, we find that CSRD can be introduced in additional layered oxide materials through improved chemical co-doping, further illustrating its potential to enhance structural and electrochemical stability. These findings open up new avenues for the design of oxide cathodes, offering insights into the effects of CSRD on the crystal and electronic structure of advanced functional materials. The introduction of chemical short-range disorder substantially affects the crystal structure of layered lithium oxide cathodes, leading to improved charge transfer and structural stability.",

    "abstract": "Major migration events in Holocene Eurasia have been characterized genetically at broad regional scales1–4. However, insights into the population dynamics in the contact zones are hampered by a lack of ancient genomic data sampled at high spatiotemporal resolution5–7. Here, to address this, we analysed shotgun-sequenced genomes from 100 skeletons spanning 7,300 years of the Mesolithic period, Neolithic period and Early Bronze Age in Denmark and integrated these with proxies for diet (13C and 15N content), mobility (87Sr/86Sr ratio) and vegetation cover (pollen). We observe that Danish Mesolithic individuals of the Maglemose, Kongemose and Ertebølle cultures form a distinct genetic cluster related to other Western European hunter-gatherers. Despite shifts in material culture they displayed genetic homogeneity from around 10,500 to 5,900 calibrated years before present, when Neolithic farmers with Anatolian-derived ancestry arrived. Although the Neolithic transition was delayed by more than a millennium relative to Central Europe, it was very abrupt and resulted in a population turnover with limited genetic contribution from local hunter-gatherers. The succeeding Neolithic population, associated with the Funnel Beaker culture, persisted for only about 1,000 years before immigrants with eastern Steppe-derived ancestry arrived. This second and equally rapid population replacement gave rise to the Single Grave culture with an ancestry profile more similar to present-day Danes. In our multiproxy dataset, these major demographic events are manifested as parallel shifts in genotype, phenotype, diet and land use. Integrated data, including 100 human genomes from the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Early Bronze Age periods show that two major population turnovers occurred over just 1,000 years in Neolithic Denmark, resulting in dramatic changes in the genes, diet and physical appearance of the local people, as well as the landscape in which they lived.",

Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo.

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids represent the mainstay of therapy for a broad spectrum of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-inflammatory mode of action have remained incompletely understood1. Here we show that the anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids involve reprogramming of the mitochondrial metabolism of macrophages, resulting in increased and sustained production of the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate and consequent inhibition of the inflammatory response. The glucocorticoid receptor interacts with parts of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex whereby glucocorticoids provoke an increase in activity and enable an accelerated and paradoxical flux of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in otherwise pro-inflammatory macrophages. This glucocorticoid-mediated rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism potentiates TCA-cycle-dependent production of itaconate throughout the inflammatory response, thereby interfering with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, artificial blocking of the TCA cycle or genetic deficiency in aconitate decarboxylase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of itaconate synthesis, interferes with the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids and, accordingly, abrogates their beneficial effects during a diverse range of preclinical models of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Our findings provide important insights into the anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids and have substantial implications for the design of new classes of anti-inflammatory drugs. Glucocorticoids reprogram the mitochondrial metabolism of macrophages, resulting in increased and sustained production of the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate and, as a consequence, inhibition of the inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "l-lactate modifies proteins through lactylation1, but how this process occurs is unclear. Here we identify the alanyl-tRNA synthetases AARS1 and AARS2 (AARS1/2) as intracellular l-lactate sensors required for l-lactate to stimulate the lysine lactylome in cells. AARS1/2 and the evolutionarily conserved Escherichia coli orthologue AlaRS bind to l-lactate with micromolar affinity and they directly catalyse l-lactate for ATP-dependent lactylation on the lysine acceptor end. In response to l-lactate, AARS2 associates with cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) and mediates its lactylation and inactivation in cells and in mice. By establishing a genetic code expansion orthogonal system for lactyl-lysine incorporation, we demonstrate that the presence of a lactyl moiety at a specific cGAS amino-terminal site abolishes cGAS liquid-like phase separation and DNA sensing in vitro and in vivo. A lactyl mimetic knock-in inhibits cGAS, whereas a lactyl-resistant knock-in protects mice against innate immune evasion induced through high levels of l-lactate. MCT1 blockade inhibits cGAS lactylation in stressed mice and restores innate immune surveillance, which in turn antagonizes viral replication. Thus, AARS1/2 are conserved intracellular l-lactate sensors and have an essential role as lactyltransferases. Moreover, a chemical reaction process of lactylation targets and inactivates cGAS. The tRNA synthases AARS1 and AARS2 are identified as evolutionarily conserved sensors of intracellular l-lactate to mediate the global lysine lactylome.",

    "abstract": "α-FA1−xCsxPbI3 is a promising absorbent material for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs)1,2. However, the most efficient α-FA1−xCsxPbI3 PSCs require the inclusion of the additive methylammonium chloride3,4, which generates volatile organic residues (methylammonium) that limit device stability at elevated temperatures5. Previously, the highest certified power-conversion efficiency of α-FA1−xCsxPbI3 PSCs without methylammonium chloride was only approximately 24% (refs. 6,7), and these PSCs have yet to exhibit any stability advantages. Here we identify interfacial contact loss caused by the accumulation of Cs+ in conventional α-FA1−xCsxPbI3 PSCs, which deteriorates device performance and stability. Through in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate an intermediate-phase-assisted crystallization pathway enabled by acetate surface coordination to fabricate high-quality α-FA1−xCsxPbI3 films, without using the methylammonium additive. We herein report a certified stabilized power output efficiency of 25.94% and a reverse-scanning power-conversion efficiency of 26.64% for α-FA1−xCsxPbI3 PSCs. Moreover, the devices exhibited negligible contact losses and enhanced operational stability. They retained over 95% of their initial power-conversion efficiency after operating for over 2,000 h at the maximum power point under 1 sun, 85 °C and 60% relative humidity (ISOS-L-3). Suppressing surface Cs+ accumulation in methylammonium-free α-FA1−xCsxPbI3 perovskite with an intermediate phase-assisted strategy enables high-efficiency and thermally stable photovoltaics.",

    "abstract": "Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections may act as viral reservoirs that could seed future outbreaks1–5, give rise to highly divergent lineages6–8 and contribute to cases with post-acute COVID-19 sequelae (long COVID)9,10. However, the population prevalence of persistent infections, their viral load kinetics and evolutionary dynamics over the course of infections remain largely unknown. Here, using viral sequence data collected as part of a national infection survey, we identified 381 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 RNA at high titre persisting for at least 30 days, of which 54 had viral RNA persisting at least 60 days. We refer to these as ‘persistent infections’ as available evidence suggests that they represent ongoing viral replication, although the persistence of non-replicating RNA cannot be ruled out in all. Individuals with persistent infection had more than 50% higher odds of self-reporting long COVID than individuals with non-persistent infection. We estimate that 0.1–0.5% of infections may become persistent with typically rebounding high viral loads and last for at least 60 days. In some individuals, we identified many viral amino acid substitutions, indicating periods of strong positive selection, whereas others had no consensus change in the sequences for prolonged periods, consistent with weak selection. Substitutions included mutations that are lineage defining for SARS-CoV-2 variants, at target sites for monoclonal antibodies and/or are commonly found in immunocompromised people11–14. This work has profound implications for understanding and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemiology and evolution. Using viral sequence data, individuals with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified, and had higher odds of self-reporting long COVID, in a large community surveillance study.",

    "abstract": "A single dose of psilocybin, a psychedelic that acutely causes distortions of space–time perception and ego dissolution, produces rapid and persistent therapeutic effects in human clinical trials1–4. In animal models, psilocybin induces neuroplasticity in cortex and hippocampus5–8. It remains unclear how human brain network changes relate to subjective and lasting effects of psychedelics. Here we tracked individual-specific brain changes with longitudinal precision functional mapping (roughly 18 magnetic resonance imaging visits per participant). Healthy adults were tracked before, during and for 3 weeks after high-dose psilocybin (25 mg) and methylphenidate (40 mg), and brought back for an additional psilocybin dose 6–12 months later. Psilocybin massively disrupted functional connectivity (FC) in cortex and subcortex, acutely causing more than threefold greater change than methylphenidate. These FC changes were driven by brain desynchronization across spatial scales (areal, global), which dissolved network distinctions by reducing correlations within and anticorrelations between networks. Psilocybin-driven FC changes were strongest in the default mode network, which is connected to the anterior hippocampus and is thought to create our sense of space, time and self. Individual differences in FC changes were strongly linked to the subjective psychedelic experience. Performing a perceptual task reduced psilocybin-driven FC changes. Psilocybin caused persistent decrease in FC between the anterior hippocampus and default mode network, lasting for weeks. Persistent reduction of hippocampal-default mode network connectivity may represent a neuroanatomical and mechanistic correlate of the proplasticity and therapeutic effects of psychedelics. Healthy adults were tracked before, during and after high doses of psilocybin and methylphenidate to assess how psychedelics can change human brain networks, and psilocybin was found to massively disrupt functional connectivity in cortex and subcortex with some changes persisting for weeks.",

However, contextualizing recent anthropogenic warming against past natural variability is challenging because the sparse meteorological records from the nineteenth century tend to overestimate temperatures6. Here we combine observed and reconstructed June–August surface air temperatures to show that 2023 was the warmest Northern Hemisphere extra-tropical summer over the past 2,000 years exceeding the 95% confidence range of natural climate variability by more than ca. 0.4 °C. Comparison of the 2023 June–August warming against the coldest reconstructed summer in ce 536 shows a maximum range of pre-Anthropocene-to-2023 temperatures of 3.93 °C. Although 2023 is consistent with a greenhouse-gases-induced warming trend7 that is amplified by an unfolding El Niño event8, this extreme emphasizes the urgency to implement international agreements for carbon emission reduction. Observations and a reconstruction of the June–August surface air temperatures show that 2023 was the warmest summer over the past 2,000 years exceeding the 95% confidence range of natural climate variability by more than 0.5 °Cs.",

    "abstract": "The Holocene (beginning around 12,000 years ago) encompassed some of the most significant changes in human evolution, with far-reaching consequences for the dietary, physical and mental health of present-day populations. Using a dataset of more than 1,600 imputed ancient genomes1, we modelled the selection landscape during the transition from hunting and gathering, to farming and pastoralism across West Eurasia. We identify key selection signals related to metabolism, including that selection at the FADS cluster began earlier than previously reported and that selection near the LCT locus predates the emergence of the lactase persistence allele by thousands of years. We also find strong selection in the HLA region, possibly due to increased exposure to pathogens during the Bronze Age. Using ancient individuals to infer local ancestry tracts in over 400,000 samples from the UK Biobank, we identify widespread differences in the distribution of Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age ancestries across Eurasia. By calculating ancestry-specific polygenic risk scores, we show that height differences between Northern and Southern Europe are associated with differential Steppe ancestry, rather than selection, and that risk alleles for mood-related phenotypes are enriched for Neolithic farmer ancestry, whereas risk alleles for diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease are enriched for Western hunter-gatherer ancestry. Our results indicate that ancient selection and migration were large contributors to the distribution of phenotypic diversity in present-day Europeans. Analyses of imputed ancient genomes and of samples from the UK Biobank indicate that ancient selection and migration were large contributors to the distribution of phenotypic diversity in present-day Europeans.",

    "abstract": "Non-Abelian topological order is a coveted state of matter with remarkable properties, including quasiparticles that can remember the sequence in which they are exchanged1–4. These anyonic excitations are promising building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers5,6. However, despite extensive efforts, non-Abelian topological order and its excitations have remained elusive, unlike the simpler quasiparticles or defects in Abelian topological order. Here we present the realization of non-Abelian topological order in the wavefunction prepared in a quantum processor and demonstrate control of its anyons. Using an adaptive circuit on Quantinuum’s H2 trapped-ion quantum processor, we create the ground-state wavefunction of D4 topological order on a kagome lattice of 27 qubits, with fidelity per site exceeding 98.4 per cent. By creating and moving anyons along Borromean rings in spacetime, anyon interferometry detects an intrinsically non-Abelian braiding process. Furthermore, tunnelling non-Abelions around a torus creates all 22 ground states, as well as an excited state with a single anyon—a peculiar feature of non-Abelian topological order. This work illustrates the counterintuitive nature of non-Abelions and enables their study in quantum devices. A trapped-ion quantum processor is used to create ground-states and excitations of non-Abelian topological order on a kagome lattice of 27 qubits with high fidelity.",

Here we demonstrate that neural networks synchronize individual action potentials to create large-amplitude, rhythmic and self-perpetuating ionic waves in the interstitial fluid of the brain. These waves are a plausible mechanism to explain the correlated potentiation of the glymphatic flow1,2 through the brain parenchyma. Chemogenetic flattening of these high-energy ionic waves largely impeded cerebrospinal fluid infiltration into and clearance of molecules from the brain parenchyma. Notably, synthesized waves generated through transcranial optogenetic stimulation substantially potentiated cerebrospinal fluid-to-interstitial fluid perfusion. Our study demonstrates that neurons serve as master organizers for brain clearance. This fundamental principle introduces a new theoretical framework for the functioning of macroscopic brain waves. Rhythmic neural activity drives cerebrospinal fluid perfusion through brain parenchyma to enhance brain cleansing.",

Wired clinical instruments that use percutaneous leads are accurate but are susceptible to infection, patient mobility constraints and potential surgical complications during removal2. Wireless implantable devices provide greater operational freedom but include issues such as limited detection range, poor degradation and difficulty in size reduction in the human body3. Here we present an injectable, bioresorbable and wireless metastructured hydrogel (metagel) sensor for ultrasonic monitoring of intracranial signals. The metagel sensors are cubes 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 in size that encompass both biodegradable and stimulus-responsive hydrogels and periodically aligned air columns with a specific acoustic reflection spectrum. Implanted into intracranial space with a puncture needle, the metagel deforms in response to physiological environmental changes, causing peak frequency shifts of reflected ultrasound waves that can be wirelessly measured by an external ultrasound probe. The metagel sensor can independently detect intracranial pressure, temperature, pH and flow rate, realize a detection depth of 10 cm and almost fully degrade within 18 weeks. Animal experiments on rats and pigs indicate promising multiparametric sensing performances on a par with conventional non-resorbable wired clinical benchmarks. A bioresorbable, wireless hydrogel (metagel) sensor, encompassing both biodegradable and stimulus-responsive hydrogels for ultrasonic monitoring of intracranial signals, was implanted into intracranial space with a puncture needle and deformed in response to physiological environmental changes.",

Here we report transport evidence of a fractional QSH insulator in 2.1° twisted bilayer MoTe2, which supports spin-Sz conservation and flat spin-contrasting Chern bands15,16.

    "abstract": "Permanent epigenetic silencing using programmable editors equipped with transcriptional repressors holds great promise for the treatment of human diseases1–3. However, to unlock its full therapeutic potential, an experimental confirmation of durable epigenetic silencing after the delivery of transient delivery of editors in vivo is needed. To this end, here we targeted Pcsk9, a gene expressed in hepatocytes that is involved in cholesterol homeostasis. In vitro screening of different editor designs indicated that zinc-finger proteins were the best-performing DNA-binding platform for efficient silencing of mouse Pcsk9. A single administration of lipid nanoparticles loaded with the editors’ mRNAs almost halved the circulating levels of PCSK9 for nearly one year in mice. Notably, Pcsk9 silencing and accompanying epigenetic repressive marks also persisted after forced liver regeneration, further corroborating the heritability of the newly installed epigenetic state. Improvements in construct design resulted in the development of an all-in-one configuration that we term evolved engineered transcriptional repressor (EvoETR). This design, which is characterized by a high specificity profile, further reduced the circulating levels of PCSK9 in mice with an efficiency comparable with that obtained through conventional gene editing, but without causing DNA breaks. Our study lays the foundation for the development of in vivo therapeutics that are based on epigenetic silencing. Experiments in mice show that designed epigenome editors that contain domains of transcriptional repressors can enable stable epigenetic silencing of Pcsk9, a gene with a role in cholesterol homeostasis, without inducing DNA breaks.",

    "abstract": "Although cancer initiation and progression are generally associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations1,2, substantial epigenomic alterations underlie many aspects of tumorigenesis and cancer susceptibility3–6, suggesting that genetic mechanisms might not be the only drivers of malignant transformation7. However, whether purely non-genetic mechanisms are sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis irrespective of mutations has been unknown. Here, we show that a transient perturbation of transcriptional silencing mediated by Polycomb group proteins is sufficient to induce an irreversible switch to a cancer cell fate in Drosophila. This is linked to the irreversible derepression of genes that can drive tumorigenesis, including members of the JAK–STAT signalling pathway and zfh1, the fly homologue of the ZEB1 oncogene, whose aberrant activation is required for Polycomb perturbation-induced tumorigenesis. These data show that a reversible depletion of Polycomb proteins can induce cancer in the absence of driver mutations, suggesting that tumours can emerge through epigenetic dysregulation leading to inheritance of altered cell fates. A transient perturbation of transcriptional silencing mediated by Polycomb proteins is sufficient to induce an epigenetic cancer cell fate in Drosophila in the absence of driver mutations.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation is a pharmacological modality that is based on the induced proximity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target protein to promote target ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This has been achieved either via proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs)—bifunctional compounds composed of two separate moieties that individually bind the target and E3 ligase, or via molecular glues that monovalently bind either the ligase or the target1–4. Here, using orthogonal genetic screening, biophysical characterization and structural reconstitution, we investigate the mechanism of action of bifunctional degraders of BRD2 and BRD4, termed intramolecular bivalent glues (IBGs), and find that instead of connecting target and ligase in trans as PROTACs do, they simultaneously engage and connect two adjacent domains of the target protein in cis. This conformational change ‘glues’ BRD4 to the E3 ligases DCAF11 or DCAF16, leveraging intrinsic target–ligase affinities that do not translate to BRD4 degradation in the absence of compound. Structural insights into the ternary BRD4–IBG1–DCAF16 complex guided the rational design of improved degraders of low picomolar potency. We thus introduce a new modality in targeted protein degradation, which works by bridging protein domains in cis to enhance surface complementarity with E3 ligases for productive ubiquitination and degradation. Studies using genetic screening, biophysical characterization and structural reconstitution elucidate the mechanism of action and enable rational design of a new class of functional compounds that glue target proteins to E3 ligases via intramolecularly bridging two domains to enhance intrinsic protein–protein interactions and promote target ubiquitination and degradation.",

    "abstract": "The pursuit of discovering new high-temperature superconductors that diverge from the copper-based model1–3 has profound implications for explaining mechanisms behind superconductivity and may also enable new applications4–8. Here our investigation shows that the application of pressure effectively suppresses the spin–charge order in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10−δ single crystals, leading to the emergence of superconductivity with a maximum critical temperature (Tc) of around 30 K at 69.0 GPa. The d.c. susceptibility measurements confirm a substantial diamagnetic response below Tc, indicating the presence of bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. In the normal state, we observe a strange metal behaviour, characterized by a linear temperature-dependent resistance extending up to 300 K. Furthermore, the layer-dependent superconductivity observed hints at a unique interlayer coupling mechanism specific to nickelates, setting them apart from cuprates in this regard. Our findings provide crucial insights into the fundamental mechanisms underpinning superconductivity, while also introducing a new material platform to explore the intricate interplay between the spin–charge order, flat band structures, interlayer coupling, strange metal behaviour and high-temperature superconductivity. The application of pressure effectively suppresses the spin–charge order in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10−δ single crystals, leading to the emergence of superconductivity.",

    "abstract": "Negotiations for a global treaty on plastic pollution1 will shape future policies on plastics production, use and waste management. Its parties will benefit from a high-resolution baseline of waste flows and plastic emission sources to enable identification of pollution hotspots and their causes2. Nationally aggregated waste management data can be distributed to smaller scales to identify generalized points of plastic accumulation and source phenomena3–11. However, it is challenging to use this type of spatial allocation to assess the conditions under which emissions take place12,13. Here we develop a global macroplastic pollution emissions inventory by combining conceptual modelling of emission mechanisms with measurable activity data. We define emissions as materials that have moved from the managed or mismanaged system (controlled or contained state) to the unmanaged system (uncontrolled or uncontained state—the environment). Using machine learning and probabilistic material flow analysis, we identify emission hotspots across 50,702 municipalities worldwide from five land-based plastic waste emission sources. We estimate global plastic waste emissions at 52.1 [48.3–56.3] million metric tonnes (Mt) per year, with approximately 57% wt. and 43% wt. open burned and unburned debris, respectively. Littering is the largest emission source in the Global North, whereas uncollected waste is the dominant emissions source across the Global South. We suggest that our findings can help inform treaty negotiations and develop national and sub-national waste management action plans and source inventories. A global macroplastic pollution emissions inventory and methodology is developed using machine learning and probabilistic material flow analysis, to identify hotspots across more than 50,000 municipalities worldwide from five land-based plastic waste emission sources.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria are extraordinarily difficult to kill because their cytoplasmic membrane is surrounded by an outer membrane that blocks the entry of most antibiotics. The impenetrable nature of the outer membrane is due to the presence of a large, amphipathic glycolipid called lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in its outer leaflet1. Assembly of the outer membrane requires transport of LPS across a protein bridge that spans from the cytoplasmic membrane to the cell surface. Maintaining outer membrane integrity is essential for bacterial cell viability, and its disruption can increase susceptibility to other antibiotics2–6. Thus, inhibitors of the seven lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) proteins that form this transenvelope transporter have long been sought7–9. A new class of antibiotics that targets the LPS transport machine in Acinetobacter was recently identified. Here, using structural, biochemical and genetic approaches, we show that these antibiotics trap a substrate-bound conformation of the LPS transporter that stalls this machine. The inhibitors accomplish this by recognizing a composite binding site made up of both the Lpt transporter and its LPS substrate. Collectively, our findings identify an unusual mechanism of lipid transport inhibition, reveal a druggable conformation of the Lpt transporter and provide the foundation for extending this class of antibiotics to other Gram-negative pathogens. A mechanism of lipid transport inhibition has been identified for a class of peptide antibiotics effective against resistant Acinetobacter strains, which may have applications in the inhibition of other Gram-negative pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid space around the brain has long been known to drain through the lymphatics to cervical lymph nodes1–17, but the connections and regulation have been challenging to identify. Here, using fluorescent CSF tracers in Prox1-GFP lymphatic reporter mice18, we found that the nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus is a major hub for CSF outflow to deep cervical lymph nodes. This plexus had unusual valves and short lymphangions but no smooth-muscle coverage, whereas downstream deep cervical lymphatics had typical semilunar valves, long lymphangions and smooth muscle coverage that transported CSF to the deep cervical lymph nodes. α-Adrenergic and nitric oxide signalling in the smooth muscle cells regulated CSF drainage through the transport properties of deep cervical lymphatics. During ageing, the nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus atrophied, but deep cervical lymphatics were not similarly altered, and CSF outflow could still be increased by adrenergic or nitric oxide signalling. Single-cell analysis of gene expression in lymphatic endothelial cells of the nasopharyngeal plexus of aged mice revealed increased type I interferon signalling and other inflammatory cytokines. The importance of evidence for the nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus functioning as a CSF outflow hub is highlighted by its regression during ageing. Yet, the ageing-resistant pharmacological activation of deep cervical lymphatic transport towards lymph nodes can still increase CSF outflow, offering an approach for augmenting CSF clearance in age-related neurological conditions in which greater efflux would be beneficial. The nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus is a major hub for cerebrospinal fluid outflow to deep cervical lymph nodes.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction1–4 provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, in which the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of Λ = 2.14 ± 0.02 when increasing the code distance by 2, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143% ± 0.003 per cent error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond breakeven, exceeding the lifetime of its best physical qubit by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 microseconds at distance 5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 microseconds. We also run repetition codes up to distance 29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events, occurring approximately once every hour or 3 × 109 cycles. Our results indicate device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. Two below-threshold surface code memories on superconducting processors markedly reduce logical error rates, achieving high efficiency and real-time decoding, indicating potential for practical large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Broad-spectrum RAS inhibition has the potential to benefit roughly a quarter of human patients with cancer whose tumours are driven by RAS mutations1,2. RMC-7977 is a highly selective inhibitor of the active GTP-bound forms of KRAS, HRAS and NRAS, with affinity for both mutant and wild-type variants3. More than 90% of cases of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are driven by activating mutations in KRAS4. Here we assessed the therapeutic potential of RMC-7977 in a comprehensive range of PDAC models. We observed broad and pronounced anti-tumour activity across models following direct RAS inhibition at exposures that were well-tolerated in vivo. Pharmacological analyses revealed divergent responses to RMC-7977 in tumour versus normal tissues. Treated tumours exhibited waves of apoptosis along with sustained proliferative arrest, whereas normal tissues underwent only transient decreases in proliferation, with no evidence of apoptosis. In the autochthonous KPC mouse model, RMC-7977 treatment resulted in a profound extension of survival followed by on-treatment relapse. Analysis of relapsed tumours identified Myc copy number gain as a prevalent candidate resistance mechanism, which could be overcome by combinatorial TEAD inhibition in vitro. Together, these data establish a strong preclinical rationale for the use of broad-spectrum RAS-GTP inhibition in the setting of PDAC and identify a promising candidate combination therapeutic regimen to overcome monotherapy resistance. RMC-7977, a multi-selective RAS(ON) inhibitor, exhibits potent tumour-selective activity in multiple pre-clinical models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma through a combination of pharmacology and oncogene dependence.",

    "abstract": "Bile acids (BAs) are steroid detergents in bile that contribute to the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins while shaping the gut microbiome because of their antimicrobial properties1–4. Here we identify the enzyme responsible for a mechanism of BA metabolism by the gut microbiota involving amino acid conjugation to the acyl-site of BAs, thus producing a diverse suite of microbially conjugated bile acids (MCBAs). We show that this transformation is mediated by acyltransferase activity of bile salt hydrolase (bile salt hydrolase/transferase, BSH/T). Clostridium perfringens BSH/T rapidly performed acyl transfer when provided various amino acids and taurocholate, glycocholate or cholate, with an optimum at pH 5.3. Amino acid conjugation by C. perfringens BSH/T was diverse, including all proteinaceous amino acids except proline and aspartate. MCBA production was widespread among gut bacteria, with strain-specific amino acid use. Species with similar BSH/T amino acid sequences had similar conjugation profiles and several bsh/t alleles correlated with increased conjugation diversity. Tertiary structure mapping of BSH/T followed by mutagenesis experiments showed that active site structure affects amino acid selectivity. These MCBA products had antimicrobial properties, where greater amino acid hydrophobicity showed greater antimicrobial activity. Inhibitory concentrations of MCBAs reached those measured natively in the mammalian gut. MCBAs fed to mice entered enterohepatic circulation, in which liver and gallbladder concentrations varied depending on the conjugated amino acid. Quantifying MCBAs in human faecal samples showed that they reach concentrations equal to or greater than secondary and primary BAs and were reduced after bariatric surgery, thus supporting MCBAs as a significant component of the BA pool that can be altered by changes in gastrointestinal physiology. In conclusion, the inherent acyltransferase activity of BSH/T greatly diversifies BA chemistry, creating a set of previously underappreciated metabolites with the potential to affect the microbiome and human health. Acyltransferase activity of the enzyme bile salt hydrolase is identified and shown to mediate microbial bile acid conjugation, diversifying the bile acid pool and expanding their role in gut physiology.",

    "abstract": "Rechargeable Li-metal batteries have the potential to more than double the specific energy of the state-of-the-art rechargeable Li-ion batteries, making Li-metal batteries a prime candidate for next-generation high-energy battery technology1–3. However, current Li-metal batteries suffer from fast cycle degradation compared with their Li-ion battery counterparts2,3, preventing their practical adoption. A main contributor to capacity degradation is the disconnection of Li from the electrochemical circuit, forming isolated Li4–8. Calendar ageing studies have shown that resting in the charged state promotes further reaction of active Li with the surrounding electrolyte9–12. Here we discover that calendar ageing in the discharged state improves capacity retention through isolated Li recovery, which is in contrast with the well-known phenomenon of capacity degradation observed during the charged state calendar ageing. Inactive capacity recovery is verified through observation of Coulombic efficiency greater than 100% on both Li||Cu half-cells and anode-free cells using a hybrid continuous–resting cycling protocol and with titration gas chromatography. An operando optical setup further confirms excess isolated Li reactivation as the predominant contributor to the increased capacity recovery. These insights into a previously unknown pathway for capacity recovery through discharged state resting emphasize the marked impact of cycling strategies on Li-metal battery performance. Calendar ageing of lithium metal batteries in the discharged state improves capacity retention through isolated lithium recovery, which is in contrast with the capacity degradation observed during charged state calendar ageing.",

Here we develop a disaster footprint analytical framework by integrating climate, epidemiological and hybrid input–output and computable general equilibrium global trade models to estimate the midcentury socioeconomic impacts of heat stress. We consider health costs related to heat exposure, the value of heat-induced labour productivity loss and indirect losses due to economic disruptions cascading through supply chains. Here we show that the global annual incremental gross domestic product loss increases exponentially from 0.03 ± 0.01 (SSP 245)–0.05 ± 0.03 (SSP 585) percentage points during 2030–2040 to 0.05 ± 0.01–0.15 ± 0.04 percentage points during 2050–2060. By 2060, the expected global economic losses reach a total of 0.6–4.6% with losses attributed to health loss (37–45%), labour productivity loss (18–37%) and indirect loss (12–43%) under different shared socioeconomic pathways. Small- and medium-sized developing countries suffer disproportionately from higher health loss in South-Central Africa (2.1 to 4.0 times above global average) and labour productivity loss in West Africa and Southeast Asia (2.0–3.3 times above global average). The supply-chain disruption effects are much more widespread with strong hit to those manufacturing-heavy countries such as China and the USA, leading to soaring economic losses of 2.7 ± 0.7% and 1.8 ± 0.5%, respectively. A global high-resolution disaster footprint analytical model is developed to show substantial socioeconomic impacts from climatic change-driven heat stress through the global supply chain by 2060 due to direct and indirect effects on health and labour productivity.",

    "abstract": "Human centromeres have been traditionally very difficult to sequence and assemble owing to their repetitive nature and large size1. As a result, patterns of human centromeric variation and models for their evolution and function remain incomplete, despite centromeres being among the most rapidly mutating regions2,3. Here, using long-read sequencing, we completely sequenced and assembled all centromeres from a second human genome and compared it to the finished reference genome4,5. We find that the two sets of centromeres show at least a 4.1-fold increase in single-nucleotide variation when compared with their unique flanks and vary up to 3-fold in size. Moreover, we find that 45.8% of centromeric sequence cannot be reliably aligned using standard methods owing to the emergence of new α-satellite higher-order repeats (HORs). DNA methylation and CENP-A chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that 26% of the centromeres differ in their kinetochore position by >500 kb. To understand evolutionary change, we selected six chromosomes and sequenced and assembled 31 orthologous centromeres from the common chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque genomes. Comparative analyses reveal a nearly complete turnover of α-satellite HORs, with characteristic idiosyncratic changes in α-satellite HORs for each species. Phylogenetic reconstruction of human haplotypes supports limited to no recombination between the short (p) and long (q) arms across centromeres and reveals that novel α-satellite HORs share a monophyletic origin, providing a strategy to estimate the rate of saltatory amplification and mutation of human centromeric DNA. A comparison of two complete sets of human centromeres reveals that the centromeres show at least a 4.1-fold increase in single-nucleotide variation compared with their unique flanks, and up to 3-fold variation in size, resulting from an accelerated mutation rate.",

    "abstract": "Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have produced external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of more than 25% with narrowband emission1,2, but these LEDs have limited operating lifetimes. We posit that poor long-range ordering in perovskite QD films—variations in dot size, surface ligand density and dot-to-dot stacking—inhibits carrier injection, resulting in inferior operating stability because of the large bias required to produce emission in these LEDs. Here we report a chemical treatment to improve the long-range order of perovskite QD films: the diffraction intensity from the repeating QD units increases three-fold compared with that of controls. We achieve this using a synergistic dual-ligand approach: an iodide-rich agent (aniline hydroiodide) for anion exchange and a chemically reactive agent (bromotrimethylsilane) that produces a strong acid that in situ dissolves smaller QDs to regulate size and more effectively removes less conductive ligands to enable compact, uniform and defect-free films. These films exhibit high conductivity (4 × 10−4 S m−1), which is 2.5-fold higher than that of the control, and represents the highest conductivity recorded so far among perovskite QDs. The high conductivity ensures efficient charge transportation, enabling red perovskite QD-LEDs that generate a luminance of 1,000 cd m−2 at a record-low voltage of 2.8 V. The EQE at this luminance is more than 20%. Furthermore, the stability of the operating device is 100 times better than previous red perovskite LEDs at EQEs of more than 20%. Improving the long-range order of the quantum dots in perovskite LEDs can markedly enhance their operational stability.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblasts are present throughout the body and function to maintain tissue homeostasis. Recent studies have identified diverse fibroblast subsets in healthy and injured tissues1,2, but the origins and functional roles of injury-induced fibroblast lineages remain unclear. Here we show that lung-specialized alveolar fibroblasts take on multiple molecular states with distinct roles in facilitating responses to fibrotic lung injury. We generate a genetic tool that uniquely targets alveolar fibroblasts to demonstrate their role in providing niches for alveolar stem cells in homeostasis and show that loss of this niche leads to exaggerated responses to acute lung injury. Lineage tracing identifies alveolar fibroblasts as the dominant origin for multiple emergent fibroblast subsets sequentially driven by inflammatory and pro-fibrotic signals after injury. We identify similar, but not completely identical, fibroblast lineages in human pulmonary fibrosis. TGFβ negatively regulates an inflammatory fibroblast subset that emerges early after injury and stimulates the differentiation into fibrotic fibroblasts to elicit intra-alveolar fibrosis. Blocking the induction of fibrotic fibroblasts in the alveolar fibroblast lineage abrogates fibrosis but exacerbates lung inflammation. These results demonstrate the multifaceted roles of the alveolar fibroblast lineage in maintaining normal alveolar homeostasis and orchestrating sequential responses to lung injury. In mouse and human, lung-specialized alveolar fibroblasts adopt multiple molecular states that are induced by pro-inflammatory and fibrotic signals and have diverse protective roles against lung injury.",

    "abstract": "Semiconducting graphene plays an important part in graphene nanoelectronics because of the lack of an intrinsic bandgap in graphene1. In the past two decades, attempts to modify the bandgap either by quantum confinement or by chemical functionalization failed to produce viable semiconducting graphene. Here we demonstrate that semiconducting epigraphene (SEG) on single-crystal silicon carbide substrates has a band gap of 0.6 eV and room temperature mobilities exceeding 5,000 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 10 times larger than that of silicon and 20 times larger than that of the other two-dimensional semiconductors. It is well known that when silicon evaporates from silicon carbide crystal surfaces, the carbon-rich surface crystallizes to produce graphene multilayers2. The first graphitic layer to form on the silicon-terminated face of SiC is an insulating epigraphene layer that is partially covalently bonded to the SiC surface3. Spectroscopic measurements of this buffer layer4 demonstrated semiconducting signatures4, but the mobilities of this layer were limited because of disorder5. Here we demonstrate a quasi-equilibrium annealing method that produces SEG (that is, a well-ordered buffer layer) on macroscopic atomically flat terraces. The SEG lattice is aligned with the SiC substrate. It is chemically, mechanically and thermally robust and can be patterned and seamlessly connected to semimetallic epigraphene using conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques. These essential properties make SEG suitable for nanoelectronics. Semiconducting epigraphene aligned with single-crystal silicon carbide substrates has a band gap of 0.6  eV and room temperature mobilities 20 times larger than that of other two-dimensional semiconductors, making it suitable for nanoelectronics.",

    "abstract": "Crop production is a large source of atmospheric ammonia (NH3), which poses risks to air quality, human health and ecosystems1–5. However, estimating global NH3 emissions from croplands is subject to uncertainties because of data limitations, thereby limiting the accurate identification of mitigation options and efficacy4,5. Here we develop a machine learning model for generating crop-specific and spatially explicit NH3 emission factors globally (5-arcmin resolution) based on a compiled dataset of field observations. We show that global NH3 emissions from rice, wheat and maize fields in 2018 were 4.3 ± 1.0 Tg N yr−1, lower than previous estimates that did not fully consider fertilizer management practices6–9. Furthermore, spatially optimizing fertilizer management, as guided by the machine learning model, has the potential to reduce the NH3 emissions by about 38% (1.6 ± 0.4 Tg N yr−1) without altering total fertilizer nitrogen inputs. Specifically, we estimate potential NH3 emissions reductions of 47% (44–56%) for rice, 27% (24–28%) for maize and 26% (20–28%) for wheat cultivation, respectively. Under future climate change scenarios, we estimate that NH3 emissions could increase by 4.0 ± 2.7% under SSP1–2.6 and 5.5 ± 5.7% under SSP5–8.5 by 2030–2060. However, targeted fertilizer management has the potential to mitigate these increases. A machine learning model for generating crop-specific and spatially explicit NH3 emission factors globally shows that global NH3 emissions in 2018 were lower than previous estimates that did not fully consider fertilizer management practices.",

    "abstract": "Psychosocial stress has profound effects on the body, including the immune system and the brain1,2. Although a large number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have linked peripheral immune system alterations to stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD)3, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that expression of a circulating myeloid cell-specific proteinase, matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8), is increased in the serum of humans with MDD as well as in stress-susceptible mice following chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). In mice, we show that this increase leads to alterations in extracellular space and neurophysiological changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as well as altered social behaviour. Using a combination of mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, we performed high-dimensional phenotyping of immune cells in circulation and in the brain and demonstrate that peripheral monocytes are strongly affected by stress. In stress-susceptible mice, both circulating monocytes and monocytes that traffic to the brain showed increased Mmp8 expression following chronic social defeat stress. We further demonstrate that circulating MMP8 directly infiltrates the NAc parenchyma and controls the ultrastructure of the extracellular space. Depleting MMP8 prevented stress-induced social avoidance behaviour and alterations in NAc neurophysiology and extracellular space. Collectively, these data establish a mechanism by which peripheral immune factors can affect central nervous system function and behaviour in the context of stress. Targeting specific peripheral immune cell-derived matrix metalloproteinases could constitute novel therapeutic targets for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Serum MMP8 is increased in stress-susceptible mice following chronic stress and leads to brain structure and behavioural changes in mice.",

    "abstract": "Memory encodes past experiences, thereby enabling future plans. The basolateral amygdala is a centre of salience networks that underlie emotional experiences and thus has a key role in long-term fear memory formation1. Here we used spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to illuminate the cellular and molecular architecture of the role of the basolateral amygdala in long-term memory. We identified transcriptional signatures in subpopulations of neurons and astrocytes that were memory-specific and persisted for weeks. These transcriptional signatures implicate neuropeptide and BDNF signalling, MAPK and CREB activation, ubiquitination pathways, and synaptic connectivity as key components of long-term memory. Notably, upon long-term memory formation, a neuronal subpopulation defined by increased Penk and decreased Tac expression constituted the most prominent component of the memory engram of the basolateral amygdala. These transcriptional changes were observed both with single-cell RNA sequencing and with single-molecule spatial transcriptomics in intact slices, thereby providing a rich spatial map of a memory engram. The spatial data enabled us to determine that this neuronal subpopulation interacts with adjacent astrocytes, and functional experiments show that neurons require interactions with astrocytes to encode long-term memory. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of the mouse basolateral amygdala reveal transcriptomic signatures, spatial resolution and interactions of cells that constitute the memory engram, including crucial neuron–astrocyte interactions.",

    "abstract": "The house mouse (Mus musculus) is an exceptional model system, combining genetic tractability with close evolutionary affinity to humans1,2. Mouse gestation lasts only 3 weeks, during which the genome orchestrates the astonishing transformation of a single-cell zygote into a free-living pup composed of more than 500 million cells. Here, to establish a global framework for exploring mammalian development, we applied optimized single-cell combinatorial indexing3 to profile the transcriptional states of 12.4 million nuclei from 83 embryos, precisely staged at 2- to 6-hour intervals spanning late gastrulation (embryonic day 8) to birth (postnatal day 0). From these data, we annotate hundreds of cell types and explore the ontogenesis of the posterior embryo during somitogenesis and of kidney, mesenchyme, retina and early neurons. We leverage the temporal resolution and sampling depth of these whole-embryo snapshots, together with published data4–8 from earlier timepoints, to construct a rooted tree of cell-type relationships that spans the entirety of prenatal development, from zygote to birth. Throughout this tree, we systematically nominate genes encoding transcription factors and other proteins as candidate drivers of the in vivo differentiation of hundreds of cell types. Remarkably, the most marked temporal shifts in cell states are observed within one hour of birth and presumably underlie the massive physiological adaptations that must accompany the successful transition of a mammalian fetus to life outside the womb. Single-cell transcriptome profiling of mouse embryos and newborn pups is combined with previously published data to construct a tree of cell-type relationships tracing development from zygote to birth.",

    "abstract": "Expansion of antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells is critical for the success of tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-adoptive cell therapy (ACT) in patients with cancer1. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) acts as a key regulator of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte functions by promoting expansion and cytotoxic capability2,3. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend mechanistic barriers to IL-2 sensing in the tumour microenvironment to implement strategies to reinvigorate IL-2 responsiveness and T cell antitumour responses. Here we report that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a known negative regulator of immune response in the tumour microenvironment4,5, is present at high concentrations in tumour tissue from patients and leads to impaired IL-2 sensing in human CD8+ TILs via the PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4. Mechanistically, PGE2 inhibits IL-2 sensing in TILs by downregulating the IL-2Rγc chain, resulting in defective assembly of IL-2Rβ–IL2Rγc membrane dimers. This results in impaired IL-2–mTOR adaptation and PGC1α transcriptional repression, causing oxidative stress and ferroptotic cell death in tumour-reactive TILs. Inhibition of PGE2 signalling to EP2 and EP4 during TIL expansion for ACT resulted in increased IL-2 sensing, leading to enhanced proliferation of tumour-reactive TILs and enhanced tumour control once the cells were transferred in vivo. Our study reveals fundamental features that underlie impairment of human TILs mediated by PGE2 in the tumour microenvironment. These findings have therapeutic implications for cancer immunotherapy and cell therapy, and enable the development of targeted strategies to enhance IL-2 sensing and amplify the IL-2 response in TILs, thereby promoting the expansion of effector T cells with enhanced therapeutic potential. Prostaglandin E2 from the tumour microenvironment impairs interleukin-2 sensing by tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, restricting proliferative response and promoting T cell death via metabolic impairment and ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Decades of neuroimaging studies have shown modest differences in brain structure and connectivity in depression, hindering mechanistic insights or the identification of risk factors for disease onset1. Furthermore, whereas depression is episodic, few longitudinal neuroimaging studies exist, limiting understanding of mechanisms that drive mood-state transitions. The emerging field of precision functional mapping has used densely sampled longitudinal neuroimaging data to show behaviourally meaningful differences in brain network topography and connectivity between and in healthy individuals2–4, but this approach has not been applied in depression. Here, using precision functional mapping and several samples of deeply sampled individuals, we found that the frontostriatal salience network is expanded nearly twofold in the cortex of most individuals with depression. This effect was replicable in several samples and caused primarily by network border shifts, with three distinct modes of encroachment occurring in different individuals. Salience network expansion was stable over time, unaffected by mood state and detectable in children before the onset of depression later in adolescence. Longitudinal analyses of individuals scanned up to 62 times over 1.5 years identified connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that tracked fluctuations in specific symptoms and predicted future anhedonia symptoms. Together, these findings identify a trait-like brain network topology that may confer risk for depression and mood-state-dependent connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that predict the emergence and remission of depressive symptoms over time. Precision functional mapping shows that the frontostriatal salience network occupies nearly twice as much of the cortex in people with depression, and this was unaffected by mood changes and detected in children before onset of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Integrated microwave photonics (MWP) is an intriguing technology for the generation, transmission and manipulation of microwave signals in chip-scale optical systems1,2. In particular, ultrafast processing of analogue signals in the optical domain with high fidelity and low latency could enable a variety of applications such as MWP filters3–5, microwave signal processing6–9 and image recognition10,11. An ideal integrated MWP processing platform should have both an efficient and high-speed electro-optic modulation block to faithfully perform microwave–optic conversion at low power and also a low-loss functional photonic network to implement various signal-processing tasks. Moreover, large-scale, low-cost manufacturability is required to monolithically integrate the two building blocks on the same chip. Here we demonstrate such an integrated MWP processing engine based on a 4 inch wafer-scale thin-film lithium niobate platform. It can perform multipurpose tasks with processing bandwidths of up to 67 GHz at complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible voltages. We achieve ultrafast analogue computation, namely temporal integration and differentiation, at sampling rates of up to 256 giga samples per second, and deploy these functions to showcase three proof-of-concept applications: solving ordinary differential equations, generating ultra-wideband signals and detecting edges in images. We further leverage the image edge detector to realize a photonic-assisted image segmentation model that can effectively outline the boundaries of melanoma lesion in medical diagnostic images. Our ultrafast lithium niobate MWP engine could provide compact, low-latency and cost-effective solutions for future wireless communications, high-resolution radar and photonic artificial intelligence. An integrated lithium niobate photonic processing engine performs integration and differentiation of analogue signals, solves ordinary differential equations, generates ultra-wideband microwave signals and detects edges in images.",

    "abstract": "An important advance in cancer therapy has been the development of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for the treatment of homologous recombination (HR)-deficient cancers1–6. PARP inhibitors trap PARPs on DNA. The trapped PARPs are thought to block replisome progression, leading to formation of DNA double-strand breaks that require HR for repair7. Here we show that PARP1 functions together with TIMELESS and TIPIN to protect the replisome in early S phase from transcription–replication conflicts. Furthermore, the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors with HR deficiency is due to an inability to repair DNA damage caused by transcription–replication conflicts, rather than by trapped PARPs. Along these lines, inhibiting transcription elongation in early S phase rendered HR-deficient cells resistant to PARP inhibitors and depleting PARP1 by small-interfering RNA was synthetic lethal with HR deficiency. Thus, inhibiting PARP1 enzymatic activity may suffice for treatment efficacy in HR-deficient settings. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) functions together with TIMELESS and TIPIN to protect the replisome in early S phase from transcription–replication conflicts, and inhibiting PARP1 enzymatic activity may suffice for treatment efficacy in homologous recombination-deficient settings.",

    "abstract": "Intensity, polarization and wavelength are intrinsic characteristics of light. Characterizing light with arbitrarily mixed information on polarization and spectrum is in high demand1–4. Despite the extensive efforts in the design of polarimeters5–18 and spectrometers19–27, concurrently yielding high-dimensional signatures of intensity, polarization and spectrum of the light fields is challenging and typically requires complicated integration of polarization- and/or wavelength-sensitive elements in the space or time domains. Here we demonstrate that simple thin-film interfaces with spatial and frequency dispersion can project and tailor polarization and spectrum responses in the wavevector domain. By this means, high-dimensional light information can be encoded into single-shot imaging and deciphered with the assistance of a deep residual network. To the best of our knowledge, our work not only enables full characterization of light with arbitrarily mixed full-Stokes polarization states across a broadband spectrum with a single device and a single measurement but also presents comparable, if not better, performance than state-of-the-art single-purpose miniaturized polarimeters or spectrometers. Our approach can be readily used as an alignment-free retrofit for the existing imaging platforms, opening up new paths to ultra-compact and high-dimensional photodetection and imaging. By combining spatial and frequency dispersive thin-film interfaces with deep residual learning, a miniature photodetector allowing the acquisition of high-dimensional information on light in a single-shot fashion is described.",

    "abstract": "Although the impact of host genetics on gut microbial diversity and the abundance of specific taxa is well established1–6, little is known about how host genetics regulates the genetic diversity of gut microorganisms. Here we conducted a meta-analysis of associations between human genetic variation and gut microbial structural variation in 9,015 individuals from four Dutch cohorts. Strikingly, the presence rate of a structural variation segment in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii that harbours an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) utilization gene cluster is higher in individuals who secrete the type A oligosaccharide antigen terminating in GalNAc, a feature that is jointly determined by human ABO and FUT2 genotypes, and we could replicate this association in a Tanzanian cohort. In vitro experiments demonstrated that GalNAc can be used as the sole carbohydrate source for F. prausnitzii strains that carry the GalNAc-metabolizing pathway. Further in silico and in vitro studies demonstrated that other ABO-associated species can also utilize GalNAc, particularly Collinsella aerofaciens. The GalNAc utilization genes are also associated with the host’s cardiometabolic health, particularly in individuals with mucosal A-antigen. Together, the findings of our study demonstrate that genetic associations across the human genome and bacterial metagenome can provide functional insights into the reciprocal host–microbiome relationship. A meta-analysis of associations between human genetic variation and gut microbial structural variations shows that ABO genotype differentially affects the presence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii strains containing GalNAc utilization pathway in the gut.",

As semiconductors are the critical component that governs device performance, the selection, control and engineering of semiconductors inside fibres are the key pathways to enabling high-performance functional fibres. However, owing to stress development and capillary instability in the high-yield fibre thermal drawing, both cracks and deformations in the semiconductor cores considerably affect the performance of these fibres. Here we report a mechanical design to achieve ultralong, fracture-free and perturbation-free semiconductor fibres, guided by a study on stress development and capillary instability at three stages of the fibre formation: the viscous flow, the core crystallization and the subsequent cooling stage. Then, the exposed semiconductor wires can be integrated into a single flexible fibre with well-defined interfaces with metal electrodes, thereby achieving optoelectronic fibres and large-scale optoelectronic fabrics. This work provides fundamental insights into extreme mechanics and fluid dynamics with geometries that are inaccessible in traditional platforms, essentially addressing the increasing demand for flexible and wearable optoelectronics. A mechanical design is developed for the fabrication of ultralong, fracture-free and perturbation-free semiconductor fibres to address the increasing demand for flexible and wearable optoelectronics.",

    "abstract": "Numerous modern technologies are reliant on the low-phase noise and exquisite timing stability of microwave signals. Substantial progress has been made in the field of microwave photonics, whereby low-noise microwave signals are generated by the down-conversion of ultrastable optical references using a frequency comb1–3. Such systems, however, are constructed with bulk or fibre optics and are difficult to further reduce in size and power consumption. In this work we address this challenge by leveraging advances in integrated photonics to demonstrate low-noise microwave generation via two-point optical frequency division4,5. Narrow-linewidth self-injection-locked integrated lasers6,7 are stabilized to a miniature Fabry–Pérot cavity8, and the frequency gap between the lasers is divided with an efficient dark soliton frequency comb9. The stabilized output of the microcomb is photodetected to produce a microwave signal at 20 GHz with phase noise of −96 dBc Hz−1 at 100 Hz offset frequency that decreases to −135 dBc Hz−1 at 10 kHz offset—values that are unprecedented for an integrated photonic system. All photonic components can be heterogeneously integrated on a single chip, providing a significant advance for the application of photonics to high-precision navigation, communication and timing systems. We leverage advances in integrated photonics to generate low-noise microwaves with an optical frequency division architecture that can be low power and chip integrated.",

    "abstract": "The heart, which is the first organ to develop, is highly dependent on its form to function1,2. However, how diverse cardiac cell types spatially coordinate to create the complex morphological structures that are crucial for heart function remains unclear. Here we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing with high-resolution multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization to resolve the identity of the cardiac cell types that develop the human heart. This approach also provided a spatial mapping of individual cells that enables illumination of their organization into cellular communities that form distinct cardiac structures. We discovered that many of these cardiac cell types further specified into subpopulations exclusive to specific communities, which support their specialization according to the cellular ecosystem and anatomical region. In particular, ventricular cardiomyocyte subpopulations displayed an unexpected complex laminar organization across the ventricular wall and formed, with other cell subpopulations, several cellular communities. Interrogating cell–cell interactions within these communities using in vivo conditional genetic mouse models and in vitro human pluripotent stem cell systems revealed multicellular signalling pathways that orchestrate the spatial organization of cardiac cell subpopulations during ventricular wall morphogenesis. These detailed findings into the cellular social interactions and specialization of cardiac cell types constructing and remodelling the human heart offer new insights into structural heart diseases and the engineering of complex multicellular tissues for human heart repair. Combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with high-resolution multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization reveals in detail the cellular interactions and specialization of cardiac cell types that form and remodel the human heart.",

    "abstract": "A major limitation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies is the poor persistence of these cells in vivo1. The expression of memory-associated genes in CAR T cells is linked to their long-term persistence in patients and clinical efficacy2–6, suggesting that memory programs may underpin durable CAR T cell function. Here we show that the transcription factor FOXO1 is responsible for promoting memory and restraining exhaustion in human CAR T cells. Pharmacological inhibition or gene editing of endogenous FOXO1 diminished the expression of memory-associated genes, promoted an exhaustion-like phenotype and impaired the antitumour activity of CAR T cells. Overexpression of FOXO1 induced a gene-expression program consistent with T cell memory and increased chromatin accessibility at FOXO1-binding motifs. CAR T cells that overexpressed FOXO1 retained their function, memory potential and metabolic fitness in settings of chronic stimulation, and exhibited enhanced persistence and tumour control in vivo. By contrast, overexpression of TCF1 (encoded by TCF7) did not enforce canonical memory programs or enhance the potency of CAR T cells. Notably, FOXO1 activity correlated with positive clinical outcomes of patients treated with CAR T cells or tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, underscoring the clinical relevance of FOXO1 in cancer immunotherapy. Our results show that overexpressing FOXO1 can increase the antitumour activity of human CAR T cells, and highlight memory reprogramming as a broadly applicable approach for optimizing therapeutic T cell states. The transcription factor FOXO1 has a key role in human T cell memory, and manipulating FOXO1 expression could provide a way to enhance CAR T cell therapies by increasing CAR T cell persistence and antitumour activity.",

    "abstract": "Supersolid, an exotic quantum state of matter that consists of particles forming an incompressible solid structure while simultaneously showing superfluidity of zero viscosity1, is one of the long-standing pursuits in fundamental research2,3. Although the initial report of 4He supersolid turned out to be an artefact4, this intriguing quantum matter has inspired enthusiastic investigations into ultracold quantum gases5–8. Nevertheless, the realization of supersolidity in condensed matter remains elusive. Here we find evidence for a quantum magnetic analogue of supersolid—the spin supersolid—in the recently synthesized triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na2BaCo(PO4)2 (ref. 9). Notably, a giant magnetocaloric effect related to the spin supersolidity is observed in the demagnetization cooling process, manifesting itself as two prominent valley-like regimes, with the lowest temperature attaining below 100 mK. Not only is there an experimentally determined series of critical fields but the demagnetization cooling profile also shows excellent agreement with the theoretical simulations with an easy-axis Heisenberg model. Neutron diffractions also successfully locate the proposed spin supersolid phases by revealing the coexistence of three-sublattice spin solid order and interlayer incommensurability indicative of the spin superfluidity. Thus, our results reveal a strong entropic effect of the spin supersolid phase in a frustrated quantum magnet and open up a viable and promising avenue for applications in sub-kelvin refrigeration, especially in the context of persistent concerns about helium shortages10,11. Evidence for a quantum magnetic analogue of a supersolid appears in a recently synthesized antiferromagnet showing a strong magnetocaloric effect of the spin supersolid phase with potential for applications in sub-kelvin refrigeration.",

    "abstract": "Spermatozoa harbour a complex and environment-sensitive pool of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs)1, which influences offspring development and adult phenotypes1–7. Whether spermatozoa in the epididymis are directly susceptible to environmental cues is not fully understood8. Here we used two distinct paradigms of preconception acute high-fat diet to dissect epididymal versus testicular contributions to the sperm sncRNA pool and offspring health. We show that epididymal spermatozoa, but not developing germ cells, are sensitive to the environment and identify mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) and their fragments (mt-tsRNAs) as sperm-borne factors. In humans, mt-tsRNAs in spermatozoa correlate with body mass index, and paternal overweight at conception doubles offspring obesity risk and compromises metabolic health. Sperm sncRNA sequencing of mice mutant for genes involved in mitochondrial function, and metabolic phenotyping of their wild-type offspring, suggest that the upregulation of mt-tsRNAs is downstream of mitochondrial dysfunction. Single-embryo transcriptomics of genetically hybrid two-cell embryos demonstrated sperm-to-oocyte transfer of mt-tRNAs at fertilization and suggested their involvement in the control of early-embryo transcription. Our study supports the importance of paternal health at conception for offspring metabolism, shows that mt-tRNAs are diet-induced and sperm-borne and demonstrates, in a physiological setting, father-to-offspring transfer of sperm mitochondrial RNAs at fertilization. A study shows that epididymal spermatozoa are sensitive to preconception diet, identifies mitochondrial tRNAs and their fragments as sperm-borne factors and demonstrates epigenetic inheritance of mitochondrial tRNAs.",

    "abstract": "The identification of sources driving cosmic reionization, a major phase transition from neutral hydrogen to ionized plasma around 600–800 Myr after the Big Bang1–3, has been a matter of debate4. Some models suggest that high ionizing emissivity and escape fractions (fesc) from quasars support their role in driving cosmic reionization5,6. Others propose that the high fesc values from bright galaxies generate sufficient ionizing radiation to drive this process7. Finally, a few studies suggest that the number density of faint galaxies, when combined with a stellar-mass-dependent model of ionizing efficiency and fesc, can effectively dominate cosmic reionization8,9. However, so far, comprehensive spectroscopic studies of low-mass galaxies have not been done because of their extreme faintness. Here we report an analysis of eight ultra-faint galaxies (in a very small field) during the epoch of reionization with absolute magnitudes between MUV ≈ −17 mag and −15 mag (down to 0.005L⋆ (refs. 10,11)). We find that faint galaxies during the first thousand million years of the Universe produce ionizing photons with log[ξion (Hz erg−1)] = 25.80 ± 0.14, a factor of 4 higher than commonly assumed values12. If this field is representative of the large-scale distribution of faint galaxies, the rate of ionizing photons exceeds that needed for reionization, even for escape fractions of the order of 5%. An analysis of eight ultra-faint galaxies during the epoch of reionization with absolute magnitudes between −17 mag and −15  mag shows that most of the photons that reionized the Universe come from dwarf galaxies.",

However, minimizing the voltage loss when their bandgap is increased to above 1.90 eV for triple-junction tandem use is challenging3–5. Here we present a previously unknown pseudohalide, cyanate (OCN−), with a comparable effective ionic radius (1.97 Å) to bromide (1.95 Å) as a bromide substitute. Electron microscopy and X-ray scattering confirm OCN incorporation into the perovskite lattice. This contributes to notable lattice distortion, ranging from 90.5° to 96.6°, a uniform iodide–bromide distribution and consistent microstrain. Owing to these effects, OCN-based perovskite exhibits enhanced defect formation energy and substantially decreased non-radiative recombination. We achieved an inverted perovskite (1.93 eV) single-junction device with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.422 V, a VOC × FF (fill factor) product exceeding 80% of the Shockley–Queisser limit and stable performance under maximum power point tracking, culminating in a 27.62% efficiency (27.10% certified efficiency) perovskite–perovskite–silicon triple-junction solar cell with 1 cm2 aperture area.

    "abstract": "As airborne methane surveys of oil and gas systems continue to discover large emissions that are missing from official estimates1–4, the true scope of methane emissions from energy production has yet to be quantified. We integrate approximately one million aerial site measurements into regional emissions inventories for six regions in the USA, comprising 52% of onshore oil and 29% of gas production over 15 aerial campaigns. We construct complete emissions distributions for each, employing empirically grounded simulations to estimate small emissions. Total estimated emissions range from 0.75% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65%, 0.84%) of covered natural gas production in a high-productivity, gas-rich region to 9.63% (95% CI 9.04%, 10.39%) in a rapidly expanding, oil-focused region. The six-region weighted average is 2.95% (95% CI 2.79%, 3.14%), or roughly three times the national government inventory estimate5. Only 0.05–1.66% of well sites contribute the majority (50–79%) of well site emissions in 11 out of 15 surveys. Ancillary midstream facilities, including pipelines, contribute 18–57% of estimated regional emissions, similarly concentrated in a small number of point sources. Together, the emissions quantified here represent an annual loss of roughly US$1 billion in commercial gas value and a US$9.3 billion annual social cost6. Repeated, comprehensive, regional remote-sensing surveys offer a path to detect these low-frequency, high-consequence emissions for rapid mitigation, incorporation into official emissions inventories and a clear-eyed assessment of the most effective emission-finding technologies for a given region. We integrate approximately one million aerial site measurements into regional emissions inventories for six regions in the USA, finding methane emission intensities that vary by more than a factor of ten.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria serve a crucial role in cell growth and proliferation by supporting both ATP synthesis and the production of macromolecular precursors. Whereas oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depends mainly on the oxidation of intermediates from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the mitochondrial production of proline and ornithine relies on reductive synthesis1. How these competing metabolic pathways take place in the same organelle is not clear. Here we show that when cellular dependence on OXPHOS increases, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS)—the rate-limiting enzyme in the reductive synthesis of proline and ornithine—becomes sequestered in a subset of mitochondria that lack cristae and ATP synthase. This sequestration is driven by both the intrinsic ability of P5CS to form filaments and the mitochondrial fusion and fission cycle. Disruption of mitochondrial dynamics, by impeding mitofusin-mediated fusion or dynamin-like-protein-1-mediated fission, impairs the separation of P5CS-containing mitochondria from mitochondria that are enriched in cristae and ATP synthase. Failure to segregate these metabolic pathways through mitochondrial fusion and fission results in cells either sacrificing the capacity for OXPHOS while sustaining the reductive synthesis of proline, or foregoing proline synthesis while preserving adaptive OXPHOS. These findings provide evidence of the key role of mitochondrial fission and fusion in maintaining both oxidative and reductive biosyntheses in response to changing nutrient availability and bioenergetic demand. Mitochondria are able to maintain two competing metabolic pathways—oxidative phosphorylation and the reductive synthesis of proline and ornithine—by generating two mitochondrial subpopulations that are enriched in either pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase or ATP synthase.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease that is most prevalent in Northern Europe. Although it is known that inherited risk for MS is located within or in close proximity to immune-related genes, it is unknown when, where and how this genetic risk originated1. Here, by using a large ancient genome dataset from the Mesolithic period to the Bronze Age2, along with new Medieval and post-Medieval genomes, we show that the genetic risk for MS rose among pastoralists from the Pontic steppe and was brought into Europe by the Yamnaya-related migration approximately 5,000 years ago. We further show that these MS-associated immunogenetic variants underwent positive selection both within the steppe population and later in Europe, probably driven by pathogenic challenges coinciding with changes in diet, lifestyle and population density. This study highlights the critical importance of the Neolithic period and Bronze Age as determinants of modern immune responses and their subsequent effect on the risk of developing MS in a changing environment. Analysis of a large ancient genome dataset shows that genetic risk for multiple sclerosis rose in steppe pastoralists, providing insight into how genetic ancestry from the Neolithic and Bronze Age has shaped modern immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous catalysts are widely used to promote chemical reactions. Although it is known that chemical reactions usually happen on catalyst surfaces, only specific surface sites have high catalytic activity. Thus, identifying active sites and maximizing their presence lies at the heart of catalysis research1–4, in which the classic model is to categorize active sites in terms of distinct surface motifs, such as terraces and steps1,5–10. However, such a simple categorization often leads to orders of magnitude errors in catalyst activity predictions and qualitative uncertainties of active sites7,8,11,12, thus limiting opportunities for catalyst design. Here, using stepped Pt(111) surfaces and the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as examples, we demonstrate that the root cause of larger errors and uncertainties is a simplified categorization that overlooks atomic site-specific reactivity driven by surface stress release. Specifically, surface stress release at steps introduces inhomogeneous strain fields, with up to 5.5% compression, leading to distinct electronic structures and reactivity for terrace atoms with identical local coordination, and resulting in atomic site-specific enhancement of ORR activity. For the terrace atoms flanking both sides of the step edge, the enhancement is up to 50 times higher than that of the atoms in the middle of the terrace, which permits control of ORR reactivity by either varying terrace widths or controlling external stress. Thus, the discovery of the above synergy provides a new perspective for both fundamental understanding of catalytically active atomic sites and design principles of heterogeneous catalysts. Stress release at stepped platinum surfaces is shown to influence the strain experienced by atoms near the steps, resulting in effects on the catalytic activity of the whole surface.",

    "abstract": "Ischaemic diseases such as critical limb ischaemia and myocardial infarction affect millions of people worldwide1. Transplanting endothelial cells (ECs) is a promising therapy in vascular medicine, but engrafting ECs typically necessitates co-transplanting perivascular supporting cells such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which makes clinical implementation complicated2,3. The mechanisms that enable MSCs to facilitate EC engraftment remain elusive. Here we show that, under cellular stress, MSCs transfer mitochondria to ECs through tunnelling nanotubes, and that blocking this transfer impairs EC engraftment. We devised a strategy to artificially transplant mitochondria, transiently enhancing EC bioenergetics and enabling them to form functional vessels in ischaemic tissues without the support of MSCs. Notably, exogenous mitochondria did not integrate into the endogenous EC mitochondrial pool, but triggered mitophagy after internalization. Transplanted mitochondria co-localized with autophagosomes, and ablation of the PINK1–Parkin pathway negated the enhanced engraftment ability of ECs. Our findings reveal a mechanism that underlies the effects of mitochondrial transfer between mesenchymal and endothelial cells, and offer potential for a new approach for vascular cell therapy. Under stressful conditions, mesenchymal stromal cells transfer mitochondria to endothelial cells through tunnelling nanotubes, and artificially transplanting mitochondria into endothelial cells improves the ability of these cells to engraft and to revascularize ischaemic tissues.",

    "abstract": "Targeted radionuclide therapy, in which radiopharmaceuticals deliver potent radionuclides to tumours for localized irradiation, has addressed unmet clinical needs and improved outcomes for patients with cancer1–4. A therapeutic radiopharmaceutical must achieve both sustainable tumour targeting and fast clearance from healthy tissue, which remains a major challenge5,6. A targeted ligation strategy that selectively fixes the radiopharmaceutical to the target protein in the tumour would be an ideal solution. Here we installed a sulfur (VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry-based linker on radiopharmaceuticals to prevent excessively fast tumour clearance. When the engineered radiopharmaceutical binds to the tumour-specific protein, the system undergoes a binding-to-ligation transition and readily conjugates to the tyrosine residues through the ‘click’ SuFEx reaction. The application of this strategy to a fibroblast activation protein (FAP) inhibitor (FAPI) triggered more than 80% covalent binding to the protein and almost no dissociation for six days. In mice, SuFEx-engineered FAPI showed 257% greater tumour uptake than did the original FAPI, and increased tumour retention by 13-fold. The uptake in healthy tissues was rapidly cleared. In a pilot imaging study, this strategy identified more tumour lesions in patients with cancer than did other methods. SuFEx-engineered FAPI also successfully achieved targeted β- and α-radionuclide therapy, causing nearly complete tumour regression in mice. Another SuFEx-engineered radioligand that targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) also showed enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Considering the broad scope of proteins that can potentially be ligated to SuFEx warheads, it might be possible to adapt this strategy to other cancer targets. Radiopharmaceuticals engineered with click chemistry to selectively bind to tumour-specific proteins can be used to successfully target tumour cells, boosting the pharmacokinetics of radionuclide therapy and improving tumour regression.",

However, the development of a durable material with high capacity, fast kinetics and low regeneration temperature for CO2 capture, especially from the intricate and dynamic atmosphere, is still lacking. Here a porous, crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) with olefin linkages has been synthesized, structurally characterized and post-synthetically modified by the covalent attachment of amine initiators for producing polyamines within the pores. This COF (termed COF-999) can capture CO2 from open air. COF-999 has a capacity of 0.96 mmol g–1 under dry conditions and 2.05 mmol g–1 under 50% relative humidity, both from 400 ppm CO2. This COF was tested for more than 100 adsorption–desorption cycles in the open air of Berkeley, California, and found to fully retain its performance. COF-999 is an exceptional material for the capture of CO2 from open air as evidenced by its cycling stability, facile uptake of CO2 (reaches half capacity in 18.8 min) and low regeneration temperature (60 °C). A polyamine-functionalized covalent organic framework, COF-999, can be used as a material for direct air capture of CO2 from open air.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus is highly organized, such that factors involved in the transcription and processing of distinct classes of RNA are confined within specific nuclear bodies1,2. One example is the nuclear speckle, which is defined by high concentrations of protein and noncoding RNA regulators of pre-mRNA splicing3. What functional role, if any, speckles might play in the process of mRNA splicing is unclear4,5. Here we show that genes localized near nuclear speckles display higher spliceosome concentrations, increased spliceosome binding to their pre-mRNAs and higher co-transcriptional splicing levels than genes that are located farther from nuclear speckles. Gene organization around nuclear speckles is dynamic between cell types, and changes in speckle proximity lead to differences in splicing efficiency. Finally, directed recruitment of a pre-mRNA to nuclear speckles is sufficient to increase mRNA splicing levels. Together, our results integrate the long-standing observations of nuclear speckles with the biochemistry of mRNA splicing and demonstrate a crucial role for dynamic three-dimensional spatial organization of genomic DNA in driving spliceosome concentrations and controlling the efficiency of mRNA splicing. Nuclear speckles are shown to have a functional role in mRNA splicing, whereby dynamic three-dimensional organization of DNA around these structures mediates splicing efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The large-scale conversion of N2 and H2 into NH3 (refs. 1,2) over Fe and Ru catalysts3 for fertilizer production occurs through the Haber–Bosch process, which has been considered the most important scientific invention of the twentieth century4. The active component of the catalyst enabling the conversion was variously considered to be the oxide5, nitride2, metallic phase or surface nitride6, and the rate-limiting step has been associated with N2 dissociation7–9, reaction of the adsorbed nitrogen10 and also NH3 desorption11. This range of views reflects that the Haber–Bosch process operates at high temperatures and pressures, whereas surface-sensitive techniques that might differentiate between different mechanistic proposals require vacuum conditions. Mechanistic studies have accordingly long been limited to theoretical calculations12. Here we use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy—capable of revealing the chemical state of catalytic surfaces and recently adapted to operando investigations13 of methanol14 and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis15—to determine the surface composition of Fe and Ru catalysts during NH3 production at pressures up to 1 bar and temperatures as high as 723 K. We find that, although flat and stepped Fe surfaces and Ru single-crystal surfaces all remain metallic, the latter are almost adsorbate free, whereas Fe catalysts retain a small amount of adsorbed N and develop at lower temperatures high amine (NHx) coverages on the stepped surfaces. These observations indicate that the rate-limiting step on Ru is always N2 dissociation. On Fe catalysts, by contrast and as predicted by theory16, hydrogenation of adsorbed N atoms is less efficient to the extent that the rate-limiting step switches following temperature lowering from N2 dissociation to the hydrogenation of surface species. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the surface composition of iron and ruthenium catalysts during ammonia synthesis at pressures up to 1 bar and temperatures as high as 723 K can be revealed.",

    "abstract": "Most of the state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials are inorganic semiconductors. Owing to the directional covalent bonding, they usually show limited plasticity at room temperature1,2, for example, with a tensile strain of less than five per cent. Here we discover that single-crystalline Mg3Bi2 shows a room-temperature tensile strain of up to 100 per cent when the tension is applied along the (0001) plane (that is, the ab plane). Such a value is at least one order of magnitude higher than that of traditional thermoelectric materials and outperforms many metals that crystallize in a similar structure. Experimentally, slip bands and dislocations are identified in the deformed Mg3Bi2, indicating the gliding of dislocations as the microscopic mechanism of plastic deformation. Analysis of chemical bonding reveals multiple planes with low slipping barrier energy, suggesting the existence of several slip systems in Mg3Bi2. In addition, continuous dynamic bonding during the slipping process prevents the cleavage of the atomic plane, thus sustaining a large plastic deformation. Importantly, the tellurium-doped single-crystalline Mg3Bi2 shows a power factor of about 55 microwatts per centimetre per kelvin squared and a figure of merit of about 0.65 at room temperature along the ab plane, which outperforms the existing ductile thermoelectric materials3,4. The thermoelectric material Mg3Bi2 is shown to be ductile in single-crystal form along certain directions, with a room-temperature tensile strain of 100%, which is attributed to the gliding of dislocations.",

    "abstract": "Working from home has become standard for employees with a university degree. The most common scheme, which has been adopted by around 100 million employees in Europe and North America, is a hybrid schedule, in which individuals spend a mix of days at home and at work each week1,2. However, the effects of hybrid working on employees and firms have been debated, and some executives argue that it damages productivity, innovation and career development3–5. Here we ran a six-month randomized control trial investigating the effects of hybrid working from home on 1,612 employees in a Chinese technology company in 2021–2022. We found that hybrid working improved job satisfaction and reduced quit rates by one-third. The reduction in quit rates was significant for non-managers, female employees and those with long commutes. Null equivalence tests showed that hybrid working did not affect performance grades over the next two years of reviews. We found no evidence for a difference in promotions over the next two years overall, or for any major employee subgroup. Finally, null equivalence tests showed that hybrid working had no effect on the lines of code written by computer-engineer employees. We also found that the 395 managers in the experiment revised their surveyed views about the effect of hybrid working on productivity, from a perceived negative effect (−2.6% on average) before the experiment to a perceived positive one (+1.0%) after the experiment. These results indicate that a hybrid schedule with two days a week working from home does not damage performance. A trial investigating the effects of a hybrid working schedule in a Chinese technology firm in 2021–2022 shows that working from home two days a week improved job satisfaction, reduced quitting and did not affect performance.",

    "abstract": "Electrified solid–liquid interfaces (ESLIs) play a key role in various electrochemical processes relevant to energy1–5, biology6 and geochemistry7. The electron and mass transport at the electrified interfaces may result in structural modifications that markedly influence the reaction pathways. For example, electrocatalyst surface restructuring during reactions can substantially affect the catalysis mechanisms and reaction products1–3. Despite its importance, direct probing the atomic dynamics of solid–liquid interfaces under electric biasing is challenging owing to the nature of being buried in liquid electrolytes and the limited spatial resolution of current techniques for in situ imaging through liquids. Here, with our development of advanced polymer electrochemical liquid cells for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we are able to directly monitor the atomic dynamics of ESLIs during copper (Cu)-catalysed CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2ERs). Our observation reveals a fluctuating liquid-like amorphous interphase. It undergoes reversible crystalline–amorphous structural transformations and flows along the electrified Cu surface, thus mediating the crystalline Cu surface restructuring and mass loss through the interphase layer. The combination of real-time observation and theoretical calculations unveils an amorphization-mediated restructuring mechanism resulting from charge-activated surface reactions with the electrolyte. Our results open many opportunities to explore the atomic dynamics and its impact in broad systems involving ESLIs by taking advantage of the in situ imaging capability. The development of advanced polymer electrochemical liquid cells for transmission electron microscopy allows direct monitoring of the atomic dynamics of electrified solid–liquid interfaces during copper-catalysed CO2 electroreduction reactions.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing has emerged as an attractive manufacturing technique because of its exceptional freedom in accessing geometrically complex customizable products. Its potential for mass manufacturing, however, is hampered by its low manufacturing efficiency (print speed) and insufficient product quality (mechanical properties). Recent progresses in ultra-fast 3D printing of photo-polymers1–5 have alleviated the issue of manufacturing efficiency, but the mechanical performance of typical printed polymers still falls far behind what is achievable with conventional processing techniques. This is because of the printing requirements that restrict the molecular design towards achieving high mechanical performance. Here we report a 3D photo-printable resin chemistry that yields an elastomer with tensile strength of 94.6 MPa and toughness of 310.4 MJ m−3, both of which far exceed that of any 3D printed elastomer6–10. Mechanistically, this is achieved by the dynamic covalent bonds in the printed polymer that allow network topological reconfiguration. This facilitates the formation of hierarchical hydrogen bonds (in particular, amide hydrogen bonds), micro-phase separation and interpenetration architecture, which contribute synergistically to superior mechanical performance. Our work suggests a brighter future for mass manufacturing using 3D printing. Three-dimensional photo-printable resin chemistry yields an elastomer with tensile strength of 94.6  MPa and toughness of 310.4  MJ  m−3, both of which far exceed that of any three-dimensional printed elastomer.",

Rapid dissemination to more than 380 farms in 14 states followed2. Here we provide results of two independent clade 2.3.4.4b experimental infection studies evaluating the oronasal susceptibility to and transmission of a US H5N1 bovine isolate, genotype B3.13 (H5N1 B3.13), in calves, and the susceptibility of lactating cows following direct mammary gland inoculation of either H5N1 B3.13 or a current EU H5N1 wild bird isolate, genotype euDG (H5N1 euDG). Inoculation of the calves resulted in moderate nasal replication and shedding with no severe clinical signs or transmission to sentinel calves. In dairy cows, infection resulted in no nasal shedding, but severe acute infection of the mammary gland with necrotizing mastitis and high fever was observed for both H5N1 isolates. Milk production was rapidly and markedly reduced and the physical condition of the cows was severely compromised. Virus titres in milk rapidly peaked at 109 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per ml, but systemic infection did not ensue. Notably, the adaptive mutation E627K emerged in the viral polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) after intramammary replication of H5N1 euDG. Our data suggest that in addition to H5N1 B3.13, other HPAIV H5N1 strains have the potential to replicate in the udder of cows and that milk and milking procedures, rather than respiratory spread, are likely to be the primary routes of H5N1 transmission between cattle. Infection studies on highly pathogenic avian influenza virus clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 on calves and lactating cows indicate that transmission occurs primarily via milk and milking procedures rather than respiratory routes.",

    "abstract": "Documenting the rate, magnitude and causes of snow loss is essential to benchmark the pace of climate change and to manage the differential water security risks of snowpack declines1–4. So far, however, observational uncertainties in snow mass5,6 have made the detection and attribution of human-forced snow losses elusive, undermining societal preparedness. Here we show that human-caused warming has caused declines in Northern Hemisphere-scale March snowpack over the 1981–2020 period. Using an ensemble of snowpack reconstructions, we identify robust snow trends in 82 out of 169 major Northern Hemisphere river basins, 31 of which we can confidently attribute to human influence. Most crucially, we show a generalizable and highly nonlinear temperature sensitivity of snowpack, in which snow becomes marginally more sensitive to one degree Celsius of warming as climatological winter temperatures exceed minus eight degrees Celsius. Such nonlinearity explains the lack of widespread snow loss so far and augurs much sharper declines and water security risks in the most populous basins. Together, our results emphasize that human-forced snow losses and their water consequences are attributable—even absent their clear detection in individual snow products—and will accelerate and homogenize with near-term warming, posing risks to water resources in the absence of substantial climate mitigation. Snowpack reconstructions for major river basins in the Northern Hemisphere reveal that the snowpack has declined in almost half of the basins, with roughly one-third of the declines attributable to human-induced warming.",

    "abstract": "Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP)1, which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations2,3. However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk. Overall, MLWP has remained less accurate and reliable than state-of-the-art NWP ensemble forecasts. Here we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, ENS, the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts4. GenCast is an ML weather prediction method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-h steps and 0.25° latitude–longitude resolution, for more than 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 min. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.2% of 1,320 targets we evaluated and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclone tracks and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, in which crucial weather-dependent decisions are made more accurately and efficiently. GenCast, a probabilistic weather model using artificial intelligence for weather forecasting, has greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world and provides probabilistic, rather than deterministic, forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Early JWST observations have uncovered a population of red sources that might represent a previously overlooked phase of supermassive black hole growth1–3. One of the most intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object that was found to be triply imaged by the strong lensing cluster Abell 2744 (ref. 4). Here we present deep JWST/NIRSpec observations of this object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three images are of the same object, and that it is a highly reddened (AV ≃ 3) broad emission line active galactic nucleus at a redshift of zspec = 7.0451 ± 0.0005. From the width of Hβ (full width at half-maximum = 2,800 ± 250 km s−1), we derive a black hole mass of \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${M}_{{\\rm{BH}}}={4}_{-1}^{+2}\\times 1{0}^{7}\\,{M}_{\\odot }$$\n                \n              . We infer a very high ratio of black-hole-to-galaxy mass of at least 3%, an order of magnitude more than that seen in local galaxies5 and possibly as high as 100%. The lack of strong metal lines in the spectrum together with the high bolometric luminosity (Lbol = (1.1 ± 0.3) × 1045 erg s−1) indicate that we are seeing the black hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting at 30% of the Eddington limit. The rapid growth and high black-hole-to-galaxy mass ratio of Abell2744-QSO1 suggest that it may represent the missing link between black hole seeds6 and one of the first luminous quasars7. JWST/NIRSpec observations of Abell2744-QSO1 show a high black-hole-to-host mass ratio in the early Universe, which indicates that we are seeing the black hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting at 30% of the Eddington limit.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota operates at the interface of host–environment interactions to influence human homoeostasis and metabolic networks1–4. Environmental factors that unbalance gut microbial ecosystems can therefore shape physiological and disease-associated responses across somatic tissues5–9. However, the systemic impact of the gut microbiome on the germline—and consequently on the F1 offspring it gives rise to—is unexplored10. Here we show that the gut microbiota act as a key interface between paternal preconception environment and intergenerational health in mice. Perturbations to the gut microbiota of prospective fathers increase the probability of their offspring presenting with low birth weight, severe growth restriction and premature mortality. Transmission of disease risk occurs via the germline and is provoked by pervasive gut microbiome perturbations, including non-absorbable antibiotics or osmotic laxatives, but is rescued by restoring the paternal microbiota before conception. This effect is linked with a dynamic response to induced dysbiosis in the male reproductive system, including impaired leptin signalling, altered testicular metabolite profiles and remapped small RNA payloads in sperm. As a result, dysbiotic fathers trigger an elevated risk of in utero placental insufficiency, revealing a placental origin of mammalian intergenerational effects. Our study defines a regulatory ‘gut–germline axis’ in males, which is sensitive to environmental exposures and programmes offspring fitness through impacting placenta function. Disturbances in the gut microbiota of male mice manifest as fitness defects in their offspring by affecting plancenta function, revealing a paternal gut–germline axis.",

    "abstract": "The first observations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revolutionized our understanding of the Universe by identifying galaxies at redshift z ≈ 13 (refs. 1–3). In addition, the discovery of many luminous galaxies at Cosmic Dawn (z > 10) has suggested that galaxies developed rapidly, in apparent tension with many standard models4–8. However, most of these galaxies lack spectroscopic confirmation, so their distances and properties are uncertain. Here we present JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey–Near-Infrared Spectrograph spectroscopic confirmation of two luminous galaxies at \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$z={14.32}_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$$\n                \n               and z = 13.90 ± 0.17. The spectra reveal ultraviolet continua with prominent Lyman-α breaks but no detected emission lines. This discovery proves that luminous galaxies were already in place 300 million years after the Big Bang and are more common than what was expected before JWST. The most distant of the two galaxies is unexpectedly luminous and is spatially resolved with a radius of 260 parsecs. Considering also the very steep ultraviolet slope of the second galaxy, we conclude that both are dominated by stellar continuum emission, showing that the excess of luminous galaxies in the early Universe cannot be entirely explained by accretion onto black holes. Galaxy formation models will need to address the existence of such large and luminous galaxies so early in cosmic history. JWST–NIRSpec spectroscopic confirmation of two luminous galaxies is presented, proving that luminous galaxies were already in place 300 million years after the Big Bang and are more common than what was expected before JWST.",

    "abstract": "Optical atomic clocks1,2 use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low-energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have, therefore, been proposed for construction of a nuclear clock3,4. However, quantum-state-resolved spectroscopy of the 229mTh isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow 229Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF2 host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA 87Sr clock2 and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its seventh harmonic in the VUV range by using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the 229Th nuclear clock transition and the 87Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clocks and demonstrate the first comparison, to our knowledge, of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong-field physics, nuclear physics and fundamental physics. A vacuum ultraviolet frequency comb is used to directly excite the narrow 229Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF2 host material, marking the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clocks.",

    "abstract": "Electro-optical photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on lithium niobate (LiNbO3) have demonstrated the vast capabilities of materials with a high Pockels coefficient1,2. They enable linear and high-speed modulators operating at complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor voltage levels3 to be used in applications including data-centre communications4, high-performance computing and photonic accelerators for AI5. However, industrial use of this technology is hindered by the high cost per wafer and the limited wafer size. The high cost results from the lack of existing high-volume applications in other domains of the sort that accelerated the adoption of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonics, which was driven by vast investment in microelectronics. Here we report low-loss PICs made of lithium tantalate (LiTaO3), a material that has already been adopted commercially for 5G radiofrequency filters6 and therefore enables scalable manufacturing at low cost, and it has equal, and in some cases superior, properties to LiNbO3. We show that LiTaO3 can be etched to create low-loss (5.6 dB m−1) PICs using a deep ultraviolet (DUV) stepper-based manufacturing process7. We demonstrate a LiTaO3 Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM) with a half-wave voltage–length product of 1.9 V cm and an electro-optic bandwidth of up to 40 GHz. In comparison with LiNbO3, LiTaO3 exhibits a much lower birefringence, enabling high-density circuits and broadband operation over all telecommunication bands. Moreover, the platform supports the generation of soliton microcombs. Our work paves the way for the scalable manufacture of low-cost and large-volume next-generation electro-optical PICs. Electro-optical photonic integrated circuits based on lithium tantalate perform as well as current state-of-the-art ones using lithium niobate but the material has the advantage of existing commercial uses in consumer electronics, easing the problem of scalability.",

There is a critical need for antibiotics that are selective both for Gram-negative bacteria over Gram-positive bacteria, as well as for pathogenic bacteria over commensal bacteria. Here we report the design and discovery of lolamicin, a Gram-negative-specific antibiotic targeting the lipoprotein transport system. Lolamicin has activity against a panel of more than 130 multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, shows efficacy in multiple mouse models of acute pneumonia and septicaemia infection, and spares the gut microbiome in mice, preventing secondary infection with Clostridioides difficile. The selective killing of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria by lolamicin is a consequence of low sequence homology for the target in pathogenic bacteria versus commensals; this doubly selective strategy can be a blueprint for the development of other microbiome-sparing antibiotics. Lolamicin, a novel antibiotic developed from a pyridinepyrazole precursor, exhibits potent activity against a broad range of Gram-negative multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, and good efficacy in mouse models of infection without inducing gut dysbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Chemical doping is an important approach to manipulating charge-carrier concentration and transport in organic semiconductors (OSCs)1–3 and ultimately enhances device performance4–7. However, conventional doping strategies often rely on the use of highly reactive (strong) dopants8–10, which are consumed during the doping process. Achieving efficient doping with weak and/or widely accessible dopants under mild conditions remains a considerable challenge. Here, we report a previously undescribed concept for the photocatalytic doping of OSCs that uses air as a weak oxidant (p-dopant) and operates at room temperature. This is a general approach that can be applied to various OSCs and photocatalysts, yielding electrical conductivities that exceed 3,000 S cm–1. We also demonstrate the successful photocatalytic reduction (n-doping) and simultaneous p-doping and n-doping of OSCs in which the organic salt used to maintain charge neutrality is the only chemical consumed. Our photocatalytic doping method offers great potential for advancing OSC doping and developing next-generation organic electronic devices. A previously undescribed photocatalytic approach enables the effective p-type and n-type doping of organic semiconductors at room temperature using only widely available weak dopants such as oxygen and triethylamine.",

    "abstract": "Apes possess two sex chromosomes—the male-specific Y chromosome and the X chromosome, which is present in both males and females. The Y chromosome is crucial for male reproduction, with deletions being linked to infertility1. The X chromosome is vital for reproduction and cognition2. Variation in mating patterns and brain function among apes suggests corresponding differences in their sex chromosomes. However, owing to their repetitive nature and incomplete reference assemblies, ape sex chromosomes have been challenging to study. Here, using the methodology developed for the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) human genome, we produced gapless assemblies of the X and Y chromosomes for five great apes (bonobo (Pan paniscus), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii)) and a lesser ape (the siamang gibbon (Symphalangus syndactylus)), and untangled the intricacies of their evolution. Compared with the X chromosomes, the ape Y chromosomes vary greatly in size and have low alignability and high levels of structural rearrangements—owing to the accumulation of lineage-specific ampliconic regions, palindromes, transposable elements and satellites. Many Y chromosome genes expand in multi-copy families and some evolve under purifying selection. Thus, the Y chromosome exhibits dynamic evolution, whereas the X chromosome is more stable. Mapping short-read sequencing data to these assemblies revealed diversity and selection patterns on sex chromosomes of more than 100 individual great apes. These reference assemblies are expected to inform human evolution and conservation genetics of non-human apes, all of which are endangered species. Reference assemblies of great ape sex chromosomes show that Y chromosomes are more variable in size and sequence than X chromosomes and provide a resource for studies on human evolution and conservation genetics of non-human apes.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 variants acquire mutations in the spike protein that promote immune evasion1 and affect other properties that contribute to viral fitness, such as ACE2 receptor binding and cell entry2,3. Knowledge of how mutations affect these spike phenotypes can provide insight into the current and potential future evolution of the virus. Here we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning4 to measure how more than 9,000 mutations across the full XBB.1.5 and BA.2 spikes affect ACE2 binding, cell entry or escape from human sera. We find that mutations outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) have meaningfully affected ACE2 binding during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. We also measure how mutations to the XBB.1.5 spike affect neutralization by serum from individuals who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infections. The strongest serum escape mutations are in the RBD at sites 357, 420, 440, 456 and 473; however, the antigenic effects of these mutations vary across individuals. We also identify strong escape mutations outside the RBD; however, many of them decrease ACE2 binding, suggesting they act by modulating RBD conformation. Notably, the growth rates of human SARS-CoV-2 clades can be explained in substantial part by the measured effects of mutations on spike phenotypes, suggesting our data could enable better prediction of viral evolution. Pseudovirus-based SARS-CoV-2 spike deep mutational scanning is used to measure how mutations across the spikes affect ACE2 binding, cell entry or escape from human sera, producing data that could enable better prediction of viral evolution.",

    "abstract": "Human brains vary across people and over time; such variation is not yet understood in cellular terms. Here we describe a relationship between people’s cortical neurons and cortical astrocytes. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to analyse the prefrontal cortex of 191 human donors aged 22–97 years, including healthy individuals and people with schizophrenia. Latent-factor analysis of these data revealed that, in people whose cortical neurons more strongly expressed genes encoding synaptic components, cortical astrocytes more strongly expressed distinct genes with synaptic functions and genes for synthesizing cholesterol, an astrocyte-supplied component of synaptic membranes. We call this relationship the synaptic neuron and astrocyte program (SNAP). In schizophrenia and ageing—two conditions that involve declines in cognitive flexibility and plasticity1,2—cells divested from SNAP: astrocytes, glutamatergic (excitatory) neurons and GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons all showed reduced SNAP expression to corresponding degrees. The distinct astrocytic and neuronal components of SNAP both involved genes in which genetic risk factors for schizophrenia were strongly concentrated. SNAP, which varies quantitatively even among healthy people of similar age, may underlie many aspects of normal human interindividual differences and may be an important point of convergence for multiple kinds of pathophysiology. A synaptic neuron and astrocyte program (SNAP) varies among healthy humans, may shape interindividual differences in synapses and plasticity, and is undermined in schizophrenia and with advancing age.",

    "abstract": "The 2023 Canadian forest fires have been extreme in scale and intensity with more than seven times the average annual area burned compared to the previous four decades1. Here, we quantify the carbon emissions from these fires from May to September 2023 on the basis of inverse modelling of satellite carbon monoxide observations. We find that the magnitude of the carbon emissions is 647 TgC (570–727 TgC), comparable to the annual fossil fuel emissions of large nations, with only India, China and the USA releasing more carbon per year2. We find that widespread hot–dry weather was a principal driver of fire spread, with 2023 being the warmest and driest year since at least 19803. Although temperatures were extreme relative to the historical record, climate projections indicate that these temperatures are likely to be typical during the 2050s, even under a moderate climate mitigation scenario (shared socioeconomic pathway, SSP 2–4.5)4. Such conditions are likely to drive increased fire activity and suppress carbon uptake by Canadian forests, adding to concerns about the long-term durability of these forests as a carbon sink5–8. Satellite carbon monoxide observations show that carbon emissions from the 2023 Canadian forest fires are comparable to the annual fossil fuel emissions of large nations.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-specific TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells can drive protective anticancer immunity through expansion and effector cell differentiation1–4; however, this response is dysfunctional in tumours. Current cancer immunotherapies2,5–9 can promote anticancer responses through TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells in some but not all patients. This variation points towards currently ill-defined mechanisms that limit TCF1+CD8+ T cell-mediated anticancer immunity. Here we demonstrate that tumour-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) restricts the proliferative expansion and effector differentiation of TCF1+CD8+ T cells within tumours, which promotes cancer immune escape. PGE2 does not affect the priming of TCF1+CD8+ T cells in draining lymph nodes. PGE2 acts through EP2 and EP4 (EP2/EP4) receptor signalling in CD8+ T cells to limit the intratumoural generation of early and late effector T cell populations that originate from TCF1+ tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (TILs). Ablation of EP2/EP4 signalling in cancer-specific CD8+ T cells rescues their expansion and effector differentiation within tumours and leads to tumour elimination in multiple mouse cancer models. Mechanistically, suppression of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) signalling pathway underlies the PGE2-mediated inhibition of TCF1+ TIL responses. Altogether, we uncover a key mechanism that restricts the IL-2 responsiveness of TCF1+ TILs and prevents anticancer T cell responses that originate from these cells. This study identifies the PGE2–EP2/EP4 axis as a molecular target to restore IL-2 responsiveness in anticancer TILs to achieve cancer immune control. Tumour-derived prostaglandin E2, signaling through its receptors EP2 and EP4, is shown to restrain the responses of tumour-infiltrating stem-like TCF1+CD8+ T lymphocytes, and modulation of T cell EP2 and EP4 can restore anticancer immunity.",

    "abstract": "The additive manufacturing of photopolymer resins by means of vat photopolymerization enables the rapid fabrication of bespoke 3D-printed parts. Advances in methodology have continually improved resolution and manufacturing speed, yet both the process design and resin technology have remained largely consistent since its inception in the 1980s1. Liquid resin formulations, which are composed of reactive monomers and/or oligomers containing (meth)acrylates and epoxides, rapidly photopolymerize to create crosslinked polymer networks on exposure to a light stimulus in the presence of a photoinitiator2. These resin components are mostly obtained from petroleum feedstocks, although recent progress has been made through the derivatization of renewable biomass3–6 and the introduction of hydrolytically degradable bonds7–9. However, the resulting materials are still akin to conventional crosslinked rubbers and thermosets, thus limiting the recyclability of printed parts. At present, no existing photopolymer resin can be depolymerized and directly re-used in a circular, closed-loop pathway. Here we describe a photopolymer resin platform derived entirely from renewable lipoates that can be 3D-printed into high-resolution parts, efficiently deconstructed and subsequently reprinted in a circular manner. Previous inefficiencies with methods using internal dynamic covalent bonds10–17 to recycle and reprint 3D-printed photopolymers are resolved by exchanging conventional (meth)acrylates for dynamic cyclic disulfide species in lipoates. The lipoate resin platform is highly modular, whereby the composition and network architecture can be tuned to access printed materials with varied thermal and mechanical properties that are comparable to several commercial acrylic resins. A photopolymer platform derived from renewable lipoates can be 3D-printed into high-resolution parts, which possess properties comparable to some commercial acrylic resins, and then recycled to produce a re-printable resin.",

    "abstract": "Glassy polymers are generally stiff and strong yet have limited extensibility1. By swelling with solvent, glassy polymers can become gels that are soft and weak yet have enhanced extensibility1–3. The marked changes in properties arise from the solvent increasing free volume between chains while weakening polymer–polymer interactions. Here we show that solvating polar polymers with ionic liquids (that is, ionogels4,5) at appropriate concentrations can produce a unique class of materials called glassy gels with desirable properties of both glasses and gels. The ionic liquid increases free volume and therefore extensibility despite the absence of conventional solvent (for example, water). Yet, the ionic liquid forms strong and abundant non-covalent crosslinks between polymer chains to render a stiff, tough, glassy, and homogeneous network (that is, no phase separation)6, at room temperature. Despite being more than 54 wt% liquid, the glassy gels exhibit enormous fracture strength (42 MPa), toughness (110 MJ m−3), yield strength (73 MPa) and Young’s modulus (1 GPa). These values are similar to those of thermoplastics such as polyethylene, yet unlike thermoplastics, the glassy gels can be deformed up to 670% strain with full and rapid recovery on heating. These transparent materials form by a one-step polymerization and have impressive adhesive, self-healing and shape-memory properties. Solvating polar polymers with ionic liquids at appropriate concentrations can produce a unique class of materials called glassy gels with desirable properties of both glasses and gels.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has recently been associated with diverse cell states1–11, yet when and how these states affect the onset of AD remains unclear. Here we used a data-driven approach to reconstruct the dynamics of the brain’s cellular environment and identified a trajectory leading to AD that is distinct from other ageing-related effects. First, we built a comprehensive cell atlas of the aged prefrontal cortex from 1.65 million single-nucleus RNA-sequencing profiles sampled from 437 older individuals, and identified specific glial and neuronal subpopulations associated with AD-related traits. Causal modelling then prioritized two distinct lipid-associated microglial subpopulations—one drives amyloid-β proteinopathy while the other mediates the effect of amyloid-β on tau proteinopathy—as well as an astrocyte subpopulation that mediates the effect of tau on cognitive decline. To model the dynamics of cellular environments, we devised the BEYOND methodology, which identified two distinct trajectories of brain ageing, each defined by coordinated progressive changes in certain cellular communities that lead to (1) AD dementia or (2) alternative brain ageing. Thus, we provide a cellular foundation for a new perspective on AD pathophysiology that informs personalized therapeutic development, targeting different cellular communities for individuals on the path to AD or to alternative brain ageing. A comprehensive cell atlas of the aged prefrontal cortex identifies two distinct cellular trajectories of ageing driven by specific glial and neuronal subpopulations, some of which are associated with clinicopathologic traits that define Alzheimer’s disease.",

    "abstract": "Reliable control of the conductivity and its polarity in semiconductors is at the heart of modern electronics1–7, and has led to key inventions including diodes, transistors, solar cells, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and semiconductor lasers. For archetypal semiconductors such as Si and GaN, positive (p)- and negative (n)-type conductivities are achieved through the doping of electron-accepting and electron-donating elements into the crystal lattices, respectively1–6. For halide perovskites, which are an emerging class of semiconductors, mechanisms for reliably controlling charge conduction behaviours while maintaining high optoelectronic qualities are yet to be discovered. Here we report that the p- and n-type characteristics in a wide-bandgap perovskite semiconductor can be adjusted by incorporating a phosphonic acid molecular dopant with strong electron-withdrawing abilities. The resultant carrier concentrations were more than 1013 cm−3 for the p- and n-type samples, with Hall coefficients ranging from −0.5 m3 C−1 (n-type) to 0.6 m3 C−1 (p-type). A shift of the Fermi level across the bandgap was observed. Importantly, the transition from n- to p-type conductivity was achieved while retaining high photoluminescence quantum yields of 70–85%. The controllable doping in the emissive perovskite semiconductor enabled the demonstration of ultrahigh brightness (more than 1.1 × 106 cd m−2) and exceptional external quantum efficiency (28.4%) in perovskite light-emitting diodes with a simple architecture. The charge carrier polarity and concentrations in an emissive perovskite semiconductor can be adjusted by incorporating a molecular dopant widely used for the passivation and structural control of optoelectronic perovskite materials.",

    "abstract": "Oncogene-induced replication stress generates endogenous DNA damage that activates cGAS–STING-mediated signalling and tumour suppression1–3. However, the precise mechanism of cGAS activation by endogenous DNA damage remains enigmatic, particularly given that high-affinity histone acidic patch (AP) binding constitutively inhibits cGAS by sterically hindering its activation by double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)4–10. Here we report that the DNA double-strand break sensor MRE11 suppresses mammary tumorigenesis through a pivotal role in regulating cGAS activation. We demonstrate that binding of the MRE11–RAD50–NBN complex to nucleosome fragments is necessary to displace cGAS from acidic-patch-mediated sequestration, which enables its mobilization and activation by dsDNA. MRE11 is therefore essential for cGAS activation in response to oncogenic stress, cytosolic dsDNA and ionizing radiation. Furthermore, MRE11-dependent cGAS activation promotes ZBP1–RIPK3–MLKL-mediated necroptosis, which is essential to suppress oncogenic proliferation and breast tumorigenesis. Notably, downregulation of ZBP1 in human triple-negative breast cancer is associated with increased genome instability, immune suppression and poor patient prognosis. These findings establish MRE11 as a crucial mediator that links DNA damage and cGAS activation, resulting in tumour suppression through ZBP1-dependent necroptosis. The double-strand break sensor MRE11 is identified as a pivotal mediator of cGAS activation in response to multiple types of DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the cellular processes that underlie early lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) development is needed to devise intervention strategies1. Here we studied 246,102 single epithelial cells from 16 early-stage LUADs and 47 matched normal lung samples. Epithelial cells comprised diverse normal and cancer cell states, and diversity among cancer cells was strongly linked to LUAD-specific oncogenic drivers. KRAS mutant cancer cells showed distinct transcriptional features, reduced differentiation and low levels of aneuploidy. Non-malignant areas surrounding human LUAD samples were enriched with alveolar intermediate cells that displayed elevated KRT8 expression (termed KRT8+ alveolar intermediate cells (KACs) here), reduced differentiation, increased plasticity and driver KRAS mutations. Expression profiles of KACs were enriched in lung precancer cells and in LUAD cells and signified poor survival. In mice exposed to tobacco carcinogen, KACs emerged before lung tumours and persisted for months after cessation of carcinogen exposure. Moreover, they acquired Kras mutations and conveyed sensitivity to targeted KRAS inhibition in KAC-enriched organoids derived from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. Last, lineage-labelling of AT2 cells or KRT8+ cells following carcinogen exposure showed that KACs are possible intermediates in AT2-to-tumour cell transformation. This study provides new insights into epithelial cell states at the root of LUAD development, and such states could harbour potential targets for prevention or intervention. Analyses of single epithelial cells from early-stage lung adenocarcinoma and normal lung identifies a population of intermediate cells that may have an increased likelihood of transforming to tumour cells after injury such as tobacco exposure.",

    "abstract": "Sugarcane, the world’s most harvested crop by tonnage, has shaped global history, trade and geopolitics, and is currently responsible for 80% of sugar production worldwide1. While traditional sugarcane breeding methods have effectively generated cultivars adapted to new environments and pathogens, sugar yield improvements have recently plateaued2. The cessation of yield gains may be due to limited genetic diversity within breeding populations, long breeding cycles and the complexity of its genome, the latter preventing breeders from taking advantage of the recent explosion of whole-genome sequencing that has benefited many other crops. Thus, modern sugarcane hybrids are the last remaining major crop without a reference-quality genome. Here we take a major step towards advancing sugarcane biotechnology by generating a polyploid reference genome for R570, a typical modern cultivar derived from interspecific hybridization between the domesticated species (Saccharum officinarum) and the wild species (Saccharum spontaneum). In contrast to the existing single haplotype (‘monoploid’) representation of R570, our 8.7 billion base assembly contains a complete representation of unique DNA sequences across the approximately 12 chromosome copies in this polyploid genome. Using this highly contiguous genome assembly, we filled a previously unsized gap within an R570 physical genetic map to describe the likely causal genes underlying the single-copy Bru1 brown rust resistance locus. This polyploid genome assembly with fine-grain descriptions of genome architecture and molecular targets for biotechnology will help accelerate molecular and transgenic breeding and adaptation of sugarcane to future environmental conditions. We build a polyploid reference genome for hybrid sugarcane cultivar R570, improving on its current ‘mosaic monoploid’ representation, enabling fine-grain description of genome architecture and the exploration of candidate genes underlying the Bru1 brown rust resistance locus.",

    "abstract": "Solar fuels offer a promising approach to provide sustainable fuels by harnessing sunlight1,2. Following a decade of advancement, Cu2O photocathodes are capable of delivering a performance comparable to that of photoelectrodes with established photovoltaic materials3–5. However, considerable bulk charge carrier recombination that is poorly understood still limits further advances in performance6. Here we demonstrate performance of Cu2O photocathodes beyond the state-of-the-art by exploiting a new conceptual understanding of carrier recombination and transport in single-crystal Cu2O thin films. Using ambient liquid-phase epitaxy, we present a new method to grow single-crystal Cu2O samples with three crystal orientations. Broadband femtosecond transient reflection spectroscopy measurements were used to quantify anisotropic optoelectronic properties, through which the carrier mobility along the [111] direction was found to be an order of magnitude higher than those along other orientations. Driven by these findings, we developed a polycrystalline Cu2O photocathode with an extraordinarily pure (111) orientation and (111) terminating facets using a simple and low-cost method, which delivers 7 mA cm−2 current density (more than 70% improvement compared to that of state-of-the-art electrodeposited devices) at 0.5 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode under air mass 1.5 G illumination, and stable operation over at least 120 h. A study introduces a novel method to grow single-crystal Cu2O thin films with selected crystal orientations, highlighting enhanced bulk carrier mobility and carrier diffusion length along the [111] direction that yields Cu2O photocathodes with improved performance.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype (HPAI H5N1) in dairy cattle in the USA has so far resulted in spillover infections of at least 14 farm workers1–3, who presented with mild respiratory symptoms or conjunctivitis, and one individual with no known animal exposure who was hospitalized but recovered3,4. Here we characterized A/Texas/37/2024 (huTX37-H5N1), a virus isolated from the eyes of an infected farm worker who developed conjunctivitis5. huTX37-H5N1 replicated efficiently in primary human alveolar epithelial cells, but less efficiently in corneal epithelial cells. Despite causing mild disease in the infected worker, huTX37-H5N1 proved lethal in mice and ferrets and spread systemically, with high titres in both respiratory and non-respiratory organs. Importantly, in four independent experiments in ferrets, huTX37-H5N1 transmitted by respiratory droplets in 17–33% of transmission pairs, and five of six exposed ferrets that became infected died. PB2-631L (encoded by bovine isolates) promoted influenza polymerase activity in human cells, suggesting a role in mammalian adaptation similar to that of PB2-627K (encoded by huTX37-H5N1). In addition, bovine HPAI H5N1 virus was found to be susceptible to polymerase inhibitors both in vitro and in mice. Thus, HPAI H5N1 virus derived from dairy cattle transmits by respiratory droplets in mammals without previous adaptation and causes lethal disease in animal models. A/Texas/37/2024 (huTX37-H5N1), a virus isolated from the eyes of an infected farm worker who developed conjunctivitis, proved lethal in mice and ferrets, spreading systemically with high titres in both respiratory and non-respiratory organs, and transmitted by respiratory droplets in ferrets.",

    "abstract": "Reducing body weight to improve metabolic health and related comorbidities is a primary goal in treating obesity1,2. However, maintaining weight loss is a considerable challenge, especially as the body seems to retain an obesogenic memory that defends against body weight changes3,4. Overcoming this barrier for long-term treatment success is difficult because the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Here, by using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we show that both human and mouse adipose tissues retain cellular transcriptional changes after appreciable weight loss. Furthermore, we find persistent obesity-induced alterations in the epigenome of mouse adipocytes that negatively affect their function and response to metabolic stimuli. Mice carrying this obesogenic memory show accelerated rebound weight gain, and the epigenetic memory can explain future transcriptional deregulation in adipocytes in response to further high-fat diet feeding. In summary, our findings indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory, largely on the basis of stable epigenetic changes, in mouse adipocytes and probably other cell types. These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic ‘yo-yo’ effect often seen with dieting. Targeting these changes in the future could improve long-term weight management and health outcomes. Stable epigenetic changes indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory in mouse adipocytes that primes cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment and potentially contributes to the problematic ‘yo-yo’ effect often seen with dieting.",

    "abstract": "The human blood system is maintained through the differentiation and massive amplification of a limited number of long-lived haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)1. Perturbations to this process underlie diverse diseases, but the clonal contributions to human haematopoiesis and how this changes with age remain incompletely understood. Although recent insights have emerged from barcoding studies in model systems2–5, simultaneous detection of cell states and phylogenies from natural barcodes in humans remains challenging. Here we introduce an improved, single-cell lineage-tracing system based on deep detection of naturally occurring mitochondrial DNA mutations with simultaneous readout of transcriptional states and chromatin accessibility. We use this system to define the clonal architecture of HSCs and map the physiological state and output of clones. We uncover functional heterogeneity in HSC clones, which is stable over months and manifests as both differences in total HSC output and biases towards the production of different mature cell types. We also find that the diversity of HSC clones decreases markedly with age, leading to an oligoclonal structure with multiple distinct clonal expansions. Our study thus provides a clonally resolved and cell-state-aware atlas of human haematopoiesis at single-cell resolution, showing an unappreciated functional diversity of human HSC clones and, more broadly, paving the way for refined studies of clonal dynamics across a range of tissues in human health and disease. An improved, single-cell lineage-tracing system, based on deep detection of naturally occurring mitochondrial DNA mutations with simultaneous readout of transcriptional states and chromatin accessibility, is used to define the clonal architecture of haematopoietic stem cells.",

Yet, a rechargeable Ca–O2 battery that operates at room temperature has not been achieved because the CaOx/O2 chemistry typically involves inert discharge products and few electrolytes can accommodate both a highly reductive Ca metal anode and O2. Here we report a Ca–O2 battery that is rechargeable for 700 cycles at room temperature. Our battery relies on a highly reversible two-electron redox to form chemically reactive calcium peroxide (CaO2) as the discharge product. Using a durable ionic liquid-based electrolyte, this two-electron reaction is enabled by the facilitated Ca plating–stripping in the Ca metal anode at room temperature and improved CaO2/O2 redox in the air cathode. We show the proposed Ca–O2 battery is stable in air and can be made into flexible fibres that are weaved into textile batteries for next-generation wearable systems. A Ca–O2 battery that relies on a highly reversible two-electron redox to form chemically reactive calcium peroxide as the discharge product is reported to be stable in air and rechargeable for 700 cycles at room temperature.",

The interplay between LLPS and macromolecular condensation is part of continuing studies4,5. Synthetic supramolecular polymers are the non-covalent equivalent of macromolecules but they are not reported to undergo LLPS yet. Here we show that continuously growing fibrils, obtained from supramolecular polymerizations of synthetic components, are responsible for phase separation into highly anisotropic aqueous liquid droplets (tactoids) by means of an entropy-driven pathway. The crowding environment, regulated by dextran concentration, affects not only the kinetics of supramolecular polymerizations but also the properties of LLPS, including phase-separation kinetics, morphology, internal order, fluidity and mechanical properties of the final tactoids. In addition, substrate–liquid and liquid–liquid interfaces proved capable of accelerating LLPS of supramolecular polymers, allowing the generation of a myriad of three-dimensional-ordered structures, including highly ordered arrays of micrometre-long tactoids at surfaces. The generality and many possibilities of supramolecular polymerizations to control emerging morphologies are demonstrated with several supramolecular polymers, opening up a new field of matter ranging from highly structured aqueous solutions by means of stabilized LLPS to nanoscopic soft matter. Spontaneous liquid–liquid phase-separation behaviour of high-aspect-ratio fibrils, obtained from supramolecular polymerizations of synthetic components, forms tactoids by means of an entropy-driven pathway.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection. A human SARS-CoV-2 challenge study in individuals without previous exposure to the virus or vaccines provides detailed profiles of local and systemic epithelial and immune cell response dynamics over time and infection status.",

    "abstract": "Genomic rearrangements, encompassing mutational changes in the genome such as insertions, deletions or inversions, are essential for genetic diversity. These rearrangements are typically orchestrated by enzymes that are involved in fundamental DNA repair processes, such as homologous recombination, or in the transposition of foreign genetic material by viruses and mobile genetic elements1,2. Here we report that IS110 insertion sequences, a family of minimal and autonomous mobile genetic elements, express a structured non-coding RNA that binds specifically to their encoded recombinase. This bridge RNA contains two internal loops encoding nucleotide stretches that base-pair with the target DNA and the donor DNA, which is the IS110 element itself. We demonstrate that the target-binding and donor-binding loops can be independently reprogrammed to direct sequence-specific recombination between two DNA molecules. This modularity enables the insertion of DNA into genomic target sites, as well as programmable DNA excision and inversion. The IS110 bridge recombination system expands the diversity of nucleic-acid-guided systems beyond CRISPR and RNA interference, offering a unified mechanism for the three fundamental DNA rearrangements—insertion, excision and inversion—that are required for genome design. A bispecific non-coding RNA expressed by the IS110 family of mobile genetic elements forms the basis of a programmable genome-editing system that enables the insertion, excision or inversion of specific target DNA sequences.",

    "abstract": "Conjugated polymers promise inherently flexible and low-cost thermoelectrics for powering the Internet of Things from waste heat1,2. Their valuable applications, however, have been hitherto hindered by the low dimensionless figure of merit (ZT)3–6. Here we report high-ZT thermoelectric plastics, which were achieved by creating a polymeric multi-heterojunction with periodic dual-heterojunction features, where each period is composed of two polymers with a sub-ten-nanometre layered heterojunction structure and an interpenetrating bulk-heterojunction interface. This geometry produces significantly enhanced interfacial phonon-like scattering while maintaining efficient charge transport. We observed a significant suppression of thermal conductivity by over 60 per cent and an enhanced power factor when compared with individual polymers, resulting in a ZT of up to 1.28 at 368 kelvin. This polymeric thermoelectric performance surpasses that of commercial thermoelectric materials and existing flexible thermoelectric candidates. Importantly, we demonstrated the compatibility of the polymeric multi-heterojunction structure with solution coating techniques for satisfying the demand for large-area plastic thermoelectrics, which paves the way for polymeric multi-heterojunctions towards cost-effective wearable thermoelectric technologies. Thermoelectric plastics with a high figure of merit, suppressed thermal conductivity and an enhanced power factor are realized by combining layered and bulk heterojunctions to create a polymeric multi-heterojunction.",

    "abstract": "Titanium carbide MXene flakes have promising applications in aerospace, flexible electronic devices and biomedicine owing to their superior mechanical properties1 and electrical conductivity2 and good photothermal conversion3, biocompatibility4 and osteoinductivity5. It is highly desired yet very challenging to assemble MXene flakes into macroscopic high-performance materials in a scalable manner. Here we demonstrate a scalable strategy to fabricate high-performance MXene films by roll-to-roll-assisted blade coating (RBC) integrated with sequential bridging, providing good photothermal conversion and osteogenesis efficiency under near-infrared irradiation. MXene flakes were first bridged with silk sericin by hydrogen bonding and then assembled into macroscopic films using a continuous RBC process, followed by ionic bridging to freeze their aligned structure. The resultant large-scale MXene films with strong interlayer interactions are highly aligned and densified, exhibiting high tensile strength (755 MPa), toughness (17.4 MJ m−3) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding capacity (78,000 dB cm2 g−1), as well as good ambient stability, photothermal conversion and bone regeneration performance. The proposed strategy not only paves a feasible way for realizing the practical applications of MXene in the fields of flexible EMI shielding materials and bone tissue engineering but also provides an avenue for the high-performance and scalable assembly of other two-dimensional flakes. Large-scale roll-to-roll-assisted blade coating is used in the production of scalable ultrastong MXene films with superior mechanical, electromagnetic shielding and bone regeneration properties.",

    "abstract": "The brightness of an emitter is ultimately described by Fermi’s golden rule, with a radiative rate proportional to its oscillator strength times the local density of photonic states. As the oscillator strength is an intrinsic material property, the quest for ever brighter emission has relied on the local density of photonic states engineering, using dielectric or plasmonic resonators1,2. By contrast, a much less explored avenue is to boost the oscillator strength, and hence the emission rate, using a collective behaviour termed superradiance. Recently, it was proposed3 that the latter can be realized using the giant oscillator-strength transitions of a weakly confined exciton in a quantum well when its coherent motion extends over many unit cells. Here we demonstrate single-photon superradiance in perovskite quantum dots with a sub-100 picosecond radiative decay time, almost as short as the reported exciton coherence time4. The characteristic dependence of radiative rates on the size, composition and temperature of the quantum dot suggests the formation of giant transition dipoles, as confirmed by effective-mass calculations. The results aid in the development of ultrabright, coherent quantum light sources and attest that quantum effects, for example, single-photon emission, persist in nanoparticles ten times larger than the exciton Bohr radius. Excitonic single-photon superradiance is reported in individual perovskite quantum dots with a sub-100 ps radiative decay time, almost as short as the reported exciton coherence time.",

    "abstract": "Epigenomes enable the rectification of disordered cancer gene expression, thereby providing new targets for pharmacological interventions. The clinical utility of targeting histone H3 lysine trimethylation (H3K27me3) as an epigenetic hallmark has been demonstrated1–7. However, in actual therapeutic settings, the mechanism by which H3K27me3-targeting therapies exert their effects and the response of tumour cells remain unclear. Here we show the potency and mechanisms of action and resistance of the EZH1–EZH2 dual inhibitor valemetostat in clinical trials of patients with adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma. Administration of valemetostat reduced tumour size and demonstrated durable clinical response in aggressive lymphomas with multiple genetic mutations. Integrative single-cell analyses showed that valemetostat abolishes the highly condensed chromatin structure formed by the plastic H3K27me3 and neutralizes multiple gene loci, including tumour suppressor genes. Nevertheless, subsequent long-term treatment encounters the emergence of resistant clones with reconstructed aggregate chromatin that closely resemble the pre-dose state. Acquired mutations at the PRC2–compound interface result in the propagation of clones with increased H3K27me3 expression. In patients free of PRC2 mutations, TET2 mutation or elevated DNMT3A expression causes similar chromatin recondensation through de novo DNA methylation in the H3K27me3-associated regions. We identified subpopulations with distinct metabolic and gene translation characteristics implicated in primary susceptibility until the acquisition of the heritable (epi)mutations. Targeting epigenetic drivers and chromatin homeostasis may provide opportunities for further sustained epigenetic cancer therapies. The mechanisms of action and resistance of valemetostat, an EZH1–EZH2 dual inhibitor, in patients with adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma who initially responded but later showed disease progression are explored.",

    "abstract": "Dielectric electrostatic capacitors1, because of their ultrafast charge–discharge, are desirable for high-power energy storage applications. Along with ultrafast operation, on-chip integration can enable miniaturized energy storage devices for emerging autonomous microelectronics and microsystems2–5. Moreover, state-of-the-art miniaturized electrochemical energy storage systems—microsupercapacitors and microbatteries—currently face safety, packaging, materials and microfabrication challenges preventing on-chip technological readiness2,3,6, leaving an opportunity for electrostatic microcapacitors. Here we report record-high electrostatic energy storage density (ESD) and power density, to our knowledge, in HfO2–ZrO2-based thin film microcapacitors integrated into silicon, through a three-pronged approach. First, to increase intrinsic energy storage, atomic-layer-deposited antiferroelectric HfO2–ZrO2 films are engineered near a field-driven ferroelectric phase transition to exhibit amplified charge storage by the negative capacitance effect7–12, which enhances volumetric ESD beyond the best-known back-end-of-the-line-compatible dielectrics (115 J cm−3) (ref. 13). Second, to increase total energy storage, antiferroelectric superlattice engineering14 scales the energy storage performance beyond the conventional thickness limitations of HfO2–ZrO2-based (anti)ferroelectricity15 (100-nm regime). Third, to increase the storage per footprint, the superlattices are conformally integrated into three-dimensional capacitors, which boosts the areal ESD nine times and the areal power density 170 times that of the best-known electrostatic capacitors: 80 mJ cm−2 and 300 kW cm−2, respectively. This simultaneous demonstration of ultrahigh energy density and power density overcomes the traditional capacity–speed trade-off across the electrostatic–electrochemical energy storage hierarchy1,16. Furthermore, the integration of ultrahigh-density and ultrafast-charging thin films within a back-end-of-the-line-compatible process enables monolithic integration of on-chip microcapacitors5, which can unlock substantial energy storage and power delivery performance for electronic microsystems17–19. Using a three-pronged approach — spanning field-driven negative capacitance stabilization to increase intrinsic energy storage, antiferroelectric superlattice engineering to increase total energy storage, and conformal three-dimensional deposition to increase areal energy storage density — very high electrostatic energy storage density and power density are reported in HfO2–ZrO2-based thin film microcapacitors integrated into silicon.",

    "abstract": "Timothy syndrome (TS) is a severe, multisystem disorder characterized by autism, epilepsy, long-QT syndrome and other neuropsychiatric conditions1. TS type 1 (TS1) is caused by a gain-of-function variant in the alternatively spliced and developmentally enriched CACNA1C exon 8A, as opposed to its counterpart exon 8. We previously uncovered several phenotypes in neurons derived from patients with TS1, including delayed channel inactivation, prolonged depolarization-induced calcium rise, impaired interneuron migration, activity-dependent dendrite retraction and an unanticipated persistent expression of exon 8A2–6. We reasoned that switching CACNA1C exon utilization from 8A to 8 would represent a potential therapeutic strategy. Here we developed antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to effectively decrease the inclusion of exon 8A in human cells both in vitro and, following transplantation, in vivo. We discovered that the ASO-mediated switch from exon 8A to 8 robustly rescued defects in patient-derived cortical organoids and migration in forebrain assembloids. Leveraging a transplantation platform previously developed7, we found that a single intrathecal ASO administration rescued calcium changes and in vivo dendrite retraction of patient neurons, suggesting that suppression of CACNA1C exon 8A expression is a potential treatment for TS1. Broadly, these experiments illustrate how a multilevel, in vivo and in vitro stem cell model-based approach can identify strategies to reverse disease-relevant neural pathophysiology. Antisense oligonucleotides effectively decrease the inclusion of exon  8A of CACNA1C in human cells both in vitro and in rodents transplanted with human brain organoids, and a single intrathecal administration rescued both calcium changes and in vivo dendrite morphology of patient neurons.",

Atomic quantum gases1,2, liquid helium3,4 and electrons in quantum materials5–7 all exhibit distinct properties because of their composition and interactions. Quantum degenerate samples of ultracold dipolar molecules promise the realization of new phases of matter and new avenues for quantum simulation8 and quantum computation9. However, rapid losses10, even when reduced through collisional shielding techniques11–13, have so far prevented evaporative cooling to a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we report on the realization of a BEC of dipolar molecules. By strongly suppressing two- and three-body losses via enhanced collisional shielding, we evaporatively cool sodium–caesium molecules to quantum degeneracy and cross the phase transition to a BEC. The BEC reveals itself by a bimodal distribution when the phase-space density exceeds 1. BECs with a condensate fraction of 60(10)% and a temperature of 6(2) nK are created and found to be stable with a lifetime close to 2 s. This work opens the door to the exploration of dipolar quantum matter in regimes that have been inaccessible so far, promising the creation of exotic dipolar droplets14, self-organized crystal phases15 and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices16. Bose–Einstein condensate of sodium–caesium molecules is observed by means of evaporative cooling and collisional shielding.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers control the location and timing of gene expression and contain the majority of variants associated with disease1–3. The ZRS is arguably the most well-studied vertebrate enhancer and mediates the expression of Shh in the developing limb4. Thirty-one human single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the ZRS are associated with polydactyly4–6. However, how this enhancer encodes tissue-specific activity, and the mechanisms by which SNVs alter the number of digits, are poorly understood. Here we show that the ETS sites within the ZRS are low affinity, and identify a functional ETS site, ETS-A, with extremely low affinity. Two human SNVs and a synthetic variant optimize the binding affinity of ETS-A subtly from 15% to around 25% relative to the strongest ETS binding sequence, and cause polydactyly with the same penetrance and severity. A greater increase in affinity results in phenotypes that are more penetrant and more severe. Affinity-optimizing SNVs in other ETS sites in the ZRS, as well as in ETS, interferon regulatory factor (IRF), HOX and activator protein 1 (AP-1) sites within a wide variety of enhancers, cause gain-of-function gene expression. The prevalence of binding sites with suboptimal affinity in enhancers creates a vulnerability in genomes whereby SNVs that optimize affinity, even slightly, can be pathogenic. Searching for affinity-optimizing SNVs in genomes could provide a mechanistic approach to identify causal variants that underlie enhanceropathies. Low-affinity transcription factor binding sites are prevalent across the genome, and single nucleotide changes that increase binding affinity even slightly can cause gain-of-function gene expression and phenotypes (such as polydactyly).",

    "abstract": "Over half of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases diagnosed worldwide are in China1–3. However, whole-genome analysis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC in Chinese individuals is limited4–8, with current analyses of HCC mainly from non-HBV-enriched populations9,10. Here we initiated the Chinese Liver Cancer Atlas (CLCA) project and performed deep whole-genome sequencing (average depth, 120×) of 494 HCC tumours. We identified 6 coding and 28 non-coding previously undescribed driver candidates. Five previously undescribed mutational signatures were found, including aristolochic-acid-associated indel and doublet base signatures, and a single-base-substitution signature that we termed SBS_H8. Pentanucleotide context analysis and experimental validation confirmed that SBS_H8 was distinct to the aristolochic-acid-associated SBS22. Notably, HBV integrations could take the form of extrachromosomal circular DNA, resulting in elevated copy numbers and gene expression. Our high-depth data also enabled us to characterize subclonal clustered alterations, including chromothripsis, chromoplexy and kataegis, suggesting that these catastrophic events could also occur in late stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. Pathway analysis of all classes of alterations further linked non-coding mutations to dysregulation of liver metabolism. Finally, we performed in vitro and in vivo assays to show that fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA), determined as both a candidate coding and non-coding driver, regulates HCC progression and metastasis. Our CLCA study depicts a detailed genomic landscape and evolutionary history of HCC in Chinese individuals, providing important clinical implications. The Chinese Liver Cancer Atlas project depicts a panoramic genomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma, covering candidate coding and non-coding drivers, mutational signatures, extrachromosomal circular DNA, subclonal catastrophic events and detailed evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic change is contributing to the rise in emerging infectious diseases, which are significantly correlated with socioeconomic, environmental and ecological factors1. Studies have shown that infectious disease risk is modified by changes to biodiversity2–6, climate change7–11, chemical pollution12–14, landscape transformations15–20 and species introductions21. However, it remains unclear which global change drivers most increase disease and under what contexts. Here we amassed a dataset from the literature that contains 2,938 observations of infectious disease responses to global change drivers across 1,497 host–parasite combinations, including plant, animal and human hosts. We found that biodiversity loss, chemical pollution, climate change and introduced species are associated with increases in disease-related end points or harm, whereas urbanization is associated with decreases in disease end points. Natural biodiversity gradients, deforestation and forest fragmentation are comparatively unimportant or idiosyncratic as drivers of disease. Overall, these results are consistent across human and non-human diseases. Nevertheless, context-dependent effects of the global change drivers on disease were found to be common. The findings uncovered by this meta-analysis should help target disease management and surveillance efforts towards global change drivers that increase disease. Specifically, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, managing ecosystem health, and preventing biological invasions and biodiversity loss could help to reduce the burden of plant, animal and human diseases, especially when coupled with improvements to social and economic determinants of health.

    "abstract": "Tumour innervation is associated with worse patient outcomes in multiple cancers1,2, which suggests that it may regulate metastasis. Here we observed that highly metastatic mouse mammary tumours acquired more innervation than did less-metastatic tumours. This enhanced innervation was driven by expression of the axon-guidance molecule SLIT2 in tumour vasculature. Breast cancer cells induced spontaneous calcium activity in sensory neurons and elicited release of the neuropeptide substance P (SP). Using three-dimensional co-cultures and in vivo models, we found that neuronal SP promoted breast tumour growth, invasion and metastasis. Moreover, patient tumours with elevated SP exhibited enhanced lymph node metastatic spread. SP acted on tumoral tachykinin receptors (TACR1) to drive death of a small population of TACR1high cancer cells. Single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) released from dying cells acted on neighbouring tumoural Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) to non-canonically activate a prometastatic gene expression program. This SP- and ssRNA-induced Tlr7 gene expression signature was associated with reduced breast cancer survival outcomes. Therapeutic targeting of this neuro–cancer axis with the TACR1 antagonist aprepitant, an approved anti-nausea drug, suppressed breast cancer growth and metastasis in multiple models. Our findings reveal that tumour-induced hyperactivation of sensory neurons regulates multiple aspects of metastatic progression in breast cancer through a therapeutically targetable neuropeptide/extracellular ssRNA sensing axis. Hyperactivation of sensory neurons regulates multiple aspects of metastatic progression in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Ion-conducting polymer membranes are essential in many separation processes and electrochemical devices, including electrodialysis1, redox flow batteries2, fuel cells3 and electrolysers4,5. Controlling ion transport and selectivity in these membranes largely hinges on the manipulation of pore size. Although membrane pore structures can be designed in the dry state6, they are redefined upon hydration owing to swelling in electrolyte solutions. Strategies to control pore hydration and a deeper understanding of pore structure evolution are vital for accurate pore size tuning. Here we report polymer membranes containing pendant groups of varying hydrophobicity, strategically positioned near charged groups to regulate their hydration capacity and pore swelling. Modulation of the hydrated micropore size (less than two nanometres) enables direct control over water and ion transport across broad length scales, as quantified by spectroscopic and computational methods. Ion selectivity improves in hydration-restrained pores created by more hydrophobic pendant groups. These highly interconnected ion transport channels, with tuned pore gate sizes, show higher ionic conductivity and orders-of-magnitude lower permeation rates of redox-active species compared with conventional membranes, enabling stable cycling of energy-dense aqueous organic redox flow batteries. This pore size tailoring approach provides a promising avenue to membranes with precisely controlled ionic and molecular transport functions. A method for design of polymer membranes uses strategically placed pendant groups with specific hydrophobicity to precisely tailor hydrated pore size, with applications in ion-conducting membranes for redox flow batteries.",

    "abstract": "HIV can infect non-dividing cells because the viral capsid can overcome the selective barrier of the nuclear pore complex and deliver the genome directly into the nucleus1,2. Remarkably, the intact HIV capsid is more than 1,000 times larger than the size limit prescribed by the diffusion barrier of the nuclear pore3. This barrier in the central channel of the nuclear pore is composed of intrinsically disordered nucleoporin domains enriched in phenylalanine–glycine (FG) dipeptides. Through multivalent FG interactions, cellular karyopherins and their bound cargoes solubilize in this phase to drive nucleocytoplasmic transport4. By performing an in vitro dissection of the nuclear pore complex, we show that a pocket on the surface of the HIV capsid similarly interacts with FG motifs from multiple nucleoporins and that this interaction licences capsids to penetrate FG-nucleoporin condensates. This karyopherin mimicry model addresses a key conceptual challenge for the role of the HIV capsid in nuclear entry and offers an explanation as to how an exogenous entity much larger than any known cellular cargo may be able to non-destructively breach the nuclear envelope. Dissection of the nuclear pore complex provides a model in which the HIV capsid enters the nucleus through karyopherin mimicry, a mechanism likely to be conserved across other viruses.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are increasingly being implicated in a variety of functions in normal and cancerous cells1–5, are formed by back-splicing of precursor mRNAs in the nucleus6–10. circRNAs are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that they must be exported from the nucleus. Here we identify a pathway that is specific for the nuclear export of circular RNA. This pathway requires Ran-GTP, exportin-2 and IGF2BP1. Enhancing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient by depletion or chemical inhibition of the major protein exporter CRM1 selectively increases the nuclear export of circRNAs, while reducing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient selectively blocks circRNA export. Depletion or knockout of exportin-2 specifically inhibits nuclear export of circRNA. Analysis of nuclear circRNA-binding proteins reveals that interaction between IGF2BP1 and circRNA is enhanced by Ran-GTP. The formation of circRNA export complexes in the nucleus is promoted by Ran-GTP through its interactions with exportin-2, circRNA and IGF2BP1. Our findings demonstrate that adaptors such as IGF2BP1 that bind directly to circular RNAs recruit Ran-GTP and exportin-2 to export circRNAs in a mechanism that is analogous to protein export, rather than mRNA export. Circular RNAs are exported from the nucleus by Ran-GTP, exportin-2 and IGF2BP1 in a mechanism analogous to protein export rather than mRNA export.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of collective order in matter is among the most fundamental and intriguing phenomena in physics. In recent years, the dynamical control and creation of novel ordered states of matter not accessible in thermodynamic equilibrium is receiving much attention1–6. The theoretical concept of dynamical multiferroicity has been introduced to describe the emergence of magnetization due to time-dependent electric polarization in non-ferromagnetic materials7,8. In simple terms, the coherent rotating motion of the ions in a crystal induces a magnetic moment along the axis of rotation. Here we provide experimental evidence of room-temperature magnetization in the archetypal paraelectric perovskite SrTiO3 due to this mechanism. We resonantly drive the infrared-active soft phonon mode with an intense circularly polarized terahertz electric field and detect the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. A simple model, which includes two coupled nonlinear oscillators whose forces and couplings are derived with ab initio calculations using self-consistent phonon theory at a finite temperature9, reproduces qualitatively our experimental observations. A quantitatively correct magnitude was obtained for the effect by also considering the phonon analogue of the reciprocal of the Einstein–de Haas effect, which is also called the Barnett effect, in which the total angular momentum from the phonon order is transferred to the electronic one. Our findings show a new path for the control of magnetism, for example, for ultrafast magnetic switches, by coherently controlling the lattice vibrations with light. We demonstrate the emergence of magnetism induced by a terahertz electric field in SrTiO3.",

    "abstract": "Horses revolutionized human history with fast mobility1. However, the timeline between their domestication and their widespread integration as a means of transport remains contentious2–4. Here we assemble a collection of 475 ancient horse genomes to assess the period when these animals were first reshaped by human agency in Eurasia. We find that reproductive control of the modern domestic lineage emerged around 2200 bce, through close-kin mating and shortened generation times. Reproductive control emerged following a severe domestication bottleneck starting no earlier than approximately 2700 bce, and coincided with a sudden expansion across Eurasia that ultimately resulted in the replacement of nearly every local horse lineage. This expansion marked the rise of widespread horse-based mobility in human history, which refutes the commonly held narrative of large horse herds accompanying the massive migration of steppe peoples across Europe around 3000 bce and earlier3,5. Finally, we detect significantly shortened generation times at Botai around 3500 bce, a settlement from central Asia associated with corrals and a subsistence economy centred on horses6,7. This supports local horse husbandry before the rise of modern domestic bloodlines. Analyses of 475 ancient horse genomes show modern horses emerged around 2200 bce, coinciding with sudden expansion across Eurasia, refuting the narrative of large horse herds accompanying earlier migrations of steppe peoples across Europe.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a leading risk factor for progression and metastasis of many cancers1,2, yet can in some cases enhance survival3–5 and responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti-PD-1, which targets PD-1 (encoded by PDCD1), an inhibitory receptor expressed on immune cells6–8. Although obesity promotes chronic inflammation, the role of the immune system in the obesity–cancer connection and immunotherapy remains unclear. It has been shown that in addition to T cells, macrophages can express PD-19–12. Here we found that obesity selectively induced PD-1 expression on tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). Type I inflammatory cytokines and molecules linked to obesity, including interferon-γ, tumour necrosis factor, leptin, insulin and palmitate, induced macrophage PD-1 expression in an mTORC1- and glycolysis-dependent manner. PD-1 then provided negative feedback to TAMs that suppressed glycolysis, phagocytosis and T cell stimulatory potential. Conversely, PD-1 blockade increased the level of macrophage glycolysis, which was essential for PD-1 inhibition to augment TAM expression of CD86 and major histocompatibility complex I and II molecules and ability to activate T cells. Myeloid-specific PD-1 deficiency slowed tumour growth, enhanced TAM glycolysis and antigen-presentation capability, and led to increased CD8+ T cell activity with a reduced level of markers of exhaustion. These findings show that obesity-associated metabolic signalling and inflammatory cues cause TAMs to induce PD-1 expression, which then drives a TAM-specific feedback mechanism that impairs tumour immune surveillance. This may contribute to increased cancer risk yet improved response to PD-1 immunotherapy in obesity. A study demonstrates that metabolic signalling and inflammatory cues associated with obesity selectively induce expression of PD-1 on tumour-associated macrophages to suppress anti-tumour immunity.",

    "abstract": "The fabrication of scalable all-perovskite tandem solar cells is considered an attractive route to commercialize perovskite photovoltaic modules1. However, the certified efficiency of 1-cm2-scale all-perovskite tandem solar cells lags behind their small-area (approximately 0.05-cm2) counterparts2,3. This performance deficit originates from inhomogeneity in wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at a large scale. The inhomogeneity is known to be introduced at the bottom interface and within the perovskite bulk itself4,5. Here we uncover another crucial source for the inhomogeneity—the top interface formed during the deposition of the electron transport layer (ETL; C60). Meanwhile, the poor ETL interface is also a notable limitation of device performance. We address this issue by introducing a mixture of 4-fluorophenethylamine (F-PEA) and 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA) to create a tailored 2D perovskite layer (TTDL), in which F-PEA forms a 2D perovskite at the surface, reducing contact losses and inhomogeneity, and CF3-PA enhances charge extraction and transport. As a result, we demonstrate a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.35 V and an efficiency of 20.5% in 1.77-eV WBG PSCs at a square-centimetre scale. By stacking with a narrow-bandgap (NBG) perovskite subcell, we report 1.05-cm2 all-perovskite tandem cells delivering 28.5% (certified 28.2%) efficiency, the highest reported so far. Our work showcases the importance of treating the top perovskite/ETL contact for upscaling PSCs. Using a mixture of 4-fluorophenethylamine and 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium to create a tailored 2D perovskite layer reduces the inhomogeneity at the top interface of all-perovskite tandem cells and results in the highest efficiency reported so far.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 infection requires nuclear entry of the viral genome. Previous evidence suggests that this entry proceeds through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), with the 120 × 60 nm capsid squeezing through an approximately 60-nm-wide central channel1 and crossing the permeability barrier of the NPC. This barrier can be described as an FG phase2 that is assembled from cohesively interacting phenylalanine–glycine (FG) repeats3 and is selectively permeable to cargo captured by nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). Here we show that HIV-1 capsid assemblies can target NPCs efficiently in an NTR-independent manner and bind directly to several types of FG repeats, including barrier-forming cohesive repeats. Like NTRs, the capsid readily partitions into an in vitro assembled cohesive FG phase that can serve as an NPC mimic and excludes much smaller inert probes such as mCherry. Indeed, entry of the capsid protein into such an FG phase is greatly enhanced by capsid assembly, which also allows the encapsulated clients to enter. Thus, our data indicate that the HIV-1 capsid behaves like an NTR, with its interior serving as a cargo container. Because capsid-coating with trans-acting NTRs would increase the diameter by 10 nm or more, we suggest that such a ‘self-translocating’ capsid undermines the size restrictions imposed by the NPC scaffold, thereby bypassing an otherwise effective barrier to viral infection. The HIV-1 capsid behaves like a nuclear transport receptor entering and traversing an FG phase, with its interior serving as a cargo container, bypassing an otherwise effective barrier to viral infection.",

    "abstract": "The human nervous system is a highly complex but organized organ. The foundation of its complexity and organization is laid down during regional patterning of the neural tube, the embryonic precursor to the human nervous system. Historically, studies of neural tube patterning have relied on animal models to uncover underlying principles. Recently, models of neurodevelopment based on human pluripotent stem cells, including neural organoids1–5 and bioengineered neural tube development models6–10, have emerged. However, such models fail to recapitulate neural patterning along both rostral–caudal and dorsal–ventral axes in a three-dimensional tubular geometry, a hallmark of neural tube development. Here we report a human pluripotent stem cell-based, microfluidic neural tube-like structure, the development of which recapitulates several crucial aspects of neural patterning in brain and spinal cord regions and along rostral–caudal and dorsal–ventral axes. This structure was utilized for studying neuronal lineage development, which revealed pre-patterning of axial identities of neural crest progenitors and functional roles of neuromesodermal progenitors and the caudal gene CDX2 in spinal cord and trunk neural crest development. We further developed dorsal–ventral patterned microfluidic forebrain-like structures with spatially segregated dorsal and ventral regions and layered apicobasal cellular organizations that mimic development of the human forebrain pallium and subpallium, respectively. Together, these microfluidics-based neurodevelopment models provide three-dimensional lumenal tissue architectures with in vivo-like spatiotemporal cell differentiation and organization, which will facilitate the study of human neurodevelopment and disease. Newly developed microfluidic neural tube-like and forebrain-like structures based on human pluripotent stem cells can model pivotal aspects of neural patterning along both the rostral–caudal and dorsal–ventral axes.",

    "abstract": "Building a fault-tolerant quantum computer will require vast numbers of physical qubits. For qubit technologies based on solid-state electronic devices1–3, integrating millions of qubits in a single processor will require device fabrication to reach a scale comparable to that of the modern complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) industry. Equally important, the scale of cryogenic device testing must keep pace to enable efficient device screening and to improve statistical metrics such as qubit yield and voltage variation. Spin qubits1,4,5 based on electrons in Si have shown impressive control fidelities6–9 but have historically been challenged by yield and process variation10–12. Here we present a testing process using a cryogenic 300-mm wafer prober13 to collect high-volume data on the performance of hundreds of industry-manufactured spin qubit devices at 1.6 K. This testing method provides fast feedback to enable optimization of the CMOS-compatible fabrication process, leading to high yield and low process variation. Using this system, we automate measurements of the operating point of spin qubits and investigate the transitions of single electrons across full wafers. We analyse the random variation in single-electron operating voltages and find that the optimized fabrication process leads to low levels of disorder at the 300-mm scale. Together, these results demonstrate the advances that can be achieved through the application of CMOS-industry techniques to the fabrication and measurement of spin qubit devices. Using a cryogenic 300-mm wafer prober, a new approach for the testing of hundreds of industry-manufactured spin qubit devices at 1.6 K provides high-volume data on performance, allowing optimization of the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible fabrication process.",

    "abstract": "Brain computation performed by billions of nerve cells relies on a sufficient and uninterrupted nutrient and oxygen supply1,2. Astrocytes, the ubiquitous glial neighbours of neurons, govern brain glucose uptake and metabolism3,4, but the exact mechanisms of metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes that ensure on-demand support of neuronal energy needs are not fully understood5,6. Here we show, using experimental in vitro and in vivo animal models, that neuronal activity-dependent metabolic activation of astrocytes is mediated by neuromodulator adenosine acting on astrocytic A2B receptors. Stimulation of A2B receptors recruits the canonical cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate–protein kinase A signalling pathway, leading to rapid activation of astrocyte glucose metabolism and the release of lactate, which supplements the extracellular pool of readily available energy substrates. Experimental mouse models involving conditional deletion of the gene encoding A2B receptors in astrocytes showed that adenosine-mediated metabolic signalling is essential for maintaining synaptic function, especially under conditions of high energy demand or reduced energy supply. Knockdown of A2B receptor expression in astrocytes led to a major reprogramming of brain energy metabolism, prevented synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, severely impaired recognition memory and disrupted sleep. These data identify the adenosine A2B receptor as an astrocytic sensor of neuronal activity and show that cAMP signalling in astrocytes tunes brain energy metabolism to support its fundamental functions such as sleep and memory. This study explores how adenosine A2B receptors can act as astrocytic sensors of brain metabolic activity and how cAMP signalling in astrocytes may support core brain functions such as sleep and memory.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of millions of people now interact with language models, with uses ranging from help with writing1,2 to informing hiring decisions3. However, these language models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making their judgements biased in problematic ways about groups such as African Americans4–7. Although previous research has focused on overt racism in language models, social scientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed over time, particularly in the United States after the civil rights movement8,9. It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the form of dialect prejudice, exhibiting raciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English (AAE) that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded. By contrast, the language models’ overt stereotypes about African Americans are more positive. Dialect prejudice has the potential for harmful consequences: language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of AAE be assigned less-prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes and be sentenced to death. Finally, we show that current practices of alleviating racial bias in language models, such as human preference alignment, exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes, by superficially obscuring the racism that language models maintain on a deeper level. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the fair and safe use of language technology. Despite efforts to remove overt racial prejudice, language models using artificial intelligence still show covert racism against speakers of African American English that is triggered by features of the dialect.",

    "abstract": "The continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2, particularly the emergence of the BA.2.86/JN.1 lineage replacing XBB, necessitates re-evaluation of vaccine compositions1–3. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the humoral immune response to XBB and JN.1 human exposure. We demonstrate the antigenic distinctiveness of XBB and JN.1 lineages in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals and show that infection with JN.1 elicits superior plasma neutralization against its subvariants. We highlight the strong immune evasion and receptor-binding capability of KP.3, supporting its foreseeable prevalence. Extensive analysis of the B cell receptor repertoire, in which we isolate approximately 2,000 receptor-binding-domain-specific antibodies, with targeting epitopes characterized by deep mutational scanning, underscores the superiority of JN.1-elicited memory B cells4,5. Class 1 IGHV3-53/3-66-derived neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are important contributors to the wild-type reactivity of NAbs against JN.1. However, KP.2 and KP.3 evade a substantial subset of these antibodies, even those induced by JN.1, supporting a need for booster updates. JN.1-induced Omicron-specific antibodies also demonstrate high potency across Omicron. Escape hotspots for these NAbs have already been mutated, resulting in a higher immune barrier to escape and indicating probable recovery of escaped NAbs. In addition, the prevalence of IGHV3-53/3-66-derived antibodies and their ability to compete with all Omicron-specific NAbs suggests that they have an inhibitory effect on the activation of Omicron-specific naive B cells, potentially explaining the heavy immune imprinting in mRNA-vaccinated individuals6–8. These findings delineate the evolving antibody response to the antigenic shift of Omicron from XBB to JN.1 and highlight the importance of developing the JN.1 lineage, especially KP.2- and KP.3-based vaccine boosters. A deep mutational scanning approach identifies mutations that allow subvariants of the prevalent JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 strain to evade Omicron-induced neutralizing antibodies, indicating a need for careful monitoring of this lineage in vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease. Currently there are no effective methods that simultaneously prevent joint degeneration and reduce pain1. Although limited evidence suggests the existence of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) in chondrocytes2, their expression and function in chondrocytes and in OA remain essentially unknown. Here we identify Nav1.7 as an OA-associated VGSC and demonstrate that human OA chondrocytes express functional Nav1.7 channels, with a density of 0.1 to 0.15 channels per µm2 and 350 to 525 channels per cell. Serial genetic ablation of Nav1.7 in multiple mouse models demonstrates that Nav1.7 expressed in dorsal root ganglia neurons is involved in pain, whereas Nav1.7 in chondrocytes regulates OA progression. Pharmacological blockade of Nav1.7 with selective or clinically used pan-Nav channel blockers significantly ameliorates the progression of structural joint damage, and reduces OA pain behaviour. Mechanistically, Nav1.7 blockers regulate intracellular Ca2+ signalling and the chondrocyte secretome, which in turn affects chondrocyte biology and OA progression. Identification of Nav1.7 as a novel chondrocyte-expressed, OA-associated channel uncovers a dual target for the development of disease-modifying and non-opioid pain relief treatment for OA. The voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 has a dual role in osteoarthritis—in chondrocytes, it promotes joint damage, and in dorsal root ganglia neurons, it increases pain transmission.",

    "abstract": "To coordinate cellular physiology, eukaryotic cells rely on the rapid exchange of molecules at specialized organelle–organelle contact sites1,2. Endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondrial contact sites (ERMCSs) are particularly vital communication hubs, playing key roles in the exchange of signalling molecules, lipids and metabolites3,4. ERMCSs are maintained by interactions between complementary tethering molecules on the surface of each organelle5,6. However, due to the extreme sensitivity of these membrane interfaces to experimental perturbation7,8, a clear understanding of their nanoscale organization and regulation is still lacking. Here we combine three-dimensional electron microscopy with high-speed molecular tracking of a model organelle tether, Vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein B (VAPB), to map the structure and diffusion landscape of ERMCSs. We uncovered dynamic subdomains within VAPB contact sites that correlate with ER membrane curvature and undergo rapid remodelling. We show that VAPB molecules enter and leave ERMCSs within seconds, despite the contact site itself remaining stable over much longer time scales. This metastability allows ERMCSs to remodel with changes in the physiological environment to accommodate metabolic needs of the cell. An amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated mutation in VAPB perturbs these subdomains, likely impairing their remodelling capacity and resulting in impaired interorganelle communication. These results establish high-speed single-molecule imaging as a new tool for mapping the structure of contact site interfaces and reveal that the diffusion landscape of VAPB at contact sites is a crucial component of ERMCS homeostasis. High-speed molecular tracking is integrated with three-dimensional electron microscopy to map the diffusion distribution and ultrastructure of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites, revealing the ability of high-speed single-molecule imaging to map contact site interface structures and corresponding diffusion landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are a revolutionary light-emitting display technology that has been successfully commercialized in mobile phones and televisions1,2. The injected charges form both singlet and triplet excitons, and for high efficiency it is important to enable triplets as well as singlets to emit light. At present, materials that harvest triplets by thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are a very active field of research as an alternative to phosphorescent emitters that usually use heavy metal atoms3,4. Although excellent progress has been made, in most TADF OLEDs there is a severe decrease of efficiency as the drive current is increased, known as efficiency roll-off. So far, much of the literature suggests that efficiency roll-off should be reduced by minimizing the energy difference between singlet and triplet excited states (ΔEST) to maximize the rate of conversion of triplets to singlets by means of reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC)5–20. We analyse the efficiency roll-off in a wide range of TADF OLEDs and find that neither of these parameters fully accounts for the reported efficiency roll-off. By considering the dynamic equilibrium between singlets and triplets in TADF materials, we propose a figure of merit for materials design to reduce efficiency roll-off and discuss its correlation with reported data of TADF OLEDs. Our new figure of merit will guide the design and development of TADF materials that can reduce efficiency roll-off. It will help improve the efficiency of TADF OLEDs at realistic display operating conditions and expand the use of TADF materials to applications that require high brightness, such as lighting, augmented reality and lasing. Efficiency roll-off in a wide range of TADF OLEDs is analysed and a figure of merit proposed for materials design to improve efficiency at high brightness, potentially expanding the range of applications of TADF materials.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine (Tyr) residues evolved in metazoan organisms as a mechanism of coordinating tissue growth1. Multicellular eukaryotes typically have more than 50 distinct protein Tyr kinases that catalyse the phosphorylation of thousands of Tyr residues throughout the proteome1–3. How a given Tyr kinase can phosphorylate a specific subset of proteins at unique Tyr sites is only partially understood4–7. Here we used combinatorial peptide arrays to profile the substrate sequence specificity of all human Tyr kinases. Globally, the Tyr kinases demonstrate considerable diversity in optimal patterns of residues surrounding the site of phosphorylation, revealing the functional organization of the human Tyr kinome by substrate motif preference. Using this information, Tyr kinases that are most compatible with phosphorylating any Tyr site can be identified. Analysis of mass spectrometry phosphoproteomic datasets using this compendium of kinase specificities accurately identifies specific Tyr kinases that are dysregulated in cells after stimulation with growth factors, treatment with anti-cancer drugs or expression of oncogenic variants. Furthermore, the topology of known Tyr signalling networks naturally emerged from a comparison of the sequence specificities of the Tyr kinases and the SH2 phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-binding domains. Finally we show that the intrinsic substrate specificity of Tyr kinases has remained fundamentally unchanged from worms to humans, suggesting that the fidelity between Tyr kinases and their protein substrate sequences has been maintained across hundreds of millions of years of evolution. An atlas of the substrate specificities for the human tyrosine kinome reveals diversity of motif specificities and enables identification of kinase–substrate relationships and kinase regulation in phosphoproteomics experiments.",

    "abstract": "Increasing rates of autoimmune and inflammatory disease present a burgeoning threat to human health1. This is compounded by the limited efficacy of available treatments1 and high failure rates during drug development2, highlighting an urgent need to better understand disease mechanisms. Here we show how functional genomics could address this challenge. By investigating an intergenic haplotype on chr21q22—which has been independently linked to inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and Takayasu’s arteritis3–6—we identify that the causal gene, ETS2, is a central regulator of human inflammatory macrophages and delineate the shared disease mechanism that amplifies ETS2 expression. Genes regulated by ETS2 were prominently expressed in diseased tissues and more enriched for inflammatory bowel disease GWAS hits than most previously described pathways. Overexpressing ETS2 in resting macrophages reproduced the inflammatory state observed in chr21q22-associated diseases, with upregulation of multiple drug targets, including TNF and IL-23. Using a database of cellular signatures7, we identified drugs that might modulate this pathway and validated the potent anti-inflammatory activity of one class of small molecules in vitro and ex vivo. Together, this illustrates the power of functional genomics, applied directly in primary human cells, to identify immune-mediated disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic opportunities. ETS2—which is associated with inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and Takayasu’s arteritis—is a central regulator of human inflammatory macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) wireless communication holds immense potential to revolutionize future 6G to XG networks with high capacity, low latency and extensive connectivity. Efficient THz beamformers are essential for energy-efficient connections, compensating path loss, optimizing resource usage and enhancing spectral efficiency. However, current beamformers face several challenges, including notable loss, limited bandwidth, constrained spatial coverage and poor integration with on-chip THz circuits. Here we present an on-chip broadband THz topological beamformer using valley vortices for waveguiding, splitting and perfect isolation in waveguide phased arrays, featuring 184 densely packed valley-locked waveguides, 54 power splitters and 136 sharp bends. Leveraging neural-network-assisted inverse design, the beamformer achieves complete 360° azimuthal beamforming with gains of up to 20 dBi, radiating THz signals into free space with customizable user-defined beams. Photoexciting the all-silicon beamformer enables reconfigurable control of THz beams. The low-loss and broadband beamformer enables a 72-Gbps chip-to-chip wireless link over 300 mm and eight simultaneous 40-Gbps wireless links. Using four of these links, we demonstrate point-to-4-point real-time HD video streaming. Our work provides a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible THz topological photonic integrated circuit for efficient large-scale beamforming, enabling massive single-input multiple-output and multiple-input and multiple-output systems for terabit-per-second 6G to XG wireless communications. An on-chip topological beamformer for multi-link terahertz 6G to XG wireless communication achieves complete 360° azimuthal beamforming with gains of up to 20 dBi, radiating THz signals into free space with neural-network-driven customizable beams enabling up to eight simultaneous 40-Gbps wireless links.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation and tissue fibrosis co-exist and are causally linked to organ dysfunction1,2. However, the molecular mechanisms driving immune–fibroblast cell communication in human cardiac disease remain unexplored and there are at present no approved treatments that directly target cardiac fibrosis3,4. Here we performed multiomic single-cell gene expression, epitope mapping and chromatin accessibility profiling in 45 healthy donor, acutely infarcted and chronically failing human hearts. We identified a disease-associated fibroblast trajectory that diverged into distinct populations reminiscent of myofibroblasts and matrifibrocytes, the latter expressing fibroblast activator protein (FAP) and periostin (POSTN). Genetic lineage tracing of FAP+ fibroblasts in vivo showed that they contribute to the POSTN lineage but not the myofibroblast lineage. We assessed the applicability of experimental systems to model cardiac fibroblasts and demonstrated that three different in vivo mouse models of cardiac injury were superior compared with cultured human heart and dermal fibroblasts in recapitulating the human disease phenotype. Ligand–receptor analysis and spatial transcriptomics predicted that interactions between C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) macrophages and fibroblasts mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signalling drove the emergence of FAP/POSTN fibroblasts within spatially defined niches. In vivo, we deleted the IL-1 receptor on fibroblasts and the IL-1β ligand in CCR2+ monocytes and macrophages, and inhibited IL-1β signalling using a monoclonal antibody, and showed reduced FAP/POSTN fibroblasts, diminished myocardial fibrosis and improved cardiac function. These findings highlight the broader therapeutic potential of targeting inflammation to treat tissue fibrosis and preserve organ function. A fibroblast lineage marked by FAP gives rise to POSTN-expressing fibroblasts resembling matrifibrocytes and IL-1β regulates FAP/POSTN fibroblast specification by directly signalling to cardiac fibroblasts, highlighting a role for immunomodulators in targeting cardiac fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "High-capacity storage technologies are needed to meet our ever-growing data demands1,2. However, data centres based on major storage technologies such as semiconductor flash devices and hard disk drives have high energy burdens, high operation costs and short lifespans2,3. Optical data storage (ODS) presents a promising solution for cost-effective long-term archival data storage. Nonetheless, ODS has been limited by its low capacity and the challenge of increasing its areal density4,5. Here, to address these issues, we increase the capacity of ODS to the petabit level by extending the planar recording architecture to three dimensions with hundreds of layers, meanwhile breaking the optical diffraction limit barrier of the recorded spots. We develop an optical recording medium based on a photoresist film doped with aggregation-induced emission dye, which can be optically stimulated by femtosecond laser beams. This film is highly transparent and uniform, and the aggregation-induced emission phenomenon provides the storage mechanism. It can also be inhibited by another deactivating beam, resulting in a recording spot with a super-resolution scale. This technology makes it possible to achieve exabit-level storage by stacking nanoscale disks into arrays, which is essential in big data centres with limited space. Optical nanoscale disk memory with petabit-level capacity is developed by extending the recording architecture to three dimensions with hundreds of layers, and exabit-level storage can be achieved by stacking the disks into arrays.",

Here we report interim analyses of a first-in-human, phase 1/2, open-label, dose-optimization study and an extension study evaluating the safety and efficacy of mRNA-3927, a dual mRNA therapy encoding PCCA and PCCB. As of 31 May 2023, 16 participants were enrolled across 5 dose cohorts. Twelve of the 16 participants completed the dose-optimization study and enrolled in the extension study. A total of 346 intravenous doses of mRNA-3927 were administered over a total of 15.69 person-years of treatment. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 15 out of the 16 (93.8%) participants. Preliminary analysis suggests an increase in the exposure to mRNA-3927 with dose escalation, and a 70% reduction in the risk of metabolic decompensation events among 8 participants who reported them in the 12-month pretreatment period. Interim data from a clinical trial of mRNA-3927—an mRNA therapeutic for propionic acidaemia—provide early indications of the safety and efficacy of the treatment, and suggest that this approach might be applicable to other rare diseases.",

    "abstract": "Emissions reduction and greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere are both necessary to achieve net-zero emissions and limit climate change1. There is thus a need for improved sorbents for the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a process known as direct air capture. In particular, low-cost materials that can be regenerated at low temperatures would overcome the limitations of current technologies. In this work, we introduce a new class of designer sorbent materials known as ‘charged-sorbents’. These materials are prepared through a battery-like charging process that accumulates ions in the pores of low-cost activated carbons, with the inserted ions then serving as sites for carbon dioxide adsorption. We use our charging process to accumulate reactive hydroxide ions in the pores of a carbon electrode, and find that the resulting sorbent material can rapidly capture carbon dioxide from ambient air by means of (bi)carbonate formation. Unlike traditional bulk carbonates, charged-sorbent regeneration can be achieved at low temperatures (90–100 °C) and the sorbent’s conductive nature permits direct Joule heating regeneration2,3 using renewable electricity. Given their highly tailorable pore environments and low cost, we anticipate that charged-sorbents will find numerous potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis and beyond. Charged-sorbents are a new class of designer sorbent materials for the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and can be regenerated at low temperatures with direct heating generation using renewable electricity.",

    "abstract": "Caloric restriction extends healthy lifespan in multiple species1. Intermittent fasting, an alternative form of dietary restriction, is potentially more sustainable in humans, but its effectiveness remains largely unexplored2–8. Identifying the most efficacious forms of dietary restriction is key for developing interventions to improve human health and longevity9. Here we performed an extensive assessment of graded levels of caloric restriction (20% and 40%) and intermittent fasting (1 and 2 days fasting per week) on the health and survival of 960 genetically diverse female mice. We show that caloric restriction and intermittent fasting both resulted in lifespan extension in proportion to the degree of restriction. Lifespan was heritable and genetics had a larger influence on lifespan than dietary restriction. The strongest trait associations with lifespan included retention of body weight through periods of handling—an indicator of stress resilience, high lymphocyte proportion, low red blood cell distribution width and high adiposity in late life. Health effects differed between interventions and exhibited inconsistent relationships with lifespan extension. 40% caloric restriction had the strongest lifespan extension effect but led to a loss of lean mass and changes in the immune repertoire that could confer susceptibility to infections. Intermittent fasting did not extend the lifespan of mice with high pre-intervention body weight, and two-day intermittent fasting was associated with disruption of erythroid cell populations. Metabolic responses to dietary restriction, including reduced adiposity and lower fasting glucose, were not associated with increased lifespan, suggesting that dietary restriction does more than just counteract the negative effects of obesity. Our findings indicate that improving health and extending lifespan are not synonymous and raise questions about which end points are the most relevant for evaluating aging interventions in preclinical models and clinical trials. Health effects of dietary restriction are uncoupled from longevity.",

    "abstract": "By directly altering microscopic interactions, pressure provides a powerful tuning knob for the exploration of condensed phases and geophysical phenomena1. The megabar regime represents an interesting frontier, in which recent discoveries include high-temperature superconductors, as well as structural and valence phase transitions2–6. However, at such high pressures, many conventional measurement techniques fail. Here we demonstrate the ability to perform local magnetometry inside a diamond anvil cell with sub-micron spatial resolution at megabar pressures. Our approach uses a shallow layer of nitrogen-vacancy colour centres implanted directly within the anvil7–9; crucially, we choose a crystal cut compatible with the intrinsic symmetries of the nitrogen-vacancy centre to enable functionality at megabar pressures. We apply our technique to characterize a recently discovered hydride superconductor, CeH9 (ref. 10). By performing simultaneous magnetometry and electrical transport measurements, we observe the dual signatures of superconductivity: diamagnetism characteristic of the Meissner effect and a sharp drop of the resistance to near zero. By locally mapping both the diamagnetic response and flux trapping, we directly image the geometry of superconducting regions, showing marked inhomogeneities at the micron scale. Our work brings quantum sensing to the megabar frontier and enables the closed-loop optimization of superhydride materials synthesis. In order to explore superconductivity in hydride materials, local magnetometry inside a diamond anvil cell is performed with sub-micron spatial resolution at megabar pressures using nitrogen-vacancy colour centres.",

    "abstract": "The fungus Candida albicans frequently colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract, from which it can disseminate to cause systemic disease. This polymorphic species can transition between growing as single-celled yeast and as multicellular hyphae to adapt to its environment. The current dogma of C. albicans commensalism is that the yeast form is optimal for gut colonization, whereas hyphal cells are detrimental to colonization but critical for virulence1–3. Here, we reveal that this paradigm does not apply to multi-kingdom communities in which a complex interplay between fungal morphology and bacteria dictates C. albicans fitness. Thus, whereas yeast-locked cells outcompete wild-type cells when gut bacteria are absent or depleted by antibiotics, hyphae-competent wild-type cells outcompete yeast-locked cells in hosts with replete bacterial populations. This increased fitness of wild-type cells involves the production of hyphal-specific factors including the toxin candidalysin4,5, which promotes the establishment of colonization. At later time points, adaptive immunity is engaged, and intestinal immunoglobulin A preferentially selects against hyphal cells1,6. Hyphal morphotypes are thus under both positive and negative selective pressures in the gut. Our study further shows that candidalysin has a direct inhibitory effect on bacterial species, including limiting their metabolic output. We therefore propose that C. albicans has evolved hyphal-specific factors, including candidalysin, to better compete with bacterial species in the intestinal niche. Both the yeast and hyphal forms of Candida albicans enable colonization of the mammalian gut, with hyphal cells secreting the toxin candidalysin to inihibit bacteria and support fungal commensalism.",

    "abstract": "Muscle atrophy and functional decline (sarcopenia) are common manifestations of frailty and are critical contributors to morbidity and mortality in older people1. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying sarcopenia has major implications for understanding human ageing2. Yet, progress has been slow, partly due to the difficulties of characterizing skeletal muscle niche heterogeneity (whereby myofibres are the most abundant) and obtaining well-characterized human samples3,4. Here we generate a single-cell/single-nucleus transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility map of human limb skeletal muscles encompassing over 387,000 cells/nuclei from individuals aged 15 to 99 years with distinct fitness and frailty levels. We describe how cell populations change during ageing, including the emergence of new populations in older people, and the cell-specific and multicellular network features (at the transcriptomic and epigenetic levels) associated with these changes. On the basis of cross-comparison with genetic data, we also identify key elements of chromatin architecture that mark susceptibility to sarcopenia. Our study provides a basis for identifying targets in the skeletal muscle that are amenable to medical, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions in late life. The Human Muscle Ageing Cell Atlas provides a series of integrated cellular and molecular explanations for sarcopenia and frailty development in advanced ages.",

    "abstract": "QS-21 is a potent vaccine adjuvant and remains the only saponin-based adjuvant that has been clinically approved for use in humans1,2. However, owing to the complex structure of QS-21, its availability is limited. Today, the supply depends on laborious extraction from the Chilean soapbark tree or on low-yielding total chemical synthesis3,4. Here we demonstrate the complete biosynthesis of QS-21 and its precursors, as well as structural derivatives, in engineered yeast strains. The successful biosynthesis in yeast requires fine-tuning of the host’s native pathway fluxes, as well as the functional and balanced expression of 38 heterologous enzymes. The required biosynthetic pathway spans seven enzyme families—a terpene synthase, P450s, nucleotide sugar synthases, glycosyltransferases, a coenzyme A ligase, acyl transferases and polyketide synthases—from six organisms, and mimics in yeast the subcellular compartmentalization of plants from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to the cytosol. Finally, by taking advantage of the promiscuity of certain pathway enzymes, we produced structural analogues of QS-21 using this biosynthetic platform. This microbial production scheme will allow for the future establishment of a structure–activity relationship, and will thus enable the rational design of potent vaccine adjuvants. QS-21—an FDA-approved vaccine adjuvant—and several structural analogues of QS-21 can be synthesized in engineered yeast strains, and this process is much less laborious compared with the conventional mode of extraction from the Chilean soapbark tree.",

    "abstract": "Cement production causes 7.5% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, arising from limestone decarbonation and fossil-fuel combustion1–3. Current decarbonation strategies include substituting Portland clinker with supplementary materials, but these mainly arise in emitting processes, developing alternative binders but none yet promises scale, or adopting carbon capture and storage that still releases some emissions4–8. However, used cement is potentially an abundant, decarbonated feedstock. Here we show that recovered cement paste can be reclinkered if used as a partial substitute for the lime–dolomite flux used in steel recycling nowadays. The resulting slag can meet existing specifications for Portland clinker and can be blended effectively with calcined clay and limestone. The process is sensitive to the silica content of the recovered cement paste, and silica and alumina that may come from the scrap, but this can be adjusted easily. We show that the proposed process may be economically competitive, and if powered by emissions-free electricity, can lead to zero emissions cement while also reducing the emissions of steel recycling by reducing lime flux requirements. The global supply of scrap steel for recycling may treble by 2050, and it is likely that more slag can be made per unit of steel recycled. With material efficiency in construction9,10, future global cement requirements could be met by this route. Recovered cement paste can be reclinkered if used as a partial substitute for the lime–dolomite flux used in steel recycling, which can reduce waste and carbon emissions.",

    "abstract": "Senescence is a cellular state linked to ageing and age-onset disease across many mammalian species1,2. Acutely, senescent cells promote wound healing3,4 and prevent tumour formation5; but they are also pro-inflammatory, thus chronically exacerbate tissue decline. Whereas senescent cells are active targets for anti-ageing therapy6–11, why these cells form in vivo, how they affect tissue ageing and the effect of their elimination remain unclear12,13. Here we identify naturally occurring senescent glia in ageing Drosophila brains and decipher their origin and influence. Using Activator protein 1 (AP1) activity to screen for senescence14,15, we determine that senescent glia can appear in response to neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction. In turn, senescent glia promote lipid accumulation in non-senescent glia; similar effects are seen in senescent human fibroblasts in culture. Targeting AP1 activity in senescent glia mitigates senescence biomarkers, extends fly lifespan and health span, and prevents lipid accumulation. However, these benefits come at the cost of increased oxidative damage in the brain, and neuronal mitochondrial function remains poor. Altogether, our results map the trajectory of naturally occurring senescent glia in vivo and indicate that these cells link key ageing phenomena: mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid accumulation. The authors identify naturally occurring senescent glia in aged Drosophila brains and decipher their origin and influence, determining that they can appear in response to neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction and that they promote lipid accumulation, indicating that these cells link key ageing phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Plastic production reached 400 million tons in 2022 (ref. 1), with packaging and single-use plastics accounting for a substantial amount of this2. The resulting waste ends up in landfills, incineration or the environment, contributing to environmental pollution3. Shifting to biodegradable and compostable plastics is increasingly being considered as an efficient waste-management alternative4. Although polylactide (PLA) is the most widely used biosourced polymer5, its biodegradation rate under home-compost and soil conditions remains low6–8. Here we present a PLA-based plastic in which an optimized enzyme is embedded to ensure rapid biodegradation and compostability at room temperature, using a scalable industrial process. First, an 80-fold activity enhancement was achieved through structure-based rational engineering of a new hyperthermostable PLA hydrolase. Second, the enzyme was uniformly dispersed within the PLA matrix by means of a masterbatch-based melt extrusion process. The liquid enzyme formulation was incorporated in polycaprolactone, a low-melting-temperature polymer, through melt extrusion at 70 °C, forming an ‘enzymated’ polycaprolactone masterbatch. Masterbatch pellets were integrated into PLA by melt extrusion at 160 °C, producing an enzymated PLA film (0.02% w/w enzyme) that fully disintegrated under home-compost conditions within 20–24 weeks, meeting home-composting standards. The mechanical and degradation properties of the enzymated film were compatible with industrial packaging applications, and they remained intact during long-term storage. This innovative material not only opens new avenues for composters and biomethane production but also provides a feasible industrial solution for PLA degradation. Embedding of a new engineered thermostable hydrolase into polymer materials enables the production of biodegradable and home-compostable plastics suitable for industrial packaging applications.",

    "abstract": "Observationally, kilonovae are astrophysical transients powered by the radioactive decay of nuclei heavier than iron, thought to be synthesized in the merger of two compact objects1–4. Over the first few days, the kilonova evolution is dominated by a large number of radioactive isotopes contributing to the heating rate2,5. On timescales of weeks to months, its behaviour is predicted to differ depending on the ejecta composition and the merger remnant6–8. Previous work has shown that the kilonova associated with gamma-ray burst 230307A is similar to kilonova AT2017gfo (ref. 9), and mid-infrared spectra revealed an emission line at 2.15 micrometres that was attributed to tellurium. Here we report a multi-wavelength analysis, including publicly available James Webb Space Telescope data9 and our own Hubble Space Telescope data, for the same gamma-ray burst. We model its evolution up to two months after the burst and show that, at these late times, the recession of the photospheric radius and the rapidly decaying bolometric luminosity (Lbol ∝ t−2.7±0.4, where t is time) support the recombination of lanthanide-rich ejecta as they cool. A modelling analysis shows that an unusually long gamma-ray burst gave rise to a lanthanide-rich kilonova following the merger of a neutron star–neutron star or of a neutron star–black hole.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary processes that underlie the marked sensitivity of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to chemotherapy and rapid relapse are unknown1–3. Here we determined tumour phylogenies at diagnosis and throughout chemotherapy and immunotherapy by multiregion sequencing of 160 tumours from 65 patients. Treatment-naive SCLC exhibited clonal homogeneity at distinct tumour sites, whereas first-line platinum-based chemotherapy led to a burst in genomic intratumour heterogeneity and spatial clonal diversity. We observed branched evolution and a shift to ancestral clones underlying tumour relapse. Effective radio- or immunotherapy induced a re-expansion of founder clones with acquired genomic damage from first-line chemotherapy. Whereas TP53 and RB1 alterations were exclusively part of the common ancestor, MYC family amplifications were frequently not constituents of the founder clone. At relapse, emerging subclonal mutations affected key genes associated with SCLC biology, and tumours harbouring clonal CREBBP/EP300 alterations underwent genome duplications. Gene-damaging TP53 alterations and co-alterations of TP53 missense mutations with TP73, CREBBP/EP300 or FMN2 were significantly associated with shorter disease relapse following chemotherapy. In summary, we uncover key processes of the genomic evolution of SCLC under therapy, identify the common ancestor as the source of clonal diversity at relapse and show central genomic patterns associated with sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy. We uncover key processes of the genomic evolution of small cell lung cancer under therapy, identify the common ancestor as the source of clonal diversity at relapse and show central genomic patterns associated with drug response.",

    "abstract": "Growing concern surrounds the impact of social media platforms on public discourse1–4 and their influence on social dynamics5–9, especially in the context of toxicity10–12. Here, to better understand these phenomena, we use a comparative approach to isolate human behavioural patterns across multiple social media platforms. In particular, we analyse conversations in different online communities, focusing on identifying consistent patterns of toxic content. Drawing from an extensive dataset that spans eight platforms over 34 years—from Usenet to contemporary social media—our findings show consistent conversation patterns and user behaviour, irrespective of the platform, topic or time. Notably, although long conversations consistently exhibit higher toxicity, toxic language does not invariably discourage people from participating in a conversation, and toxicity does not necessarily escalate as discussions evolve. Our analysis suggests that debates and contrasting sentiments among users significantly contribute to more intense and hostile discussions. Moreover, the persistence of these patterns across three decades, despite changes in platforms and societal norms, underscores the pivotal role of human behaviour in shaping online discourse. Long conversations online consistently exhibit higher toxicity, yet toxic language does not invariably discourage people from participating in a conversation, and toxicity does not necessarily escalate as discussions evolve.",

Following these early events, some neurons acquired an inflammatory phenotype involving activation of TLR9 signalling and accumulation of centrosomal DNA damage repair complexes6. Neuron-specific knockdown of Tlr9 impaired memory while blunting contextual fear conditioning-induced changes of gene expression in specific clusters of excitatory CA1 neurons. Notably, TLR9 had an essential role in centrosome function, including DNA damage repair, ciliogenesis and build-up of perineuronal nets. We demonstrate a novel cascade of learning-induced molecular events in discrete neuronal clusters undergoing dsDNA damage and TLR9-mediated repair, resulting in their recruitment to memory circuits. With compromised TLR9 function, this fundamental memory mechanism becomes a gateway to genomic instability and cognitive impairments implicated in accelerated senescence, psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. Maintaining the integrity of TLR9 inflammatory signalling thus emerges as a promising preventive strategy for neurocognitive deficits. Learning results in persistent double-stranded DNA breaks, nuclear rupture and release of DNA fragments and histones within hippocampal CA1 neurons that, following TLR9-mediated DNA damage repair, results in their recruitment to memory circuits.",

However, it is an intrinsically ultraviolet faint galaxy, in the range of those now thought to drive the reionization of the Universe2–4. Hitherto the smallest features resolved in a galaxy at a comparable redshift are between a few hundreds and a few tens of parsecs (pc)5,6. Here we report JWST observations of the Cosmic Gems. The light of the galaxy is resolved into five star clusters located in a region smaller than 70 pc. They exhibit minimal dust attenuation and low metallicity, ages younger than 50 Myr and intrinsic masses of about 106M⊙. Their lensing-corrected sizes are approximately 1 pc, resulting in stellar surface densities near 105M⊙ pc−2, three orders of magnitude higher than typical young star clusters in the local Universe7. Despite the uncertainties inherent to the lensing model, they are consistent with being gravitationally bound stellar systems, that is, proto-globular clusters. We conclude that star cluster formation and feedback likely contributed to shaping the properties of galaxies during the epoch of reionization. JWST observations of the Cosmic Gems arc resolve the light of an infant galaxy into five gravitationally bound star clusters located in a region smaller than 70 pc.",

    "abstract": "The most successful obesity therapeutics, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists, cause aversive responses such as nausea and vomiting1,2, effects that may contribute to their efficacy. Here, we investigated the brain circuits that link satiety to aversion, and unexpectedly discovered that the neural circuits mediating these effects are functionally separable. Systematic investigation across drug-accessible GLP1R populations revealed that only hindbrain neurons are required for the efficacy of GLP1-based obesity drugs. In vivo two-photon imaging of hindbrain GLP1R neurons demonstrated that most neurons are tuned to either nutritive or aversive stimuli, but not both. Furthermore, simultaneous imaging of hindbrain subregions indicated that area postrema (AP) GLP1R neurons are broadly responsive, whereas nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) GLP1R neurons are biased towards nutritive stimuli. Strikingly, separate manipulation of these populations demonstrated that activation of NTSGLP1R neurons triggers satiety in the absence of aversion, whereas activation of APGLP1R neurons triggers strong aversion with food intake reduction. Anatomical and behavioural analyses revealed that NTSGLP1R and APGLP1R neurons send projections to different downstream brain regions to drive satiety and aversion, respectively. Importantly, GLP1R agonists reduce food intake even when the aversion pathway is inhibited. Overall, these findings highlight NTSGLP1R neurons as a population that could be selectively targeted to promote weight loss while avoiding the adverse side effects that limit treatment adherence. The neural circuits in the hindbrain that link satiety and aversion are shown to be separate, raising the possibility of developing obesity drugs without the common side effects of nausea and vomiting.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, perovskite has been widely adopted in series-connected monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs) to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction solar cells. Perovskite–organic TSCs, comprising a wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cell (pero-SC) as the front cell and a narrow-bandgap organic solar cell (OSC) as the rear cell, have recently drawn attention owing to the good stability and potential high power conversion efficiency (PCE)1–4. However, WBG pero-SCs usually exhibit higher voltage losses than regular pero-SCs, which limits the performance of TSCs5,6. One of the main obstacles comes from interfacial recombination at the perovskite–C60 interface, and it is important to develop effective surface passivation strategies to pursue higher PCE of perovskite–organic TSCs7. Here we exploit a new surface passivator cyclohexane 1,4-diammonium diiodide (CyDAI2), which naturally contains two isomeric structures with ammonium groups on the same or opposite sides of the hexane ring (denoted as cis-CyDAI2 and trans-CyDAI2, respectively), and the two isomers demonstrate completely different surface interaction behaviours. The cis-CyDAI2 passivation treatment reduces the quasi-Fermi-level splitting–open circuit voltage (Voc) mismatch of the WBG pero-SCs with a bandgap of 1.88 eV and enhanced its Voc to 1.36 V. Combining the cis-CyDAI2-treated perovskite and the organic active layer with a narrow bandgap of 1.27 eV, the constructed monolithic perovskite–organic TSC demonstrates a PCE of 26.4% (certified as 25.7%). A new surface passivator cyclohexane 1,4-diammonium diiodide naturally contains two isomeric structures with ammonium groups on the same or opposite sides of the hexane ring, and the two isomers demonstrate completely different surface interaction behaviours.",

    "abstract": "The loss of the tail is among the most notable anatomical changes to have occurred along the evolutionary lineage leading to humans and to the ‘anthropomorphous apes’1–3, with a proposed role in contributing to human bipedalism4–6. Yet, the genetic mechanism that facilitated tail-loss evolution in hominoids remains unknown. Here we present evidence that an individual insertion of an Alu element in the genome of the hominoid ancestor may have contributed to tail-loss evolution. We demonstrate that this Alu element—inserted into an intron of the TBXT gene7–9—pairs with a neighbouring ancestral Alu element encoded in the reverse genomic orientation and leads to a hominoid-specific alternative splicing event. To study the effect of this splicing event, we generated multiple mouse models that express both full-length and exon-skipped isoforms of Tbxt, mimicking the expression pattern of its hominoid orthologue TBXT. Mice expressing both Tbxt isoforms exhibit a complete absence of the tail or a shortened tail depending on the relative abundance of Tbxt isoforms expressed at the embryonic tail bud. These results support the notion that the exon-skipped transcript is sufficient to induce a tail-loss phenotype. Moreover, mice expressing the exon-skipped Tbxt isoform develop neural tube defects, a condition that affects approximately 1 in 1,000 neonates in humans10. Thus, tail-loss evolution may have been associated with an adaptive cost of the potential for neural tube defects, which continue to affect human health today. An insertion of an Alu element into an intron of the TBXT gene is identified as a genetic mechanism of tail-loss evolution in humans and apes, with implications for human health today.",

    "abstract": "Calcium (Ca2+) is an essential nutrient for plants and a cellular signal, but excessive levels can be toxic and inhibit growth1,2. To thrive in dynamic environments, plants must monitor and maintain cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating numerous Ca2+ transporters3. Here we report two signalling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana that converge on the activation of vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchangers (CAXs) to scavenge excess cytosolic Ca2+ in plants. One mechanism, activated in response to an elevated external Ca2+ level, entails calcineurin B-like (CBL) Ca2+ sensors and CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs), which activate CAXs by phosphorylating a serine (S) cluster in the auto-inhibitory domain. The second pathway, triggered by molecular patterns associated with microorganisms, engages the immune receptor complex FLS2–BAK1 and the associated cytoplasmic kinases BIK1 and PBL1, which phosphorylate the same S-cluster in CAXs to modulate Ca2+ signals in immunity. These Ca2+-dependent (CBL–CIPK) and Ca2+-independent (FLS2–BAK1–BIK1/PBL1) mechanisms combine to balance plant growth and immunity by regulating cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis. A study of calcium homeostasis in the plant Arabidopsis reveals two signalling pathways it uses to balance the objectives of growth and immunity by regulating the level of Ca2+ in the cytosol.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of cancer is the avoidance of immune destruction. This process has been primarily investigated in locally advanced or metastatic cancer1–3; however, much less is known about how pre-malignant or early invasive tumours evade immune detection. Here, to understand this process in early colorectal cancers (CRCs), we investigated how naive colon cancer organoids that were engineered in vitro to harbour Apc-null, KrasG12D and Trp53-null (AKP) mutations adapted to the in vivo native colonic environment. Comprehensive transcriptomic and chromatin analyses revealed that the endoderm-specifying transcription factor SOX17 became strongly upregulated in vivo. Notably, whereas SOX17 loss did not affect AKP organoid propagation in vitro, its loss markedly reduced the ability of AKP tumours to persist in vivo. The small fraction of SOX17-null tumours that grew displayed notable interferon-γ (IFNγ)-producing effector-like CD8+ T cell infiltrates in contrast to the immune-suppressive microenvironment in wild-type counterparts. Mechanistically, in both endogenous Apc-null pre-malignant adenomas and transplanted organoid-derived AKP CRCs, SOX17 suppresses the ability of tumour cells to sense and respond to IFNγ, preventing anti-tumour T cell responses. Finally, SOX17 engages a fetal intestinal programme that drives differentiation away from LGR5+ tumour cells to produce immune-evasive LGR5− tumour cells with lower expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I). We propose that SOX17 is a transcription factor that is engaged during the early steps of colon cancer to orchestrate an immune-evasive programme that permits CRC initiation and progression. Transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses of naive and transplanted colon cancer organoids in a mouse model reveal a key role for the transcription factor SOX17 in establishing a permissive immune environment for tumour cells.",

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate heterotrimeric G proteins by stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange in the Gα subunit1. To visualize this mechanism, we developed a time-resolved cryo-EM approach that examines the progression of ensembles of pre-steady-state intermediates of a GPCR–G-protein complex. By monitoring the transitions of the stimulatory Gs protein in complex with the β2-adrenergic receptor at short sequential time points after GTP addition, we identified the conformational trajectory underlying G-protein activation and functional dissociation from the receptor. Twenty structures generated from sequential overlapping particle subsets along this trajectory, compared to control structures, provide a high-resolution description of the order of main events driving G-protein activation in response to GTP binding. Structural changes propagate from the nucleotide-binding pocket and extend through the GTPase domain, enacting alterations to Gα switch regions and the α5 helix that weaken the G-protein–receptor interface. Molecular dynamics simulations with late structures in the cryo-EM trajectory support that enhanced ordering of GTP on closure of the α-helical domain against the nucleotide-bound Ras-homology domain correlates with α5 helix destabilization and eventual dissociation of the G protein from the GPCR. These findings also highlight the potential of time-resolved cryo-EM as a tool for mechanistic dissection of GPCR signalling events. Time-resolved cryo-EM is used to capture structural transitions during G-protein activation stimulated by a G-protein-coupled receptor.",

    "abstract": "Compared to polycrystalline semiconductors, amorphous semiconductors offer inherent cost-effective, simple and uniform manufacturing. Traditional amorphous hydrogenated Si falls short in electrical properties, necessitating the exploration of new materials. The creation of high-mobility amorphous n-type metal oxides, such as a-InGaZnO (ref. 1), and their integration into thin-film transistors (TFTs) have propelled advancements in modern large-area electronics and new-generation displays2–8. However, finding comparable p-type counterparts poses notable challenges, impeding the progress of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology and integrated circuits9–11. Here we introduce a pioneering design strategy for amorphous p-type semiconductors, incorporating high-mobility tellurium within an amorphous tellurium suboxide matrix, and demonstrate its use in high-performance, stable p-channel TFTs and complementary circuits. Theoretical analysis unveils a delocalized valence band from tellurium 5p bands with shallow acceptor states, enabling excess hole doping and transport. Selenium alloying suppresses hole concentrations and facilitates the p-orbital connectivity, realizing high-performance p-channel TFTs with an average field-effect hole mobility of around 15 cm2 V−1 s−1 and on/off current ratios of 106–107, along with wafer-scale uniformity and long-term stabilities under bias stress and ambient ageing. This study represents a crucial stride towards establishing commercially viable amorphous p-channel TFT technology and complementary electronics in a low-cost and industry-compatible manner. A pioneering design strategy for amorphous p-type semiconductors can be used in high-performance, stable p-channel TFTs and complementary circuits, which may establish viable amorphous p-channel TFT technology and large-area complementary electronics in a low-cost manner.",

We find that the fly VNC contains roughly 45 million synapses and 14,600 neuronal cell bodies. To interpret the output of the connectome, we mapped the muscle targets of leg and wing motor neurons using genetic driver lines2 and X-ray holographic nanotomography3. With this motor neuron atlas, we identified neural circuits that coordinate leg and wing movements during take-off. We provide the reconstruction of VNC circuits, the motor neuron atlas and tools for programmatic and interactive access as resources to support experimental and theoretical studies of how the nervous system controls behaviour.

    "abstract": "Advancements in precision oncology over the past decades have led to new therapeutic interventions, but the efficacy of such treatments is generally limited by an adaptive process that fosters drug resistance1. In addition to genetic mutations2, recent research has identified a role for non-genetic plasticity in transient drug tolerance3 and the acquisition of stable resistance4,5. However, the dynamics of cell-state transitions that occur in the adaptation to cancer therapies remain unknown and require a systems-level longitudinal framework. Here we demonstrate that resistance develops through trajectories of cell-state transitions accompanied by a progressive increase in cell fitness, which we denote as the ‘resistance continuum’. This cellular adaptation involves a stepwise assembly of gene expression programmes and epigenetically reinforced cell states underpinned by phenotypic plasticity, adaptation to stress and metabolic reprogramming. Our results support the notion that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or stemness programmes—often considered a proxy for phenotypic plasticity—enable adaptation, rather than a full resistance mechanism. Through systematic genetic perturbations, we identify the acquisition of metabolic dependencies, exposing vulnerabilities that can potentially be exploited therapeutically. The concept of the resistance continuum highlights the dynamic nature of cellular adaptation and calls for complementary therapies directed at the mechanisms underlying adaptive cell-state transitions. Tumour cells adapt to anticancer drug treatments by a series of cellular state transitions, each inducing distinct gene expression programmes and leading to increased drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Microbial systems have been synthetically engineered to deploy therapeutic payloads in vivo1,2. With emerging evidence that bacteria naturally home in on tumours3,4 and modulate antitumour immunity5,6, one promising application is the development of bacterial vectors as precision cancer vaccines2,7. Here we engineered probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 as an antitumour vaccination platform optimized for enhanced production and cytosolic delivery of neoepitope-containing peptide arrays, with increased susceptibility to blood clearance and phagocytosis. These features enhance both safety and immunogenicity, achieving a system that drives potent and specific T cell-mediated anticancer immunity that effectively controls or eliminates tumour growth and extends survival in advanced murine primary and metastatic solid tumours. We demonstrate that the elicited antitumour immune response involves recruitment and activation of dendritic cells, extensive priming and activation of neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, broader activation of both T and natural killer cells, and a reduction of tumour-infiltrating immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T and B cell populations. Taken together, this work leverages the advantages of living medicines to deliver arrays of tumour-specific neoantigen-derived epitopes within the optimal context to induce specific, effective and durable systemic antitumour immunity. Probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is engineered as an antitumour vaccination platform optimized for enhanced production and cytosolic delivery of neoepitope-containing peptide arrays to safely induce specific, effective and durable systemic antitumour immunity.",

    "abstract": "The liver has a unique ability to regenerate1,2; however, in the setting of acute liver failure (ALF), this regenerative capacity is often overwhelmed, leaving emergency liver transplantation as the only curative option3–5. Here, to advance understanding of human liver regeneration, we use paired single-nucleus RNA sequencing combined with spatial profiling of healthy and ALF explant human livers to generate a single-cell, pan-lineage atlas of human liver regeneration. We uncover a novel ANXA2+ migratory hepatocyte subpopulation, which emerges during human liver regeneration, and a corollary subpopulation in a mouse model of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver regeneration. Interrogation of necrotic wound closure and hepatocyte proliferation across multiple timepoints following APAP-induced liver injury in mice demonstrates that wound closure precedes hepatocyte proliferation. Four-dimensional intravital imaging of APAP-induced mouse liver injury identifies motile hepatocytes at the edge of the necrotic area, enabling collective migration of the hepatocyte sheet to effect wound closure. Depletion of hepatocyte ANXA2 reduces hepatocyte growth factor-induced human and mouse hepatocyte migration in vitro, and abrogates necrotic wound closure following APAP-induced mouse liver injury. Together, our work dissects unanticipated aspects of liver regeneration, demonstrating an uncoupling of wound closure and hepatocyte proliferation and uncovering a novel migratory hepatocyte subpopulation that mediates wound closure following liver injury. Therapies designed to promote rapid reconstitution of normal hepatic microarchitecture and reparation of the gut–liver barrier may advance new areas of therapeutic discovery in regenerative medicine. Harnessing single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial profiling, this work dissects unanticipated aspects of human liver regeneration to uncover a novel migratory hepatocyte subpopulation mediating wound closure following acute liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Wireless modules that provide telecommunications and power-harvesting capabilities enabled by radio-frequency (RF) electronics are vital components of skin-interfaced stretchable electronics1–7. However, recent studies on stretchable RF components have demonstrated that substantial changes in electrical properties, such as a shift in the antenna resonance frequency, occur even under relatively low elastic strains8–15. Such changes lead directly to greatly reduced wireless signal strength or power-transfer efficiency in stretchable systems, particularly in physically dynamic environments such as the surface of the skin. Here we present strain-invariant stretchable RF electronics capable of completely maintaining the original RF properties under various elastic strains using a ‘dielectro-elastic’ material as the substrate. Dielectro-elastic materials have physically tunable dielectric properties that effectively avert frequency shifts arising in interfacing RF electronics. Compared with conventional stretchable substrate materials, our material has superior electrical, mechanical and thermal properties that are suitable for high-performance stretchable RF electronics. In this paper, we describe the materials, fabrication and design strategies that serve as the foundation for enabling the strain-invariant behaviour of key RF components based on experimental and computational studies. Finally, we present a set of skin-interfaced wireless healthcare monitors based on strain-invariant stretchable RF electronics with a wireless operational distance of up to 30 m under strain. Stretchable radio-frequency electronics based on a dielectro-elastic elastomer is demonstrated to be capable of completely maintaining operating frequencies unaffected by strain and shows superior electrical, mechanical and thermal properties compared with conventional stretchable substrate materials.",

    "abstract": "Farmed soils contribute substantially to global warming by emitting N2O (ref. 1), and mitigation has proved difficult2. Several microbial nitrogen transformations produce N2O, but the only biological sink for N2O is the enzyme NosZ, catalysing the reduction of N2O to N2 (ref. 3). Although strengthening the NosZ activity in soils would reduce N2O emissions, such bioengineering of the soil microbiota is considered challenging4,5. However, we have developed a technology to achieve this, using organic waste as a substrate and vector for N2O-respiring bacteria selected for their capacity to thrive in soil6–8. Here we have analysed the biokinetics of N2O reduction by our most promising N2O-respiring bacterium, Cloacibacterium sp. CB-01, its survival in soil and its effect on N2O emissions in field experiments. Fertilization with waste from biogas production, in which CB-01 had grown aerobically to about 6 × 109 cells per millilitre, reduced N2O emissions by 50–95%, depending on soil type. The strong and long-lasting effect of CB-01 is ascribed to its tenacity in soil, rather than its biokinetic parameters, which were inferior to those of other strains of N2O-respiring bacteria. Scaling our data up to the European level, we find that national anthropogenic N2O emissions could be reduced by 5–20%, and more if including other organic wastes. This opens an avenue for cost-effective reduction of N2O emissions for which other mitigation options are lacking at present. A study presents a method to mitigate emissions of nitrous oxide from farmland using bacteria to consume nitrous oxide in soil with organic waste as a substrate and vector.",

    "abstract": "Harnessing genetic diversity in major staple crops through the development of new breeding capabilities is essential to ensure food security1. Here we examined the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the A. E. Watkins landrace collection2 of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), a major global cereal, by whole-genome re-sequencing of 827 Watkins landraces and 208 modern cultivars and in-depth field evaluation spanning a decade. We found that modern cultivars are derived from two of the seven ancestral groups of wheat and maintain very long-range haplotype integrity. The remaining five groups represent untapped genetic sources, providing access to landrace-specific alleles and haplotypes for breeding. Linkage disequilibrium-based haplotypes and association genetics analyses link Watkins genomes to the thousands of identified high-resolution quantitative trait loci and significant marker–trait associations. Using these structured germplasm, genotyping and informatics resources, we revealed many Watkins-unique beneficial haplotypes that can confer superior traits in modern wheat. Furthermore, we assessed the phenotypic effects of 44,338 Watkins-unique haplotypes, introgressed from 143 prioritized quantitative trait loci in the context of modern cultivars, bridging the gap between landrace diversity and current breeding. This study establishes a framework for systematically utilizing genetic diversity in crop improvement to achieve sustainable food security. Genomic and phenomic screens of 827 wheat landraces from the A. E. Watkins collection provide insight into the wheat population genetic background, unlocking many agronomic traits and revealing haplotypes that could potentially be used to improve modern wheat cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale cell death is commonly observed during organismal development and in human pathologies1–5. These cell death events extend over great distances to eliminate large populations of cells, raising the question of how cell death can be coordinated in space and time. One mechanism that enables long-range signal transmission is trigger waves6, but how this mechanism might be used for death events in cell populations remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ferroptosis, an iron- and lipid-peroxidation-dependent form of cell death, can propagate across human cells over long distances (≥5 mm) at constant speeds (around 5.5 μm min−1) through trigger waves of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Chemical and genetic perturbations indicate a primary role of ROS feedback loops (Fenton reaction, NADPH oxidase signalling and glutathione synthesis) in controlling the progression of ferroptotic trigger waves. We show that introducing ferroptotic stress through suppression of cystine uptake activates these ROS feedback loops, converting cellular redox systems from being monostable to being bistable and thereby priming cell populations to become bistable media over which ROS propagate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ferroptosis and its propagation accompany the massive, yet spatially restricted, cell death events during muscle remodelling of the embryonic avian limb, substantiating its use as a tissue-sculpting strategy during embryogenesis. Our findings highlight the role of ferroptosis in coordinating global cell death events, providing a paradigm for investigating large-scale cell death in embryonic development and human pathologies. Ferroptosis can propagate across human cells over long distances (≥5 mm) at constant speeds (around 5.5 μm per minute) through self-regenerating waves of reactive oxygen species; such waves facilitate large-scale cell death in the developing avian limb.",

    "abstract": "A broad range of brain pathologies critically relies on the vasculature, and cerebrovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. However, the cellular and molecular architecture of the human brain vasculature remains incompletely understood1. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 606,380 freshly isolated endothelial cells, perivascular cells and other tissue-derived cells from 117 samples, from 68 human fetuses and adult patients to construct a molecular atlas of the developing fetal, adult control and diseased human brain vasculature. We identify extensive molecular heterogeneity of the vasculature of healthy fetal and adult human brains and across five vascular-dependent central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, including brain tumours and brain vascular malformations. We identify alteration of arteriovenous differentiation and reactivated fetal as well as conserved dysregulated genes and pathways in the diseased vasculature. Pathological endothelial cells display a loss of CNS-specific properties and reveal an upregulation of MHC class II molecules, indicating atypical features of CNS endothelial cells. Cell–cell interaction analyses predict substantial endothelial-to-perivascular cell ligand–receptor cross-talk, including immune-related and angiogenic pathways, thereby revealing a central role for the endothelium within brain neurovascular unit signalling networks. Our single-cell brain atlas provides insights into the molecular architecture and heterogeneity of the developing, adult/control and diseased human brain vasculature and serves as a powerful reference for future studies. Endothelial cells from vascular-dependent central nervous system (CNS) diseases reveal reactivated fetal pathways, display common hallmarks of disease — including a partial loss of arteriovenous specification and CNS-specific properties as well as an upregulation of MHC class II receptors — and play a key role in the human brain neurovascular unit across development, adulthood and disease.",

The presence of a new 1313 polymorph and competing R–P phases obscured proper identification of the phase for HTSC6–9. Thus, achieving bulk HTSC and identifying the phase at play are the most prominent tasks. Here we address these issues in the praseodymium (Pr)-doped La2PrNi2O7 polycrystalline samples. We find that substitutions of Pr for La effectively inhibit the intergrowth of different R–P phases, resulting in a nearly pure bilayer structure. For La2PrNi2O7, pressure-induced orthorhombic to tetragonal structural transition takes place at Pc ≈ 11 GPa, above which HTSC emerges gradually on further compression. The superconducting transition temperatures at 18–20 GPa reach \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${T}_{{\\rm{c}}}^{{\\rm{onset}}}=82.5\\,{\\rm{K}}$$\n                \n               and \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${T}_{{\\rm{c}}}^{{\\rm{zero}}}=60\\,{\\rm{K}}$$\n                \n              , which are the highest values, to our knowledge, among known nickelate superconductors. Importantly, bulk HTSC was testified by detecting clear diamagnetic signals below about 75 K with appreciable superconducting shielding volume fractions at a pressure of above 15 GPa. Our results not only resolve the existing controversies but also provide directions for exploring bulk HTSC in the bilayer nickelates. Bulk high-temperature superconductivity observed in pressurized tetragonal La2PrNi2O7 was testified by detecting clear diamagnetic signals below about 75 K with appreciable superconducting shielding volume fractions at a pressure of above 15 GPa.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal signals that are relevant for spatial navigation have been described in many species1–10. However, a circuit-level understanding of how such signals interact to guide navigational behaviour is lacking. Here we characterize a neuronal circuit in the Drosophila central complex that compares internally generated estimates of the heading and goal angles of the fly—both of which are encoded in world-centred (allocentric) coordinates—to generate a body-centred (egocentric) steering signal. Past work has suggested that the activity of EPG neurons represents the fly’s moment-to-moment angular orientation, or heading angle, during navigation2,11. An animal’s moment-to-moment heading angle, however, is not always aligned with its goal angle—that is, the allocentric direction in which it wishes to progress forward. We describe FC2 cells12, a second set of neurons in the Drosophila brain with activity that correlates with the fly’s goal angle. Focal optogenetic activation of FC2 neurons induces flies to orient along experimenter-defined directions as they walk forward. EPG and FC2 neurons connect monosynaptically to a third neuronal class, PFL3 cells12,13. We found that individual PFL3 cells show conjunctive, spike-rate tuning to both the heading angle and the goal angle during goal-directed navigation. Informed by the anatomy and physiology of these three cell classes, we develop a model that explains how this circuit compares allocentric heading and goal angles to build an egocentric steering signal in the PFL3 output terminals. Quantitative analyses and optogenetic manipulations of PFL3 activity support the model. Finally, using a new navigational memory task, we show that flies expressing disruptors of synaptic transmission in subsets of PFL3 cells have a reduced ability to orient along arbitrary goal directions, with an effect size in quantitative accordance with the prediction of our model. The biological circuit described here reveals how two population-level allocentric signals are compared in the brain to produce an egocentric output signal that is appropriate for motor control. In Drosophila, FC2 neurons signal a navigational goal, which is compared with the fly’s heading by PFL3 neurons to guide moment-to-moment steering.",

However, there remains little consensus on the mechanism(s) of response with this combination2. Here we find that a high baseline of intratumoural macrophages and regulatory T cells is associated with better outcomes in patients treated with atezolizumab plus tiragolumab but not with atezolizumab alone. Serum sample analysis revealed that macrophage activation is associated with a clinical benefit in patients who received the combination treatment. In mouse tumour models, tiragolumab surrogate antibodies inflamed tumour-associated macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells through Fcγ receptors (FcγR), in turn driving anti-tumour CD8+ T cells from an exhausted effector-like state to a more memory-like state. These results reveal a mechanism of action through which TIGIT checkpoint inhibitors can remodel immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments, and suggest that FcγR engagement is an important consideration in anti-TIGIT antibody development. A high baseline of intratumoural macrophages and regulatory T cells is associated with better outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with atezolizumab plus tiragolumab, but not with atezolizumab alone.",

    "abstract": "The sea level along the US coastlines is projected to rise by 0.25–0.3 m by 2050, increasing the probability of more destructive flooding and inundation in major cities1–3. However, these impacts may be exacerbated by coastal subsidence—the sinking of coastal land areas4—a factor that is often underrepresented in coastal-management policies and long-term urban planning2,5. In this study, we combine high-resolution vertical land motion (that is, raising or lowering of land) and elevation datasets with projections of sea-level rise to quantify the potential inundated areas in 32 major US coastal cities. Here we show that, even when considering the current coastal-defence structures, further land area of between 1,006 and 1,389 km2 is threatened by relative sea-level rise by 2050, posing a threat to a population of 55,000–273,000 people and 31,000–171,000 properties. Our analysis shows that not accounting for spatially variable land subsidence within the cities may lead to inaccurate projections of expected exposure. These potential consequences show the scale of the adaptation challenge, which is not appreciated in most US coastal cities. High-resolution vertical land motion and elevation datasets combined with projections of sea-level rise of 32 major US coastal cities shows that a considerable amount of land area, population, and properties are threatened by relative sea-level rise by 2050.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional organoid culture technologies have revolutionized cancer research by allowing for more realistic and scalable reproductions of both tumour and microenvironmental structures1–3. This has enabled better modelling of low-complexity cancer cell behaviours that occur over relatively short periods of time4. However, available organoid systems do not capture the intricate evolutionary process of cancer development in terms of tissue architecture, cell diversity, homeostasis and lifespan. As a consequence, oncogenesis and tumour formation studies are not possible in vitro and instead require the extensive use of animal models, which provide limited spatiotemporal resolution of cellular dynamics and come at a considerable cost in terms of resources and animal lives. Here we developed topobiologically complex mini-colons that are able to undergo tumorigenesis ex vivo by integrating microfabrication, optogenetic and tissue engineering approaches. With this system, tumorigenic transformation can be spatiotemporally controlled by directing oncogenic activation through blue-light exposure, and emergent colon tumours can be tracked in real-time at the single-cell resolution for several weeks without breaking the culture. These induced mini-colons display rich intratumoural and intertumoural diversity and recapitulate key pathophysiological hallmarks displayed by colorectal tumours in vivo. By fine-tuning cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic parameters, mini-colons can be used to identify tumorigenic determinants and pharmacological opportunities. As a whole, our study paves the way for cancer initiation research outside living organisms. Topobiologically complex mini-colons—which enable the faithful in vitro recapitulation of colorectal cancer tumorigenesis and its environmental determinants—offer the possibility to reduce animal use in a wide range of experimental applications.",

    "abstract": "Photobiocatalysis—where light is used to expand the reactivity of an enzyme—has recently emerged as a powerful strategy to develop chemistries that are new to nature. These systems have shown potential in asymmetric radical reactions that have long eluded small-molecule catalysts1. So far, unnatural photobiocatalytic reactions are limited to overall reductive and redox-neutral processes2–9. Here we report photobiocatalytic asymmetric sp3–sp3 oxidative cross-coupling between organoboron reagents and amino acids. This reaction requires the cooperative use of engineered pyridoxal biocatalysts, photoredox catalysts and an oxidizing agent. We repurpose a family of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes, threonine aldolases10–12, for the α-C–H functionalization of glycine and α-branched amino acid substrates by a radical mechanism, giving rise to a range of α-tri- and tetrasubstituted non-canonical amino acids 13–15 possessing up to two contiguous stereocentres. Directed evolution of pyridoxal radical enzymes allowed primary and secondary radical precursors, including benzyl, allyl and alkylboron reagents, to be coupled in an enantio- and diastereocontrolled fashion. Cooperative photoredox–pyridoxal biocatalysis provides a platform for sp3–sp3 oxidative coupling16, permitting the stereoselective, intermolecular free-radical transformations that are unknown to chemistry or biology. We report on the oxidative cross-coupling of organoboron reagents and amino acids via pyridoxal biocatalysis to produce non-canonical amino acids, uncovering stereoselective, intermolecular free-radical transformations.",

    "abstract": "Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are useful synthetic materials that are built by the programmed assembly of metal nodes and organic linkers1. The success of MOFs results from the isoreticular principle2, which allows families of structurally analogous frameworks to be built in a predictable way. This relies on directional coordinate covalent bonding to define the framework geometry. However, isoreticular strategies do not translate to other common crystalline solids, such as organic salts3–5, in which the intermolecular ionic bonding is less directional. Here we show that chemical knowledge can be combined with computational crystal-structure prediction6 (CSP) to design porous organic ammonium halide salts that contain no metals. The nodes in these salt frameworks are tightly packed ionic clusters that direct the materials to crystallize in specific ways, as demonstrated by the presence of well-defined spikes of low-energy, low-density isoreticular structures on the predicted lattice energy landscapes7,8. These energy landscapes allow us to select combinations of cations and anions that will form thermodynamically stable, porous salt frameworks with channel sizes, functionalities and geometries that can be predicted a priori. Some of these porous salts adsorb molecular guests such as iodine in quantities that exceed those of most MOFs, and this could be useful for applications such as radio-iodine capture9–12. More generally, the synthesis of these salts is scalable, involving simple acid–base neutralization, and the strategy makes it possible to create a family of non-metal organic frameworks that combine high ionic charge density with permanent porosity. The use of computational crystal-structure prediction has enabled the targeted assembly of frameworks of porous organic ammonium halide salts that have many of the qualities of metal–organic frameworks despite containing no metal.",

    "abstract": "Vertical three-dimensional integration of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors holds great promise, as it offers the possibility to scale up logic layers in the z axis1–3. Indeed, vertical complementary field-effect transistors (CFETs) built with such mixed-dimensional heterostructures4,5, as well as hetero-2D layers with different carrier types6–8, have been demonstrated recently. However, so far, the lack of a controllable doping scheme (especially p-doped WSe2 (refs. 9–17) and MoS2 (refs. 11,18–28)) in 2D semiconductors, preferably in a stable and non-destructive manner, has greatly impeded the bottom-up scaling of complementary logic circuitries. Here we show that, by bringing transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoS2, atop a van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnetic insulator chromium oxychloride (CrOCl), the carrier polarity in MoS2 can be readily reconfigured from n- to p-type via strong vdW interfacial coupling. The consequential band alignment yields transistors with room-temperature hole mobilities up to approximately 425 cm2 V−1 s−1, on/off ratios reaching 106 and air-stable performance for over one year. Based on this approach, vertically constructed complementary logic, including inverters with 6 vdW layers, NANDs with 14 vdW layers and SRAMs with 14 vdW layers, are further demonstrated. Our findings of polarity-engineered p- and n-type 2D semiconductor channels with and without vdW intercalation are robust and universal to various materials and thus may throw light on future three-dimensional vertically integrated circuits based on 2D logic gates. We develop a method for high-density vertical stacking of active-device multi-layers, implementing memory and logic functions, using unique VIP-FETs where a van der Waals intercalation layer modulates the p- or n-type nature of the FETs.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is caused by a sequence of somatic genomic alterations affecting driver genes in core cancer pathways1. Here, to understand the functional and prognostic impact of cancer-causing somatic mutations, we analysed the whole genomes and transcriptomes of 1,063 primary colorectal cancers in a population-based cohort with long-term follow-up. From the 96 mutated driver genes, 9 were not previously implicated in colorectal cancer and 24 had not been linked to any cancer. Two distinct patterns of pathway co-mutations were observed, timing analyses identified nine early and three late driver gene mutations, and several signatures of colorectal-cancer-specific mutational processes were identified. Mutations in WNT, EGFR and TGFβ pathway genes, the mitochondrial CYB gene and 3 regulatory elements along with 21 copy-number variations and the COSMIC SBS44 signature correlated with survival. Gene expression classification yielded five prognostic subtypes with distinct molecular features, in part explained by underlying genomic alterations. Microsatellite-instable tumours divided into two classes with different levels of hypoxia and infiltration of immune and stromal cells. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the largest integrated genome and transcriptome analysis of colorectal cancer, and interlinks mutations, gene expression and patient outcomes. The identification of prognostic mutations and expression subtypes can guide future efforts to individualize colorectal cancer therapy. A large integrated genome and transcriptome analysis of colorectal cancer identifies prognostic mutations and expression subtypes.",

    "abstract": "The formation of galaxies by gradual hierarchical co-assembly of baryons and cold dark matter halos is a fundamental paradigm underpinning modern astrophysics1,2 and predicts a strong decline in the number of massive galaxies at early cosmic times3–5. Extremely massive quiescent galaxies (stellar masses of more than 1011 M⊙) have now been observed as early as 1–2 billion years after the Big Bang6–13. These galaxies are extremely constraining on theoretical models, as they had formed 300–500 Myr earlier, and only some models can form massive galaxies this early12,14. Here we report on the spectroscopic observations with the JWST of a massive quiescent galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at redshift 3.205 ± 0.005. It has eluded deep ground-based spectroscopy8, it is significantly redder than is typical and its spectrum reveals features typical of much older stellar populations. Detailed modelling shows that its stellar population formed around 1.5 billion years earlier in time (z ≈ 11) at an epoch when dark matter halos of sufficient hosting mass had not yet assembled in the standard scenario4,5. This observation may indicate the presence of undetected populations of early galaxies and the possibility of significant gaps in our understanding of early stellar populations, galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. A massive galaxy observed with the JWST indicates that the bulk of its stars formed within the first 500 million years of the Universe.",

This technique has enabled the release of molecular cargo by rearrangement, as a direct5,6 or indirect7–10 consequence of bond scission in a mechanophore, or by dissociation of cage11, supramolecular12 or metal complexes13,14, and even by ‘flex activation’15,16. However, the systems described so far are limited in the diversity and/or quantity of the molecules released per stretching event1,2. This is due to the difficulty in iteratively activating scissile mechanophores, as the actuating polymers will dissociate after the first activation. Physical encapsulation strategies can be used to deliver a larger cargo load, but these are often subject to non-specific (that is, non-mechanical) release3. Here we show that a rotaxane (an interlocked molecule in which a macrocycle is trapped on a stoppered axle) acts as an efficient actuator to trigger the release of cargo molecules appended to its axle. The release of up to five cargo molecules per rotaxane actuator was demonstrated in solution, by ultrasonication, and in bulk, by compression, achieving a release efficiency of up to 71% and 30%, respectively, which places this rotaxane device among the most efficient release systems achieved so far1. We also demonstrate the release of three representative functional molecules (a drug, a fluorescent tag and an organocatalyst), and we anticipate that a large variety of cargo molecules could be released with this device. This rotaxane actuator provides a versatile platform for various force-controlled release applications. A rotaxane-based mechanochemical system enables force-controlled release of multiple cargo molecules that are appended to its molecular axle.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) are the most common precursors of pancreatic cancer, but their small size and inaccessibility in humans make them challenging to study1. Critically, the number, dimensions and connectivity of human PanINs remain largely unknown, precluding important insights into early cancer development. Here, we provide a microanatomical survey of human PanINs by analysing 46 large samples of grossly normal human pancreas with a machine-learning pipeline for quantitative 3D histological reconstruction at single-cell resolution. To elucidate genetic relationships between and within PanINs, we developed a workflow in which 3D modelling guides multi-region microdissection and targeted and whole-exome sequencing. From these samples, we calculated a mean burden of 13 PanINs per cm3 and extrapolated that the normal intact adult pancreas harbours hundreds of PanINs, almost all with oncogenic KRAS hotspot mutations. We found that most PanINs originate as independent clones with distinct somatic mutation profiles. Some spatially continuous PanINs were found to contain multiple KRAS mutations; computational and in situ analyses demonstrated that different KRAS mutations localize to distinct cell subpopulations within these neoplasms, indicating their polyclonal origins. The extensive multifocality and genetic heterogeneity of PanINs raises important questions about mechanisms that drive precancer initiation and confer differential progression risk in the human pancreas. This detailed 3D genomic mapping of molecular alterations in human PanINs provides an empirical foundation for early detection and rational interception of pancreatic cancer. Quantitative multimodal 3D reconstruction of human pancreatic tissue at single-cell resolution reveals a high burden of multifocal, genetically heterogeneous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias in the normal adult pancreas.",

    "abstract": "The properties of polycrystalline materials are often dominated by defects; two-dimensional (2D) crystals can even be divided and disrupted by a line defect1–3. However, 2D crystals are often required to be processed into films, which are inevitably polycrystalline and contain numerous grain boundaries, and therefore are brittle and fragile, hindering application in flexible electronics, optoelectronics and separation1–4. Moreover, similar to glass, wood and plastics, they suffer from trade-off effects between mechanical strength and toughness5,6. Here we report a method to produce highly strong, tough and elastic films of an emerging class of 2D crystals: 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) composed of single-crystal domains connected by an interwoven grain boundary on water surface using an aliphatic bi-amine as a sacrificial go-between. Films of two 2D COFs have been demonstrated, which show Young’s moduli and breaking strengths of 56.7 ± 7.4 GPa and 73.4 ± 11.6 GPa, and 82.2 ± 9.1 N m−1 and 29.5 ± 7.2 N m−1, respectively. We predict that the sacrificial go-between guided synthesis method and the interwoven grain boundary will inspire grain boundary engineering of various polycrystalline materials, endowing them with new properties, enhancing their current applications and paving the way for new applications. A method is reported that produces highly strong, tough and elastic 2D COF films, using a sacrificial go-between, which endows them with new properties, enhances their current applications and paves the way for new applications.",

However, with atomically thin body thickness, 2D semiconductors are not compatible with various high-energy processes in microelectronics11–13, where the M3D integration of multiple 2D circuit tiers is challenging. Here we report an alternative low-temperature M3D integration approach by van der Waals (vdW) lamination of entire prefabricated circuit tiers, where the processing temperature is controlled to 120 °C. By further repeating the vdW lamination process tier by tier, an M3D integrated system is achieved with 10 circuit tiers in the vertical direction, overcoming previous thermal budget limitations. Detailed electrical characterization demonstrates the bottom 2D transistor is not impacted after repetitively laminating vdW circuit tiers on top. Furthermore, by vertically connecting devices within different tiers through vdW inter-tier vias, various logic and heterogeneous structures are realized with desired system functions. Our demonstration provides a low-temperature route towards fabricating M3D circuits with increased numbers of tiers. We develop a low-temperature, damage-free process using van der Waals lamination to integrate multiple circuit tiers into a monolithic three-dimensional device, incorporating unique multi-tier functionality and resolving legacy issues with the layering technology.",

    "abstract": "To run large-scale algorithms on a quantum computer, error-correcting codes must be able to perform a fundamental set of operations, called logic gates, while isolating the encoded information from noise1–8. We can complete a universal set of logic gates by producing special resources called magic states9–11. It is therefore important to produce high-fidelity magic states to conduct algorithms while introducing a minimal amount of noise to the computation. Here we propose and implement a scheme to prepare a magic state on a superconducting qubit array using error correction. We find that our scheme produces better magic states than those that can be prepared using the individual qubits of the device. This demonstrates a fundamental principle of fault-tolerant quantum computing12, namely, that we can use error correction to improve the quality of logic gates with noisy qubits. Moreover, we show that the yield of magic states can be increased using adaptive circuits, in which the circuit elements are changed depending on the outcome of mid-circuit measurements. This demonstrates an essential capability needed for many error-correction subroutines. We believe that our prototype will be invaluable in the future as it can reduce the number of physical qubits needed to produce high-fidelity magic states in large-scale quantum-computing architectures. A scheme to prepare a magic state, an important ingredient for quantum computers, on a superconducting qubit array using error correction is proposed that produces better magic states than those that can be prepared using the individual qubits of the device.",

    "abstract": "The eye, an anatomical extension of the central nervous system (CNS), exhibits many molecular and cellular parallels to the brain. Emerging research demonstrates that changes in the brain are often reflected in the eye, particularly in the retina1. Still, the possibility of an immunological nexus between the posterior eye and the rest of the CNS tissues remains unexplored. Here, studying immune responses to herpes simplex virus in the brain, we observed that intravitreal immunization protects mice against intracranial viral challenge. This protection extended to bacteria and even tumours, allowing therapeutic immune responses against glioblastoma through intravitreal immunization. We further show that the anterior and posterior compartments of the eye have distinct lymphatic drainage systems, with the latter draining to the deep cervical lymph nodes through lymphatic vasculature in the optic nerve sheath. This posterior lymphatic drainage, like that of meningeal lymphatics, could be modulated by the lymphatic stimulator VEGFC. Conversely, we show that inhibition of lymphatic signalling on the optic nerve could overcome a major limitation in gene therapy by diminishing the immune response to adeno-associated virus and ensuring continued efficacy after multiple doses. These results reveal a shared lymphatic circuit able to mount a unified immune response between the posterior eye and the brain, highlighting an understudied immunological feature of the eye and opening up the potential for new therapeutic strategies in ocular and CNS diseases. A study provides evidence for a shared lymphatic circuit that connects the posterior eye and the brain, allowing the generation of immune responses to protect the CNS against pathogens and tumours following intravitreal immunization.",

    "abstract": "The Werner syndrome RecQ helicase WRN was identified as a synthetic lethal target in cancer cells with microsatellite instability (MSI) by several genetic screens1–6. Despite advances in treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors7–10, there is an unmet need in the treatment of MSI cancers11–14. Here we report the structural, biochemical, cellular and pharmacological characterization of the clinical-stage WRN helicase inhibitor HRO761, which was identified through an innovative hit-finding and lead-optimization strategy. HRO761 is a potent, selective, allosteric WRN inhibitor that binds at the interface of the D1 and D2 helicase domains, locking WRN in an inactive conformation. Pharmacological inhibition by HRO761 recapitulated the phenotype observed by WRN genetic suppression, leading to DNA damage and inhibition of tumour cell growth selectively in MSI cells in a p53-independent manner. Moreover, HRO761 led to WRN degradation in MSI cells but not in microsatellite-stable cells. Oral treatment with HRO761 resulted in dose-dependent in vivo DNA damage induction and tumour growth inhibition in MSI cell- and patient-derived xenograft models. These findings represent preclinical pharmacological validation of WRN as a therapeutic target in MSI cancers. A clinical trial with HRO761 (NCT05838768) is ongoing to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumour activity in patients with MSI colorectal cancer and other MSI solid tumours. HRO761 is a potent, selective, allosteric WRN inhibitor that binds at the interface of the D1 and D2 helicase domains, locking WRN in an inactive conformation.",

    "abstract": "The liver is the main gateway from the gut, and the unidirectional sinusoidal flow from portal to central veins constitutes heterogenous zones, including the periportal vein (PV) and the pericentral vein zones1–5. However, functional differences in the immune system in each zone remain poorly understood. Here intravital imaging revealed that inflammatory responses are suppressed in PV zones. Zone-specific single-cell transcriptomics detected a subset of immunosuppressive macrophages enriched in PV zones that express high levels of interleukin-10 and Marco, a scavenger receptor that sequesters pro-inflammatory pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns, and consequently suppress immune responses. Induction of Marco+ immunosuppressive macrophages depended on gut microbiota. In particular, a specific bacterial family, Odoribacteraceae, was identified to induce this macrophage subset through its postbiotic isoallolithocholic acid. Intestinal barrier leakage resulted in inflammation in PV zones, which was markedly augmented in Marco-deficient conditions. Chronic liver inflammatory diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) showed decreased numbers of Marco+ macrophages. Functional ablation of Marco+ macrophages led to PSC-like inflammatory phenotypes related to colitis and exacerbated steatosis in NASH in animal experimental models. Collectively, commensal bacteria induce Marco+ immunosuppressive macrophages, which consequently limit excessive inflammation at the gateway of the liver. Failure of this self-limiting system promotes hepatic inflammatory disorders such as PSC and NASH. A subset of Macro-positive macrophages is identified to have immunosuppressive functions in the periportal vein zones of the liver to mediate excessive inflammation, and their effects depend on commensal gut bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to environmental pollutants and human microbiome composition are important predisposition factors for tumour development1,2. Similar to drug molecules, pollutants are typically metabolized in the body, which can change their carcinogenic potential and affect tissue distribution through altered toxicokinetics3. Although recent studies demonstrated that human-associated microorganisms can chemically convert a wide range of xenobiotics and influence the profile and tissue exposure of resulting metabolites4,5, the effect of microbial biotransformation on chemical-induced tumour development remains unclear. Here we show that the depletion of the gut microbiota affects the toxicokinetics of nitrosamines, which markedly reduces the development and severity of nitrosamine-induced urinary bladder cancer in mice6,7. We causally linked this carcinogen biotransformation to specific gut bacterial isolates in vitro and in vivo using individualized bacterial culture collections and gnotobiotic mouse models, respectively. We tested gut communities from different human donors to demonstrate that microbial carcinogen metabolism varies between individuals and we showed that this metabolic activity applies to structurally related nitrosamine carcinogens. Altogether, these results indicate that gut microbiota carcinogen metabolism may be a contributing factor for chemical-induced carcinogenesis, which could open avenues to target the microbiome for improved predisposition risk assessment and prevention of cancer. A study links environmental nitrosamines to bladder cancer through their metabolism by specific commensal microorganisms occurring in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and mice.",

In individuals assigned female sex at birth and undergoing gender-affirming testosterone therapy (trans men), hormone concentrations change markedly but the immunological consequences are poorly understood. Here we performed longitudinal systems-level analyses in 23 trans men and found that testosterone modulates a cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumour necrosis factor. This is mediated by functional attenuation of type-I interferon responses in both plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes. Conversely, testosterone potentiates monocyte responses leading to increased tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-15 production and downstream activation of nuclear factor kappa B-regulated genes and potentiation of interferon-γ responses, primarily in natural killer cells. These findings in trans men are corroborated by sex-divergent responses in public datasets and illustrate the dynamic regulation of human immunity by sex hormones, with implications for the health of individuals undergoing hormone therapy and our understanding of sex-divergent immune responses in cisgender individuals. Examination of immunological changes in transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming testosterone treatment reveals sex hormone-regulated pathways in humans and explains sex-divergent responses in cisgender individuals.",

    "abstract": "The ability to sequence single protein molecules in their native, full-length form would enable a more comprehensive understanding of proteomic diversity. Current technologies, however, are limited in achieving this goal1,2. Here, we establish a method for the long-range, single-molecule reading of intact protein strands on a commercial nanopore sensor array. By using the ClpX unfoldase to ratchet proteins through a CsgG nanopore3,4, we provide single-molecule evidence that ClpX translocates substrates in two-residue steps. This mechanism achieves sensitivity to single amino acids on synthetic protein strands hundreds of amino acids in length, enabling the sequencing of combinations of single-amino-acid substitutions and the mapping of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. To enhance classification accuracy further, we demonstrate the ability to reread individual protein molecules multiple times, and we explore the potential for highly accurate protein barcode sequencing. Furthermore, we develop a biophysical model that can simulate raw nanopore signals a priori on the basis of residue volume and charge, enhancing the interpretation of raw signal data. Finally, we apply these methods to examine full-length, folded protein domains for complete end-to-end analysis. These results provide proof of concept for a platform that has the potential to identify and characterize full-length proteoforms at single-molecule resolution. A technique for threading long protein strands through a nanopore by electrophoresis and back using a protein unfoldase motor, ClpX, enables single protein molecules to be analyzed multiple times with single-amino-acid sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "For patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with CTLA4 inhibitors and PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (hereafter, PD-(L)1 inhibitors) is associated with higher rates of anti-tumour activity and immune-related toxicities, when compared with treatment with PD-(L)1 inhibitors alone. However, there are currently no validated biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit from dual ICB1,2. Here we show that patients with NSCLC who have mutations in the STK11 and/or KEAP1 tumour suppressor genes derived clinical benefit from dual ICB with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab and the CTLA4 inhibitor tremelimumab, but not from durvalumab alone, when added to chemotherapy in the randomized phase III POSEIDON trial3. Unbiased genetic screens identified loss of both of these tumour suppressor genes as independent drivers of resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition, and showed that loss of Keap1 was the strongest genomic predictor of dual ICB efficacy—a finding that was confirmed in several mouse models of Kras-driven NSCLC. In both mouse models and patients, KEAP1 and STK11 alterations were associated with an adverse tumour microenvironment, which was characterized by a preponderance of suppressive myeloid cells and the depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but relative sparing of CD4+ effector subsets. Dual ICB potently engaged CD4+ effector cells and reprogrammed the tumour myeloid cell compartment towards inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-expressing tumoricidal phenotypes that—together with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells—contributed to anti-tumour efficacy. These data support the use of chemo-immunotherapy with dual ICB to mitigate resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition in patients with NSCLC who have STK11 and/or KEAP1 alterations. Alterations in the tumour suppressor genes STK11 and/or KEAP1 can identify patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who are likely to benefit from combinations of PD-(L)1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint inhibitors added to chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "As the only surviving lineages of jawless fishes, hagfishes and lampreys provide a crucial window into early vertebrate evolution1–3. Here we investigate the complex history, timing and functional role of genome-wide duplications4–7 and programmed DNA elimination8,9 in vertebrates in the light of a chromosome-scale genome sequence for the brown hagfish Eptatretus atami. Combining evidence from syntenic and phylogenetic analyses, we establish a comprehensive picture of vertebrate genome evolution, including an auto-tetraploidization (1RV) that predates the early Cambrian cyclostome–gnathostome split, followed by a mid–late Cambrian allo-tetraploidization (2RJV) in gnathostomes and a prolonged Cambrian–Ordovician hexaploidization (2RCY) in cyclostomes. Subsequently, hagfishes underwent extensive genomic changes, with chromosomal fusions accompanied by the loss of genes that are essential for organ systems (for example, genes involved in the development of eyes and in the proliferation of osteoclasts); these changes account, in part, for the simplification of the hagfish body plan1,2. Finally, we characterize programmed DNA elimination in hagfish, identifying protein-coding genes and repetitive elements that are deleted from somatic cell lineages during early development. The elimination of these germline-specific genes provides a mechanism for resolving genetic conflict between soma and germline by repressing germline and pluripotency functions, paralleling findings in lampreys10,11. Reconstruction of the early genomic history of vertebrates provides a framework for further investigations of the evolution of cyclostomes and jawed vertebrates. A chromosome-scale genome assembly for the hagfish Eptatretus atami, combined with a series of phylogenetic analyses, sheds light on ancient polyploidization events that had a key role in the early evolution of vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Local and low-redshift (z < 3) galaxies are known to broadly follow a bimodal distribution: actively star-forming galaxies with relatively stable star-formation rates and passive systems. These two populations are connected by galaxies in relatively slow transition. By contrast, theory predicts that star formation was stochastic at early cosmic times and in low-mass systems1–4. These galaxies transitioned rapidly between starburst episodes and phases of suppressed star formation, potentially even causing temporary quiescence—so-called mini-quenching events5,6. However, the regime of star-formation burstiness is observationally highly unconstrained. Directly observing mini-quenched galaxies in the primordial Universe is therefore of utmost importance to constrain models of galaxy formation and transformation7,8. Early quenched galaxies have been identified out to redshift z < 5 (refs. 9–12) and these are all found to be massive (M⋆ > 1010 M⊙) and relatively old. Here we report a (mini-)quenched galaxy at z = 7.3, when the Universe was only 700 Myr old. The JWST/NIRSpec spectrum is very blue (U–V = 0.16 ± 0.03 mag) but exhibits a Balmer break and no nebular emission lines. The galaxy experienced a short starburst followed by rapid quenching; its stellar mass (4–6 × 108 M⊙) falls in a range that is sensitive to various feedback mechanisms, which can result in perhaps only temporary quenching. Analysis of the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of the recently observed Lyman-break galaxy JADES-GS+53.15508-27.80178 revealed a redshift of z = 7.3, a Balmer break and a complete absence of nebular emission lines, indicating that quenching occurred only 700 million years after the Big Bang.",

    "abstract": "The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a glutamate-activated cation channel that is critical to many processes in the brain. Genome-wide association studies suggest that glutamatergic neurotransmission and NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity are important for body weight homeostasis1. Here we report the engineering and preclinical development of a bimodal molecule that integrates NMDA receptor antagonism with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonism to effectively reverse obesity, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia in rodent models of metabolic disease. GLP-1-directed delivery of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 affects neuroplasticity in the hypothalamus and brainstem. Importantly, targeting of MK-801 to GLP-1 receptor-expressing brain regions circumvents adverse physiological and behavioural effects associated with MK-801 monotherapy. In summary, our approach demonstrates the feasibility of using peptide-mediated targeting to achieve cell-specific ionotropic receptor modulation and highlights the therapeutic potential of unimolecular mixed GLP-1 receptor agonism and NMDA receptor antagonism for safe and effective obesity treatment. Unimolecular integration of NMDA receptor antagonism with GLP-1 receptor agonism effectively reverses obesity, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia in rodent models of metabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "Climate warming induces shifts from snow to rain in cold regions1, altering snowpack dynamics with consequent impacts on streamflow that raise challenges to many aspects of ecosystem services2–4. A straightforward conceptual model states that as the fraction of precipitation falling as snow (snowfall fraction) declines, less solid water is stored over the winter and both snowmelt and streamflow shift earlier in season. Yet the responses of streamflow patterns to shifts in snowfall fraction remain uncertain5–9. Here we show that as snowfall fraction declines, the timing of the centre of streamflow mass may be advanced or delayed. Our results, based on analysis of 1950–2020 streamflow measurements across 3,049 snow-affected catchments over the Northern Hemisphere, show that mean snowfall fraction modulates the seasonal response to reductions in snowfall fraction. Specifically, temporal changes in streamflow timing with declining snowfall fraction reveal a gradient from earlier streamflow in snow-rich catchments to delayed streamflow in less snowy catchments. Furthermore, interannual variability of streamflow timing and seasonal variation increase as snowfall fraction decreases across both space and time. Our findings revise the ‘less snow equals earlier streamflow’ heuristic and instead point towards a complex evolution of seasonal streamflow regimes in a snow-dwindling world. Analysis of streamflow measurements from 1950 to 2020 across 3,049 snow-affected catchments over the Northern Hemisphere shows that seasonal streamflow occurs earlier in snow-heavy catchments but later in less snowy regions.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells require high levels of iron for rapid proliferation, leading to significant upregulation of cell-surface transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which mediates iron uptake by binding to the iron-carrying protein transferrin1–3. Leveraging this phenomenon and the fast endocytosis rate of TfR1 (refs. 4,5), we developed transferrin receptor targeting chimeras (TransTACs), a heterobispecific antibody modality for membrane protein degradation. TransTACs are engineered to drive rapid co-internalization of a target protein of interest and TfR1 from the cell surface, and to enable target protein entry into the lysosomal degradation pathway. We show that TransTACs can efficiently degrade a diverse range of single-pass, multi-pass, native or synthetic membrane proteins, including epidermal growth factor receptor, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1, cluster of differentiation 20 and chimeric antigen receptor. In example applications, TransTACs enabled the reversible control of human primary chimeric antigen receptor T cells and the targeting of drug-resistant epidermal growth factor receptor-driven lung cancer with the exon 19 deletion/T790M/C797S mutations in a mouse xenograft model. TransTACs represent a promising new family of bifunctional antibodies for precise manipulation of membrane proteins and targeted cancer therapy. Transferrin receptor targeting chimeras have been developed that enable targeting of drug resistance in epidermal growth factor receptor-driven lung cancer and reversible control of human primary chimeric antigen receptor T cells, representing a promising new family of bifunctional antibodies for targeted cancer therapy.",

As a unique GB subset, {112} incoherent twin boundaries (ITBs) are ubiquitous in nanotwinned, face-centred cubic materials6–9. Although multiple ITB configurations and transitions have been reported7,10, their transition mechanisms and impacts on mechanical properties remain largely unexplored, especially in regard to covalent materials. Here we report atomic observations of six ITB configurations and structural transitions in diamond at room temperature, showing a dislocation-mediated mechanism different from metallic systems11,12. The dominant ITBs are asymmetric and less mobile, contributing strongly to continuous hardening in nanotwinned diamond13. The potential driving forces of ITB activities are discussed. Our findings shed new light on GB behaviour in diamond and covalent materials, pointing to a new strategy for development of high-performance, nanotwinned materials. We report atomic observations of six incoherent twin boundary configurations and structural transitions in diamond at room temperature, showing a dislocation-mediated mechanism different from metallic systems and shedding new light on grain boundary behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Disease-associated astrocyte subsets contribute to the pathology of neurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis1–8 (EAE), an experimental model for multiple sclerosis. However, little is known about the stability of these astrocyte subsets and their ability to integrate past stimulation events. Here we report the identification of an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset that exhibits exacerbated pro-inflammatory responses upon rechallenge. Specifically, using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, focused interrogation of cells by nucleic acid detection and sequencing, and cell-specific in vivo CRISPR–Cas9-based genetic perturbation studies we established that astrocyte memory is controlled by the metabolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), which produces acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) that is used by histone acetyltransferase p300 to control chromatin accessibility. The number of ACLY+p300+ memory astrocytes is increased in acute and chronic EAE models, and their genetic inactivation ameliorated EAE. We also detected the pro-inflammatory memory phenotype in human astrocytes in vitro; single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry studies detected increased numbers of ACLY+p300+ astrocytes in chronic multiple sclerosis lesions. In summary, these studies define an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset that promotes CNS pathology in EAE and, potentially, multiple sclerosis. These findings may guide novel therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis and other neurologic diseases. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model in mice, a subset of astrocytes retains an epigenetically regulated memory of past inflammation, causing exacerbated inflammation upon subsequent rechallenge.",

    "abstract": "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity from interference1,2. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal persistent activity are coordinated by theta–gamma phase–amplitude coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory. In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality. We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity representations of working memory content that were associated with improved behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory1,2, with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related areas3–5. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes. Hippocampal theta–gamma phase–amplitude coupling integrates cognitive control and working memory storage across brain areas in humans.",

    "abstract": "The intimate relationship between the epithelium and immune system is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis, with perturbations therein linked to autoimmune disease and cancer1–3. Whereas stem cell-derived organoids are powerful models of epithelial function4, they lack tissue-resident immune cells that are essential for capturing organ-level processes. We describe human intestinal immuno-organoids (IIOs), formed through self-organization of epithelial organoids and autologous tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells, a portion of which integrate within the epithelium and continuously survey the barrier. TRM cell migration and interaction with epithelial cells was orchestrated by TRM cell-enriched transcriptomic programs governing cell motility and adhesion. We combined IIOs and single-cell transcriptomics to investigate intestinal inflammation triggered by cancer-targeting biologics in patients. Inflammation was associated with the emergence of an activated population of CD8+ T cells that progressively acquired intraepithelial and cytotoxic features. The appearance of this effector population was preceded and potentiated by a T helper-1-like CD4+ population, which initially produced cytokines and subsequently became cytotoxic itself. As a system amenable to direct perturbation, IIOs allowed us to identify the Rho pathway as a new target for mitigation of immunotherapy-associated intestinal inflammation. Given that they recapitulate both the phenotypic outcomes and underlying interlineage immune interactions, IIOs can be used to study tissue-resident immune responses in the context of tumorigenesis and infectious and autoimmune diseases. We combined human intestinal immuno-organoids and single-cell transcriptomics to investigate intestinal inflammation triggered by cancer-targeting biologics, which was associated with an activated population of CD8+ T cells that progressively acquired intraepithelial and cytotoxic features.",

    "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have undergone rapid development in the past decade. However, there is still a lack of systematic studies investigating whether the empirical rules of working lifetime assessment used for silicon solar cells can be applied to pero-SCs. It is believed that pero-SCs show enhanced stability under day/night cycling owing to the reported self-healing effect in the dark1,2. Here we find that the degradation of highly efficient FAPbI3 pero-SCs is much faster under a natural day/night cycling mode, bringing into question the widely accepted approach to estimate the operational lifetime of pero-SCs based on continuous-mode testing. We reveal the key factor to be the lattice strain caused by thermal expansion and shrinking of the perovskite during operation, an effect that gradually relaxes under the continuous-illumination mode but cycles synchronously under the cycling mode3,4. The periodic lattice strain under the cycling mode results in deep trap accumulation and chemical degradation during operation, decreasing the ion-migration potential and hence the device lifetime5. We introduce phenylselenenyl chloride to regulate the perovskite lattice strain during day/night cycling, achieving a certified efficiency of 26.3 per cent and a 10-fold improvement in the time required to reach 80% of peak efficiency (T80) under the cycling mode after the modification. Perovskite solar cells degrade quickly under natural day/night cycling, compared with continuous illumination, owing to periodic lattice strain during cycling; the lattice strain can be regulated by adding phenylselenenyl chloride.",

    "abstract": "Stress response pathways detect and alleviate adverse conditions to safeguard cell and tissue homeostasis, yet their prolonged activation induces apoptosis and disrupts organismal health1–3. How stress responses are turned off at the right time and place remains poorly understood. Here we report a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism that silences the cellular response to mitochondrial protein import stress. Crucial to this process is the silencing factor of the integrated stress response (SIFI), a large E3 ligase complex mutated in ataxia and in early-onset dementia that degrades both unimported mitochondrial precursors and stress response components. By recognizing bifunctional substrate motifs that equally encode protein localization and stability, the SIFI complex turns off a general stress response after a specific stress event has been resolved. Pharmacological stress response silencing sustains cell survival even if stress resolution failed, which underscores the importance of signal termination and provides a roadmap for treating neurodegenerative diseases caused by mitochondrial import defects. The E3 ligase SIFI is identified as a dedicated silencing factor of the integrated stress response, a finding that has implications for the development of therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases caused by mitochondrial protein import stress.",

    "abstract": "Microbiome research is now demonstrating a growing number of bacterial strains and genes that affect our health1. Although CRISPR-derived tools have shown great success in editing disease-driving genes in human cells2, we currently lack the tools to achieve comparable success for bacterial targets in situ. Here we engineer a phage-derived particle to deliver a base editor and modify Escherichia coli colonizing the mouse gut. Editing of a β-lactamase gene in a model E. coli strain resulted in a median editing efficiency of 93% of the target bacterial population with a single dose. Edited bacteria were stably maintained in the mouse gut for at least 42 days following treatment. This was achieved using a non-replicative DNA vector, preventing maintenance and dissemination of the payload. We then leveraged this approach to edit several genes of therapeutic relevance in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in vitro and demonstrate in situ editing of a gene involved in the production of curli in a pathogenic E. coli strain. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of modifying bacteria directly in the gut, offering a new avenue to investigate the function of bacterial genes and opening the door to the design of new microbiome-targeted therapies. Edited bacteria were stably maintained in mouse gut for at least 42 days following the delivery of a base editor using an engineered phage-derived particle to modify Escherichia coli colonizing the gut.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a common cause of mortality1, but a comprehensive description of its genomic landscape is lacking2–9. Here we perform whole-genome sequencing of 2,023 CRC samples from participants in the UK 100,000 Genomes Project, thereby providing a highly detailed somatic mutational landscape of this cancer. Integrated analyses identify more than 250 putative CRC driver genes, many not previously implicated in CRC or other cancers, including several recurrent changes outside the coding genome. We extend the molecular pathways involved in CRC development, define four new common subgroups of microsatellite-stable CRC based on genomic features and show that these groups have independent prognostic associations. We also characterize several rare molecular CRC subgroups, some with potential clinical relevance, including cancers with both microsatellite and chromosomal instability. We demonstrate a spectrum of mutational profiles across the colorectum, which reflect aetiological differences. These include the role of Escherichia colipks+ colibactin in rectal cancers10 and the importance of the SBS93 signature11–13, which suggests that diet or smoking is a risk factor. Immune-escape driver mutations14 are near-ubiquitous in hypermutant tumours and occur in about half of microsatellite-stable CRCs, often in the form of HLA copy number changes. Many driver mutations are actionable, including those associated with rare subgroups (for example, BRCA1 and IDH1), highlighting the role of whole-genome sequencing in optimizing patient care. Whole-genome sequencing of more than 2,000 colorectal carcinoma samples provides a highly detailed view of the genomic landscape of this cancer and identifies new driver mutations.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial membranes define distinct structural and functional compartments. Cristae of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) function as independent bioenergetic units that undergo rapid and transient remodelling, but the significance of this compartmentalized organization is unknown1. Using super-resolution microscopy, here we show that cytosolic IMM vesicles, devoid of outer mitochondrial membrane or mitochondrial matrix, are formed during resting state. These vesicles derived from the IMM (VDIMs) are formed by IMM herniation through pores formed by voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Live-cell imaging showed that lysosomes in proximity to mitochondria engulfed the herniating IMM and, aided by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery, led to the formation of VDIMs in a microautophagy-like process, sparing the remainder of the organelle. VDIM formation was enhanced in mitochondria undergoing oxidative stress, suggesting their potential role in maintenance of mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the formation of VDIMs required calcium release by the reactive oxygen species-activated, lysosomal calcium channel, transient receptor potential mucolipin 1, showing an interorganelle communication pathway for maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Thus, IMM compartmentalization could allow for the selective removal of damaged IMM sections via VDIMs, which should protect mitochondria from localized injury. Our findings show a new pathway of intramitochondrial quality control. We show that cytosolic inner mitochondrial membrane vesicles, devoid of outer mitochondrial membrane or mitochondrial matrix, are formed during resting state and directly herniate into lysosomes through pores formed by voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby allowing their selective removal.",

    "abstract": "Current cancer immunotherapy predominately focuses on eliciting type 1 immune responses fighting cancer; however, long-term complete remission remains uncommon1,2. A pivotal question arises as to whether type 2 immunity can be orchestrated alongside type 1-centric immunotherapy to achieve enduring response against cancer3,4. Here we show that an interleukin-4 fusion protein (Fc–IL-4), a typical type 2 cytokine, directly acts on CD8+ T cells and enriches functional terminally exhausted CD8+ T (CD8+ TTE) cells in the tumour. Consequently, Fc–IL-4 enhances antitumour efficacy of type 1 immunity-centric adoptive T cell transfer or immune checkpoint blockade therapies and induces durable remission across several syngeneic and xenograft tumour models. Mechanistically, we discovered that Fc–IL-4 signals through both signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, augmenting the glycolytic metabolism and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) concentration of CD8+ TTE cells in a lactate dehydrogenase A-dependent manner. The metabolic modulation mediated by Fc–IL-4 is indispensable for reinvigorating intratumoural CD8+ TTE cells. These findings underscore Fc–IL-4 as a potent type 2 cytokine-based immunotherapy that synergizes effectively with type 1 immunity to elicit long-lasting responses against cancer. Our study not only sheds light on the synergy between these two types of immune responses, but also unveils an innovative strategy for advancing next-generation cancer immunotherapy by integrating type 2 immune factors. Fc–IL-4, a typical type 2 cytokine, reinvigorates exhausted CD8+ T cells in tumours, underscoring this fusion protein as a potent immunotherapy that synergizes effectively with type 1 immunity against cancer.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining micron-thick perovskite films of high quality is key to realizing efficient and stable positive (p)-intrinsic (i)-negative (n) perovskite solar cells1,2, but it remains a challenge. Here we report an effective method for producing high-quality, micron-thick formamidinium-based perovskite films by forming coherent grain boundaries, in which high-Miller-index-oriented grains grow on the low-Miller-index-oriented grains in a stabilized atmosphere. The resulting micron-thick perovskite films, with enhanced grain boundaries and grains, showed stable material properties and outstanding optoelectronic performances. The small-area solar cells achieved efficiencies of 26.1%. The 1-cm2 devices and 5 cm × 5 cm mini-modules delivered efficiencies of 24.3% and 21.4%, respectively. The devices processed in a stabilized atmosphere presented a high reproducibility across all four seasons. The encapsulated devices exhibited superior long-term stability under both light and thermal stressors in ambient air. High-quality micron-thick perovskite films with high-Miller-index-oriented grains can be used to achieve high-performance solar cells and modules.",

    "abstract": "The development of bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) catalysis has expanded cross-coupling chemistries by enabling the selective combination of any primary radical with any secondary or tertiary radical through a radical sorting mechanism1–8. Biomimetic9,10 SH2 catalysis can be used to merge common feedstock chemicals—such as alcohols, acids and halides—in various permutations for the construction of a single C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond. The ability to sort these two distinct radicals across commercially available alkenes in a three-component manner would enable the simultaneous construction of two C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds, greatly accelerating access to complex molecules and drug-like chemical space11. However, the simultaneous in situ formation of electrophilic and primary nucleophilic radicals in the presence of unactivated alkenes is problematic, typically leading to statistical radical recombination, hydrogen atom transfer, disproportionation and other deleterious pathways12,13. Here we report the use of bimolecular homolytic substitution catalysis to sort an electrophilic radical and a nucleophilic radical across an unactivated alkene. This reaction involves the in situ formation of three distinct radical species, which are then differentiated by size and electronics, allowing for regioselective formation of the desired dialkylated products. This work accelerates access to pharmaceutically relevant C(sp3)-rich molecules and defines a distinct mechanistic approach for alkene dialkylation. We use bimolecular homolytic substitution catalysis to sort an electrophilic radical and a nucleophilic radical across an unactivated alkene, accelerating access to pharmaceutically relevant C(sp3)-rich molecules and defining a mechanistic approach for alkene dialkylation.",

    "abstract": "Severe influenza A virus (IAV) infections can result in hyper-inflammation, lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome1–5 (ARDS), for which there are no effective pharmacological therapies. Necroptosis is an attractive entry point for therapeutic intervention in ARDS and related inflammatory conditions because it drives pathogenic lung inflammation and lethality during severe IAV infection6–8 and can potentially be targeted by receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) inhibitors. Here we show that a newly developed RIPK3 inhibitor, UH15-38, potently and selectively blocked IAV-triggered necroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells in vivo. UH15-38 ameliorated lung inflammation and prevented mortality following infection with laboratory-adapted and pandemic strains of IAV, without compromising antiviral adaptive immune responses or impeding viral clearance. UH15-38 displayed robust therapeutic efficacy even when administered late in the course of infection, suggesting that RIPK3 blockade may provide clinical benefit in patients with IAV-driven ARDS and other hyper-inflammatory pathologies. A newly developed RIPK3 inhibitor blocks necroptosis of lung cells, reduces lung inflammation and prevents mortality in a mouse model of influenza A virus infection.",

    "abstract": "WRN helicase is a promising target for treatment of cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI) due to its essential role in resolving deleterious non-canonical DNA structures that accumulate in cells with faulty mismatch repair mechanisms1–5. Currently there are no approved drugs directly targeting human DNA or RNA helicases, in part owing to the challenging nature of developing potent and selective compounds to this class of proteins. Here we describe the chemoproteomics-enabled discovery of a clinical-stage, covalent allosteric inhibitor of WRN, VVD-133214. This compound selectively engages a cysteine (C727) located in a region of the helicase domain subject to interdomain movement during DNA unwinding. VVD-133214 binds WRN protein cooperatively with nucleotide and stabilizes compact conformations lacking the dynamic flexibility necessary for proper helicase function, resulting in widespread double-stranded DNA breaks, nuclear swelling and cell death in MSI-high (MSI-H), but not in microsatellite-stable, cells. The compound was well tolerated in mice and led to robust tumour regression in multiple MSI-H colorectal cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Our work shows an allosteric approach for inhibition of WRN function that circumvents competition from an endogenous ATP cofactor in cancer cells, and designates VVD-133214 as a promising drug candidate for patients with MSI-H cancers. VVD-133214, a clinical-stage, covalent allosteric inhibitor of the helicase WRN, was well tolerated in mice and led to robust tumour regression in multiple microsatellite-instability-high colorectal cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models.",

    "abstract": "Increasing planting density is a key strategy for enhancing maize yields1–3. An ideotype for dense planting requires a ‘smart canopy’ with leaf angles at different canopy layers differentially optimized to maximize light interception and photosynthesis4–6, among other features. Here we identified leaf angle architecture of smart canopy 1 (lac1), a natural mutant with upright upper leaves, less erect middle leaves and relatively flat lower leaves. lac1 has improved photosynthetic capacity and attenuated responses to shade under dense planting. lac1 encodes a brassinosteroid C-22 hydroxylase that predominantly regulates upper leaf angle. Phytochrome A photoreceptors accumulate in shade and interact with the transcription factor RAVL1 to promote its degradation via the 26S proteasome, thereby inhibiting activation of lac1 by RAVL1 and decreasing brassinosteroid levels. This ultimately decreases upper leaf angle in dense fields. Large-scale field trials demonstrate that lac1 boosts maize yields under high planting densities. To quickly introduce lac1 into breeding germplasm, we transformed a haploid inducer and recovered homozygous lac1 edits from 20 diverse inbred lines. The tested doubled haploids uniformly acquired smart-canopy-like plant architecture. We provide an important target and an accelerated strategy for developing high-density-tolerant cultivars, with lac1 serving as a genetic chassis for further engineering of a smart canopy in maize. A natural mutant of maize exhibits leaf characteristics in line with the ‘smart canopy’ ideotype for high-density planting and boosts yields in large-scale field trials.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring (native) sugars and carbohydrates contain numerous hydroxyl groups of similar reactivity1,2. Chemists, therefore, rely typically on laborious, multi-step protecting-group strategies3 to convert these renewable feedstocks into reagents (glycosyl donors) to make glycans. The direct transformation of native sugars to complex saccharides remains a notable challenge. Here we describe a photoinduced approach to achieve site- and stereoselective chemical glycosylation from widely available native sugar building blocks, which through homolytic (one-electron) chemistry bypasses unnecessary hydroxyl group masking and manipulation. This process is reminiscent of nature in its regiocontrolled generation of a transient glycosyl donor, followed by radical-based cross-coupling with electrophiles on activation with light. Through selective anomeric functionalization of mono- and oligosaccharides, this protecting-group-free ‘cap and glycosylate’ approach offers straightforward access to a wide array of metabolically robust glycosyl compounds. Owing to its biocompatibility, the method was extended to the direct post-translational glycosylation of proteins. A radical-based method for functionalizing native sugars shows a way to remove typical protecting-group manipulations.",

    "abstract": "Life-threatening thrombotic events and neurological symptoms are prevalent in COVID-19 and are persistent in patients with long COVID experiencing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection1–4. Despite the clinical evidence1,5–7, the underlying mechanisms of coagulopathy in COVID-19 and its consequences in inflammation and neuropathology remain poorly understood and treatment options are insufficient. Fibrinogen, the central structural component of blood clots, is abundantly deposited in the lungs and brains of patients with COVID-19, correlates with disease severity and is a predictive biomarker for post-COVID-19 cognitive deficits1,5,8–10. Here we show that fibrin binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, forming proinflammatory blood clots that drive systemic thromboinflammation and neuropathology in COVID-19. Fibrin, acting through its inflammatory domain, is required for oxidative stress and macrophage activation in the lungs, whereas it suppresses natural killer cells, after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fibrin promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal loss after infection, as well as innate immune activation in the brain and lungs independently of active infection. A monoclonal antibody targeting the inflammatory fibrin domain provides protection from microglial activation and neuronal injury, as well as from thromboinflammation in the lung after infection. Thus, fibrin drives inflammation and neuropathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and fibrin-targeting immunotherapy may represent a therapeutic intervention for patients with acute COVID-19 and long COVID.

    "abstract": "Low soil moisture and high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) cause plant water stress and lead to a variety of drought responses, including a reduction in transpiration and photosynthesis1,2. When soils dry below critical soil moisture thresholds, ecosystems transition from energy to water limitation as stomata close to alleviate water stress3,4. However, the mechanisms behind these thresholds remain poorly defined at the ecosystem scale. Here, by analysing observations of critical soil moisture thresholds globally, we show the prominent role of soil texture in modulating the onset of ecosystem water limitation through the soil hydraulic conductivity curve, whose steepness increases with sand fraction. This clarifies how ecosystem sensitivity to VPD versus soil moisture is shaped by soil texture, with ecosystems in sandy soils being relatively more sensitive to soil drying, whereas ecosystems in clayey soils are relatively more sensitive to VPD. For the same reason, plants in sandy soils have limited potential to adjust to water limitations, which has an impact on how climate change affects terrestrial ecosystems. In summary, although vegetation–atmosphere exchanges are driven by atmospheric conditions and mediated by plant adjustments, their fate is ultimately dependent on the soil. Through their effects on soil hydraulic properties, soil texture and sand content are shown to have broad implications for the terrestrial water cycle and carbon sink, and specific implications for vital ecosystems that are vulnerable to drought, especially with changing climate.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous laboratories can accelerate discoveries in chemical synthesis, but this requires automated measurements coupled with reliable decision-making1,2. Most autonomous laboratories involve bespoke automated equipment3–6, and reaction outcomes are often assessed using a single, hard-wired characterization technique7. Any decision-making algorithms8 must then operate using this narrow range of characterization data9,10. By contrast, manual experiments tend to draw on a wider range of instruments to characterize reaction products, and decisions are rarely taken based on one measurement alone. Here we show that a synthesis laboratory can be integrated into an autonomous laboratory by using mobile robots11–13 that operate equipment and make decisions in a human-like way. Our modular workflow combines mobile robots, an automated synthesis platform, a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometer and a benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. This allows robots to share existing laboratory equipment with human researchers without monopolizing it or requiring extensive redesign. A heuristic decision-maker processes the orthogonal measurement data, selecting successful reactions to take forward and automatically checking the reproducibility of any screening hits. We exemplify this approach in the three areas of structural diversification chemistry, supramolecular host–guest chemistry and photochemical synthesis. This strategy is particularly suited to exploratory chemistry that can yield multiple potential products, as for supramolecular assemblies, where we also extend the method to an autonomous function assay by evaluating host–guest binding properties. A modular autonomous platform for general exploratory synthetic chemistry uses mobile robots to integrate an automated synthesis platform and two analysis platforms.",

    "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) catalyses the oxidation of water through a four-step cycle of Si states (i = 0–4) at the Mn4CaO5 cluster1–3, during which an extra oxygen (O6) is incorporated at the S3 state to form a possible dioxygen4–7. Structural changes of the metal cluster and its environment during the S-state transitions have been studied on the microsecond timescale. Here we use pump-probe serial femtosecond crystallography to reveal the structural dynamics of PSII from nanoseconds to milliseconds after illumination with one flash (1F) or two flashes (2F). YZ, a tyrosine residue that connects the reaction centre P680 and the Mn4CaO5 cluster, showed structural changes on a nanosecond timescale, as did its surrounding amino acid residues and water molecules, reflecting the fast transfer of electrons and protons after flash illumination. Notably, one water molecule emerged in the vicinity of Glu189 of the D1 subunit of PSII (D1-E189), and was bound to the Ca2+ ion on a sub-microsecond timescale after 2F illumination. This water molecule disappeared later with the concomitant increase of O6, suggesting that it is the origin of O6. We also observed concerted movements of water molecules in the O1, O4 and Cl-1 channels and their surrounding amino acid residues to complete the sequence of electron transfer, proton release and substrate water delivery. These results provide crucial insights into the structural dynamics of PSII during S-state transitions as well as O–O bond formation. Serial femtosecond crystallography reveals the structural dynamics of photosystem II during the S-state transitions that produce dioxygen, providing insight into electron transfer, water insertion, proton release and O–O bond formation on sub-microsecond timescales.",

    "abstract": "Electrode-based electrical stimulation underpins several clinical bioelectronic devices, including deep-brain stimulators1,2 and cardiac pacemakers3. However, leadless multisite stimulation is constrained by the technical difficulties and spatial-access limitations of electrode arrays. Optogenetics offers optically controlled random access with high spatiotemporal capabilities, but clinical translation poses challenges4–6. Here we show tunable spatiotemporal photostimulation of cardiac systems using a non-genetic platform based on semiconductor-enabled biomodulation interfaces. Through spatiotemporal profiling of photoelectrochemical currents, we assess the magnitude, precision, accuracy and resolution of photostimulation in four leadless silicon-based monolithic photoelectrochemical devices. We demonstrate the optoelectronic capabilities of the devices through optical overdrive pacing of cultured cardiomyocytes (CMs) targeting several regions and spatial extents, isolated rat hearts in a Langendorff apparatus, in vivo rat hearts in an ischaemia model and an in vivo mouse heart model with transthoracic optical pacing. We also perform the first, to our knowledge, optical override pacing and multisite pacing of a pig heart in vivo. Our systems are readily adaptable for minimally invasive clinical procedures using our custom endoscopic delivery device, with which we demonstrate closed-thoracic operations and endoscopic optical stimulation. Our results indicate the clinical potential of the leadless, lightweight and multisite photostimulation platform as a pacemaker in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), in which lead-placement complications are common. A silicon-based electrode system is described that allows tunable spatiotemporal photostimulation of cardiac systems, with the optoelectronic capabilities of these devices being demonstrated in mouse, rat and pig heart models.",

    "abstract": "Moiré superlattices formed by twisted stacking in van der Waals materials have emerged as a new platform for exploring the physics of strongly correlated materials and other emergent phenomena1–5. However, there remains a lack of research on the mechanical properties of twisted-layer van der Waals materials, owing to a lack of suitable strategies for making three-dimensional bulk materials. Here we report the successful synthesis of a polycrystalline boron nitride bulk ceramic with high room-temperature deformability and strength. This ceramic, synthesized from an onion-like boron nitride nanoprecursor with conventional spark plasma sintering and hot-pressing sintering, consists of interlocked laminated nanoplates in which parallel laminae are stacked with varying twist angles. The compressive strain of this bulk ceramic can reach 14% before fracture, about one order of magnitude higher compared with traditional ceramics (less than 1% in general), whereas the compressive strength is about six times that of ordinary hexagonal boron nitride layered ceramics. The exceptional mechanical properties are due to a combination of the elevated intrinsic deformability of the twisted layering in the nanoplates and the three-dimensional interlocked architecture that restricts deformation from propagating across individual nanoplates. The advent of this twisted-layer boron nitride bulk ceramic opens a gate to the fabrication of highly deformable bulk ceramics. A bulk ceramic composed of interlocked boron nitride nanoplates with a laminated structure of twist-stacked nanoslices is created using hot-pressing and spark plasma sintering, which exhibits large elastic and plastic deformability and high strength at room temperature.",

    "abstract": "Bitter taste sensing is mediated by type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs (also known as T2Rs)), which represent a distinct class of G-protein-coupled receptors1. Among the 26 members of the TAS2Rs, TAS2R14 is highly expressed in extraoral tissues and mediates the responses to more than 100 structurally diverse tastants2–6, although the molecular mechanisms for recognizing diverse chemicals and initiating cellular signalling are still poorly understood. Here we report two cryo-electron microscopy structures for TAS2R14 complexed with Ggust (also known as gustducin) and Gi1. Both structures have an orthosteric binding pocket occupied by endogenous cholesterol as well as an intracellular allosteric site bound by the bitter tastant cmpd28.1, including a direct interaction with the α5 helix of Ggust and Gi1. Computational and biochemical studies validate both ligand interactions. Our functional analysis identified cholesterol as an orthosteric agonist and the bitter tastant cmpd28.1 as a positive allosteric modulator with direct agonist activity at TAS2R14. Moreover, the orthosteric pocket is connected to the allosteric site via an elongated cavity, which has a hydrophobic core rich in aromatic residues. Our findings provide insights into the ligand recognition of bitter taste receptors and suggest activities of TAS2R14 beyond bitter taste perception via intracellular allosteric tastants. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the type 2 taste receptor TAS2R14 in complex with Ggust and Gi1 identify cholesterol as an orthosteric agonist and the bitter tastant cmpd28.1 as a positive allosteric modulator and agonist.",

    "abstract": "Hydroformylation is an industrial process for the production of aldehydes from alkenes1,2. Regioselective hydroformylation of propene to high-value n-butanal is particularly important, owing to a wide range of bulk applications of n-butanal in the manufacture of various necessities in human daily life3. Supported rhodium (Rh) hydroformylation catalysts, which often excel in catalyst recyclability, ease of separation and adaptability for continuous-flow processes, have been greatly exploited4. Nonetheless, they usually consist of rotationally flexible and sterically unconstrained Rh hydride dicarbonyl centres, only affording limited regioselectivity to n-butanal5–8. Here we show that proper encapsulation of Rh species comprising Rh(I)-gem-dicarbonyl centres within a MEL zeolite framework allows the breaking of the above model. The optimized catalyst exhibits more than 99% regioselectivity to n-butanal and more than 99% selectivity to aldehydes at a product formation turnover frequency (TOF) of 6,500 h−1, surpassing the performance of all heterogeneous and most homogeneous catalysts developed so far. Our comprehensive studies show that the zeolite framework can act as a scaffold to steer the reaction pathway of the intermediates confined in the space between the zeolite framework and Rh centres towards the exclusive formation of n-butanal. Rhodium catalysts confined in zeolite pores exhibit high regioselectivity in the hydroformylation process of propene to high-value n-butanal, surpassing the performance of all heterogeneous and most homogeneous catalysts developed so far.",

    "abstract": "Adoptively transferred T cells and agents designed to block the CD47–SIRPα axis are promising cancer therapeutics that activate distinct arms of the immune system1,2. Here we administered anti-CD47 antibodies in combination with adoptively transferred T cells with the goal of enhancing antitumour efficacy but observed abrogated therapeutic benefit due to rapid macrophage-mediated clearance of T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or engineered T cell receptors. Anti-CD47-antibody-mediated CAR T cell clearance was potent and rapid enough to serve as an effective safety switch. To overcome this challenge, we engineered the CD47 variant CD47(Q31P) (47E), which engages SIRPα and provides a ‘don’t eat me’ signal that is not blocked by anti-CD47 antibodies. TCR or CAR T cells expressing 47E are resistant to clearance by macrophages after treatment with anti-CD47 antibodies, and mediate substantial, sustained macrophage recruitment to the tumour microenvironment. Although many of the recruited macrophages manifested an M2-like profile3, the combined therapy synergistically enhanced antitumour efficacy. Our study identifies macrophages as major regulators of T cell persistence and illustrates the fundamental challenge of combining T-cell-directed therapeutics with those designed to activate macrophages. It delivers a therapeutic approach that is capable of simultaneously harnessing the antitumour effects of T cells and macrophages, offering enhanced potency against solid tumours. Combination of TCR or CAR T cells expressing the engineered CD47 variant 47E with anti-CD47 antibody therapy results in synergistic antitumour efficacy due to T cell resistance to clearance by macrophages, while maintaining macrophage recruitment into the tumour microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Tumours can obtain nutrients and oxygen required to progress and metastasize through the blood supply1. Inducing angiogenesis involves the sprouting of established vessel beds and their maturation into an organized network2,3. Here we generate a comprehensive atlas of tumour vasculature at single-cell resolution, encompassing approximately 200,000 cells from 372 donors representing 31 cancer types. Trajectory inference suggested that tumour angiogenesis was initiated from venous endothelial cells and extended towards arterial endothelial cells. As neovascularization elongates (through angiogenic stages SI, SII and SIII), APLN+ tip cells at the SI stage (APLN+ TipSI) advanced to TipSIII cells with increased Notch signalling. Meanwhile, stalk cells, following tip cells, transitioned from high chemokine expression to elevated TEK (also known as Tie2) expression. Moreover, APLN+ TipSI cells not only were associated with disease progression and poor prognosis but also hold promise for predicting response to anti-VEGF therapy. Lymphatic endothelial cells demonstrated two distinct differentiation lineages: one responsible for lymphangiogenesis and the other involved in antigen presentation. In pericytes, endoplasmic reticulum stress was associated with the proangiogenic BASP1+ matrix-producing pericytes. Furthermore, intercellular communication analysis showed that neovascular endothelial cells could shape an immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to angiogenesis. This study depicts the complexity of tumour vasculature and has potential clinical significance for anti-angiogenic therapy. An atlas of tumour vasculature shows that tumour angiogenesis is initiated from venous endothelial cells and extended towards arterial endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Around 60% of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) remain undiagnosed after comprehensive genetic testing, primarily of protein-coding genes1. Large genome-sequenced cohorts are improving our ability to discover new diagnoses in the non-coding genome. Here we identify the non-coding RNA RNU4-2 as a syndromic NDD gene. RNU4-2 encodes the U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which is a critical component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex of the major spliceosome2. We identify an 18 base pair region of RNU4-2 mapping to two structural elements in the U4/U6 snRNA duplex (the T-loop and stem III) that is severely depleted of variation in the general population, but in which we identify heterozygous variants in 115 individuals with NDD. Most individuals (77.4%) have the same highly recurrent single base insertion (n.64_65insT). In 54 individuals in whom it could be determined, the de novo variants were all on the maternal allele. We demonstrate that RNU4-2 is highly expressed in the developing human brain, in contrast to RNU4-1 and other U4 homologues. Using RNA sequencing, we show how 5′ splice-site use is systematically disrupted in individuals with RNU4-2 variants, consistent with the known role of this region during spliceosome activation. Finally, we estimate that variants in this 18 base pair region explain 0.4% of individuals with NDD. This work underscores the importance of non-coding genes in rare disorders and will provide a diagnosis to thousands of individuals with NDD worldwide. The non-coding RNA RNU4-2, which is highly expressed in the developing human brain, is identified as a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder gene, and, using RNA sequencing, 5′ splice-site use is shown to be systematically disrupted in individuals with RNU4-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Global emission reduction efforts continue to be insufficient to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement1. This makes the systematic exploration of so-called overshoot pathways that temporarily exceed a targeted global warming limit before drawing temperatures back down to safer levels a priority for science and policy2–5. Here we show that global and regional climate change and associated risks after an overshoot are different from a world that avoids it. We find that achieving declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including for sea-level rise and cryosphere changes. However, the possibility that global warming could be reversed many decades into the future might be of limited relevance for adaptation planning today. Temperature reversal could be undercut by strong Earth-system feedbacks resulting in high near-term and continuous long-term warming6,7. To hedge and protect against high-risk outcomes, we identify the geophysical need for a preventive carbon dioxide removal capacity of several hundred gigatonnes. Yet, technical, economic and sustainability considerations may limit the realization of carbon dioxide removal deployment at such scales8,9. Therefore, we cannot be confident that temperature decline after overshoot is achievable within the timescales expected today. Only rapid near-term emission reductions are effective in reducing climate risks. Aiming for declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including sea-level rise and cryosphere changes.",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging provides high-dimensional spatial–temporal–spectral information showing intrinsic matter characteristics1–5. Here we report an on-chip computational hyperspectral imaging framework with high spatial and temporal resolution. By integrating different broadband modulation materials on the image sensor chip, the target spectral information is non-uniformly and intrinsically coupled to each pixel with high light throughput. Using intelligent reconstruction algorithms, multi-channel images can be recovered from each frame, realizing real-time hyperspectral imaging. Following this framework, we fabricated a broadband visible–near-infrared (400–1,700 nm) hyperspectral image sensor using photolithography, with an average light throughput of 74.8% and 96 wavelength channels. The demonstrated resolution is 1,024 × 1,024 pixels at 124 fps. We demonstrated its wide applications, including chlorophyll and sugar quantification for intelligent agriculture, blood oxygen and water quality monitoring for human health, textile classification and apple bruise detection for industrial automation, and remote lunar detection for astronomy. The integrated hyperspectral image sensor weighs only tens of grams and can be assembled on various resource-limited platforms or equipped with off-the-shelf optical systems. The technique transforms the challenge of high-dimensional imaging from a high-cost manufacturing and cumbersome system to one that is solvable through on-chip compression and agile computation. A broadband hyperspectral image sensor fabricated using photolithography maintains high throughput with high spatial–temporal–spectral resolution, and has demonstrated wide applications including chlorophyll and sugar quantification, blood oxygen and water quality monitoring, textile classification, apple bruise detection, and remote lunar detection.",

    "abstract": "The genetic code of living cells has been reprogrammed to enable the site-specific incorporation of hundreds of non-canonical amino acids into proteins, and the encoded synthesis of non-canonical polymers and macrocyclic peptides and depsipeptides1–3. Current methods for engineering orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to acylate new monomers, as required for the expansion and reprogramming of the genetic code, rely on translational readouts and therefore require the monomers to be ribosomal substrates4–6. Orthogonal synthetases cannot be evolved to acylate orthogonal tRNAs with non-canonical monomers (ncMs) that are poor ribosomal substrates, and ribosomes cannot be evolved to polymerize ncMs that cannot be acylated onto orthogonal tRNAs—this co-dependence creates an evolutionary deadlock that has essentially restricted the scope of translation in living cells to α-l-amino acids and closely related hydroxy acids. Here we break this deadlock by developing tRNA display, which enables direct, rapid and scalable selection for orthogonal synthetases that selectively acylate their cognate orthogonal tRNAs with ncMs in Escherichia coli, independent of whether the ncMs are ribosomal substrates. Using tRNA display, we directly select orthogonal synthetases that specifically acylate their cognate orthogonal tRNA with eight non-canonical amino acids and eight ncMs, including several β-amino acids, α,α-disubstituted-amino acids and β-hydroxy acids. We build on these advances to demonstrate the genetically encoded, site-specific cellular incorporation of β-amino acids and α,α-disubstituted amino acids into a protein, and thereby expand the chemical scope of the genetic code to new classes of monomers. tRNA display enables the direct selection of orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that acylate orthogonal tRNAs with non-canonical monomers, enabling in vivo synthesis of proteins that include these monomers and expanding the repertoire of the genetic code.",

Herein we introduce a scalable, high-resolution, 3D printing technique for the fabrication of shape-specific particles based on roll-to-roll continuous liquid interface production (r2rCLIP).

We demonstrate r2rCLIP production of mouldable and non-mouldable shapes with voxel sizes as small as 2.0 × 2.0 µm2 in the print plane and 1.1 ± 0.3 µm unsupported thickness, at speeds of up to 1,000,000 particles per day.

    "abstract": "Immune imprinting is a phenomenon in which prior antigenic experiences influence responses to subsequent infection or vaccination1,2. The effects of immune imprinting on serum antibody responses after boosting with variant-matched SARS-CoV-2 vaccines remain uncertain. Here we characterized the serum antibody responses after mRNA vaccine boosting of mice and human clinical trial participants. In mice, a single dose of a preclinical version of mRNA-1273 vaccine encoding Wuhan-1 spike protein minimally imprinted serum responses elicited by Omicron boosters, enabling generation of type-specific antibodies. However, imprinting was observed in mice receiving an Omicron booster after two priming doses of mRNA-1273, an effect that was mitigated by a second booster dose of Omicron vaccine. In both SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected humans who received two Omicron-matched boosters after two or more doses of the prototype mRNA-1273 vaccine, spike-binding and neutralizing serum antibodies cross-reacted with Omicron variants as well as more distantly related sarbecoviruses. Because serum neutralizing responses against Omicron strains and other sarbecoviruses were abrogated after pre-clearing with Wuhan-1 spike protein, antibodies induced by XBB.1.5 boosting in humans focus on conserved epitopes targeted by the antecedent mRNA-1273 primary series. Thus, the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters in humans is imprinted by immunizations with historical mRNA-1273 vaccines, but this outcome may be beneficial as it drives expansion of cross-neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and distantly related sarbecoviruses. In mouse experiments and in clinical trials in humans, boosting with Omicron-specific mRNA following immunization with Wuhan-1 spike mRNA results in immune responses focused on conserved rather than variant-specific epitopes.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between exoplanetary atmospheres and internal properties have long been proposed to be drivers of the inflation mechanisms of gaseous planets and apparent atmospheric chemical disequilibrium conditions1. However, transmission spectra of exoplanets have been limited in their ability to observationally confirm these theories owing to the limited wavelength coverage of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and inferences of single molecules, mostly H2O (ref. 2). In this work, we present the panchromatic transmission spectrum of the approximately 750 K, low-density, Neptune-sized exoplanet WASP-107b using a combination of HST Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and JWST Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). From this spectrum, we detect spectroscopic features resulting from H2O (21σ), CH4 (5σ), CO (7σ), CO2 (29σ), SO2 (9σ) and NH3 (6σ). The presence of these molecules enables constraints on the atmospheric metal enrichment (M/H is 10–18× solar3), vertical mixing strength (log10Kzz = 8.4–9.0 cm2 s−1) and internal temperature (>345 K). The high internal temperature is suggestive of tidally driven inflation4 acting on a Neptune-like internal structure, which can naturally explain the large radius and low density of the planet. These findings suggest that eccentricity-driven tidal heating is a critical process governing atmospheric chemistry and interior-structure inferences for most of the cool (<1,000 K) super-Earth-to-Saturn-mass exoplanet population. Analysis of the panchromatic transmission spectrum of the warm, low-density, Neptune-sized exoplanet WASP-107b from instruments aboard the HST and JWST suggests that tidal interaction with its host star led to changes in its atmospheric chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow is valuable for clinical neurocritical care and fundamental neurovascular research. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography is a widely used non-invasive method for evaluating cerebral blood flow1, but the conventional rigid design severely limits the measurement accuracy of the complex three-dimensional (3D) vascular networks and the practicality for prolonged recording2. Here we report a conformal ultrasound patch for hands-free volumetric imaging and continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow. The 2 MHz ultrasound waves reduce the attenuation and phase aberration caused by the skull, and the copper mesh shielding layer provides conformal contact to the skin while improving the signal-to-noise ratio by 5 dB. Ultrafast ultrasound imaging based on diverging waves can accurately render the circle of Willis in 3D and minimize human errors during examinations. Focused ultrasound waves allow the recording of blood flow spectra at selected locations continuously. The high accuracy of the conformal ultrasound patch was confirmed in comparison with a conventional TCD probe on 36 participants, showing a mean difference and standard deviation of difference as −1.51 ± 4.34 cm s−1, −0.84 ± 3.06 cm s−1 and −0.50 ± 2.55 cm s−1 for peak systolic velocity, mean flow velocity, and end diastolic velocity, respectively. The measurement success rate was 70.6%, compared with 75.3% for a conventional TCD probe. Furthermore, we demonstrate continuous blood flow spectra during different interventions and identify cascades of intracranial B waves during drowsiness within 4 h of recording. A conformal ultrasound patch can be used for hands-free volumetric imaging and continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric catalysis enables the synthesis of optically active compounds, often requiring the differentiation between two substituents on prochiral substrates1. Despite decades of development of mainly noble metal catalysts, achieving differentiation between substituents with similar steric and electronic properties remains a notable challenge2,3. Here we introduce a class of Earth-abundant manganese catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of dialkyl ketimines to give a range of chiral amine products. These catalysts distinguish between pairs of minimally differentiated alkyl groups bound to the ketimine, such as methyl and ethyl, and even subtler distinctions, such as ethyl and n-propyl. The degree of enantioselectivity can be adjusted by modifying the components of the chiral manganese catalyst. This reaction demonstrates a wide substrate scope and achieves a turnover number of up to 107,800. Our mechanistic studies indicate that exceptional stereoselectivity arises from the modular assembly of confined chiral catalysts and cooperative non-covalent interactions between the catalyst and the substrate. An Earth-abundant manganese catalyst that can hydrogenate imines to amines with high enantioselectivity works even for small differences in the groups on the imine, which is still a challenge for precious metal catalysts.",

Yet current frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew10–12, Axiom and Polaris.

The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions.

    "abstract": "Interindividual genetic variation affects the susceptibility to and progression of many diseases1,2. However, efforts to study how individual human brains differ in normal development and disease phenotypes are limited by the paucity of faithful cellular human models, and the difficulty of scaling current systems to represent multiple people. Here we present human brain Chimeroids, a highly reproducible, multidonor human brain cortical organoid model generated by the co-development of cells from a panel of individual donors in a single organoid. By reaggregating cells from multiple single-donor organoids at the neural stem cell or neural progenitor cell stage, we generate Chimeroids in which each donor produces all cell lineages of the cerebral cortex, even when using pluripotent stem cell lines with notable growth biases. We used Chimeroids to investigate interindividual variation in the susceptibility to neurotoxic triggers that exhibit high clinical phenotypic variability: ethanol and the antiepileptic drug valproic acid. Individual donors varied in both the penetrance of the effect on target cell types, and the molecular phenotype within each affected cell type. Our results suggest that human genetic background may be an important mediator of neurotoxin susceptibility and introduce Chimeroids as a scalable system for high-throughput investigation of interindividual variation in processes of brain development and disease. An analysis in 3D multidonor Chimeroids—a scalable multidonor human brain organoid model—shows that human genetic background may be an important mediator of neurotoxin susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing methods to make large language models more powerful and amenable have been based on continuous scaling up (that is, increasing their size, data volume and computational resources1) and bespoke shaping up (including post-filtering2,3, fine tuning or use of human feedback4,5). However, larger and more instructable large language models may have become less reliable. By studying the relationship between difficulty concordance, task avoidance and prompting stability of several language model families, here we show that easy instances for human participants are also easy for the models, but scaled-up, shaped-up models do not secure areas of low difficulty in which either the model does not err or human supervision can spot the errors. We also find that early models often avoid user questions but scaled-up, shaped-up models tend to give an apparently sensible yet wrong answer much more often, including errors on difficult questions that human supervisors frequently overlook. Moreover, we observe that stability to different natural phrasings of the same question is improved by scaling-up and shaping-up interventions, but pockets of variability persist across difficulty levels. These findings highlight the need for a fundamental shift in the design and development of general-purpose artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes areas for which a predictable distribution of errors is paramount. Scaling up and shaping up large language models increased their tendency to provide sensible yet incorrect answers at difficulty levels humans cannot supervise, highlighting the need for a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence design towards reliability.",

    "abstract": "Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a fatal drug-induced skin reaction triggered by common medications and is an emerging public health issue1–3. Patients with TEN undergo severe and sudden epidermal detachment caused by keratinocyte cell death. Although molecular mechanisms that drive keratinocyte cell death have been proposed, the main drivers remain unknown, and there is no effective therapy for TEN4–6. Here, to systematically map molecular changes that are associated with TEN and identify potential druggable targets, we utilized deep visual proteomics, which provides single-cell-based, cell-type-resolution proteomics7,8. We analysed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived skin tissue biopsies of three types of cutaneous drug reactions with varying severity and quantified more than 5,000 proteins in keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating immune cells. This revealed a marked enrichment of type I and type II interferon signatures in the immune cell and keratinocyte compartment of patients with TEN, as well as phosphorylated STAT1 activation. Targeted inhibition with the pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in vitro reduced keratinocyte-directed cytotoxicity. In vivo oral administration of tofacitinib, baricitinib or the JAK1-specific inhibitors abrocitinib or upadacitinib ameliorated clinical and histological disease severity in two distinct mouse models of TEN. Crucially, treatment with JAK inhibitors (JAKi) was safe and associated with rapid cutaneous re-epithelialization and recovery in seven patients with TEN. This study uncovers the JAK/STAT and interferon signalling pathways as key pathogenic drivers of TEN and demonstrates the potential of targeted JAKi as a curative therapy. Cell-type-resolved spatial proteomics of the skin from patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis reveals that it is driven by JAK/STAT signaling, leading to successful treatment of this potentially fatal condition in patients using JAK inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Green indium phosphide (InP)-based quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) still suffer from low efficiency and short operational lifetime, posing a critical challenge to fully cadmium-free QD-LED displays and lighting1–3. Unfortunately, the factors that underlie these limitations remain unclear and, therefore, no clear device-engineering guidelines are available. Here, by using electrically excited transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that the low efficiency of state-of-the-art green cadmium-free QD-LEDs (which ubiquitously adopt the InP–ZnSeS–ZnS core–shell–shell structure) originates from the ZnSeS interlayer because it imposes a high injection barrier that limits the electron concentration and trap saturation. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that replacing the currently widely used ZnSeS interlayer with a thickened ZnSe interlayer enables improved electron injection and depressed leakage simultaneously, allowing to achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.68% and T95 lifetime (time for the luminance to drop to 95% of the initial value) of 1,241 h at an initial brightness of 1,000 cd m–2 in green InP-based QD-LEDs emitting at 543 nm—exceeding the previous best values by a factor of 1.6 and 165, respectively3,4. Replacing ZnSeS with a thickened ZnSe layer in green InP-based QD-LEDs improves the efficiency and lifetime, boosting electron injection and reducing leakage, enabling 26.68% external quantum efficiency and 1,241 h T95 lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs), embedded in the spectrum of free-space waves1,2 with diverging radiative quality factor, are topologically non-trivial dark modes in open-cavity resonators that have enabled important advances in photonics3,4. However, it is particularly challenging to achieve maximum near-field enhancement, as this requires matching radiative and non-radiative losses. Here we propose the concept of supercritical coupling, drawing inspiration from electromagnetically induced transparency in near-field coupled resonances close to the Friedrich–Wintgen condition2. Supercritical coupling occurs when the near-field coupling between dark and bright modes compensates for the negligible direct far-field coupling with the dark mode. This enables a quasi-BIC field to reach maximum enhancement imposed by non-radiative loss, even when the radiative quality factor is divergent. Our experimental design consists of a photonic-crystal nanoslab covered with upconversion nanoparticles. Near-field coupling is finely tuned at the nanostructure edge, in which a coherent upconversion luminescence enhanced by eight orders of magnitude is observed. The emission shows negligible divergence, narrow width at the microscale and controllable directivity through input focusing and polarization. This approach is relevant to various physical processes, with potential applications for light-source development, energy harvesting and photochemical catalysis. An experimental design consisting of a photonic-crystal nanoslab covered with upconversion nanoparticles demonstrates the phenomenon of supercritical coupling, resulting in giant enhancement of upconversion by photonic bound states in the continuum.",

    "abstract": "The generation of spectrally pure microwave signals is a critical functionality in fundamental and applied sciences, including metrology and communications. Optical frequency combs enable the powerful technique of optical frequency division (OFD) to produce microwave oscillations of the highest quality1,2. Current implementations of OFD require multiple lasers, with space- and energy-consuming optical stabilization and electronic feedback components, resulting in device footprints incompatible with integration into a compact and robust photonic platform3–5. Here we demonstrate all-optical OFD on a photonic chip by synchronizing two distinct dynamical states of Kerr microresonators pumped by a single continuous-wave laser. The inherent stability of the terahertz beat frequency between the signal and idler fields of an optical parametric oscillator is transferred to a microwave frequency of a Kerr soliton comb, and synchronization is achieved via a coupling waveguide without the need for electronic locking. OFD factors of N = 34 and 468 are achieved for 227 GHz and 16 GHz soliton combs, respectively. In particular, OFD enables a 46 dB phase-noise reduction for the 16 GHz soliton comb, resulting in the lowest microwave noise observed in an integrated photonics platform. Our work represents a simple, effective approach for performing OFD and provides a pathway towards chip-scale devices that can generate microwave frequencies comparable to the purest tones produced in metrological laboratories. We demonstrate an all-optical, mode-locking, Kerr-comb frequency division method that provides a chip-scale microwave source that is extremely versatile, accurate, stable and has ultralow noise, using only a single continuous-wave laser.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing rocky exoplanets is a central aim of astronomy, and yet the search for atmospheres on rocky exoplanets has so far resulted in either tight upper limits on the atmospheric mass1–3 or inconclusive results4–6. The 1.95REarth and 8.8MEarth planet 55 Cancri e (abbreviated 55 Cnc e), with a predominantly rocky composition and an equilibrium temperature of around 2,000 K, may have a volatile envelope (containing molecules made from a combination of C, H, O, N, S and P elements) that accounts for up to a few percent of its radius7–13. The planet has been observed extensively with transmission spectroscopy14–22 and its thermal emission has been measured in broad photometric bands23–26. These observations disfavour a primordial H2/He-dominated atmosphere but cannot conclusively determine whether the planet has a secondary atmosphere27,28. Here we report a thermal emission spectrum of the planet obtained by the NIRCam and MIRI instruments aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) from 4 to 12 μm. The measurements rule out the scenario in which the planet is a lava world shrouded by a tenuous atmosphere made of vaporized rock29–32 and indicate a bona fide volatile atmosphere that is probably rich in CO2 or CO. This atmosphere can be outgassed from and sustained by a magma ocean. The thermal emission spectrum of the rocky exoplanet 55 Cancri e obtained by the NIRCAM and MIRI instruments aboard the JWST indicates that it has a secondary volatile-rich atmosphere, possibly arising from a magma ocean.",

    "abstract": "For many adult human organs, tissue regeneration during chronic disease remains a controversial subject. Regenerative processes are easily observed in animal models, and their underlying mechanisms are becoming well characterized1–4, but technical challenges and ethical aspects are limiting the validation of these results in humans. We decided to address this difficulty with respect to the liver. This organ displays the remarkable ability to regenerate after acute injury, although liver regeneration in the context of recurring injury remains to be fully demonstrated. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 47 liver biopsies from patients with different stages of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease to establish a cellular map of the liver during disease progression. We then combined these single-cell-level data with advanced 3D imaging to reveal profound changes in the liver architecture. Hepatocytes lose their zonation and considerable reorganization of the biliary tree takes place. More importantly, our study uncovers transdifferentiation events that occur between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes without the presence of adult stem cells or developmental progenitor activation. Detailed analyses and functional validations using cholangiocyte organoids confirm the importance of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway in this process, thereby connecting this acquisition of plasticity to insulin signalling. Together, our data indicate that chronic injury creates an environment that induces cellular plasticity in human organs, and understanding the underlying mechanisms of this process could open new therapeutic avenues in the management of chronic diseases. Single-cell RNA sequencing and 3D imaging have revealed the cellular changes and structural reorganization that occur during the progression of human chronic liver disease and as the liver attempts to regenerate.",

    "abstract": "T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is a high-risk tumour1 that has eluded comprehensive genomic characterization, which is partly due to the high frequency of noncoding genomic alterations that result in oncogene deregulation2,3. Here we report an integrated analysis of genome and transcriptome sequencing of tumour and remission samples from more than 1,300 uniformly treated children with T-ALL, coupled with epigenomic and single-cell analyses of malignant and normal T cell precursors. This approach identified 15 subtypes with distinct genomic drivers, gene expression patterns, developmental states and outcomes. Analyses of chromatin topology revealed multiple mechanisms of enhancer deregulation that involve enhancers and genes in a subtype-specific manner, thereby demonstrating widespread involvement of the noncoding genome. We show that the immunophenotypically described, high-risk entity of early T cell precursor ALL is superseded by a broader category of ‘early T cell precursor-like’ leukaemia. This category has a variable immunophenotype and diverse genomic alterations of a core set of genes that encode regulators of hematopoietic stem cell development. Using multivariable outcome models, we show that genetic subtypes, driver and concomitant genetic alterations independently predict treatment failure and survival. These findings provide a roadmap for the classification, risk stratification and mechanistic understanding of this disease. Comprehensive genomic and transcriptomics analyses of more than 1,300 cases of childhood T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia identify 15 distinct subtypes that are associated with specific outcomes.",

    "abstract": "An issue that affects the scaling-up development of perovskite photovoltaics is the marked efficiency drop when enlarging the device area, caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of defected sites1–3. In the narrow band gap formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), the native impurities of PbI2 and δ-FAPbI3 non-perovskite could induce unfavoured non-radiative recombination, as well as inferior charge transport and extraction4,5. Here we develop an impurity-healing interface engineering strategy to address the issue in small-area solar cells and large-scale submodules. With the introduction of a functional cation, 2-(1-cyclohexenyl)ethyl ammonium, two-dimensional perovskite with high mobility is rationally constructed on FAPbI3 to horizontally cover the film surface and to vertically penetrate the grain boundaries of three-dimensional perovskites. This unique configuration not only comprehensively transforms the PbI2 and δ-FAPbI3 impurities into stable two-dimensional perovskite and realizes uniform defect passivation but also provides interconnecting channels for efficient carrier transport. As a result, the FAPbI3-based small-area (0.085 cm2) solar cells achieve a champion efficiency of more than 25.86% with a notably high fill factor of 86.16%. The fabricated submodules with an aperture area of 715.1 cm2 obtain a certified record efficiency of 22.46% with a good fill factor of 81.21%, showcasing the feasibility and effectualness of the impurity-healing interface engineering for scaling-up promotion with well-preserved photovoltaic performance. An impurity-healing interface engineering strategy is developed to address the issue in small-area solar cells and large-scale submodules.",

    "abstract": "For stable and efficient fusion energy production using a tokamak reactor, it is essential to maintain a high-pressure hydrogenic plasma without plasma disruption. Therefore, it is necessary to actively control the tokamak based on the observed plasma state, to manoeuvre high-pressure plasma while avoiding tearing instability, the leading cause of disruptions. This presents an obstacle-avoidance problem for which artificial intelligence based on reinforcement learning has recently shown remarkable performance1–4. However, the obstacle here, the tearing instability, is difficult to forecast and is highly prone to terminating plasma operations, especially in the ITER baseline scenario. Previously, we developed a multimodal dynamic model that estimates the likelihood of future tearing instability based on signals from multiple diagnostics and actuators5. Here we harness this dynamic model as a training environment for reinforcement-learning artificial intelligence, facilitating automated instability prevention. We demonstrate artificial intelligence control to lower the possibility of disruptive tearing instabilities in DIII-D6, the largest magnetic fusion facility in the United States. The controller maintained the tearing likelihood under a given threshold, even under relatively unfavourable conditions of low safety factor and low torque. In particular, it allowed the plasma to actively track the stable path within the time-varying operational space while maintaining H-mode performance, which was challenging with traditional preprogrammed control. This controller paves the path to developing stable high-performance operational scenarios for future use in ITER. Artificial intelligence control is used to avoid the emergence of disruptive tearing instabilities in the magnetically confined fusion plasma in the DIII-D tokamak reactor.",

    "abstract": "Immune cells rely on transient physical interactions with other immune and non-immune populations to regulate their function1. To study these ‘kiss-and-run’ interactions directly in vivo, we previously developed LIPSTIC (labelling immune partnerships by SorTagging intercellular contacts)2, an approach that uses enzymatic transfer of a labelled substrate between the molecular partners CD40L and CD40 to label interacting cells. Reliance on this pathway limited the use of LIPSTIC to measuring interactions between CD4+ T helper cells and antigen-presenting cells, however. Here we report the development of a universal version of LIPSTIC (uLIPSTIC), which can record physical interactions both among immune cells and between immune and non-immune populations irrespective of the receptors and ligands involved. We show that uLIPSTIC can be used, among other things, to monitor the priming of CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells, reveal the steady-state cellular partners of regulatory T cells and identify germinal centre-resident T follicular helper cells on the basis of their ability to interact cognately with germinal centre B cells. By coupling uLIPSTIC with single-cell transcriptomics, we build a catalogue of the immune populations that physically interact with intestinal epithelial cells at the steady state and profile the evolution of the interactome of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific CD8+ T cells in multiple organs following systemic infection. Thus, uLIPSTIC provides a broadly useful technology for measuring and understanding cell–cell interactions across multiple biological systems. A paper reports the development of a universal tool for studying cellular interactions in biological systems, and demonstrates its coupling with single-cell transcriptomics methods to provide insights into the biology of the interactions.",

    "abstract": "The valley degree of freedom1–4 of electrons in materials promises routes towards energy-efficient information storage with enticing prospects for quantum information processing5–7. Current challenges in utilizing valley polarization are symmetry conditions that require monolayer structures8,9 or specific material engineering10–13, non-resonant optical control to avoid energy dissipation and the ability to switch valley polarization at optical speed. We demonstrate all-optical and non-resonant control over valley polarization using bulk MoS2, a centrosymmetric material without Berry curvature at the valleys. Our universal method utilizes spin angular momentum-shaped trefoil optical control pulses14,15 to switch the material’s electronic topology and induce valley polarization by transiently breaking time and space inversion symmetry16 through a simple phase rotation. We confirm valley polarization through the transient generation of the second harmonic of a non-collinear optical probe pulse, depending on the trefoil phase rotation. The investigation shows that direct optical control over the valley degree of freedom is not limited to monolayer structures. Indeed, such control is possible for systems with an arbitrary number of layers and for bulk materials. Non-resonant valley control is universal and, at optical speeds, unlocks the possibility of engineering efficient multimaterial valleytronic devices operating on quantum coherent timescales. We develop an optical method that can set and read the state of electrons in the valley polarization of bulk transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, with potential utility as digital storage at quantum coherent timescales and application in quantum computing.",

    "abstract": "Pyroptosis is a lytic cell death mode that helps limit the spread of infections and is also linked to pathology in sterile inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases1–4. During pyroptosis, inflammasome activation and the engagement of caspase-1 lead to cell death, along with the maturation and secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β). The dominant effect of IL-1β in promoting tissue inflammation has clouded the potential influence of other factors released from pyroptotic cells. Here, using a system in which macrophages are induced to undergo pyroptosis without IL-1β or IL-1α release (denoted Pyro−1), we identify unexpected beneficial effects of the Pyro−1 secretome. First, we noted that the Pyro−1 supernatants upregulated gene signatures linked to migration, cellular proliferation and wound healing. Consistent with this gene signature, Pyro−1 supernatants boosted migration of primary fibroblasts and macrophages, and promoted faster wound closure in vitro and improved tissue repair in vivo. In mechanistic studies, lipidomics and metabolomics of the Pyro−1 supernatants identified the presence of both oxylipins and metabolites, linking them to pro-wound-healing effects. Focusing specifically on the oxylipin prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), we find that its synthesis is induced de novo during pyroptosis, downstream of caspase-1 activation and cyclooxygenase-2 activity; further, PGE2 synthesis occurs late in pyroptosis, with its release dependent on gasdermin D pores opened during pyroptosis. As for the pyroptotic metabolites, they link to immune cell infiltration into the wounds, and polarization to CD301+ macrophages. Collectively, these data advance the concept that the pyroptotic secretome possesses oxylipins and metabolites with tissue repair properties that may be harnessed therapeutically. Defining the composition of the secretome of pyroptotic macrophages reveals the involvement of the component factors in wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) structures composed of atomically thin materials with high carrier mobility have been studied as candidates for future transistors1–4. However, owing to the unavailability of suitable high-quality dielectrics, 2D field-effect transistors (FETs) cannot attain the full theoretical potential and advantages despite their superior physical and electrical properties3,5,6. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of atomically thin single-crystalline Al2O3 (c-Al2O3) as a high-quality top-gate dielectric in 2D FETs. By using intercalative oxidation techniques, a stable, stoichiometric and atomically thin c-Al2O3 layer with a thickness of 1.25 nm is formed on the single-crystalline Al surface at room temperature. Owing to the favourable crystalline structure and well-defined interfaces, the gate leakage current, interface state density and dielectric strength of c-Al2O3 meet the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems requirements3,5,7. Through a one-step transfer process consisting of the source, drain, dielectric materials and gate, we achieve top-gate MoS2 FETs characterized by a steep subthreshold swing of 61 mV dec−1, high on/off current ratio of 108 and very small hysteresis of 10 mV. This technique and material demonstrate the possibility of producing high-quality single-crystalline oxides suitable for integration into fully scalable advanced 2D FETs, including negative capacitance transistors and spin transistors. By using intercalative oxidation techniques, stable, stoichiometric and atomically thin single-crystalline Al2O3 films can be produced, which can be effectively used as a dielectric in top-gated field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional materials.",

    "abstract": "Undesired coupling to the surrounding environment destroys long-range correlations in quantum processors and hinders coherent evolution in the nominally available computational space. This noise is an outstanding challenge when leveraging the computation power of near-term quantum processors1. It has been shown that benchmarking random circuit sampling with cross-entropy benchmarking can provide an estimate of the effective size of the Hilbert space coherently available2–8. Nevertheless, quantum algorithms’ outputs can be trivialized by noise, making them susceptible to classical computation spoofing. Here, by implementing an algorithm for random circuit sampling, we demonstrate experimentally that two phase transitions are observable with cross-entropy benchmarking, which we explain theoretically with a statistical model. The first is a dynamical transition as a function of the number of cycles and is the continuation of the anti-concentration point in the noiseless case. The second is a quantum phase transition controlled by the error per cycle; to identify it analytically and experimentally, we create a weak-link model, which allows us to vary the strength of the noise versus coherent evolution. Furthermore, by presenting a random circuit sampling experiment in the weak-noise phase with 67 qubits at 32 cycles, we demonstrate that the computational cost of our experiment is beyond the capabilities of existing classical supercomputers. Our experimental and theoretical work establishes the existence of transitions to a stable, computationally complex phase that is reachable with current quantum processors. By implementing random circuit sampling, experimental and theoretical results establish the existence of transitions to a stable, computationally complex phase that is reachable with current quantum processors.",

    "abstract": "Adoptive T cell therapies have produced exceptional responses in a subset of patients with cancer. However, therapeutic efficacy can be hindered by poor T cell persistence and function1. In human T cell cancers, evolution of the disease positively selects for mutations that improve fitness of T cells in challenging situations analogous to those faced by therapeutic T cells. Therefore, we reasoned that these mutations could be co-opted to improve T cell therapies. Here we systematically screened the effects of 71 mutations from T cell neoplasms on T cell signalling, cytokine production and in vivo persistence in tumours. We identify a gene fusion, CARD11–PIK3R3, found in a CD4+ cutaneous T cell lymphoma2, that augments CARD11–BCL10–MALT1 complex signalling and anti-tumour efficacy of therapeutic T cells in several immunotherapy-refractory models in an antigen-dependent manner. Underscoring its potential to be deployed safely, CARD11–PIK3R3-expressing cells were followed up to 418 days after T cell transfer in vivo without evidence of malignant transformation. Collectively, our results indicate that exploiting naturally occurring mutations represents a promising approach to explore the extremes of T cell biology and discover how solutions derived from evolution of malignant T cells can improve a broad range of T cell therapies. A study examines the effects of mutations that occur naturally in T cell cancers, reporting that such mutations can potentially be exploited to increase the potency of T cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "Van der Waals encapsulation of two-dimensional materials in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) stacks is a promising way to create ultrahigh-performance electronic devices1–4. However, contemporary approaches for achieving van der Waals encapsulation, which involve artificial layer stacking using mechanical transfer techniques, are difficult to control, prone to contamination and unscalable. Here we report the transfer-free direct growth of high-quality graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) in hBN stacks. The as-grown embedded GNRs exhibit highly desirable features being ultralong (up to 0.25 mm), ultranarrow (<5 nm) and homochiral with zigzag edges. Our atomistic simulations show that the mechanism underlying the embedded growth involves ultralow GNR friction when sliding between AA′-stacked hBN layers. Using the grown structures, we demonstrate the transfer-free fabrication of embedded GNR field-effect devices that exhibit excellent performance at room temperature with mobilities of up to 4,600 cm2 V–1 s–1 and on–off ratios of up to 106. This paves the way for the bottom-up fabrication of high-performance electronic devices based on embedded layered materials. A strategy for the transfer-free direct growth of ultralong, high-quality graphene nanoribbons, which have desirable electronic properties, between layers of a boron nitride insulator is reported.",

    "abstract": "OSCA/TMEM63 channels are the largest known family of mechanosensitive channels1–3, playing critical roles in plant4–7 and mammalian8,9 mechanotransduction. Here we determined 44 cryogenic electron microscopy structures of OSCA/TMEM63 channels in different environments to investigate the molecular basis of OSCA/TMEM63 channel mechanosensitivity. In nanodiscs, we mimicked increased membrane tension and observed a dilated pore with membrane access in one of the OSCA1.2 subunits. In liposomes, we captured the fully open structure of OSCA1.2 in the inside-in orientation, in which the pore shows a large lateral opening to the membrane. Unusually for ion channels, structural, functional and computational evidence supports the existence of a ‘proteo-lipidic pore’ in which lipids act as a wall of the ion permeation pathway. In the less tension-sensitive homologue OSCA3.1, we identified an ‘interlocking’ lipid tightly bound in the central cleft, keeping the channel closed. Mutation of the lipid-coordinating residues induced OSCA3.1 activation, revealing a conserved open conformation of OSCA channels. Our structures provide a global picture of the OSCA channel gating cycle, uncover the importance of bound lipids and show that each subunit can open independently. This expands both our understanding of channel-mediated mechanotransduction and channel pore formation, with important mechanistic implications for the TMEM16 and TMC protein families. The molecular basis of OSCA/TMEM63 channel mechanosensitivity was investigated by determining 44 cryogenic electron microscopy structures of channels in different environments, expanding understanding of channel-mediated mechanotransduction and pore formation, with implications for two protein families.",

    "abstract": "Rare coding variants that substantially affect function provide insights into the biology of a gene1–3. However, ascertaining the frequency of such variants requires large sample sizes4–8. Here we present a catalogue of human protein-coding variation, derived from exome sequencing of 983,578 individuals across diverse populations. In total, 23% of the Regeneron Genetics Center Million Exome (RGC-ME) data come from individuals of African, East Asian, Indigenous American, Middle Eastern and South Asian ancestry. The catalogue includes more than 10.4 million missense and 1.1 million predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants. We identify individuals with rare biallelic pLOF variants in 4,848 genes, 1,751 of which have not been previously reported. From precise quantitative estimates of selection against heterozygous loss of function (LOF), we identify 3,988 LOF-intolerant genes, including 86 that were previously assessed as tolerant and 1,153 that lack established disease annotation. We also define regions of missense depletion at high resolution. Notably, 1,482 genes have regions that are depleted of missense variants despite being tolerant of pLOF variants. Finally, we estimate that 3% of individuals have a clinically actionable genetic variant, and that 11,773 variants reported in ClinVar with unknown significance are likely to be deleterious cryptic splice sites. To facilitate variant interpretation and genetics-informed precision medicine, we make this resource of coding variation from the RGC-ME dataset publicly accessible through a variant allele frequency browser. A dataset of coding variation, derived from exome sequencing of nearly one million individuals from a range of ancestries, provides insight into rare variants and could accelerate the discovery of disease-associated genes and advance precision medicine efforts.",

    "abstract": "Transcription is the primary regulatory step in gene expression. Divergent transcription initiation from promoters and enhancers produces stable RNAs from genes and unstable RNAs from enhancers1,2. Nascent RNA capture and sequencing assays simultaneously measure gene and enhancer activity in cell populations3. However, fundamental questions about the temporal regulation of transcription and enhancer–gene coordination remain unanswered, primarily because of the absence of a single-cell perspective on active transcription. In this study, we present scGRO–seq—a new single-cell nascent RNA sequencing assay that uses click chemistry—and unveil coordinated transcription throughout the genome. We demonstrate the episodic nature of transcription and the co-transcription of functionally related genes. scGRO–seq can estimate burst size and frequency by directly quantifying transcribing RNA polymerases in individual cells and can leverage replication-dependent non-polyadenylated histone gene transcription to elucidate cell cycle dynamics. The single-nucleotide spatial and temporal resolution of scGRO–seq enables the identification of networks of enhancers and genes. Our results suggest that the bursting of transcription at super-enhancers precedes bursting from associated genes. By imparting insights into the dynamic nature of global transcription and the origin and propagation of transcription signals, we demonstrate the ability of scGRO–seq to investigate the mechanisms of transcription regulation and the role of enhancers in gene expression. Nascent transcription in genes and enhancers genome-wide at the single-cell level is quantified using global run-on and sequencing (GRO–seq) with click chemistry.",

    "abstract": "The gravitational wave detectors have shown a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way1–3 and whose origin is debated4–6. According to a possible explanation, these black holes may have formed from density fluctuations in the early Universe (primordial black holes)7–9, and they should comprise several to 100% of dark matter to explain the observed black hole merger rates10–12. If these black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years13. The previous experiments were not sufficiently sensitive to such events14–17. Here we present the results of the search for long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of nearly 80 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud that were monitored for 20 years by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment survey18. We did not find any events with timescales longer than 1 year, whereas all shorter events detected may be explained by known stellar populations. We find that compact objects in the mass range from 1.8 × 10−4M⊙ to 6.3M⊙ cannot make up more than 1% of dark matter, and those in the mass range from 1.3 × 10−5M⊙ to 860 M⊙ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. Thus, primordial black holes in this mass range cannot simultaneously explain a substantial fraction of dark matter and gravitational wave events. The results of the search for long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of nearly 80 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud indicate that there are no massive black holes in the Milky Way halo.",

    "abstract": "Most kidney cancers are metabolically dysfunctional1–4, but how this dysfunction affects cancer progression in humans is unknown. We infused 13C-labelled nutrients in over 80 patients with kidney cancer during surgical tumour resection. Labelling from [U-13C]glucose varies across subtypes, indicating that the kidney environment alone cannot account for all tumour metabolic reprogramming. Compared with the adjacent kidney, clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) display suppressed labelling of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates in vivo and in ex vivo organotypic cultures, indicating that suppressed labelling is tissue intrinsic. [1,2-13C]acetate and [U-13C]glutamine infusions in patients, coupled with measurements of respiration in isolated human kidney and tumour mitochondria, reveal lower electron transport chain activity in ccRCCs that contributes to decreased oxidative and enhanced reductive TCA cycle labelling. However, ccRCC metastases unexpectedly have enhanced TCA cycle labelling compared with that of primary ccRCCs, indicating a divergent metabolic program during metastasis in patients. In mice, stimulating respiration or NADH recycling in kidney cancer cells is sufficient to promote metastasis, whereas inhibiting electron transport chain complex I decreases metastasis. These findings in humans and mice indicate that metabolic properties and liabilities evolve during kidney cancer progression, and that mitochondrial function is limiting for metastasis but not growth at the original site.  Studying changes in the metabolic properties of kidney cancer in patients reveals an increased need for mitochondrial metabolism as tumors metastasize from the kidney to distant organs.",

    "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 haemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4b was detected in the USA in 2021. These HPAI viruses caused mortality events in poultry, wild birds and wild mammals. On 25 March 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multistate investigation into milk production losses1. More than 200 positive herds were identified in 14 US states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production and thick yellow milk2,3. The diagnostic investigation revealed viral RNA in milk and alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium in mammary tissue. A single transmission event, probably from birds, was followed by limited local transmission and onward horizontal transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13 (ref. 4). Here we sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. Heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance and production losses. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, pathogenesis, transmission and intervention strategies. A study describes the experimental infection of cattle with a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13 strain using an aerosol respiratory route for heifers and an intramammary route for lactating cows.",

    "abstract": "Linking variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to underlying mechanisms of disease remains a challenge1–3. For some diseases, a successful strategy has been to look for cases in which multiple GWAS loci contain genes that act in the same biological pathway1–6. However, our knowledge of which genes act in which pathways is incomplete, particularly for cell-type-specific pathways or understudied genes. Here we introduce a method to connect GWAS variants to functions. This method links variants to genes using epigenomics data, links genes to pathways de novo using Perturb-seq and integrates these data to identify convergence of GWAS loci onto pathways. We apply this approach to study the role of endothelial cells in genetic risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), and discover 43 CAD GWAS signals that converge on the cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) signalling pathway. Two regulators of this pathway, CCM2 and TLNRD1, are each linked to a CAD risk variant, regulate other CAD risk genes and affect atheroprotective processes in endothelial cells. These results suggest a model whereby CAD risk is driven in part by the convergence of causal genes onto a particular transcriptional pathway in endothelial cells. They highlight shared genes between common and rare vascular diseases (CAD and CCM), and identify TLNRD1 as a new, previously uncharacterized member of the CCM signalling pathway. This approach will be widely useful for linking variants to functions for other common polygenic diseases. Variant-to-gene-to-program is a new approach to building maps of genome function to link risk variants to disease genes and to convergent signalling pathways in an unbiased manner; its strength is demonstrated in coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation and stabilization are promising therapeutic modalities because of their potency, versatility and their potential to expand the druggable target space1,2. However, only a few of the hundreds of E3 ligases and deubiquitinases in the human proteome have been harnessed for this purpose, which substantially limits the potential of the approach. Moreover, there may be other protein classes that could be exploited for protein stabilization or degradation3–5, but there are currently no methods that can identify such effector proteins in a scalable and unbiased manner. Here we established a synthetic proteome-scale platform to functionally identify human proteins that can promote the degradation or stabilization of a target protein in a proximity-dependent manner. Our results reveal that the human proteome contains a large cache of effectors of protein stability. The approach further enabled us to comprehensively compare the activities of human E3 ligases and deubiquitinases, identify and characterize non-canonical protein degraders and stabilizers and establish that effectors have vastly different activities against diverse targets. Notably, the top degraders were more potent against multiple therapeutically relevant targets than the currently used E3 ligases cereblon and VHL. Our study provides a functional catalogue of stability effectors for targeted protein degradation and stabilization and highlights the potential of induced proximity screens for the discovery of new proximity-dependent protein modulators. A synthetic proteome-scale strategy enables the identification of a diverse range of human proteins that can induce the degradation or stabilization of a target protein in a proximity-dependent way.",

    "abstract": "Topological whirls or ‘textures’ of spins such as magnetic skyrmions represent the smallest realizable emergent magnetic entities1–5. They hold considerable promise as robust, nanometre-scale, mobile bits for sustainable computing6–8. A longstanding roadblock to unleashing their potential is the absence of a device enabling deterministic electrical readout of individual spin textures9,10. Here we present the wafer-scale realization of a nanoscale chiral magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) hosting a single, ambient skyrmion. Using a suite of electrical and multimodal imaging techniques, we show that the MTJ nucleates skyrmions of fixed polarity, whose large readout signal—20–70% relative to uniformly magnetized states—corresponds directly to skyrmion size. The MTJ exploits complementary nucleation mechanisms to stabilize distinctly sized skyrmions at zero field, thereby realizing three non-volatile electrical states. Crucially, it can electrically write and delete skyrmions to both uniform states with switching energies 1,000 times lower than the state of the art. Here, the applied voltage emulates a magnetic field and, in contrast to conventional MTJs, it reshapes both the energetics and kinetics of the switching transition, enabling deterministic bidirectional switching. Our stack platform enables large readout and efficient switching, and is compatible with lateral manipulation of skyrmionic bits, providing the much-anticipated backbone for all-electrical skyrmionic device architectures9,10. Its wafer-scale realizability provides a springboard to harness chiral spin textures for multibit memory and unconventional computing8,11. Wafer-scale realization of a nanoscale magnetic tunnel junction hosting a single, ambient skyrmion enables its large readout, efficient switching, and compatibility with lateral manipulation, and thereby provides the backbone for all-electrical skyrmionic device architectures.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity faces unprecedented threats from rapid global change1. Signals of biodiversity change come from time-series abundance datasets for thousands of species over large geographic and temporal scales. Analyses of these biodiversity datasets have pointed to varied trends in abundance, including increases and decreases. However, these analyses have not fully accounted for spatial, temporal and phylogenetic structures in the data. Here, using a new statistical framework, we show across ten high-profile biodiversity datasets2–11 that increases and decreases under existing approaches vanish once spatial, temporal and phylogenetic structures are accounted for. This is a consequence of existing approaches severely underestimating trend uncertainty and sometimes misestimating the trend direction. Under our revised average abundance trends that appropriately recognize uncertainty, we failed to observe a single increasing or decreasing trend at 95% credible intervals in our ten datasets. This emphasizes how little is known about biodiversity change across vast spatial and taxonomic scales. Despite this uncertainty at vast scales, we reveal improved local-scale prediction accuracy by accounting for spatial, temporal and phylogenetic structures. Improved prediction offers hope of estimating biodiversity change at policy-relevant scales, guiding adaptive conservation responses. This study presents an approach to deal with spatial, temporal and phylogenetic non-independence in large-scale analyses of biodiversity change, improving trend estimation and inference across scales.",

    "abstract": "The early evolution of a supernova (SN) can reveal information about the environment and the progenitor star. When a star explodes in vacuum, the first photons to escape from its surface appear as a brief, hours-long shock-breakout flare1,2, followed by a cooling phase of emission. However, for stars exploding within a distribution of dense, optically thick circumstellar material (CSM), the first photons escape from the material beyond the stellar edge and the duration of the initial flare can extend to several days, during which the escaping emission indicates photospheric heating3. Early serendipitous observations2,4 that lacked ultraviolet (UV) data were unable to determine whether the early emission is heating or cooling and hence the nature of the early explosion event. Here we report UV spectra of the nearby SN 2023ixf in the galaxy Messier 101 (M101). Using the UV data as well as a comprehensive set of further multiwavelength observations, we temporally resolve the emergence of the explosion shock from a thick medium heated by the SN emission. We derive a reliable bolometric light curve that indicates that the shock breaks out from a dense layer with a radius substantially larger than typical supergiants. Using ultraviolet data as well as a comprehensive set of further multiwavelength observations of the supernova 2023ixf, a reliable bolometric light curve is derived that indicates the heating nature of the early emission.",

    "abstract": "Liquid crystals, with their ability to self-assemble, strong response to an electric field and integrability into complex systems, are key materials in light-beam manipulation1. The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals2,3 also have considerable second-order optical nonlinearity, making them a potential material for nonlinear optics4,5. Their use as sources of quantum light could considerably extend the boundaries of photonic quantum technologies6. However, spontaneous parametric down-conversion, the basic source of entangled photons7, heralded single photons8 and squeezed light9, has so far not been observed in liquid crystals—or in any liquids or organic materials. Here we implement spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal and demonstrate electric-field tunable broadband generation of entangled photons, with an efficiency comparable to that of the best nonlinear crystals. The emission rate and polarization state of photon pairs is markedly varied by applying a few volts or twisting the molecular orientation along the sample. A liquid-crystal source enables a special type of quasi-phase matching10, which is based on the molecular twist structure and is therefore reconfigurable for the desired spectral and polarization properties of photon pairs. Such sources promise to outperform standard nonlinear optical materials in terms of functionality, brightness and the tunability of the generated quantum state. The concepts developed here can be extended to complex topological structures, macroscopic devices and multi-pixel tunable quantum light sources. Electric-field tunable generation of entangled photon pairs is achieved by spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal, with an efficiency comparable to that of the best nonlinear crystals.",

    "abstract": "The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) provides most of the global seasonal climate forecast skill1–3, yet, quantifying the sources of skilful predictions is a long-standing challenge4–7. Different sources of predictability affect ENSO evolution, leading to distinct global effects. Artificial intelligence forecasts offer promising advancements but linking their skill to specific physical processes is not yet possible8–10, limiting our understanding of the dynamics underpinning the advancements. Here we show that an extended nonlinear recharge oscillator (XRO) model shows skilful ENSO forecasts at lead times up to 16–18 months, better than global climate models and comparable to the most skilful artificial intelligence forecasts. The XRO parsimoniously incorporates the core ENSO dynamics and ENSO’s seasonally modulated interactions with other modes of variability in the global oceans. The intrinsic enhancement of ENSO’s long-range forecast skill is traceable to the initial conditions of other climate modes by means of their memory and interactions with ENSO and is quantifiable in terms of these modes’ contributions to ENSO amplitude. Reforecasts using the XRO trained on climate model output show that reduced biases in both model ENSO dynamics and in climate mode interactions can lead to more skilful ENSO forecasts. The XRO framework’s holistic treatment of ENSO’s global multi-timescale interactions highlights promising targets for improving ENSO simulations and forecasts. An extended nonlinear recharge oscillator model shows skilful and explainable El Niño–Southern Oscillation forecasts at lead times up to 16–18 months, better than global climate models and comparable to the most skilful artificial intelligence forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions urgently requires the large-scale deployment of carbon-capture technologies. These technologies must separate CO2 from various sources and deliver it to different sinks1,2. The quest for optimal solutions for specific source–sink pairs is a complex, multi-objective challenge involving multiple stakeholders and depends on social, economic and regional contexts. Currently, research follows a sequential approach: chemists focus on materials design3 and engineers on optimizing processes4,5, which are then operated at a scale that impacts the economy and the environment. Assessing these impacts, such as the greenhouse gas emissions over the plant’s lifetime, is typically one of the final steps6. Here we introduce the PrISMa (Process-Informed design of tailor-made Sorbent Materials) platform, which integrates materials, process design, techno-economics and life-cycle assessment. We compare more than 60 case studies capturing CO2 from various sources in 5 global regions using different technologies. The platform simultaneously informs various stakeholders about the cost-effectiveness of technologies, process configurations and locations, reveals the molecular characteristics of the top-performing sorbents, and provides insights on environmental impacts, co-benefits and trade-offs. By uniting stakeholders at an early research stage, PrISMa accelerates carbon-capture technology development during this critical period as we aim for a net-zero world. A framework that integrates materials, process design, techno-economics and life-cycle assessment can be used to accelerate the development of carbon-capture technology as we aim for a net-zero world.",

    "abstract": "Groundwater is the most ubiquitous source of liquid freshwater globally, yet its role in supporting diverse ecosystems is rarely acknowledged1,2. However, the location and extent of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are unknown in many geographies, and protection measures are lacking1,3. Here, we map GDEs at high-resolution (roughly 30 m) and find them present on more than one-third of global drylands analysed, including important global biodiversity hotspots4. GDEs are more extensive and contiguous in landscapes dominated by pastoralism with lower rates of groundwater depletion, suggesting that many GDEs are likely to have already been lost due to water and land use practices. Nevertheless, 53% of GDEs exist within regions showing declining groundwater trends, which highlights the urgent need to protect GDEs from the threat of groundwater depletion. However, we found that only 21% of GDEs exist on protected lands or in jurisdictions with sustainable groundwater management policies, invoking a call to action to protect these vital ecosystems. Furthermore, we examine the linkage of GDEs with cultural and socio-economic factors in the Greater Sahel region, where GDEs play an essential role in supporting biodiversity and rural livelihoods, to explore other means for protection of GDEs in politically unstable regions. Our GDE map provides critical information for prioritizing and developing policies and protection mechanisms across various local, regional or international scales to safeguard these important ecosystems and the societies dependent on them. Mapping of groundwater-dependent ecosystems, which support biodiversity and rural livelihoods, shows they occur on more than one-third of global drylands analysed, but lack protections to safeguard these critical ecosystems and the societies dependent upon them from groundwater depletion.",

    "abstract": "Superconductivity in a highly correlated kagome system has been theoretically proposed for years (refs. 1–5), yet the experimental realization is hard to achieve6,7. The recently discovered vanadium-based kagome materials8, which exhibit both superconductivity9–11 and charge-density-wave orders12–14, are nonmagnetic8,9 and weakly correlated15,16. Thus these materials are unlikely to host the exotic superconductivity theoretically proposed. Here we report the discovery of a chromium-based kagome metal, CsCr3Sb5, which is contrastingly featured with strong electron correlations, frustrated magnetism and characteristic flat bands close to the Fermi level. Under ambient pressure, this kagome metal undergoes a concurrent structural and magnetic phase transition at 55 K, with a stripe-like 4a0 structural modulation. At high pressure, the phase transition evolves into two transitions, possibly associated with charge-density-wave and antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave orderings. These density-wave-like orders are gradually suppressed with pressure and, remarkably, a superconducting dome emerges at 3.65–8.0 GPa. The maximum of the superconducting transition temperature, Tcmax = 6.4 K, appears when the density-wave-like orders are completely suppressed at 4.2 GPa, and the normal state exhibits a non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, reminiscent of unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality in iron-based superconductors17,18. Our work offers an unprecedented platform for investigating superconductivity in correlated kagome systems. The emergence of superconductivity under pressure is reported in a chromium-based kagome metal, CsCr3Sb5, which has strong electron correlations, frustrated magnetism and characteristic flat bands close to the Fermi level.",

    "abstract": "Moiré materials have enabled the realization of flat electron bands and quantum phases that are driven by the strong correlations associated with flat bands1–4. Superconductivity has been observed, but only in graphene moiré materials5–9. The absence of robust superconductivity in moiré materials beyond graphene, such as semiconductor moiré materials4, has remained a mystery and challenged our current understanding of superconductivity in flat bands. Here we report the observation of robust superconductivity in both 3.5° and 3.65° twisted bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2), which hosts a hexagonal moiré lattice10,11. Superconductivity emerges near half-band filling and zero external displacement fields. The optimal superconducting transition temperature is about 200 mK in both cases and constitutes about 1–2% of the effective Fermi temperature; the latter is comparable to the value in high-temperature cuprate superconductors12 and suggests strong pairing. The superconductor borders on two distinct metals below and above half-band filling; it undergoes a continuous transition to a correlated insulator by tuning the external displacement field. The observed superconductivity on the verge of Coulomb-induced charge localization suggests roots in strong electron correlations12,13. Robust superconductivity is observed in twisted bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) on the verge of Coulomb-induced charge localization around half-band filling and zero external displacement fields.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular dynamics simulation is a fundamental technology for life sciences research, and its usefulness depends on its accuracy and efficiency1–3. Classical molecular dynamics simulation is fast but lacks chemical accuracy4,5. Quantum chemistry methods such as density functional theory can reach chemical accuracy but cannot scale to support large biomolecules6. Here we introduce an artificial intelligence-based ab initio biomolecular dynamics system (AI2BMD) that can efficiently simulate full-atom large biomolecules with ab initio accuracy. AI2BMD uses a protein fragmentation scheme and a machine learning force field7 to achieve generalizable ab initio accuracy for energy and force calculations for various proteins comprising more than 10,000 atoms. Compared to density functional theory, it reduces the computational time by several orders of magnitude. With several hundred nanoseconds of dynamics simulations, AI2BMD demonstrated its ability to efficiently explore the conformational space of peptides and proteins, deriving accurate 3J couplings that match nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, and showing protein folding and unfolding processes. Furthermore, AI2BMD enables precise free-energy calculations for protein folding, and the estimated thermodynamic properties are well aligned with experiments. AI2BMD could potentially complement wet-lab experiments, detect the dynamic processes of bioactivities and enable biomedical research that is impossible to conduct at present. A study introduces AI2BMD, an artificial intelligence-based dynamics simulation program that uses protein fragmentation with a machine learning force field to accurately and efficiently model the folding and unfolding of large proteins.",

    "abstract": "Unravelling the volcanic history of the enigmatic lunar farside is essential for understanding the hemispheric dichotomy of the Moon1–3. Cratering chronology established for the lunar nearside has been used to suggest long-lived volcanism on the farside of the Moon3,4 but without sample verification. We describe two episodes of basaltic volcanism identified by Pb–Pb dating of basalt fragments returned by the Chang’e-6 mission. One high-Al basalt fragment, dated at 4,203 ± 4 million years ago (Ma), has a source 238U/204Pb ratio (µ value) of approximately 1,620, implying a KREEP-rich (K, rare earth elements and P) source for this oldest-known example of basaltic volcanism among returned samples. The main volcanic episode of the Chang’e-6 basalt documents a surprisingly young eruption age of 2,807 ± 3 Ma, which has not been observed on the nearside of the Moon. The initial Pb isotope compositions of these younger basalts indicate a derivation from a source with a µ value of approximately 360, indicating a KREEP-poor mantle source. Mare volcanism on the lunar farside thus persisted for over 1.4 billion years, even if the source was depleted in heat-producing elements. The consistency between the 2.8-billion-year basalt age and the crater-counting age indicates that the cratering chronology model established for the lunar nearside is also applicable to the farside of the Moon. Volcanism identified by Pb–Pb dating of basalt fragments returned by the Chang’e-6 mission from the farside of the Moon gives a young eruption age of 2,807 ± 3 Ma, consistent with the crater-counting age.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of reproductive barriers is the first step in the formation of new species and can help us understand the diversification of life on Earth. These reproductive barriers often take the form of hybrid incompatibilities, in which alleles derived from two different species no longer interact properly in hybrids1–3. Theory predicts that hybrid incompatibilities may be more likely to arise at rapidly evolving genes4–6 and that incompatibilities involving multiple genes should be common7,8, but there has been sparse empirical data to evaluate these predictions. Here we describe a mitonuclear incompatibility involving three genes whose protein products are in physical contact within respiratory complex I of naturally hybridizing swordtail fish species. Individuals homozygous for mismatched protein combinations do not complete embryonic development or die as juveniles, whereas those heterozygous for the incompatibility have reduced complex I function and unbalanced representation of parental alleles in the mitochondrial proteome. We find that the effects of different genetic interactions on survival are non-additive, highlighting subtle complexity in the genetic architecture of hybrid incompatibilities. Finally, we document the evolutionary history of the genes involved, showing signals of accelerated evolution and evidence that an incompatibility has been transferred between species via hybridization. Analysis of naturally hybridizing swordtail fish species reveals a mitonuclear genetic incompatibility among three genes that encode components of mitochondrial respiratory complex I, providing insights into the emergence of hybrid incompatibilities and reproductive barriers.",

    "abstract": "To navigate, we must continuously estimate the direction we are headed in, and we must correct deviations from our goal1. Direction estimation is accomplished by ring attractor networks in the head direction system2,3. However, we do not fully understand how the sense of direction is used to guide action. Drosophila connectome analyses4,5 reveal three cell populations (PFL3R, PFL3L and PFL2) that connect the head direction system to the locomotor system. Here we use imaging, electrophysiology and chemogenetic stimulation during navigation to show how these populations function. Each population receives a shifted copy of the head direction vector, such that their three reference frames are shifted approximately 120° relative to each other. Each cell type then compares its own head direction vector with a common goal vector; specifically, it evaluates the congruence of these vectors via a nonlinear transformation. The output of all three cell populations is then combined to generate locomotor commands. PFL3R cells are recruited when the fly is oriented to the left of its goal, and their activity drives rightward turning; the reverse is true for PFL3L. Meanwhile, PFL2 cells increase steering speed, and are recruited when the fly is oriented far from its goal. PFL2 cells adaptively increase the strength of steering as directional error increases, effectively managing the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Together, our results show how a map of space in the brain can be combined with an internal goal to generate action commands, via a transformation from world-centric coordinates to body-centric coordinates. Here we show how PFL2 and PFL3 neurons in the Drosophila brain compare a representation of direction with internal spatial goals, both anchored in world-centric coordinates, and produce body-centric steering commands that act to correct deviations from the goal direction.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in mammalian complex traits are prevalent and are intimately associated with androgens1–7. However, a molecular and cellular profile of sex differences and their modulation by androgens is still lacking. Here we constructed a high-dimensional single-cell transcriptomic atlas comprising over 2.3 million cells from 17 tissues in Mus musculus and explored the effects of sex and androgens on the molecular programs and cellular populations. In particular, we found that sex-biased immune gene expression and immune cell populations, such as group 2 innate lymphoid cells, were modulated by androgens. Integration with the UK Biobank dataset revealed potential cellular targets and risk gene enrichment in antigen presentation for sex-biased diseases. This study lays the groundwork for understanding the sex differences orchestrated by androgens and provides important evidence for targeting the androgen pathway as a broad therapeutic strategy for sex-biased diseases. The effects of sex and androgens on the molecular programs and cellular populations are explored using a single-cell transcriptomic atlas comprising over 2.3 million cells from different tissues in Mus musculus.",

    "abstract": "Arctic and alpine tundra ecosystems are large reservoirs of organic carbon1,2. Climate warming may stimulate ecosystem respiration and release carbon into the atmosphere3,4. The magnitude and persistency of this stimulation and the environmental mechanisms that drive its variation remain uncertain5–7. This hampers the accuracy of global land carbon–climate feedback projections7,8. Here we synthesize 136 datasets from 56 open-top chamber in situ warming experiments located at 28 arctic and alpine tundra sites which have been running for less than 1 year up to 25 years. We show that a mean rise of 1.4 °C [confidence interval (CI) 0.9–2.0 °C] in air and 0.4 °C [CI 0.2–0.7 °C] in soil temperature results in an increase in growing season ecosystem respiration by 30% [CI 22–38%] (n = 136). Our findings indicate that the stimulation of ecosystem respiration was due to increases in both plant-related and microbial respiration (n = 9) and continued for at least 25 years (n = 136). The magnitude of the warming effects on respiration was driven by variation in warming-induced changes in local soil conditions, that is, changes in total nitrogen concentration and pH and by context-dependent spatial variation in these conditions, in particular total nitrogen concentration and the carbon:nitrogen ratio. Tundra sites with stronger nitrogen limitations and sites in which warming had stimulated plant and microbial nutrient turnover seemed particularly sensitive in their respiration response to warming. The results highlight the importance of local soil conditions and warming-induced changes therein for future climatic impacts on respiration. Datasets from in situ warming experiments across 28 arctic and alpine tundra sites covering  a span of less than 1 year up to 25 years show the importance of local soil conditions and warming-induced changes therein for future climatic impacts on ecosystem respiration.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization allows adaptations to be shared among lineages and may trigger the evolution of new species1,2. However, convincing examples of homoploid hybrid speciation remain rare because it is challenging to demonstrate that hybridization was crucial in generating reproductive isolation3. Here we combine population genomic analysis with quantitative trait locus mapping of species-specific traits to examine a case of hybrid speciation in Heliconius butterflies. We show that Heliconius elevatus is a hybrid species that is sympatric with both parents and has persisted as an independently evolving lineage for at least 180,000 years. This is despite pervasive and ongoing gene flow with one parent, Heliconius pardalinus, which homogenizes 99% of their genomes. The remaining 1% introgressed from the other parent, Heliconius melpomene, and is scattered widely across the H. elevatus genome in islands of divergence from H. pardalinus. These islands contain multiple traits that are under disruptive selection, including colour pattern, wing shape, host plant preference, sex pheromones and mate choice. Collectively, these traits place H. elevatus on its own adaptive peak and permit coexistence with both parents. Our results show that speciation was driven by introgression of ecological traits, and that speciation with gene flow is possible with a multilocus genetic architecture. Genomic studies of Heliconius butterflies provide evidence that Heliconius elevatus is a hybrid species, and that its speciation was driven by introgression of traits from Heliconius melpomene into the other parent, an ancestor of Heliconius pardalinus.",

    "abstract": "Towards realizing the future quantum internet1,2, a pivotal milestone entails the transition from two-node proof-of-principle experiments conducted in laboratories to comprehensive multi-node set-ups on large scales. Here we report the creation of memory–memory entanglement in a multi-node quantum network over a metropolitan area. We use three independent memory nodes, each of which is equipped with an atomic ensemble quantum memory3 that has telecom conversion, together with a photonic server where detection of a single photon heralds the success of entanglement generation. The memory nodes are maximally separated apart for 12.5 kilometres. We actively stabilize the phase variance owing to fibre links and control lasers. We demonstrate concurrent entanglement generation between any two memory nodes. The memory lifetime is longer than the round-trip communication time. Our work provides a metropolitan-scale testbed for the evaluation and exploration of multi-node quantum network protocols and starts a stage of quantum internet research. A metropolitan-area quantum network based on the generation of pairwise entanglement is formed by three atomic quantum memories connected to a central photonic server.",

    "abstract": "Plants exposed to incidences of excessive temperatures activate heat-stress responses to cope with the physiological challenge and stimulate long-term acclimation1,2. The mechanism that senses cellular temperature for inducing thermotolerance is still unclear3. Here we show that TWA1 is a temperature-sensing transcriptional co-regulator that is needed for basal and acquired thermotolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. At elevated temperatures, TWA1 changes its conformation and allows physical interaction with JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED MYC-LIKE (JAM) transcription factors and TOPLESS (TPL) and TOPLESS-RELATED (TPR) proteins for repressor complex assembly. TWA1 is a predicted intrinsically disordered protein that has a key thermosensory role functioning through an amino-terminal highly variable region. At elevated temperatures, TWA1 accumulates in nuclear subdomains, and physical interactions with JAM2 and TPL appear to be restricted to these nuclear subdomains. The transcriptional upregulation of the heat shock transcription factor A2 (HSFA2) and heat shock proteins depended on TWA1, and TWA1 orthologues provided different temperature thresholds, consistent with the sensor function in early signalling of heat stress. The identification of the plant thermosensors offers a molecular tool for adjusting thermal acclimation responses of crops by breeding and biotechnology, and a sensitive temperature switch for thermogenetics. TWA1 is a temperature-sensing transcriptional co-regulator that is needed for basal and acquired thermotolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana.",

    "abstract": "Exoskeletons have enormous potential to improve human locomotive performance1–3. However, their development and broad dissemination are limited by the requirement for lengthy human tests and handcrafted control laws2. Here we show an experiment-free method to learn a versatile control policy in simulation. Our learning-in-simulation framework leverages dynamics-aware musculoskeletal and exoskeleton models and data-driven reinforcement learning to bridge the gap between simulation and reality without human experiments. The learned controller is deployed on a custom hip exoskeleton that automatically generates assistance across different activities with reduced metabolic rates by 24.3%, 13.1% and 15.4% for walking, running and stair climbing, respectively. Our framework may offer a generalizable and scalable strategy for the rapid development and widespread adoption of a variety of assistive robots for both able-bodied and mobility-impaired individuals. A learning-in-simulation framework for wearable robots uses dynamics-aware musculoskeletal and exoskeleton models and data-driven reinforcement learning to bridge the gap between simulation and reality without human experiments to assist versatile activities.",

    "abstract": "CD4+ T cells can either enhance or inhibit tumour immunity. Although regulatory T cells have long been known to impede antitumour responses1–5, other CD4+ T cells have recently been implicated in inhibiting this response6,7. Yet, the nature and function of the latter remain unclear. Here, using vaccines containing MHC class I (MHC-I) neoantigens (neoAgs) and different doses of tumour-derived MHC-II neoAgs, we discovered that whereas the inclusion of vaccines with low doses of MHC-II-restricted peptides (LDVax) promoted tumour rejection, vaccines containing high doses of the same MHC-II neoAgs (HDVax) inhibited rejection. Characterization of the inhibitory cells induced by HDVax identified them as type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells expressing IL-10, granzyme B, perforin, CCL5 and LILRB4. Tumour-specific Tr1 cells suppressed tumour rejection induced by anti-PD1, LDVax or adoptively transferred tumour-specific effector T cells. Mechanistically, HDVax-induced Tr1 cells selectively killed MHC-II tumour antigen-presenting type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), leading to low numbers of cDC1s in tumours. We then documented modalities to overcome this inhibition, specifically via anti-LILRB4 blockade, using a CD8-directed IL-2 mutein, or targeted loss of cDC2/monocytes. Collectively, these data show that cytotoxic Tr1 cells, which maintain peripheral tolerance, also inhibit antitumour responses and thereby function to impede immune control of cancer. Type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1) represent a major obstacle that compromises naturally occurring and therapeutically induced tumour-specific immunity.",

    "abstract": "The single chirality of biological molecules is a signature of life. Yet, rationalizing how single chirality emerged remains a challenging goal1. Research has commonly focused on initial symmetry breaking and subsequent enantioenrichment of monomer building blocks—sugars and amino acids—that compose the genetic polymers RNA and DNA as well as peptides. If these building blocks are only partially enantioenriched, however, stalling of chain growth may occur, whimsically termed in the case of nucleic acids as “the problem of original syn”2. Here, in studying a new prebiotically plausible route to proteinogenic peptides3–5, we discovered that the reaction favours heterochiral ligation (that is, the ligation of l monomers with d monomers). Although this finding seems problematic for the prebiotic emergence of homochiral l-peptides, we demonstrate, paradoxically, that this heterochiral preference provides a mechanism for enantioenrichment in homochiral chains. Symmetry breaking, chiral amplification and chirality transfer processes occur for all reactants and products in multicomponent competitive reactions even when only one of the molecules in the complex mixture exhibits an imbalance in enantiomer concentrations (non-racemic). Solubility considerations rationalize further chemical purification and enhanced chiral amplification. Experimental data and kinetic modelling support this prebiotically plausible mechanism for the emergence of homochiral biological polymers. A study of a new route to proteinogenic peptides reveals how heterochiral preference can lead to homochiral peptides in a prebiotic world.",

    "abstract": "DNA and histone modifications combine into characteristic patterns that demarcate functional regions of the genome1,2. While many ‘readers’ of individual modifications have been described3–5, how chromatin states comprising composite modification signatures, histone variants and internucleosomal linker DNA are interpreted is a major open question. Here we use a multidimensional proteomics strategy to systematically examine the interaction of around 2,000 nuclear proteins with over 80 modified dinucleosomes representing promoter, enhancer and heterochromatin states. By deconvoluting complex nucleosome-binding profiles into networks of co-regulated proteins and distinct nucleosomal features driving protein recruitment or exclusion, we show comprehensively how chromatin states are decoded by chromatin readers. We find highly distinctive binding responses to different features, many factors that recognize multiple features, and that nucleosomal modifications and linker DNA operate largely independently in regulating protein binding to chromatin. Our online resource, the Modification Atlas of Regulation by Chromatin States (MARCS), provides in-depth analysis tools to engage with our results and advance the discovery of fundamental principles of genome regulation by chromatin states. A multidimensional proteomics analysis of the interactions between around 2,000 nuclear proteins and over 80 modified dinucleosomes representing promoter, enhancer and heterochromatin states provides insights into how chromatin states are decoded by chromatin readers.",

    "abstract": "Roads are expanding at the fastest pace in human history. This is the case especially in biodiversity-rich tropical nations, where roads can result in forest loss and fragmentation, wildfires, illicit land invasions and negative societal effects1–5. Many roads are being constructed illegally or informally and do not appear on any existing road map6–10; the toll of such ‘ghost roads’ on ecosystems is poorly understood. Here we use around 7,000 h of effort by trained volunteers to map ghost roads across the tropical Asia-Pacific region, sampling 1.42 million plots, each 1 km2 in area. Our intensive sampling revealed a total of 1.37 million km of roads in our plots—from 3.0 to 6.6 times more roads than were found in leading datasets of roads globally. Across our study area, road building almost always preceded local forest loss, and road density was by far the strongest correlate11 of deforestation out of 38 potential biophysical and socioeconomic covariates. The relationship between road density and forest loss was nonlinear, with deforestation peaking soon after roads penetrate a landscape and then declining as roads multiply and remaining accessible forests largely disappear. Notably, after controlling for lower road density inside protected areas, we found that protected areas had only modest additional effects on preventing forest loss, implying that their most vital conservation function is limiting roads and road-related environmental disruption. Collectively, our findings suggest that burgeoning, poorly studied ghost roads are among the gravest of all direct threats to tropical forests. An effort to map roads in the Asia-Pacific region finds that there are 3.0–6.6 times more roads than other sources suggest, and that unmapped ‘ghost roads’ are a major contributor to tropical forest loss.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes, the most abundant non-neuronal cell type in the mammalian brain, are crucial circuit components that respond to and modulate neuronal activity through calcium (Ca2+) signalling1–7. Astrocyte Ca2+ activity is highly heterogeneous and occurs across multiple spatiotemporal scales—from fast, subcellular activity3,4 to slow, synchronized activity across connected astrocyte networks8–10—to influence many processes5,7,11. However, the inputs that drive astrocyte network dynamics remain unclear. Here we used ex vivo and in vivo two-photon astrocyte imaging while mimicking neuronal neurotransmitter inputs at multiple spatiotemporal scales. We find that brief, subcellular inputs of GABA and glutamate lead to widespread, long-lasting astrocyte Ca2+ responses beyond an individual stimulated cell. Further, we find that a key subset of Ca2+ activity—propagative activity—differentiates astrocyte network responses to these two main neurotransmitters, and may influence responses to future inputs. Together, our results demonstrate that local, transient neurotransmitter inputs are encoded by broad cortical astrocyte networks over a minutes-long time course, contributing to accumulating evidence that substantial astrocyte–neuron communication occurs across slow, network-level spatiotemporal scales12–14. These findings will enable future studies to investigate the link between specific astrocyte Ca2+ activity and specific functional outputs, which could build a consistent framework for astrocytic modulation of neuronal activity. A study investigates subcellular, single-cell and network-level comunication within the astrocyte network in response to the two major neurotransmitter inputs.",

    "abstract": "The coupling of excitons in π-conjugated molecules to high-frequency vibrational modes, particularly carbon–carbon stretch modes (1,000–1,600 cm−1) has been thought to be unavoidable1,2. These high-frequency modes accelerate non-radiative losses and limit the performance of light-emitting diodes, fluorescent biomarkers and photovoltaic devices. Here, by combining broadband impulsive vibrational spectroscopy, first-principles modelling and synthetic chemistry, we explore exciton–vibration coupling in a range of π-conjugated molecules. We uncover two design rules that decouple excitons from high-frequency vibrations. First, when the exciton wavefunction has a substantial charge-transfer character with spatially disjoint electron and hole densities, we find that high-frequency modes can be localized to either the donor or acceptor moiety, so that they do not significantly perturb the exciton energy or its spatial distribution. Second, it is possible to select materials such that the participating molecular orbitals have a symmetry-imposed non-bonding character and are, thus, decoupled from the high-frequency vibrational modes that modulate the π-bond order. We exemplify both these design rules by creating a series of spin radical systems that have very efficient near-infrared emission (680–800 nm) from charge-transfer excitons. We show that these systems have substantial coupling to vibrational modes only below 250 cm−1, frequencies that are too low to allow fast non-radiative decay. This enables non-radiative decay rates to be suppressed by nearly two orders of magnitude in comparison to π-conjugated molecules with similar bandgaps. Our results show that losses due to coupling to high-frequency modes need not be a fundamental property of these systems. A molecular design strategy for reducing the vibration-induced non-radiative losses in emissive organic semiconductors is realized by decoupling excitons from high-frequency vibrations.",

    "abstract": "Optical computing promises to improve the speed and energy efficiency of machine learning applications1–6. However, current approaches to efficiently train these models are limited by in silico emulation on digital computers. Here we develop a method called fully forward mode (FFM) learning, which implements the compute-intensive training process on the physical system. The majority of the machine learning operations are thus efficiently conducted in parallel on site, alleviating numerical modelling constraints. In free-space and integrated photonics, we experimentally demonstrate optical systems with state-of-the-art performances for a given network size. FFM learning shows training the deepest optical neural networks with millions of parameters achieves accuracy equivalent to the ideal model. It supports all-optical focusing through scattering media with a resolution of the diffraction limit; it can also image in parallel the objects hidden outside the direct line of sight at over a kilohertz frame rate and can conduct all-optical processing with light intensity as weak as subphoton per pixel (5.40 × 1018- operations-per-second-per-watt energy efficiency) at room temperature. Furthermore, we prove that FFM learning can automatically search non-Hermitian exceptional points without an analytical model. FFM learning not only facilitates orders-of-magnitude-faster learning processes, but can also advance applied and theoretical fields such as deep neural networks, ultrasensitive perception and topological photonics. We present fully forward mode learning, which conducts machine learning operations on site, leading to faster learning and promoting advancement in numerous fields.",

For example, the deuterated drugs austedo3, donafenib4 and sotyktu5 have been recently approved. There are various methods for the synthesis of deuterated compounds with high deuterium incorporation6. However, the reductive deuteration of aromatic hydrocarbons—ubiquitous chemical feedstocks—to saturated cyclic compounds has rarely been achieved. Here we describe a scalable and general electrocatalytic method for the reductive deuteration and deuterodefluorination of (hetero)arenes using a prepared nitrogen-doped electrode and deuterium oxide (D2O), giving perdeuterated and saturated deuterocarbon products. This protocol has been successfully applied to the synthesis of 13 highly deuterated drug molecules. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the ruthenium–deuterium species, generated by electrolysis of D2O in the presence of a nitrogen-doped ruthenium electrode, are key intermediates that directly reduce aromatic compounds. This quick and cost-effective methodology for the preparation of highly deuterium-labelled saturated (hetero)cyclic compounds could be applied in drug development and metabolism studies. Reductive deuteration and deuterodefluorination of arenes and heteroarenes is achieved through a scalable and general electrocatalytic method using a nitrogen-doped ruthenium electrode and heavy water.",

    "abstract": "The past two decades has witnessed a remarkable increase in the number of microbial genomes retrieved from marine systems1,2. However, it has remained challenging to translate this marine genomic diversity into biotechnological and biomedical applications3,4. Here we recovered 43,191 bacterial and archaeal genomes from publicly available marine metagenomes, encompassing a wide range of diversity with 138 distinct phyla, redefining the upper limit of marine bacterial genome size and revealing complex trade-offs between the occurrence of CRISPR–Cas systems and antibiotic resistance genes. In silico bioprospecting of these marine genomes led to the discovery of a novel CRISPR–Cas9 system, ten antimicrobial peptides, and three enzymes that degrade polyethylene terephthalate. In vitro experiments confirmed their effectiveness and efficacy. This work provides evidence that global-scale sequencing initiatives advance our understanding of how microbial diversity has evolved in the oceans and is maintained, and demonstrates how such initiatives can be sustainably exploited to advance biotechnology and biomedicine. Analysis of 43,191 genomes obtained from publicly available marine bacterial and archaeal metagenome data provides insights into marine bacterial evolution, CRISPR–Cas defence and antibiotic resistance genes, and demonstrates the potential of marine metagenomes for biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "Persistent colonization and outgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms in the intestine can result from long-term antibiotic use or inflammatory conditions, and may perpetuate dysregulated immunity and tissue damage1,2. Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae gut pathobionts are particularly recalcitrant to conventional antibiotic treatment3,4, although an emerging body of evidence suggests that manipulation of the commensal microbiota may be a practical alternative therapeutic strategy5–7. Here we isolated and down-selected commensal bacterial consortia from stool samples from healthy humans that could strongly and specifically suppress intestinal Enterobacteriaceae. One of the elaborated consortia, comprising 18 commensal strains, effectively controlled ecological niches by regulating gluconate availability, thereby re-establishing colonization resistance and alleviating Klebsiella- and Escherichia-driven intestinal inflammation in mice. Harnessing these activities in the form of live bacterial therapies may represent a promising solution to combat the growing threat of proinflammatory, antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infection. Transplants of consortia with limited numbers of strains of commensal bacteria derived from healthy human stool samples are able to suppress intestinal Enterobacteriaceae by regulating gluconate availability, suggesting potential therapies for infectious and inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Brains comprise complex networks of neurons and connections, similar to the nodes and edges of artificial networks. Network analysis applied to the wiring diagrams of brains can offer insights into how they support computations and regulate the flow of information underlying perception and behaviour. The completion of the first whole-brain connectome of an adult fly, containing over 130,000 neurons and millions of synaptic connections1–3, offers an opportunity to analyse the statistical properties and topological features of a complete brain. Here we computed the prevalence of two- and three-node motifs, examined their strengths, related this information to both neurotransmitter composition and cell type annotations4,5, and compared these metrics with wiring diagrams of other animals. We found that the network of the fly brain displays rich-club organization, with a large population (30% of the connectome) of highly connected neurons. We identified subsets of rich-club neurons that may serve as integrators or broadcasters of signals. Finally, we examined subnetworks based on 78 anatomically defined brain regions or neuropils. These data products are shared within the FlyWire Codex (\n                https://codex.flywire.ai\n                \n              ) and should serve as a foundation for models and experiments exploring the relationship between neural activity and anatomical structure.

However, it is unclear which parts of the human brain are covered by existing protocols, and it has been difficult to quantitatively assess organoid variation and fidelity. Here we integrate 36 single-cell transcriptomic datasets spanning 26 protocols into one integrated human neural organoid cell atlas totalling more than 1.7 million cells1–26. Mapping to developing human brain references27–30 shows primary cell types and states that have been generated in vitro, and estimates transcriptomic similarity between primary and organoid counterparts across protocols. We provide a programmatic interface to browse the atlas and query new datasets, and showcase the power of the atlas to annotate organoid cell types and evaluate new organoid protocols. Finally, we show that the atlas can be used as a diverse control cohort to annotate and compare organoid models of neural disease, identifying genes and pathways that may underlie pathological mechanisms with the neural models. The human neural organoid cell atlas will be useful to assess organoid fidelity, characterize perturbed and diseased states and facilitate protocol development. A human neural organoid cell atlas integrating 36 single-cell transcriptomic datasets shows cell types and states and estimates transcriptomic similarity between primary and organoid counterparts, showing potential to assess organoid fidelity and facilitate protocol development.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been discovered as a new superconductor with transition temperature Tc near 80 K under high pressure1–3. Despite extensive theoretical and experimental work to understand the nature of its superconductivity4–29, the requirement of extreme pressure restricts the use of many experimental probes and limits its application potential. Here we present signatures of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 thin films at ambient pressure, facilitated by the application of epitaxial compressive strain. The onset Tc varies roughly from 26 to 42 K, with higher Tc values correlating with smaller in-plane lattice constants. We observed the co-existence of other Ruddlesden–Popper phases within the films and dependence of transport behaviour with ozone annealing, suggesting that the observed low zero resistance Tc of around 2 K can be attributed to stacking defects, grain boundaries and oxygen stoichiometry. This finding initiates numerous opportunities to stabilize and study superconductivity in bilayer nickelates at ambient pressure, and to facilitate the broad understanding of the ever-growing number of high temperature and unconventional superconductors in the transition metal oxides. Signatures of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 thin films are demonstrated, facilitated by the application of epitaxial compressive strain, suggesting that the observed low zero resistance Tc of around 2 K can be attributed to several factors.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by biology’s most sophisticated computer, the brain, neural networks constitute a profound reformulation of computational principles1–3. Analogous high-dimensional, highly interconnected computational architectures also arise within information-processing molecular systems inside living cells, such as signal transduction cascades and genetic regulatory networks4–7. Might collective modes analogous to neural computation be found more broadly in other physical and chemical processes, even those that ostensibly play non-information-processing roles? Here we examine nucleation during self-assembly of multicomponent structures, showing that high-dimensional patterns of concentrations can be discriminated and classified in a manner similar to neural network computation. Specifically, we design a set of 917 DNA tiles that can self-assemble in three alternative ways such that competitive nucleation depends sensitively on the extent of colocalization of high-concentration tiles within the three structures. The system was trained in silico to classify a set of 18 grayscale 30 × 30 pixel images into three categories. Experimentally, fluorescence and atomic force microscopy measurements during and after a 150 hour anneal established that all trained images were correctly classified, whereas a test set of image variations probed the robustness of the results. Although slow compared to previous biochemical neural networks, our approach is compact, robust and scalable. Our findings suggest that ubiquitous physical phenomena, such as nucleation, may hold powerful information-processing capabilities when they occur within high-dimensional multicomponent systems. Examination of nucleation during self-assembly of multicomponent structures illustrates how ubiquitous molecular phenomena inherently classify high-dimensional patterns of concentrations in a manner similar to neural network computation.",

    "abstract": "The assembly and specification of synapses in the brain is incompletely understood1–3. Latrophilin-3 (encoded by Adgrl3, also known as Lphn3)—a postsynaptic adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor—mediates synapse formation in the hippocampus4 but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we show in mice that LPHN3 organizes synapses through a convergent dual-pathway mechanism: activation of Gαs signalling and recruitment of phase-separated postsynaptic protein scaffolds. We found that cell-type-specific alternative splicing of Lphn3 controls the LPHN3 G-protein-coupling mode, resulting in LPHN3 variants that predominantly signal through Gαs or Gα12/13. CRISPR-mediated manipulation of Lphn3 alternative splicing that shifts LPHN3 from a Gαs- to a Gα12/13-coupled mode impaired synaptic connectivity as severely as the overall deletion of Lphn3, suggesting that Gαs signalling by LPHN3 splice variants mediates synapse formation. Notably, Gαs-coupled, but not Gα12/13-coupled, splice variants of LPHN3 also recruit phase-transitioned postsynaptic protein scaffold condensates, such that these condensates are clustered by binding of presynaptic teneurin and FLRT ligands to LPHN3. Moreover, neuronal activity promotes alternative splicing of the synaptogenic Gαs-coupled variant of LPHN3. Together, these data suggest that activity-dependent alternative splicing of a key synaptic adhesion molecule controls synapse formation by parallel activation of two convergent pathways: Gαs signalling and clustered phase separation of postsynaptic protein scaffolds. Latrophilin-3 organizes synapses through a convergent dual-pathway mechanism in which Gαs signalling is activated and phase-separated postsynaptic protein scaffolds are recruited.",

    "abstract": "To survive in a complex social group, one needs to know who to approach and, more importantly, who to avoid. In mice, a single defeat causes the losing mouse to stay away from the winner for weeks1. Here through a series of functional manipulation and recording experiments, we identify oxytocin neurons in the retrochiasmatic supraoptic nucleus (SOROXT) and oxytocin-receptor-expressing cells in the anterior subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral part (aVMHvlOXTR) as a key circuit motif for defeat-induced social avoidance. Before defeat, aVMHvlOXTR cells minimally respond to aggressor cues. During defeat, aVMHvlOXTR cells are highly activated and, with the help of an exclusive oxytocin supply from the SOR, potentiate their responses to aggressor cues. After defeat, strong aggressor-induced aVMHvlOXTR cell activation drives the animal to avoid the aggressor and minimizes future defeat. Our study uncovers a neural process that supports rapid social learning caused by defeat and highlights the importance of the brain oxytocin system in social plasticity. In mice, the neural mechanisms underlying aversive social learning, specifically avoidance and fear after defeat, involve oxytocin signalling in the anterior subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral part.",

    "abstract": "The Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Europe is associated with the regional disappearance of Neanderthals and the spread of Homo sapiens. Late Neanderthals persisted in western Europe several millennia after the occurrence of H. sapiens in eastern Europe1. Local hybridization between the two groups occurred2, but not on all occasions3. Archaeological evidence also indicates the presence of several technocomplexes during this transition, complicating our understanding and the association of behavioural adaptations with specific hominin groups4. One such technocomplex for which the makers are unknown is the Lincombian–Ranisian–Jerzmanowician (LRJ), which has been described in northwestern and central Europe5–8. Here we present the morphological and proteomic taxonomic identification, mitochondrial DNA analysis and direct radiocarbon dating of human remains directly associated with an LRJ assemblage at the site Ilsenhöhle in Ranis (Germany). These human remains are among the earliest directly dated Upper Palaeolithic H. sapiens remains in Eurasia. We show that early H. sapiens associated with the LRJ were present in central and northwestern Europe long before the extinction of late Neanderthals in southwestern Europe. Our results strengthen the notion of a patchwork of distinct human populations and technocomplexes present in Europe during this transitional period. Through archaeological excavation, morphological and proteomic taxonomic identification, mitochondrial DNA analysis and direct radiocarbon dating of human remains, a study reports the presence of Homo sapiens in Germany north of the Alps more than 45,000 years ago.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, DNA compacts into chromatin through nucleosomes1,2. Replication of the eukaryotic genome must be coupled to the transmission of the epigenome encoded in the chromatin3,4. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) replisomes associated with the FACT (facilitates chromatin transactions) complex (comprising Spt16 and Pob3) and an evicted histone hexamer. In these structures, FACT is positioned at the front end of the replisome by engaging with the parental DNA duplex to capture the histones through the middle domain and the acidic carboxyl-terminal domain of Spt16. The H2A–H2B dimer chaperoned by the carboxyl-terminal domain of Spt16 is stably tethered to the H3–H4 tetramer, while the vacant H2A–H2B site is occupied by the histone-binding domain of Mcm2. The Mcm2 histone-binding domain wraps around the DNA-binding surface of one H3–H4 dimer and extends across the tetramerization interface of the H3–H4 tetramer to the binding site of Spt16 middle domain before becoming disordered. This arrangement leaves the remaining DNA-binding surface of the other H3–H4 dimer exposed to additional interactions for further processing. The Mcm2 histone-binding domain and its downstream linker region are nested on top of Tof1, relocating the parental histones to the replisome front for transfer to the newly synthesized lagging-strand DNA. Our findings offer crucial structural insights into the mechanism of replication-coupled histone recycling for maintaining epigenetic inheritance. Structures of the yeast replisome associated with the FACT complex and an evicted histone hexamer offer insights into the mechanism of replication-coupled histone recycling for maintaining epigenetic inheritance.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the stacking and twisting of atom-thin structures with matching crystal symmetry has provided a unique way to create new superlattice structures in which new properties emerge1,2. In parallel, control over the temporal characteristics of strong light fields has allowed researchers to manipulate coherent electron transport in such atom-thin structures on sublaser-cycle timescales3,4. Here we demonstrate a tailored light-wave-driven analogue to twisted layer stacking. Tailoring the spatial symmetry of the light waveform to that of the lattice of a hexagonal boron nitride monolayer and then twisting this waveform result in optical control of time-reversal symmetry breaking5 and the realization of the topological Haldane model6 in a laser-dressed two-dimensional insulating crystal. Further, the parameters of the effective Haldane-type Hamiltonian can be controlled by rotating the light waveform, thus enabling ultrafast switching between band structure configurations and allowing unprecedented control over the magnitude, location and curvature of the bandgap. This results in an asymmetric population between complementary quantum valleys that leads to a measurable valley Hall current7, which can be detected by optical harmonic polarimetry. The universality and robustness of our scheme paves the way to valley-selective bandgap engineering on the fly and unlocks the possibility of creating few-femtosecond switches with quantum degrees of freedom. We introduce strong tailored light-wave-driven time-reversal symmetry breaking in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride, realizing a sub-laser-cycle controllable analogue of the topological model of Haldane and inducing non-resonant valley polarization.",

    "abstract": "Quantum bits (qubits) are prone to several types of error as the result of uncontrolled interactions with their environment. Common strategies to correct these errors are based on architectures of qubits involving daunting hardware overheads1. One possible solution is to build qubits that are inherently protected against certain types of error, so the overhead required to correct the remaining errors is greatly reduced2–7. However, this strategy relies on one condition: any quantum manipulations of the qubit must not break the protection that has been so carefully engineered5,8. A type of qubit known as a cat qubit is encoded in the manifold of metastable states of a quantum dynamical system, and thereby acquires continuous and autonomous protection against bit-flips. Here, in a superconducting-circuit experiment, we implemented a cat qubit with bit-flip times exceeding 10 s. This is an improvement of four orders of magnitude over previously published cat-qubit implementations. We prepared and imaged quantum superposition states, and measured phase-flip times greater than 490 ns. Most importantly, we controlled the phase of these quantum superpositions without breaking the bit-flip protection. This experiment demonstrates the compatibility of quantum control and inherent bit-flip protection at an unprecedented level, showing the viability of these dynamical qubits for future quantum technologies. A type of qubit that has inherent resistance to bit-flip errors has been manipulated with a bit-flip time of more than 10 s without losing that error protection.",

    "abstract": "Psychedelic substances such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin show potential for the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders1–3. These compounds are thought to mediate their hallucinogenic and therapeutic effects through the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) receptor 5-HT2A (ref. 4). However, 5-HT1A also plays a part in the behavioural effects of tryptamine hallucinogens5, particularly 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), a psychedelic found in the toxin of Colorado River toads6. Although 5-HT1A is a validated therapeutic target7,8, little is known about how psychedelics engage 5-HT1A and which effects are mediated by this receptor. Here we map the molecular underpinnings of 5-MeO-DMT pharmacology through five cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of 5-HT1A, systematic medicinal chemistry, receptor mutagenesis and mouse behaviour. Structure–activity relationship analyses of 5-methoxytryptamines at both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A enable the characterization of molecular determinants of 5-HT1A signalling potency, efficacy and selectivity. Moreover, we contrast the structural interactions and in vitro pharmacology of 5-MeO-DMT and analogues to the pan-serotonergic agonist LSD and clinically used 5-HT1A agonists. We show that a 5-HT1A-selective 5-MeO-DMT analogue is devoid of hallucinogenic-like effects while retaining anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like activity in socially defeated animals. Our studies uncover molecular aspects of 5-HT1A-targeted psychedelics and therapeutics, which may facilitate the future development of new medications for neuropsychiatric disorders. Detailed analyses of the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A and the psychedelic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine reveal the differences in receptor structural pharmacology that mediate signalling specificity, efficacy and potency, findings that may facilitate the development of new neuropsychiatric therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The interplay among frustrated lattice geometry, non-trivial band topology and correlation yields rich quantum states of matter in kagome systems1,2. A series of recent members in this family, AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb or Cs), exhibit a cascade of symmetry-breaking transitions3, involving the 3Q chiral charge ordering4–8, electronic nematicity9,10, roton pair density wave11 and superconductivity12. The nature of the superconducting order is yet to be resolved. Here we report an indication of dynamic superconducting domains with boundary supercurrents in intrinsic CsV3Sb5 flakes. The magnetic field-free superconducting diode effect is observed with polarity modulated by thermal histories, suggesting that there are dynamic superconducting order domains in a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry-breaking background. Strikingly, the critical current exhibits double-slit superconductivity interference patterns when subjected to an external magnetic field. The characteristics of the patterns are modulated by thermal cycling. These phenomena are proposed as a consequence of periodically modulated supercurrents flowing along certain domain boundaries constrained by fluxoid quantization. Our results imply a time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting order, opening a potential for exploring exotic physics, for example, Majorana zero modes, in this intriguing topological kagome system. We observe the superconducting diode effect and interference patterns in CsV3Sb5, implying a time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting order in kagome superconductors.",

    "abstract": "The computer vision algorithms used currently in advanced driver assistance systems rely on image-based RGB cameras, leading to a critical bandwidth–latency trade-off for delivering safe driving experiences. To address this, event cameras have emerged as alternative vision sensors. Event cameras measure the changes in intensity asynchronously, offering high temporal resolution and sparsity, markedly reducing bandwidth and latency requirements1. Despite these advantages, event-camera-based algorithms are either highly efficient but lag behind image-based ones in terms of accuracy or sacrifice the sparsity and efficiency of events to achieve comparable results. To overcome this, here we propose a hybrid event- and frame-based object detector that preserves the advantages of each modality and thus does not suffer from this trade-off. Our method exploits the high temporal resolution and sparsity of events and the rich but low temporal resolution information in standard images to generate efficient, high-rate object detections, reducing perceptual and computational latency. We show that the use of a 20 frames per second (fps) RGB camera plus an event camera can achieve the same latency as a 5,000-fps camera with the bandwidth of a 45-fps camera without compromising accuracy. Our approach paves the way for efficient and robust perception in edge-case scenarios by uncovering the potential of event cameras2. Use of a 20 frames per second (fps) RGB camera plus an event camera can achieve the same latency as a 5,000-fps camera with the bandwidth of a 45-fps camera without compromising accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play a pivotal part in ATP energy production through oxidative phosphorylation, which occurs within the inner membrane through a series of respiratory complexes1–4. Despite extensive in vitro structural studies, determining the atomic details of their molecular mechanisms in physiological states remains a major challenge, primarily because of loss of the native environment during purification. Here we directly image porcine mitochondria using an in situ cryo-electron microscopy approach. This enables us to determine the structures of various high-order assemblies of respiratory supercomplexes in their native states. We identify four main supercomplex organizations: I1III2IV1, I1III2IV2, I2III2IV2 and I2III4IV2, which potentially expand into higher-order arrays on the inner membranes. These diverse supercomplexes are largely formed by ‘protein–lipids–protein’ interactions, which in turn have a substantial impact on the local geometry of the surrounding membranes. Our in situ structures also capture numerous reactive intermediates within these respiratory supercomplexes, shedding light on the dynamic processes of the ubiquinone/ubiquinol exchange mechanism in complex I and the Q-cycle in complex III. Structural comparison of supercomplexes from mitochondria treated under different conditions indicates a possible correlation between conformational states of complexes I and III, probably in response to environmental changes. By preserving the native membrane environment, our approach enables structural studies of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes in reaction at high resolution across multiple scales, from atomic-level details to the broader subcellular context. Mammalian respiratory supercomplexes are imaged in their native membrane environment by in situ cryo-electron microscopy, providing insight into their reactive intermediates and conformational dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Here, we introduce the Tabulae Paralytica—a compilation of four atlases of spinal cord injury (SCI) comprising a single-nucleus transcriptome atlas of half a million cells, a multiome atlas pairing transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements within the same nuclei, and two spatial transcriptomic atlases of the injured spinal cord spanning four spatial and temporal dimensions. We integrated these atlases into a common framework to dissect the molecular logic that governs the responses to injury within the spinal cord1. The Tabulae Paralytica uncovered new biological principles that dictate the consequences of SCI, including conserved and divergent neuronal responses to injury; the priming of specific neuronal subpopulations to upregulate circuit-reorganizing programs after injury; an inverse relationship between neuronal stress responses and the activation of circuit reorganization programs; the necessity of re-establishing a tripartite neuroprotective barrier between immune-privileged and extra-neural environments after SCI and a failure to form this barrier in old mice. We leveraged the Tabulae Paralytica to develop a rejuvenative gene therapy that re-established this tripartite barrier, and restored the natural recovery of walking after paralysis in old mice. The Tabulae Paralytica provides a window into the pathobiology of SCI, while establishing a framework for integrating multimodal, genome-scale measurements in four dimensions to study biology and medicine.

    "abstract": "De novo design of complex protein folds using solely computational means remains a substantial challenge1. Here we use a robust deep learning pipeline to design complex folds and soluble analogues of integral membrane proteins. Unique membrane topologies, such as those from G-protein-coupled receptors2, are not found in the soluble proteome, and we demonstrate that their structural features can be recapitulated in solution. Biophysical analyses demonstrate the high thermal stability of the designs, and experimental structures show remarkable design accuracy. The soluble analogues were functionalized with native structural motifs, as a proof of concept for bringing membrane protein functions to the soluble proteome, potentially enabling new approaches in drug discovery. In summary, we have designed complex protein topologies and enriched them with functionalities from membrane proteins, with high experimental success rates, leading to a de facto expansion of the functional soluble fold space. A deep learning approach enables accurate computational design of soluble and functional analogues of membrane proteins, expanding the soluble protein fold space and facilitating new approaches to drug screening and design.",

    "abstract": "The current technologies to place new DNA into specific locations in plant genomes are low frequency and error-prone, and this inefficiency hampers genome-editing approaches to develop improved crops1,2. Often considered to be genome ‘parasites’, transposable elements (TEs) evolved to insert their DNA seamlessly into genomes3–5. Eukaryotic TEs select their site of insertion based on preferences for chromatin contexts, which differ for each TE type6–9. Here we developed a genome engineering tool that controls the TE insertion site and cargo delivered, taking advantage of the natural ability of the TE to precisely excise and insert into the genome. Inspired by CRISPR-associated transposases that target transposition in a programmable manner in bacteria10–12, we fused the rice Pong transposase protein to the Cas9 or Cas12a programmable nucleases. We demonstrated sequence-specific targeted insertion (guided by the CRISPR gRNA) of enhancer elements, an open reading frame and a gene expression cassette into the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis. We then translated this system into soybean—a major global crop in need of targeted insertion technology. We have engineered a TE ‘parasite’ into a usable and accessible toolkit that enables the sequence-specific targeting of custom DNA into plant genomes. Fusion of rice Pong transposase to the Cas9 or Cas12a programmable nucleases provides sequence-specific targeted insertion of enhancer elements, an open reading frame and gene expression cassette into the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis and crop soybean.",

    "abstract": "Innate immune pattern recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), are key mediators of the immune response to infection and central to our understanding of health and disease1. After microbial detection, these receptors activate inflammatory signal transduction pathways that involve IκB kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, ubiquitin ligases and other adaptor proteins. The mechanisms that connect the proteins in the TLR pathways are poorly defined. To delineate TLR pathway activities, we engineered macrophages to enable microscopy and proteomic analysis of the endogenous myddosome constituent MyD88. We found that myddosomes form transient contacts with activated TLRs and that TLR-free myddosomes are dynamic in size, number and composition over the course of 24 h. Analysis using super-resolution microscopy revealed that, within most myddosomes, MyD88 forms barrel-like structures that function as scaffolds for effector protein recruitment. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that myddosomes contain proteins that act at all stages and regulate all effector responses of the TLR pathways, and genetic analysis defined the epistatic relationship between these effector modules. Myddosome assembly was evident in cells infected with Listeria monocytogenes, but these bacteria evaded myddosome assembly and TLR signalling during cell-to-cell spread. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the entire TLR signalling pathway is executed from within the myddosome. Myddosomes, in which MyD88 forms barrel-like scaffold structures for effector protein recruitment and activation, contain proteins that act at all stages and regulate all effector responses of the TLR signalling pathways.",

Here we performed single-sample metatranscriptomic sequencing of internal tissues from 461 individual fur animals that were found dead due to disease. We characterized 125 virus species, including 36 that were novel and 39 at potentially high risk of cross-species transmission, including zoonotic spillover. Notably, we identified seven species of coronaviruses, expanding their known host range, and documented the cross-species transmission of a novel canine respiratory coronavirus to raccoon dogs and of bat HKU5-like coronaviruses to mink, present at a high abundance in lung tissues. Three subtypes of influenza A virus—H1N2, H5N6 and H6N2—were detected in the lungs of guinea pig, mink and muskrat, respectively. Multiple known zoonotic viruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus and mammalian orthoreovirus4,5, were detected in guinea pigs. Raccoon dogs and mink carried the highest number of potentially high-risk viruses, while viruses from the Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae and Sedoreoviridae families commonly infected multiple hosts. These data also reveal potential virus transmission between farmed animals and wild animals, and from humans to farmed animals, indicating that fur farming represents an important transmission hub for viral zoonoses. Fur farming represents an important hub of cross-species transmission for viral zoonoses.",

    "abstract": "Back-contact silicon solar cells, valued for their aesthetic appeal because they have no grid lines on the sunny side, find applications in buildings, vehicles and aircraft and enable self-power generation without compromising appearance1–3. Patterning techniques arrange contacts on the shaded side of the silicon wafer, which offers benefits for light incidence as well. However, the patterning process complicates production and results in power loss. We employed lasers to streamline the fabrication of back-contact solar cells and enhance the power-conversion efficiency. Using this approach, we produced a silicon solar cell that exceeded 27% efficiency. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers were deposited onto the wafer for surface passivation and to collect light-generated carriers. A dense passivating contact, which differs from conventional technology practice, was developed. Pulsed picosecond lasers operating at different wavelengths were used to create the back-contact patterns. The approach developed is a streamlined process for producing high-performance back-contact silicon solar cells, with a total effective processing time of about one-third that of the emerging mainstream technology. To meet the terawatt demand, we developed indium-less cells at 26.5% efficiency and precious silver-free cells at 26.2% efficiency.

    "abstract": "Nearly every glacier in Greenland has thinned or retreated over the past few decades1–4, leading to glacier acceleration, increased rates of sea-level rise and climate impacts around the globe5–9. To understand how calving-front retreat has affected the ice-mass balance of Greenland, we combine 236,328 manually derived and AI-derived observations of glacier terminus positions collected from 1985 to 2022 and generate a 120-m-resolution mask defining the ice-sheet extent every month for nearly four decades. Here we show that, since 1985, the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has lost 5,091 ± 72 km2 of area, corresponding to 1,034 ± 120 Gt of ice lost to retreat. Our results indicate that, by neglecting calving-front retreat, current consensus estimates of ice-sheet mass balance4,9 have underestimated recent mass loss from Greenland by as much as 20%. The mass loss we report has had minimal direct impact on global sea level but is sufficient to affect ocean circulation and the distribution of heat energy around the globe10–12. On seasonal timescales, Greenland loses 193 ± 25 km2 (63 ± 6 Gt) of ice to retreat each year from a maximum extent in May to a minimum between September and October. We find that multidecadal retreat is highly correlated with the magnitude of seasonal advance and retreat of each glacier, meaning that terminus-position variability on seasonal timescales can serve as an indicator of glacier sensitivity to longer-term climate change. Analysis of more than 236,000 observations of glacier terminus positions shows that accelerated calving reduced the ice area of Greenland by about 5,000 km2 since 1985, producing over 1,000 Gt of freshwater that could influence ocean salinity and circulation.",

    "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica is a paradigmatic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, in which the water-channel protein AQP4 is the target antigen1. The immunopathology in neuromyelitis optica is largely driven by autoantibodies to AQP42. However, the T cell response that is required for the generation of these anti-AQP4 antibodies is not well understood. Here we show that B cells endogenously express AQP4 in response to activation with anti-CD40 and IL-21 and are able to present their endogenous AQP4 to T cells with an AQP4-specific T cell receptor (TCR). A population of thymic B cells emulates a CD40-stimulated B cell transcriptome, including AQP4 (in mice and humans), and efficiently purges the thymic TCR repertoire of AQP4-reactive clones. Genetic ablation of Aqp4 in B cells rescues AQP4-specific TCRs despite sufficient expression of AQP4 in medullary thymic epithelial cells, and B-cell-conditional AQP4-deficient mice are fully competent to raise AQP4-specific antibodies in productive germinal-centre responses. Thus, the negative selection of AQP4-specific thymocytes is dependent on the expression and presentation of AQP4 by thymic B cells. As AQP4 is expressed in B cells in a CD40-dependent (but not AIRE-dependent) manner, we propose that thymic B cells might tolerize against a group of germinal-centre-associated antigens, including disease-relevant autoantigens such as AQP4. The immune system is tolerized against the neuromyelitis optica autoantigen AQP4 by thymic B cells, which present their endogenous AQP4 to AQP4-reactive thymocytes.",

    "abstract": "From protein motifs1 to black holes2, topological solitons are pervasive nonlinear excitations that are robust and can be driven by external fields3. So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and antisolitons in opposite directions3,4. Here we introduce a local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally coupled oscillators5–8 subject to a bistable potential9–14. We find that such nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations—so-called non-Hermitian skin waves5–8,15–22, which are typically unstable—into robust one-way (anti)solitons. We harness such non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information. Finally, we illustrate this mechanism in another class of metamaterials that shows the breaking of ‘supersymmetry’23,24 causing only antisolitons to be driven. Our observations and models demonstrate a subtle interplay between non-reciprocity and topological solitons, whereby solitons create their own driving force by locally straining the material. Beyond the scope of our study, non-reciprocal solitons might provide an efficient driving mechanism for robotic locomotion25 and could emerge in other settings, for example, quantum mechanics26,27, optics28–30 and soft matter31. A local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction, called non-reciprocal driving, is introduced, showing a subtle interplay between non-reciprocity and topological solitons and providing waveguiding and wave-processing possibilities for other fields.",

    "abstract": "The encoding of qubits in semiconductor spin carriers has been recognized as a promising approach to a commercial quantum computer that can be lithographically produced and integrated at scale1–10. However, the operation of the large number of qubits required for advantageous quantum applications11–13 will produce a thermal load exceeding the available cooling power of cryostats at millikelvin temperatures. As the scale-up accelerates, it becomes imperative to establish fault-tolerant operation above 1 K, at which the cooling power is orders of magnitude higher14–18. Here we tune up and operate spin qubits in silicon above 1 K, with fidelities in the range required for fault-tolerant operations at these temperatures19–21. We design an algorithmic initialization protocol to prepare a pure two-qubit state even when the thermal energy is substantially above the qubit energies and incorporate radiofrequency readout to achieve fidelities up to 99.34% for both readout and initialization. We also demonstrate single-qubit Clifford gate fidelities up to 99.85% and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 98.92%. These advances overcome the fundamental limitation that the thermal energy must be well below the qubit energies for the high-fidelity operation to be possible, surmounting a main obstacle in the pathway to scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Initialization and operation of spin qubits in silicon above 1 K reach fidelities sufficient for fault-tolerant operations at these temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Mountain ranges contain high concentrations of endemic species and are indispensable refugia for lowland species that are facing anthropogenic climate change1,2. Forecasting biodiversity redistribution hinges on assessing whether species can track shifting isotherms as the climate warms3,4. However, a global analysis of the velocities of isotherm shifts along elevation gradients is hindered by the scarcity of weather stations in mountainous regions5. Here we address this issue by mapping the lapse rate of temperature (LRT) across mountain regions globally, both by using satellite data (SLRT) and by using the laws of thermodynamics to account for water vapour6 (that is, the moist adiabatic lapse rate (MALRT)). By dividing the rate of surface warming from 1971 to 2020 by either the SLRT or the MALRT, we provide maps of vertical isotherm shift velocities. We identify 17 mountain regions with exceptionally high vertical isotherm shift velocities (greater than 11.67 m per year for the SLRT; greater than 8.25 m per year for the MALRT), predominantly in dry areas but also in wet regions with shallow lapse rates; for example, northern Sumatra, the Brazilian highlands and southern Africa. By linking these velocities to the velocities of species range shifts, we report instances of close tracking in mountains with lower climate velocities. However, many species lag behind, suggesting that range shift dynamics would persist even if we managed to curb climate-change trajectories. Our findings are key for devising global conservation strategies, particularly in the 17 high-velocity mountain regions that we have identified. An analysis of the rate at which isotherms are shifting in mountain regions worldwide identifies 17 key regions with particularly high vertical isotherm shift velocities, and provides insight into how these shifts affect species ranges.",

    "abstract": "The Integrator complex can terminate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in the promoter-proximal region of genes. Previous work has shed light on how Integrator binds to the paused elongation complex consisting of Pol II, the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and the negative elongation factor (NELF) and how it cleaves the nascent RNA transcript1, but has not explained how Integrator removes Pol II from the DNA template. Here we present three cryo-electron microscopy structures of the complete Integrator–PP2A complex in different functional states. The structure of the pre-termination complex reveals a previously unresolved, scorpion-tail-shaped INTS10–INTS13–INTS14–INTS15 module that may use its ‘sting’ to open the DSIF DNA clamp and facilitate termination. The structure of the post-termination complex shows that the previously unresolved subunit INTS3 and associated sensor of single-stranded DNA complex (SOSS) factors prevent Pol II rebinding to Integrator after termination. The structure of the free Integrator–PP2A complex in an inactive closed conformation2 reveals that INTS6 blocks the PP2A phosphatase active site. These results lead to a model for how Integrator terminates Pol II transcription in three steps that involve major rearrangements. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human Integrator complex in three different functional states shed light on how Integrator terminates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription by disengaging Pol II from the DNA template.",

    "abstract": "Wigner predicted that when the Coulomb interactions between electrons become much stronger than their kinetic energy, electrons crystallize into a closely packed lattice1. A variety of two-dimensional systems have shown evidence for Wigner crystals2–11 (WCs). However, a spontaneously formed classical or quantum WC has never been directly visualized. Neither the identification of the WC symmetry nor direct investigation of its melting has been accomplished. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements to directly image a magnetic-field-induced electron WC in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene and examine its structural properties as a function of electron density, magnetic field and temperature. At high fields and the lowest temperature, we observe a triangular lattice electron WC in the lowest Landau level. The WC possesses the expected lattice constant and is robust between filling factor ν ≈ 0.13 and ν ≈ 0.38 except near fillings where it competes with fractional quantum Hall states. Increasing the density or temperature results in the melting of the WC into a liquid phase that is isotropic but has a modulated structure characterized by the Bragg wavevector of the WC. At low magnetic fields, the WC unexpectedly transitions into an anisotropic stripe phase, which has been commonly anticipated to form in higher Landau levels. Analysis of individual lattice sites shows signatures that may be related to the quantum zero-point motion of electrons in the WC lattice. A magnetic-field-induced Wigner crystal in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene was directly imaged using high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy and its structural properties as a function of electron density, magnetic field and temperature were examined.",

    "abstract": "Natural diamonds were (and are) formed (thousands of million years ago) in the upper mantle of Earth in metallic melts at temperatures of 900–1,400 °C and at pressures of 5–6 GPa (refs. 1,2). Diamond is thermodynamically stable under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions as per the phase diagram of carbon3. Scientists at General Electric invented and used a high-pressure and high-temperature apparatus in 1955 to synthesize diamonds by using molten iron sulfide at about 7 GPa and 1,600 °C (refs. 4–6). There is an existing model that diamond can be grown using liquid metals only at both high pressure and high temperature7. Here we describe the growth of diamond crystals and polycrystalline diamond films with no seed particles using liquid metal but at 1 atm pressure and at 1,025 °C, breaking this pattern. Diamond grew in the subsurface of liquid metal composed of gallium, iron, nickel and silicon, by catalytic activation of methane and diffusion of carbon atoms into and within the subsurface regions. We found that the supersaturation of carbon in the liquid metal subsurface leads to the nucleation and growth of diamonds, with Si playing an important part in stabilizing tetravalently bonded carbon clusters that play a part in nucleation. Growth of (metastable) diamond in liquid metal at moderate temperature and 1 atm pressure opens many possibilities for further basic science studies and for the scaling of this type of growth. Diamond crystals and polycrystalline diamond films can be grown using liquid metal at standard pressure and high temperature instead of conventional high pressure and high temperature.",

    "abstract": "International differences in the incidence of many cancer types indicate the existence of carcinogen exposures that have not yet been identified by conventional epidemiology make a substantial contribution to cancer burden1. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, obesity, hypertension and tobacco smoking are risk factors, but they do not explain the geographical variation in its incidence2. Underlying causes can be inferred by sequencing the genomes of cancers from populations with different incidence rates and detecting differences in patterns of somatic mutations. Here we sequenced 962 clear cell renal cell carcinomas from 11 countries with varying incidence. The somatic mutation profiles differed between countries. In Romania, Serbia and Thailand, mutational signatures characteristic of aristolochic acid compounds were present in most cases, but these were rare elsewhere. In Japan, a mutational signature of unknown cause was found in more than 70% of cases but in less than 2% elsewhere. A further mutational signature of unknown cause was ubiquitous but exhibited higher mutation loads in countries with higher incidence rates of kidney cancer. Known signatures of tobacco smoking correlated with tobacco consumption, but no signature was associated with obesity or hypertension, suggesting that non-mutagenic mechanisms of action underlie these risk factors. The results of this study indicate the existence of multiple, geographically variable, mutagenic exposures that potentially affect tens of millions of people and illustrate the opportunities for new insights into cancer causation through large-scale global cancer genomics. Whole-genome sequencing of 962 clear cell renal cell carcinomas from 11 countries shows geographic variations in somatic mutation profiles, including a mutational signature of unknown cause in 70% of cases from Japan.",

This risk is particularly important when large initial failures occur, as tends to be the case in the most disastrous collapses6. Here we present an original design approach to arrest collapse propagation after major initial failures. When a collapse initiates, the approach ensures that specific elements fail before the failure of the most critical components for global stability. The structural system thus separates into different parts and isolates collapse when its propagation would otherwise be inevitable. The effectiveness of the approach is proved through unique experimental tests on a purposely built full-scale building. We also demonstrate that large initial failures would lead to total collapse of the test building if increased connectivity was implemented as recommended by present guidelines. Our proposed approach enables incorporating a last line of defence for more resilient buildings. A design approach arrests collapse propagation in buildings after major initial failures by ensuring that specific elements fail before the failure of the most important components for global stability.",

    "abstract": "Ice surfaces are closely relevant to many physical and chemical properties, such as melting, freezing, friction, gas uptake and atmospheric reaction1–8. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations9–17, the exact atomic structures of ice interfaces remain elusive owing to the vulnerable hydrogen-bonding network and the complicated premelting process. Here we realize atomic-resolution imaging of the basal (0001) surface structure of hexagonal water ice (ice Ih) by using qPlus-based cryogenic atomic force microscopy with a carbon monoxide-functionalized tip. We find that the crystalline ice-Ih surface consists of mixed Ih- and cubic (Ic)-stacking nanodomains, forming \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$\\sqrt{19}\\times \\sqrt{19}$$\n                \n               periodic superstructures. Density functional theory reveals that this reconstructed surface is stabilized over the ideal ice surface mainly by minimizing the electrostatic repulsion between dangling OH bonds. Moreover, we observe that the ice surface gradually becomes disordered with increasing temperature (above 120 Kelvin), indicating the onset of the premelting process. The surface premelting occurs from the defective boundaries between the Ih and Ic domains and can be promoted by the formation of a planar local structure. These results put an end to the longstanding debate on ice surface structures and shed light on the molecular origin of ice premelting, which may lead to a paradigm shift in the understanding of ice physics and chemistry. Atomic-resolution imaging of the surface structure of hexagonal water ice is achieved using cryogenic atomic force microscopy, providing a molecular perspective on the origin and mechanism of of ice premelting.",

    "abstract": "Image sensors face substantial challenges when dealing with dynamic, diverse and unpredictable scenes in open-world applications. However, the development of image sensors towards high speed, high resolution, large dynamic range and high precision is limited by power and bandwidth. Here we present a complementary sensing paradigm inspired by the human visual system that involves parsing visual information into primitive-based representations and assembling these primitives to form two complementary vision pathways: a cognition-oriented pathway for accurate cognition and an action-oriented pathway for rapid response. To realize this paradigm, a vision chip called Tianmouc is developed, incorporating a hybrid pixel array and a parallel-and-heterogeneous readout architecture. Leveraging the characteristics of the complementary vision pathway, Tianmouc achieves high-speed sensing of up to 10,000 fps, a dynamic range of 130 dB and an advanced figure of merit in terms of spatial resolution, speed and dynamic range. Furthermore, it adaptively reduces bandwidth by 90%. We demonstrate the integration of a Tianmouc chip into an autonomous driving system, showcasing its abilities to enable accurate, fast and robust perception, even in challenging corner cases on open roads. The primitive-based complementary sensing paradigm helps in overcoming fundamental limitations in developing vision systems for diverse open-world applications. Inspired by the human visual system, a vision chip with primitive-based complementary pathways is developed to overcome the power and bandwidth wall of vision systems, achieving fast, precise, robust and high-dynamic-range sensing efficiently in the open world.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in aerosol pollution studies and climate change assessment is to understand how atmospheric aerosol particles are initially formed1,2. Although new particle formation (NPF) mechanisms have been described at specific sites3–6, in most regions, such mechanisms remain uncertain to a large extent because of the limited ability of atmospheric models to simulate critical NPF processes1,7. Here we synthesize molecular-level experiments to develop comprehensive representations of 11 NPF mechanisms and the complex chemical transformation of precursor gases in a fully coupled global climate model. Combined simulations and observations show that the dominant NPF mechanisms are distinct worldwide and vary with region and altitude. Previously neglected or underrepresented mechanisms involving organics, amines, iodine oxoacids and HNO3 probably dominate NPF in most regions with high concentrations of aerosols or large aerosol radiative forcing; such regions include oceanic and human-polluted continental boundary layers, as well as the upper troposphere over rainforests and Asian monsoon regions. These underrepresented mechanisms also play notable roles in other areas, such as the upper troposphere of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Accordingly, NPF accounts for different fractions (10–80%) of the nuclei on which cloud forms at 0.5% supersaturation over various regions in the lower troposphere. The comprehensive simulation of global NPF mechanisms can help improve estimation and source attribution of the climate effects of aerosols. Molecular-level experiments are described to develop a detailed assessment of 11 new particle formation mechanisms in a global climate model and, in comparison with simulations and observations, the dominant mechanisms worldwide are mapped.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Kitaev chains can be used to engineer Majorana bound states (MBSs) in superconductor–semiconductor hybrids1–4. In this work, we realize a two-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas by coupling two quantum dots through a region proximitized by a superconductor. We demonstrate systematic control over inter-dot couplings through in-plane rotations of the magnetic field and via electrostatic gating of the proximitized region. This allows us to tune the system to sweet spots in parameter space, where robust correlated zero-bias conductance peaks are observed in tunnelling spectroscopy. To study the extent of hybridization between localized MBSs, we probe the evolution of the energy spectrum with magnetic field and estimate the Majorana polarization, an important metric for Majorana-based qubits5,6. The implementation of a Kitaev chain on a scalable and flexible two-dimensional platform provides a realistic path towards more advanced experiments that require manipulation and readout of multiple MBSs. We have implemented a two-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas by coupling quantum dots through Andreev bound states in a superconductor–semiconductor hybrid region.",

    "abstract": "Animal movement is controlled by motor neurons (MNs), which project out of the central nervous system to activate muscles1. MN activity is coordinated by complex premotor networks that facilitate the contribution of individual muscles to many different behaviours2–6. Here we use connectomics7 to analyse the wiring logic of premotor circuits controlling the Drosophila leg and wing. We find that both premotor networks cluster into modules that link MNs innervating muscles with related functions. Within most leg motor modules, the synaptic weights of each premotor neuron are proportional to the size of their target MNs, establishing a circuit basis for hierarchical MN recruitment. By contrast, wing premotor networks lack proportional synaptic connectivity, which may enable more flexible recruitment of wing steering muscles. Through comparison of the architecture of distinct motor control systems within the same animal, we identify common principles of premotor network organization and specializations that reflect the unique biomechanical constraints and evolutionary origins of leg and wing motor control. We use connectomics to compare the wiring logic of premotor circuits controlling the Drosophila leg and wing, finding that both premotor networks cluster into modules that link motor neurons innervating muscles with related functions.",

    "abstract": "A defining pathological feature of most neurodegenerative diseases is the assembly of proteins into amyloid that form disease-specific structures1. In Alzheimer’s disease, this is characterized by the deposition of β-amyloid and tau with disease-specific conformations. The in situ structure of amyloid in the human brain is unknown. Here, using cryo-fluorescence microscopy-targeted cryo-sectioning, cryo-focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy lift-out and cryo-electron tomography, we determined in-tissue architectures of β-amyloid and tau pathology in a postmortem Alzheimer’s disease donor brain. β-amyloid plaques contained a mixture of fibrils, some of which were branched, and protofilaments, arranged in parallel arrays and lattice-like structures. Extracellular vesicles and cuboidal particles defined the non-amyloid constituents of β-amyloid plaques. By contrast, tau inclusions formed parallel clusters of unbranched filaments. Subtomogram averaging a cluster of 136 tau filaments in a single tomogram revealed the polypeptide backbone conformation and filament polarity orientation of paired helical filaments within tissue. Filaments within most clusters were similar to each other, but were different between clusters, showing amyloid heterogeneity that is spatially organized by subcellular location. The in situ structural approaches outlined here for human donor tissues have applications to a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases. The in-tissue architectures of β-amyloid and tau pathology in a postmortem Alzheimer’s disease donor brain are determined, showing fibril heterogeneity is spatially organized by subcellular location and suggesting applications to a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Advances in science, medicine and engineering rely on breakthroughs in imaging, particularly for obtaining multiscale, three-dimensional information from functional systems such as integrated circuits or mammalian brains. Achieving this goal often requires combining electron- and photon-based approaches. Whereas electron microscopy provides nanometre resolution through serial, destructive imaging of surface layers1, ptychographic X-ray computed tomography2 offers non-destructive imaging and has recently achieved resolutions down to seven nanometres for a small volume3. Here we implement burst ptychography, which overcomes experimental instabilities and enables much higher performance, with 4-nanometre resolution at a 170-times faster acquisition rate, namely, 14,000 resolution elements per second. Another key innovation is tomographic back-propagation reconstruction4, allowing us to image samples up to ten times larger than the conventional depth of field. By combining the two innovations, we successfully imaged a state-of-the-art (seven-nanometre node) commercial integrated circuit, featuring nanostructures made of low- and high-density materials such as silicon and metals, which offer good radiation stability and contrast at the selected X-ray wavelength. These capabilities enabled a detailed study of the chip’s design and manufacturing, down to the level of individual transistors. We anticipate that the combination of nanometre resolution and higher X-ray flux at next-generation X-ray sources will have a revolutionary impact in fields ranging from electronics to electrochemistry and neuroscience. X-ray computed tomography is combined with burst ptychography and filtered back-propagation to achieve high-speed, three-dimensional imaging of features as small as 4 nm.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the abnormal filamentous assembly of specific proteins in the central nervous system1. Human genetic studies have established a causal role for protein assembly in neurodegeneration2. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, which is limiting progress in developing clinical tools for these diseases. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have enabled the structures of the protein filaments to be determined from the brains of patients1. All neurodegenerative diseases studied to date have been characterized by the self-assembly of proteins in homomeric amyloid filaments, including that of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) types A and B3,4. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine filament structures from the brains of individuals with FTLD-TDP type C, one of the most common forms of sporadic FTLD-TDP. Unexpectedly, the structures revealed that a second protein, annexin A11 (ANXA11), co-assembles with TDP-43 in heteromeric amyloid filaments. The ordered filament fold is formed by TDP-43 residues G282/G284–N345 and ANXA11 residues L39–Y74 from their respective low-complexity domains. Regions of TDP-43 and ANXA11  that were previously implicated in protein–protein interactions form an extensive hydrophobic interface at the centre of the filament fold. Immunoblots of the filaments revealed that the majority of ANXA11 exists as an approximately 22 kDa N-terminal fragment lacking the annexin core domain. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections showed the colocalization of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in inclusions, redefining the histopathology of FTLD-TDP type C. This work establishes a central role for ANXA11 in FTLD-TDP type C. The unprecedented formation of heteromeric amyloid filaments in the human brain revises our understanding of amyloid assembly and may be of significance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Using cryo-electron microscopy, heteromeric amyloid filaments composed of TDP-43 and ANXA11 in the brains of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration type C are discovered.",

    "abstract": "Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental precision limits of a quantum sensor1. Optical atomic clocks2, the current state of the art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology3–6. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection7–10 with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing11,12 offers a promising route towards making use of highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and use a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schrödinger cat states of the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to nine optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit (SQL) using GHZ states of up to four qubits. However, because of their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared with unentangled atoms13. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval14–17. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision. A family of multi-qubit Rydberg quantum gates is developed and used to generate Schrödinger cat states in an optical clock, allowing improvement in frequency measurement precision by taking advantage of entanglement.",

While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for these intended purposes has arisen naturally. Here we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays to design and empirically test thousands of CREs4–8. Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs from massively parallel reporter assay models and demonstrate the required literacy to write fit-for-purpose regulatory code. A generalizable framework to prospectively engineer cis-regulatory elements from massively parallel reporter assay models can be used to write fit-for-purpose regulatory code.",

    "abstract": "To study the spatial interactions among cancer and non-cancer cells1, we here examined a cohort of 131 tumour sections from 78 cases across 6 cancer types by Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST). This was combined with 48 matched single-nucleus RNA sequencing samples and 22 matched co-detection by indexing (CODEX) samples. To describe tumour structures and habitats, we defined ‘tumour microregions’ as spatially distinct cancer cell clusters separated by stromal components. They varied in size and density among cancer types, with the largest microregions observed in metastatic samples. We further grouped microregions with shared genetic alterations into ‘spatial subclones’. Thirty five tumour sections exhibited subclonal structures. Spatial subclones with distinct copy number variations and mutations displayed differential oncogenic activities. We identified increased metabolic activity at the centre and increased antigen presentation along the leading edges of microregions. We also observed variable T cell infiltrations within microregions and macrophages predominantly residing at tumour boundaries. We reconstructed 3D tumour structures by co-registering 48 serial ST sections from 16 samples, which provided insights into the spatial organization and heterogeneity of tumours. Additionally, using an unsupervised deep-learning algorithm and integrating ST and CODEX data, we identified both immune hot and cold neighbourhoods and enhanced immune exhaustion markers surrounding the 3D subclones. These findings contribute to the understanding of spatial tumour evolution through interactions with the local microenvironment in 2D and 3D space, providing valuable insights into tumour biology. Visium spatial transcriptomics, single-nucleus RNA sequencing and co-detection by indexing are used to identify distinct spatial microregions in tumours and their microenvironment across six diverse solid cancer types.",

    "abstract": "As cancers progress, they become increasingly aggressive—metastatic tumours are less responsive to first-line therapies than primary tumours, they acquire resistance to successive therapies and eventually cause death1,2. Mutations are largely conserved between primary and metastatic tumours from the same patients, suggesting that non-genetic phenotypic plasticity has a major role in cancer progression and therapy resistance3–5. However, we lack an understanding of metastatic cell states and the mechanisms by which they transition. Here, in a cohort of biospecimen trios from same-patient normal colon, primary and metastatic colorectal cancer, we show that, although primary tumours largely adopt LGR5+ intestinal stem-like states, metastases display progressive plasticity. Cancer cells lose intestinal cell identities and reprogram into a highly conserved fetal progenitor state before undergoing non-canonical differentiation into divergent squamous and neuroendocrine-like states, a process that is exacerbated in metastasis and by chemotherapy and is associated with poor patient survival. Using matched patient-derived organoids, we demonstrate that metastatic cells exhibit greater cell-autonomous multilineage differentiation potential in response to microenvironment cues compared with their intestinal lineage-restricted primary tumour counterparts. We identify PROX1 as a repressor of non-intestinal lineage in the fetal progenitor state, and show that downregulation of PROX1 licenses non-canonical reprogramming. Colorectal cancer metastasis involves dramatic plasticity and loss of PROX1-mediated repression of non-intestinal lineages.",

    "abstract": "The posterior parietal cortex exhibits choice-selective activity during perceptual decision-making tasks1–10. However, it is not known how this selective activity arises from the underlying synaptic connectivity. Here we combined virtual-reality behaviour, two-photon calcium imaging, high-throughput electron microscopy and circuit modelling to analyse how synaptic connectivity between neurons in the posterior parietal cortex relates to their selective activity. We found that excitatory pyramidal neurons preferentially target inhibitory interneurons with the same selectivity. In turn, inhibitory interneurons preferentially target pyramidal neurons with opposite selectivity, forming an opponent inhibition motif. This motif was present even between neurons with activity peaks in different task epochs. We developed neural-circuit models of the computations performed by these motifs, and found that opponent inhibition between neural populations with opposite selectivity amplifies selective inputs, thereby improving the encoding of trial-type information. The models also predict that opponent inhibition between neurons with activity peaks in different task epochs contributes to creating choice-specific sequential activity. These results provide evidence for how synaptic connectivity in cortical circuits supports a learned decision-making task. Excitatory pyramidal neurons preferentially target inhibitory interneurons with the same selectivity and, in turn, inhibitory interneurons preferentially target pyramidal neurons with opposite selectivity, forming an opponent inhibition motif that supports decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Within the family of two-dimensional dielectrics, rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) is considerably promising owing to having not only the superior properties of hexagonal boron nitride1–4—including low permittivity and dissipation, strong electrical insulation, good chemical stability, high thermal conductivity and atomic flatness without dangling bonds—but also useful optical nonlinearity and interfacial ferroelectricity originating from the broken in-plane and out-of-plane centrosymmetry5–23. However, the preparation of large-sized single-crystal rBN layers remains a challenge24–26, owing to the requisite unprecedented growth controls to coordinate the lattice orientation of each layer and the sliding vector of every interface. Here we report a facile methodology using bevel-edge epitaxy to prepare centimetre-sized single-crystal rBN layers with exact interlayer ABC stacking on a vicinal nickel surface. We realized successful accurate fabrication over a single-crystal nickel substrate with bunched step edges of the terrace facet (100) at the bevel facet (110), which simultaneously guided the consistent boron–nitrogen bond orientation in each BN layer and the rhombohedral stacking of BN layers via nucleation near each bevel facet. The pure rhombohedral phase of the as-grown BN layers was verified, and consequently showed robust, homogeneous and switchable ferroelectricity with a high Curie temperature. Our work provides an effective route for accurate stacking-controlled growth of single-crystal two-dimensional layers and presents a foundation for applicable multifunctional devices based on stacked two-dimensional materials.  Centimetre-sized single-crystal rhombohedral boron nitride layers are achieved through bevel-edge epitaxy, and the resulting material exhibits robust, homogeneous and switchable ferroelectricity with a high Curie temperature.",

    "abstract": "Observations of transiting gas giant exoplanets have revealed a pervasive depletion of methane1–4, which has only recently been identified atmospherically5,6. The depletion is thought to be maintained by disequilibrium processes such as photochemistry or mixing from a hotter interior7–9. However, the interiors are largely unconstrained along with the vertical mixing strength and only upper limits on the CH4 depletion have been available. The warm Neptune WASP-107b stands out among exoplanets with an unusually low density, reported low core mass10, and temperatures amenable to CH4, though previous observations have yet to find the molecule2,4. Here we present a JWST-NIRSpec transmission spectrum of WASP-107b that shows features from both SO2 and CH4 along with H2O, CO2, and CO. We detect methane with 4.2σ significance at an abundance of 1.0 ± 0.5 ppm, which is depleted by 3 orders of magnitude relative to equilibrium expectations. Our results are highly constraining for the atmosphere and interior, which indicate the envelope has a super-solar metallicity of 43 ± 8 × solar, a hot interior with an intrinsic temperature of Tint = 460 ± 40 K, and vigorous vertical mixing which depletes CH4 with a diffusion coefficient of Kzz = 1011.6±0.1 cm2 s−1. Photochemistry has a negligible effect on the CH4 abundance but is needed to account for the SO2. We infer a core mass of \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${11.5}_{-3.6}^{+3.0}{M}_{\\oplus }$$\n                \n              , which is much higher than previous upper limits10, releasing a tension with core-accretion models11. Observations of the warm Neptune WASP-107b show that the planet has a hot interior with an intrinsic temperature of about 460 K.",

    "abstract": "The strength of materials depends on the rate at which they are tested, as defects, for example dislocations, that move in response to applied strains have intrinsic kinetic limitations1–4. As the deformation strain rate increases, more strengthening mechanisms become active and increase the strength4–7. However, the regime in which this transition happens has been difficult to access with traditional micromechanical strength measurements. Here, with microballistic impact testing at strain rates greater than 106 s−1, and without shock conflation, we show that the strength of copper increases by about 30% for a 157 °C increase in temperature, an effect also observed in pure titanium and gold. This effect is counterintuitive, as almost all materials soften when heated under normal conditions. This anomalous thermal strengthening across several pure metals is the result of a change in the controlling deformation mechanism from thermally activated strengthening to ballistic transport of dislocations, which experience drag through phonon interactions1,8–10. These results point to a pathway to better model and predict materials properties under various extreme strain rate conditions, from high-speed manufacturing operations11 to hypersonic transport12. Microballistic impact testing at strain rates greater than 106 s−1 shows that pure metals, including copper, gold and titanium, become stronger with increasing temperature.",

    "abstract": "Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) synthesis of graphene on copper has been broadly adopted since the first demonstration of this process1. However, widespread use of CVD-grown graphene for basic science and applications has been hindered by challenges with reproducibility2 and quality3. Here we identify trace oxygen as a key factor determining the growth trajectory and quality for graphene grown by low-pressure CVD. Oxygen-free chemical vapour deposition (OF-CVD) synthesis is fast and highly reproducible, with kinetics that can be described by a compact model, whereas adding trace oxygen leads to suppressed nucleation and slower/incomplete growth. Oxygen affects graphene quality as assessed by surface contamination, emergence of the Raman D peak and decrease in electrical conductivity. Epitaxial graphene grown in oxygen-free conditions is contamination-free and shows no detectable D peak. After dry transfer and boron nitride encapsulation, it shows room-temperature electrical-transport behaviour close to that of exfoliated graphene. A graphite-gated device shows well-developed integer and fractional quantum Hall effects. By highlighting the importance of eliminating trace oxygen, this work provides guidance for future CVD system design and operation. The increased reproducibility and quality afforded by OF-CVD synthesis will broadly influence basic research and applications of graphene. Assessment of surface contamination shows that trace oxygen is a key factor influencing the trajectory and quality of graphene grown by low-pressure chemical vapour deposition, with oxygen-free synthesis showing increased reproducibility and quality.",

    "abstract": "The upper airway is an important site of infection, but immune memory in the human upper airway is poorly understood, with implications for COVID-19 and many other human diseases1–4. Here we demonstrate that nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs can be used to obtain insights into these challenging problems, and define distinct immune cell populations, including antigen-specific memory B cells and T cells, in two adjacent anatomical sites in the upper airway. Upper airway immune cell populations seemed stable over time in healthy adults undergoing monthly swabs for more than 1 year, and prominent tissue resident memory T (TRM) cell and B (BRM) cell populations were defined. Unexpectedly, germinal centre cells were identified consistently in many nasopharyngeal swabs. In subjects with SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections, local virus-specific BRM cells, plasma cells and germinal centre B cells were identified, with evidence of local priming and an enrichment of IgA+ memory B cells in upper airway compartments compared with blood. Local plasma cell populations were identified with transcriptional profiles of longevity. Local virus-specific memory CD4+ TRM cells and CD8+ TRM cells were identified, with diverse additional virus-specific T cells. Age-dependent upper airway immunological shifts were observed. These findings provide new understanding of immune memory at a principal mucosal barrier tissue in humans. This study of immunological memory diversity in the human upper airway provides new understanding of immune memory at a major mucosal barrier tissue in humans.",

Here we examine the diversity of ecDNA elements across cancer, revealing the associated tissue, genetic and mutational contexts. By analysing data from 14,778 patients with 39 tumour types from the 100,000 Genomes Project, we demonstrate that 17.1% of tumour samples contain ecDNA. We reveal a pattern highly indicative of tissue-context-based selection for ecDNAs, linking their genomic content to their tissue of origin. We show that not only is ecDNA a mechanism for amplification of driver oncogenes, but it also a mechanism that frequently amplifies immunomodulatory and inflammatory genes, such as those that modulate lymphocyte-mediated immunity and immune effector processes. Moreover, ecDNAs carrying immunomodulatory genes are associated with reduced tumour T cell infiltration. We identify ecDNAs bearing only enhancers, promoters and lncRNA elements, suggesting the combinatorial power of interactions between ecDNAs in trans. We also identify intrinsic and environmental mutational processes linked to ecDNA, including those linked to its formation, such as tobacco exposure, and progression, such as homologous recombination repair deficiency. Clinically, ecDNA detection was associated with tumour stage, more prevalent after targeted therapy and cytotoxic treatments, and associated with metastases and shorter overall survival. These results shed light on why ecDNA is a substantial clinical problem that can cooperatively drive tumour growth signals, alter transcriptional landscapes and suppress the immune system. A study examines the diversity of extrachromosomal DNA elements in cancer, and provides details on the frequency and origin of extrachromosomal DNA and its role in the development of different types of cancer.",

Patients with clinical or imaging benefit were eligible for subsequent intracerebroventricular (ICV) intracranial infusions (10–30 × 106 GD2-CART). Primary objectives were manufacturing feasibility, tolerability and the identification of maximally tolerated IV dose. Secondary objectives included preliminary assessments of benefit. Thirteen patients enroled, with 11 receiving IV GD2-CART on study (n = 3 DL1 (3 DIPG); n = 8 DL2 (6 DIPG, 2 sDMG)). GD2-CART manufacture was successful for all patients. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred on DL1, but three patients experienced dose-limiting cytokine release syndrome on DL2, establishing DL1 as the maximally tolerated IV dose. Nine patients received ICV infusions, with no dose-limiting toxicities. All patients exhibited tumour inflammation-associated neurotoxicity, safely managed with intensive monitoring and care. Four patients demonstrated major volumetric tumour reductions (52, 54, 91 and 100%), with a further three patients exhibiting smaller reductions. One patient exhibited a complete response ongoing for over 30 months since enrolment. Nine patients demonstrated neurological benefit, as measured by a protocol-directed clinical improvement score. Sequential IV, followed by ICV GD2-CART, induced tumour regressions and neurological improvements in patients with DIPG and those with sDMG. We evaluated the use of chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells targeting GD2 (GD2-CART) for H3K27M+ diffuse midline glioma (DMG), finding that intravenous administration of GD2-CART, followed by intracranial infusions, induced tumour regressions and neurological improvements in patients with H3K27M-mutant pontine or spinal DMG.",

    "abstract": "Humans and animals exhibit various forms of prosocial helping behaviour towards others in need1–3. Although previous research has investigated how individuals may perceive others’ states4,5, the neural mechanisms of how they respond to others’ needs and goals with helping behaviour remain largely unknown. Here we show that mice engage in a form of helping behaviour towards other individuals experiencing physical pain and injury—they exhibit allolicking (social licking) behaviour specifically towards the injury site, which aids the recipients in coping with pain. Using microendoscopic imaging, we found that single-neuron and ensemble activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes others’ state of pain and that this representation is different from that of general stress in others. Furthermore, functional manipulations demonstrate a causal role of the ACC in bidirectionally controlling targeted allolicking. Notably, this behaviour is represented in a population code in the ACC that differs from that of general allogrooming, a distinct type of prosocial behaviour elicited by others’ emotional stress. These findings advance our understanding of the neural coding and regulation of helping behaviour. A study describes the role of the anterior cingulate cortex in coding and regulating helping behaviour exhibited by mice towards others experiencing pain.",

    "abstract": "At room temperature, mechanical motion driven by the quantum backaction of light has been observed only in pioneering experiments in which an optical restoring force controls the oscillator stiffness1,2. For solid-state mechanical resonators in which oscillations are controlled by the material rigidity, the observation of these effects has been hindered by low mechanical quality factors, optical cavity frequency fluctuations3, thermal intermodulation noise4,5 and photothermal instabilities. Here we overcome these challenges with a phononic-engineered membrane-in-the-middle system. By using phononic-crystal-patterned cavity mirrors, we reduce the cavity frequency noise by more than 700-fold. In this ultralow noise cavity, we insert a membrane resonator with high thermal conductance and a quality factor (Q) of 180 million, engineered using recently developed soft-clamping techniques6,7. These advances enable the operation of the system within a factor of 2.5 of the Heisenberg limit for displacement sensing8, leading to the squeezing of the probe laser by 1.09(1) dB below the vacuum fluctuations. Moreover, the long thermal decoherence time of the membrane oscillator (30 vibrational periods) enables us to prepare conditional displaced thermal states of motion with an occupation of 0.97(2) phonons using a multimode Kalman filter. Our work extends the quantum control of solid-state macroscopic oscillators to room temperature.

    "abstract": "Baleen whales (mysticetes) use vocalizations to mediate their complex social and reproductive behaviours in vast, opaque marine environments1. Adapting to an obligate aquatic lifestyle demanded fundamental physiological changes to efficiently produce sound, including laryngeal specializations2–4. Whereas toothed whales (odontocetes) evolved a nasal vocal organ5, mysticetes have been thought to use the larynx for sound production1,6–8. However, there has been no direct demonstration that the mysticete larynx can phonate, or if it does, how it produces the great diversity of mysticete sounds9. Here we combine experiments on the excised larynx of three mysticete species with detailed anatomy and computational models to show that mysticetes evolved unique laryngeal structures for sound production. These structures allow some of the largest animals that ever lived to efficiently produce frequency-modulated, low-frequency calls. Furthermore, we show that this phonation mechanism is likely to be ancestral to all mysticetes and shares its fundamental physical basis with most terrestrial mammals, including humans10, birds11, and their closest relatives, odontocetes5. However, these laryngeal structures set insurmountable physiological limits to the frequency range and depth of their vocalizations, preventing them from escaping anthropogenic vessel noise12,13 and communicating at great depths14, thereby greatly reducing their active communication range. Studies of vocal production in baleen whales show that their larynx has evolved unique structures that enable their low-frequency vocalizations but limit their active communication range.",

How primates navigate the multidimensional social relationships that structure daily life4 and shape survival and reproductive success5 remains largely unclear at the single-neuron level. Here we combine ethological analysis, computer vision and wireless recording technologies to identify neural signatures of natural behaviour in unrestrained, socially interacting pairs of rhesus macaques. Single-neuron and population activity in the prefrontal and temporal cortex robustly encoded 24 species-typical behaviours, as well as social context. Male–female partners demonstrated near-perfect reciprocity in grooming, a key behavioural mechanism supporting friendships and alliances6, and neural activity maintained a running account of these social investments. Confronted with an aggressive intruder, behavioural and neural population responses reflected empathy and were buffered by the presence of a partner. Our findings reveal a highly distributed neurophysiological ledger of social dynamics, a potential computational foundation supporting communal life in primate societies, including our own. Single-neuron and population activity in the macaque prefrontal and temporal cortex robustly encodes 24 species-typical behaviours, reciprocity in social interactions and social support.",

    "abstract": "Stable aluminosilicate zeolites with extra-large pores that are open through rings of more than 12 tetrahedra could be used to process molecules larger than those currently manageable in zeolite materials. However, until very recently1–3, they proved elusive. In analogy to the interlayer expansion of layered zeolite precursors4,5, we report a strategy that yields thermally and hydrothermally stable silicates by expansion of a one-dimensional silicate chain with an intercalated silylating agent that separates and connects the chains. As a result, zeolites with extra-large pores delimited by 20, 16 and 16 Si tetrahedra along the three crystallographic directions are obtained. The as-made interchain-expanded zeolite contains dangling Si–CH3 groups that, by calcination, connect to each other, resulting in a true, fully connected (except possible defects) three-dimensional zeolite framework with a very low density. Additionally, it features triple four-ring units not seen before in any type of zeolite. The silicate expansion–condensation approach we report may be amenable to further extra-large-pore zeolite formation. Ti can be introduced in this zeolite, leading to a catalyst that is active in liquid-phase alkene oxidations involving bulky molecules, which shows promise in the industrially relevant clean production of propylene oxide using cumene hydroperoxide as an oxidant. We report a strategy that yields thermally and hydrothermally stable silicates by expansion of a one-dimensional silicate chain with an intercalated silylating agent that separates and connects the chains.",

    "abstract": "The historic Barnett effect describes how an inertial body with otherwise zero net magnetic moment acquires spontaneous magnetization when mechanically spinning1,2. Breakthrough experiments have recently shown that an ultrashort laser pulse destroys the magnetization of an ordered ferromagnet within hundreds of femtoseconds3, with the spins losing angular momentum to circularly polarized optical phonons as part of the ultrafast Einstein–de Haas effect4,5. However, the prospect of using such high-frequency vibrations of the lattice to reciprocally switch magnetization in a nearby magnetic medium has not yet been experimentally explored. Here we show that the spontaneous magnetization gained temporarily by means of the ultrafast Barnett effect, through the resonant excitation of circularly polarized optical phonons in a paramagnetic substrate, can be used to permanently reverse the magnetic state of a heterostructure mounted atop the said substrate. With the handedness of the phonons steering the direction of magnetic switching, the ultrafast Barnett effect offers a selective and potentially universal method for exercising ultrafast non-local control over magnetic order. Ultrafast light-induced driving of phonons at resonance in a substrate facilitates the permanent reversal of the magnetic state of a material mounted on it.",

Here we show, using double electron–electron resonance and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, how ligand-specific conformational changes of µOR translate into a broad range of intrinsic efficacies at the transducer level. We identify several conformations of the cytoplasmic face of the receptor that interconvert on different timescales, including a pre-activated conformation that is capable of G-protein binding, and a fully activated conformation that markedly reduces GDP affinity within the ternary complex. Interaction of β-arrestin-1 with the μOR core binding site appears less specific and occurs with much lower affinity than binding of Gi. Studies on the µ-opioid receptor using fluorescent labelling of intracellular residues and energy transfer experiments in the presence of different ligands with or without G-protein binding reveals conformational changes that correlate to ligand efficacy.",

While uniform strains are known to elicit limited effects on heat flow10–15, the impact of inhomogeneous strains has remained elusive owing to the coexistence of interfaces16–20 and defects21–23. Here we address this gap by introducing inhomogeneous strain through bending individual silicon nanoribbons on a custom-fabricated microdevice and measuring its effect on thermal transport while characterizing the strain-dependent vibrational spectra with sub-nanometre resolution. Our results show that a strain gradient of 0.112% per nanometre could lead to a drastic thermal conductivity reduction of 34 ± 5%, in clear contrast to the nearly constant values measured under uniform strains10,12,14,15. We further map the local lattice vibrational spectra using electron energy-loss spectroscopy, which reveals phonon peak shifts of several millielectron-volts along the strain gradient. This unique phonon spectra broadening effect intensifies phonon scattering and substantially impedes thermal transport, as evidenced by first-principles calculations. Our work uncovers a crucial piece of the long-standing puzzle of lattice dynamics under inhomogeneous strain, which is absent under uniform strain and eludes conventional understanding. We report on a method for inducing uncontaminated and precise inhomogeneous strain in nanoscale silicon ribbons and its use for determining physical effects in these strained materials, in particular, an increase in the range and control of thermal conductivity.",

    "abstract": "Despite its disordered liquid-like structure, glass exhibits solid-like mechanical properties1. The formation of glassy material occurs by vitrification, preventing crystallization and promoting an amorphous structure2. Glass is fundamental in diverse fields of materials science, owing to its unique optical, chemical and mechanical properties as well as durability, versatility and environmental sustainability3. However, engineering a glassy material without compromising its properties is challenging4–6. Here we report the discovery of a supramolecular amorphous glass formed by the spontaneous self-organization of the short aromatic tripeptide YYY initiated by non-covalent cross-linking with structural water7,8. This system uniquely combines often contradictory sets of properties; it is highly rigid yet can undergo complete self-healing at room temperature. Moreover, the supramolecular glass is an extremely strong adhesive yet it is transparent in a wide spectral range from visible to mid-infrared. This exceptional set of characteristics is observed in a simple bioorganic peptide glass composed of natural amino acids, presenting a multi-functional material that could be highly advantageous for various applications in science and engineering. A tyrosine tripeptide was discovered to unexpectedly form a supramolecular amorphous glassy material by constructing a non-specific hydrogen bonding network with structural water molecules.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is prototypical autoimmune disease driven by pathological T cell–B cell interactions1,2. Expansion of T follicular helper (TFH) and T peripheral helper (TPH) cells, two T cell populations that provide help to B cells, is a prominent feature of SLE3,4. Human TFH and TPH cells characteristically produce high levels of the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 (refs. 5,6), yet regulation of T cell CXCL13 production and the relationship between CXCL13+ T cells and other T cell states remains unclear. Here, we identify an imbalance in CD4+ T cell phenotypes in patients with SLE, with expansion of PD-1+/ICOS+ CXCL13+ T cells and reduction of CD96hi IL-22+ T cells. Using CRISPR screens, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) as a potent negative regulator of CXCL13 production by human CD4+ T cells. Transcriptomic, epigenetic and functional studies demonstrate that AHR coordinates with AP-1 family member JUN to prevent CXCL13+ TPH/TFH cell differentiation and promote an IL-22+ phenotype. Type I interferon, a pathogenic driver of SLE7, opposes AHR and JUN to promote T cell production of CXCL13. These results place CXCL13+ TPH/TFH cells on a polarization axis opposite from T helper 22 (TH22) cells and reveal AHR, JUN and interferon as key regulators of these divergent T cell states. Insufficient AHR activation has been suggested in SLE, and augmenting AHR activation therapeutically may prevent CXCL13+ TPH/TFH differentiation and the subsequent recruitment of B cells and formation of lymphoid aggregates in inflamed tissues.",

    "abstract": "We can now measure the connectivity of every neuron in a neural circuit1–9, but we cannot measure other biological details, including the dynamical characteristics of each neuron. The degree to which measurements of connectivity alone can inform the understanding of neural computation is an open question10. Here we show that with experimental measurements of only the connectivity of a biological neural network, we can predict the neural activity underlying a specified neural computation. We constructed a model neural network with the experimentally determined connectivity for 64 cell types in the motion pathways of the fruit fly optic lobe1–5 but with unknown parameters for the single-neuron and single-synapse properties. We then optimized the values of these unknown parameters using techniques from deep learning11, to allow the model network to detect visual motion12. Our mechanistic model makes detailed, experimentally testable predictions for each neuron in the connectome. We found that model predictions agreed with experimental measurements of neural activity across 26 studies. Our work demonstrates a strategy for generating detailed hypotheses about the mechanisms of neural circuit function from connectivity measurements. We show that this strategy is more likely to be successful when neurons are sparsely connected—a universally observed feature of biological neural networks across species and brain regions. A study demonstrates how experimental measurements of only the connectivity of a biological neural network can be used to predict neural responses across the fly visual system at single-neuron resolution using deep learning techniques.",

    "abstract": "Entanglement is a key feature of quantum mechanics1–3, with applications in fields such as metrology, cryptography, quantum information and quantum computation4–8. It has been observed in a wide variety of systems and length scales, ranging from the microscopic9–13 to the macroscopic14–16. However, entanglement remains largely unexplored at the highest accessible energy scales. Here we report the highest-energy observation of entanglement, in top–antitop quark events produced at the Large Hadron Collider, using a proton–proton collision dataset with a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 140 inverse femtobarns (fb)−1 recorded with the ATLAS experiment. Spin entanglement is detected from the measurement of a single observable D, inferred from the angle between the charged leptons in their parent top- and antitop-quark rest frames. The observable is measured in a narrow interval around the top–antitop quark production threshold, at which the entanglement detection is expected to be significant. It is reported in a fiducial phase space defined with stable particles to minimize the uncertainties that stem from the limitations of the Monte Carlo event generators and the parton shower model in modelling top-quark pair production. The entanglement marker is measured to be D = −0.537 ± 0.002 (stat.) ± 0.019 (syst.) for \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$340\\,{\\rm{GeV}} < {m}_{t\\bar{t}} < 380\\,{\\rm{GeV}}$$\n                \n              . The observed result is more than five standard deviations from a scenario without entanglement and hence constitutes the first observation of entanglement in a pair of quarks and the highest-energy observation of entanglement so far. Entanglement was observed in top–antitop quark events by the ATLAS experiment produced at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN using a proton–proton collision dataset with a centre-of-mass energy of √s  = 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 140 fb−1.",

    "abstract": "A catalogue of neuronal cell types has often been called a ‘parts list’ of the brain1, and regarded as a prerequisite for understanding brain function2,3. In the optic lobe of Drosophila, rules of connectivity between cell types have already proven to be essential for understanding fly vision4,5. Here we analyse the fly connectome to complete the list of cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, as well as the rules governing their connectivity. Most new cell types contain 10 to 100 cells, and integrate information over medium distances in the visual field. Some existing type families (Tm, Li, and LPi)6–10 at least double in number of types. A new serpentine medulla (Sm) interneuron family contains more types than any other. Three families of cross-neuropil types are revealed. The consistency of types is demonstrated by analysing the distances in high-dimensional feature space, and is further validated by algorithms that select small subsets of discriminative features. We use connectivity to hypothesize about the functional roles of cell types in motion, object and colour vision. Connectivity with ‘boundary types’ that straddle the optic lobe and central brain is also quantified. We showcase the advantages of connectomic cell typing: complete and unbiased sampling, a rich array of features based on connectivity and reduction of the connectome to a substantially simpler wiring diagram of cell types, with immediate relevance for brain function and development. An analysis of the Drosophila connectome yields all cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, and their rules of connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation and tissue fibrosis are common responses that worsen organ function, yet the molecular mechanisms governing their cross-talk are poorly understood. In diseased organs, stress-induced gene expression changes fuel maladaptive cell state transitions1 and pathological interaction between cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction in the lungs, liver, kidneys and heart, and exacerbates many cancers2, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are poorly understood. Here we show that conditional deletion of the transcriptional co-activator Brd4 in infiltrating Cx3cr1+ macrophages ameliorates heart failure in mice and significantly reduces fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1+ cells identified a large enhancer proximal to interleukin-1β (IL-1β, encoded by Il1b), and a series of CRISPR-based deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controls Il1b expression. Secreted IL-1β activated a fibroblast RELA-dependent (also known as p65) enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL-1β neutralization improved cardiac function and tissue fibrosis in heart failure. Systemic IL-1β inhibition or targeted Il1b deletion in Cx3cr1+ cells prevented stress-induced Meox1 expression and fibroblast activation. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent cross-talk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL-1β reveals how inflammation drives profibrotic cell states and supports strategies that modulate this process in heart disease and other chronic inflammatory disorders featuring tissue remodelling. Conditional deletion of the transcriptional co-activator Brd4 in infiltrating Cx3cr1+ mouse macrophages ameliorates heart failure and substantially reduces fibroblast activation.",

    "abstract": "The physical manifestations of memory formation and recall are fundamental questions that remain unresolved1. At the cellular level, ensembles of neurons called engrams are activated by learning events and control memory recall1–5. Astrocytes are found in close proximity to neurons and engage in a range of activities that support neurotransmission and circuit plasticity6–10. Moreover, astrocytes exhibit experience-dependent plasticity11–13, although whether specific ensembles of astrocytes participate in memory recall remains obscure. Here we show that learning events induce c-Fos expression in a subset of hippocampal astrocytes, and that this subsequently regulates the function of the hippocampal circuit in mice. Intersectional labelling of astrocyte ensembles with c-Fos after learning events shows that they are closely affiliated with engram neurons, and reactivation of these astrocyte ensembles stimulates memory recall. At the molecular level, learning-associated astrocyte (LAA) ensembles exhibit elevated expression of nuclear factor I-A, and its selective deletion from this population suppresses memory recall. Taken together, our data identify LAA ensembles as a form of plasticity that is sufficient to provoke memory recall and indicate that astrocytes are an active component of the engram. A study in mice shows that learning induces c-Fos expression in a subset of astrocytes in the hippocampus, and that ensembles of these learning-associated astrocytes are involved in the recall of memories.",

    "abstract": "All-inorganic perovskites prepared by substituting the organic cations (for example, methylammonium and formamidinium) with inorganic cations (for example, Cs+) are effective concepts to enhance the long-term photostability and thermal stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs)1,2. Hence, inorganic perovskite tandem solar cells (IPTSCs) are promising candidates for breaking the efficiency bottleneck and addressing the stability issue, too3,4. However, challenges remain in fabricating two-terminal (2T) IPTSCs due to the inferior film formation and deep trap states induced by tin cations5–7. Here a ligand evolution (LE) strategy with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (PTSH) is used to regulate film formation and eliminate deep traps in inorganic narrow-bandgap (NBG) perovskites, enabling the successful development of 2T IPTSCs. Accordingly, the 1.31 eV CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3:LE device delivers a record efficiency of 17.41%. Combined with the 1.92 eV CsPbI2Br top cell, 2T IPTSCs exhibit a champion efficiency of 22.57% (certified, 21.92%). Moreover, IPTSCs are engineered to deliver remarkable durability under maximum power point (MPP) tracking, maintaining 80% of their initial efficiency at 65 °C for 1,510 h and at 85 °C for 800 h. We elucidate that LE deliberately leverages multiple roles for inorganic NBG perovskite growth and anticipate that our study provides an insightful guideline for developing high-efficiency and stable IPTSCs. Inorganic perovskite tandem solar cells using ligand evolution strategy achieve record efficiencies and durability, maintaining 80% of their initial efficiency under light/heat stresses, guiding the development of high-efficiency, stable inorganic perovskite tandem solar cells.",

    "abstract": "The recent inference of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of the hot (approximately 1,100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST observations1–3 suggests that photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature exoplanet atmospheres4. This is because of the low (<1 ppb) abundance of SO2 under thermochemical equilibrium compared with that produced from the photochemistry of H2O and H2S (1–10 ppm)4–9. However, the SO2 inference was made from a single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05 μm and, therefore, the detection of other SO2 absorption bands at different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO2 abundance. Here we report the detection of SO2 spectral features at 7.7 and 8.5 μm in the 5–12-μm transmission spectrum of WASP-39b measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS)10. Our observations suggest an abundance of SO2 of 0.5–25 ppm (1σ range), consistent with previous findings4. As well as SO2, we find broad water-vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10 μm. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we derive an atmospheric heavy-element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of approximately 7.1–8.0 times solar and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range. Observations from the JWST MIRI/LRS show the detection of SO2 spectral features in the 5–12-μm transmission spectrum of the hot, Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b, suggesting that photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature exoplanet atmospheres.",

    "abstract": "The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a family C G-protein-coupled receptor1 (GPCR) that has a central role in regulating systemic calcium homeostasis2,3. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy and functional assays to investigate the activation of human CaSR embedded in lipid nanodiscs and its coupling to functional Gi versus Gq proteins in the presence and absence of the calcimimetic drug cinacalcet. High-resolution structures show that both Gi and Gq drive additional conformational changes in the activated CaSR dimer to stabilize a more extensive asymmetric interface of the seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) that involves key protein–lipid interactions. Selective Gi and Gq coupling by the receptor is achieved through substantial rearrangements of intracellular loop 2 and the C terminus, which contribute differentially towards the binding of the two G-protein subtypes, resulting in distinct CaSR–G-protein interfaces. The structures also reveal that natural polyamines target multiple sites on CaSR to enhance receptor activation by zipping negatively charged regions between two protomers. Furthermore, we find that the amino acid l-tryptophan, a well-known ligand of CaSR extracellular domains, occupies the 7TM bundle of the G-protein-coupled protomer at the same location as cinacalcet and other allosteric modulators. Together, these results provide a framework for G-protein activation and selectivity by CaSR, as well as its allosteric modulation by endogenous and exogenous ligands. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human calcium-sensing receptor in complex with Gi and Gq proteins reveal how this receptor activates distinct G protein subtypes and how its function is modulated by a variety of ligands.",

    "abstract": "To survive bacteriophage (phage) infections, bacteria developed numerous anti-phage defence systems1–7. Some of them (for example, type III CRISPR–Cas, CBASS, Pycsar and Thoeris) consist of two modules: a sensor responsible for infection recognition and an effector that stops viral replication by destroying key cellular components8–12. In the Thoeris system, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain protein, ThsB, acts as a sensor that synthesizes an isomer of cyclic ADP ribose, 1′′−3′ glycocyclic ADP ribose (gcADPR), which is bound in the Smf/DprA-LOG (SLOG) domain of the ThsA effector and activates the silent information regulator 2 (SIR2)-domain-mediated hydrolysis of a key cell metabolite, NAD+ (refs. 12–14). Although the structure of ThsA has been solved15, the ThsA activation mechanism remained incompletely understood. Here we show that 1′′−3′ gcADPR, synthesized in vitro by the dimeric ThsB′ protein, binds to the ThsA SLOG domain, thereby activating ThsA by triggering helical filament assembly of ThsA tetramers. The cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of activated ThsA revealed that filament assembly stabilizes the active conformation of the ThsA SIR2 domain, enabling rapid NAD+ depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that filament formation enables a switch-like response of ThsA to the 1′′−3′ gcADPR signal. A study reports that the Theoris anti-phage defence system is activated through helical filament assembly of the ThsA effector and details the activation mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase adds G-rich telomeric repeats to the 3′ ends of telomeres1, counteracting telomere shortening caused by loss of telomeric 3′ overhangs during leading-strand DNA synthesis (‘the end-replication problem’2). Here we report a second end-replication problem that originates from the incomplete duplication of the C-rich telomeric repeat strand (C-strand) by lagging-strand DNA synthesis. This problem is resolved by fill-in synthesis mediated by polymerase α-primase bound to Ctc1–Stn1–Ten1 (CST–Polα-primase). In vitro, priming for lagging-strand DNA replication does not occur on the 3′ overhang and lagging-strand synthesis stops in a zone of approximately 150 nucleotides (nt) more than 26 nt from the end of the template. Consistent with the in vitro data, lagging-end telomeres of cells lacking CST–Polα-primase lost 50–60 nt of telomeric CCCTAA repeats per population doubling. The C-strands of leading-end telomeres shortened by around 100 nt per population doubling, reflecting the generation of 3′ overhangs through resection. The measured overall C-strand shortening in the absence of CST–Polα-primase fill-in is consistent with the combined effects of incomplete lagging-strand synthesis and 5′ resection at the leading ends. We conclude that canonical DNA replication creates two telomere end-replication problems that require telomerase to maintain the G-rich strand and CST–Polα-primase to maintain the C-strand. Incomplete duplication of the C-rich telomeric repeat strand by lagging-strand DNA synthesis is counteracted by DNA synthesis mediated by CST–polymerase α-primase.",

    "abstract": "The capacity for terrestrial ecosystems to sequester additional carbon (C) with rising CO2 concentrations depends on soil nutrient availability1,2. Previous evidence suggested that mature forests growing on phosphorus (P)-deprived soils had limited capacity to sequester extra biomass under elevated CO2 (refs. 3–6), but uncertainty about ecosystem P cycling and its CO2 response represents a crucial bottleneck for mechanistic prediction of the land C sink under climate change7. Here, by compiling the first comprehensive P budget for a P-limited mature forest exposed to elevated CO2, we show a high likelihood that P captured by soil microorganisms constrains ecosystem P recycling and availability for plant uptake. Trees used P efficiently, but microbial pre-emption of mineralized soil P seemed to limit the capacity of trees for increased P uptake and assimilation under elevated CO2 and, therefore, their capacity to sequester extra C. Plant strategies to stimulate microbial P cycling and plant P uptake, such as increasing rhizosphere C release to soil, will probably be necessary for P-limited forests to increase C capture into new biomass. Our results identify the key mechanisms by which P availability limits CO2 fertilization of tree growth and will guide the development of Earth system models to predict future long-term C storage. Microbial pre-emption of mineralized soil P limits the capacity of trees for increased P uptake and assimilation under elevated CO2 and therefore restricts their capacity to sequester extra C.",

    "abstract": "Placebo effects are notable demonstrations of mind–body interactions1,2. During pain perception, in the absence of any treatment, an expectation of pain relief can reduce the experience of pain—a phenomenon known as placebo analgesia3–6. However, despite the strength of placebo effects and their impact on everyday human experience and the failure of clinical trials for new therapeutics7, the neural circuit basis of placebo effects has remained unclear. Here we show that analgesia from the expectation of pain relief is mediated by rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) neurons that project to the pontine nucleus (rACC→Pn)—a precerebellar nucleus with no established function in pain. We created a behavioural assay that generates placebo-like anticipatory pain relief in mice. In vivo calcium imaging of neural activity and electrophysiological recordings in brain slices showed that expectations of pain relief boost the activity of rACC→Pn neurons and potentiate neurotransmission in this pathway. Transcriptomic studies of Pn neurons revealed an abundance of opioid receptors, further suggesting a role in pain modulation. Inhibition of the rACC→Pn pathway disrupted placebo analgesia and decreased pain thresholds, whereas activation elicited analgesia in the absence of placebo conditioning. Finally, Purkinje cells exhibited activity patterns resembling those of rACC→Pn neurons during pain-relief expectation, providing cellular-level evidence for a role of the cerebellum in cognitive pain modulation. These findings open the possibility of targeting this prefrontal cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway with drugs or neurostimulation to treat pain. Analgesia from the expectation of pain relief is mediated by rostral anterior cingulate cortex neurons that project to the pontine nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in optical coherence control1–5 have unlocked many cutting-edge applications, including long-haul communication, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and optical coherence tomography6–8. Prevailing wisdom suggests that using more coherent light sources leads to enhanced system performance and device functionalities9–11. Our study introduces a photonic convolutional processing system that takes advantage of partially coherent light to boost computing parallelism without substantially sacrificing accuracy, potentially enabling larger-size photonic tensor cores. The reduction of the degree of coherence optimizes bandwidth use in the photonic convolutional processing system. This breakthrough challenges the traditional belief that coherence is essential or even advantageous in integrated photonic accelerators, thereby enabling the use of light sources with less rigorous feedback control and thermal-management requirements for high-throughput photonic computing. Here we demonstrate such a system in two photonic platforms for computing applications: a photonic tensor core using phase-change-material photonic memories that delivers parallel convolution operations to classify the gaits of ten patients with Parkinson’s disease with 92.2% accuracy (92.7% theoretically) and a silicon photonic tensor core with embedded electro-absorption modulators (EAMs) to facilitate 0.108 tera operations per second (TOPS) convolutional processing for classifying the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten digits dataset with 92.4% accuracy (95.0% theoretically). Two photonic platforms using a convolutional processing system with partially coherent light sources is shown to boost computing parallelism, demonstrated using the classification of gaits of patients with Parkinson’s disease and the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.",

    "abstract": "Endocytosis and lysosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors can be triggered by endogenous ligands. Therapeutic approaches such as lysosome-targeting chimaeras1,2 (LYTACs) and cytokine receptor-targeting chimeras3 (KineTACs) have used this to target specific proteins for degradation by fusing modified native ligands to target binding proteins. Although powerful, these approaches can be limited by competition with native ligands and requirements for chemical modification that limit genetic encodability and can complicate manufacturing, and, more generally, there may be no native ligands that stimulate endocytosis through a given receptor. Here we describe computational design approaches for endocytosis-triggering binding proteins (EndoTags) that overcome these challenges. We present EndoTags for insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), sortilin and transferrin receptors, and show that fusing these tags to soluble or transmembrane target protein binders leads to lysosomal trafficking and target degradation. As these receptors have different tissue distributions, the different EndoTags could enable targeting of degradation to different tissues. EndoTag fusion to a PD-L1 antibody considerably increases efficacy in a mouse tumour model compared to antibody alone. The modularity and genetic encodability of EndoTags enables AND gate control for higher-specificity targeted degradation, and the localized secretion of degraders from engineered cells. By promoting endocytosis, EndoTag fusion increases signalling through an engineered ligand–receptor system by nearly 100-fold. EndoTags have considerable therapeutic potential as targeted degradation inducers, signalling activators for endocytosis-dependent pathways, and cellular uptake inducers for targeted antibody–drug and antibody–RNA conjugates. Computationally designed genetically encoded proteins can be used to target surface proteins, thereby triggering endocytosis and subsequent intracellular degradation, activating signalling or increasing cellular uptake in specific tissues.",

    "abstract": "Since 2020, there has been unprecedented global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in wild bird populations with spillover into a variety of mammalian species and sporadically humans1. In March 2024, clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) virus was first detected in dairy cattle in the USA, with subsequent detection in numerous states2, leading to more than a dozen confirmed human cases3,4. In this study, we used the ferret, a well-characterized animal model that permits concurrent investigation of viral pathogenicity and transmissibility5, in the evaluation of A/Texas/37/2024 (TX/37) A(H5N1) virus isolated from a dairy farm worker in Texas6. Here we show that the virus has a remarkable ability for robust systemic infection in ferrets, leading to high levels of virus shedding and spread to naive contacts. Ferrets inoculated with TX/37 rapidly exhibited a severe and fatal infection, characterized by viraemia and extrapulmonary spread. The virus efficiently transmitted in a direct contact setting and was capable of indirect transmission through fomites. Airborne transmission was corroborated by the detection of infectious virus shed into the air by infected animals, albeit at lower levels compared to those of the highly transmissible human seasonal and swine-origin H1 subtype strains. Our results show that despite maintaining an avian-like receptor-binding specificity, TX/37 exhibits heightened virulence, transmissibility and airborne shedding relative to other clade 2.3.4.4b virus isolated before the 2024 cattle outbreaks7, underscoring the need for continued public health vigilance. Analysis of a human isolate of the A/Texas/37/2024 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in the ferret model demonstrates its pathogenicity and transmission in both direct and indirect contact settings, including airborne transmission.",

Optical–ultraviolet observations5–7 of TDEs contradict simple models of TDE emission2,8, but the debate between alternative models (for example, shock power9,10 or reprocessed accretion power11–16) remains unsettled, as the dynamic range of the problem has so far prevented ab initio hydrodynamical simulations17. Consequently, past simulations have resorted to unrealistic parameter choices10,12,18–21, artificial mass injection schemes22,23 or very short run-times24. Here we present a three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of a TDE flare from disruption to peak emission, with typical astrophysical parameters. At early times, shocks near pericentre power the light curve and a previously unknown source of X-ray emission, but circularization and outflows are inefficient. Near peak light, stream–disk shocks efficiently circularize returning debris, power stronger outflows and reproduce observed peak optical–ultraviolet luminosities25,26. Peak emission in this simulation is shock-powered, but upper limits on accretion power become competitive near peak light as circularization runs away. This simulation shows how deterministic predictions of TDE light curves and spectra can be calculated using moving-mesh hydrodynamics algorithms. A three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of a tidal disruption event (TDE) flare from disruption to peak emission shows how deterministic predictions of TDE light curves and spectra can be calculated using moving-mesh hydrodynamics algorithms.",

However, human cumulative culture involves behaviours so complex that they lie beyond the capacity of any individual to independently discover during their lifetime1–3. To our knowledge, no study has so far demonstrated this phenomenon in an invertebrate. Here we show that bumblebees can learn from trained demonstrator bees to open a novel two-step puzzle box to obtain food rewards, even though they fail to do so independently. Experimenters were unable to train demonstrator bees to perform the unrewarded first step without providing a temporary reward linked to this action, which was removed during later stages of training. However, a third of naive observer bees learned to open the two-step box from these demonstrators, without ever being rewarded after the first step. This suggests that social learning might permit the acquisition of behaviours too complex to ‘re-innovate’ through individual learning. Furthermore, naive bees failed to open the box despite extended exposure for up to 24 days. This finding challenges a common opinion in the field: that the capacity to socially learn behaviours that cannot be innovated through individual trial and error is unique to humans. Bumblebees can learn how to open a two-step puzzle box by observing another trained bee, indicating that these insects can use social learning to acquire a behaviour too complex to otherwise be learnt through individual trial and error.",

    "abstract": "The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) represents the world’s largest ocean-current system and affects global ocean circulation, climate and Antarctic ice-sheet stability1–3. Today, ACC dynamics are controlled by atmospheric forcing, oceanic density gradients and eddy activity4. Whereas palaeoceanographic reconstructions exhibit regional heterogeneity in ACC position and strength over Pleistocene glacial–interglacial cycles5–8, the long-term evolution of the ACC is poorly known. Here we document changes in ACC strength from sediment cores in the Pacific Southern Ocean. We find no linear long-term trend in ACC flow since 5.3 million years ago (Ma), in contrast to global cooling9 and increasing global ice volume10. Instead, we observe a reversal on a million-year timescale, from increasing ACC strength during Pliocene global cooling to a subsequent decrease with further Early Pleistocene cooling. This shift in the ACC regime coincided with a Southern Ocean reconfiguration that altered the sensitivity of the ACC to atmospheric and oceanic forcings11–13. We find ACC strength changes to be closely linked to 400,000-year eccentricity cycles, probably originating from modulation of precessional changes in the South Pacific jet stream linked to tropical Pacific temperature variability14. A persistent link between weaker ACC flow, equatorward-shifted opal deposition and reduced atmospheric CO2 during glacial periods first emerged during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT). The strongest ACC flow occurred during warmer-than-present intervals of the Plio-Pleistocene, providing evidence of potentially increasing ACC flow with future climate warming. The strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, as traced in sediment cores from the Pacific Southern Ocean, shows no linear long-term trend over the past 5.3 Myr; instead, the strongest flow occurs consistently in warmer-than-present intervals.",

Combining these two effects could achieve the lightweight, compact localized thermal management that is promised by electrocaloric refrigeration5. Despite a handful of numerical models and schematic presentations6,7, current electrocaloric refrigerators still rely on external accessories to drive the working bodies8–10 and hence result in a low device-level cooling power density and coefficient of performance (COP). Here we report an electrocaloric thin-film device that uses the electro-thermomechanical synergy provided by polymeric ferroelectrics. Under one-time a.c. electric stimulation, the device is thermally and mechanically cycled by the working body itself, resulting in an external-driver-free, self-cycling, soft refrigerator. The prototype offers a directly measured cooling power density of 6.5 W g−1 and a peak COP exceeding 58 under a zero temperature span. Being merely a 30-µm-thick polymer film, the device achieved a COP close to 24 under a 4 K temperature span in an open ambient environment (32% thermodynamic efficiency). Compared with passive cooling, the thin-film refrigerator could immediately induce an additional 17.5 K temperature drop against an electronic chip. The soft, polymeric refrigerator can sense, actuate and pump heat to provide automatic localized thermal management. We report on a near-zero-power flexible heat pump that uses both electrocaloric and electrostrictive properties of a tailored polymer to create a chip-scale refrigerator device.",

    "abstract": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a functional material class able to harness, convert and store energy. However, after almost 20 years of research, there are no coherent prediction rules for their synthesis conditions. This is partly because of an incomplete picture of nucleation and growth at the early stages of formation. Here we use the optical technique interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT)1–3 for in operando studies of COF polymerization and framework formation. We observe liquid–liquid phase separation, pointing to the existence of structured solvents in the form of surfactant-free (micro)emulsions in conventional COF synthesis. Our findings show that the role of solvents extends beyond solubility to being kinetic modulators by compartmentation of reactants and catalyst. Taking advantage of these observations, we develop a synthesis protocol for COFs using room temperature instead of elevated temperatures. This work connects framework synthesis with liquid phase diagrams and thereby enables an active design of the reaction environment, emphasizing that visualization of chemical reactions by means of light-scattering-based techniques can be a powerful approach for advancing rational materials synthesis. The operando imaging of the early formation stages of covalent organic frameworks with the optical technique interferometric scattering microscopy leads to mechanistic insights, enabling the rational development of a synthesis protocol at room temperature instead of elevated temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Spin accumulation in semiconductor structures at room temperature and without magnetic fields is key to enable a broader range of optoelectronic functionality1. Current efforts are limited owing to inherent inefficiencies associated with spin injection across semiconductor interfaces2. Here we demonstrate spin injection across chiral halide perovskite/III–V interfaces achieving spin accumulation in a standard semiconductor III–V (AlxGa1−x)0.5In0.5P multiple quantum well light-emitting diode. The spin accumulation in the multiple quantum well is detected through emission of circularly polarized light with a degree of polarization of up to 15 ± 4%. The chiral perovskite/III–V interface was characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cross-sectional scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy imaging, showing a clean semiconductor/semiconductor interface at which the Fermi level can equilibrate. These findings demonstrate that chiral perovskite semiconductors can transform well-developed semiconductor platforms into ones that can also control spin. By using a chiral halide perovskite material, spin injection at room temperature into a conventional III–V semiconductor multiple quantum well light-emitting diode is demonstrated, resulting in a semiconductor platform that can also control spin.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses remodel the intracellular host membranes during replication, forming double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) to accommodate viral RNA synthesis and modifications1,2. SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) and nsp4 are the minimal viral components required to induce DMV formation and to form a double-membrane-spanning pore, essential for the transport of newly synthesized viral RNAs3–5. The mechanism of DMV pore complex formation remains unknown. Here we describe the molecular architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3–nsp4 pore complex, as resolved by cryogenic electron tomography and subtomogram averaging in isolated DMVs. The structures uncover an unexpected stoichiometry and topology of the nsp3–nsp4 pore complex comprising 12 copies each of nsp3 and nsp4, organized in 4 concentric stacking hexamer rings, mimicking a miniature nuclear pore complex. The transmembrane domains are interdigitated to create a high local curvature at the double-membrane junction, coupling double-membrane reorganization with pore formation. The ectodomains form extensive contacts in a pseudo-12-fold symmetry, belting the pore complex from the intermembrane space. A central positively charged ring of arginine residues coordinates the putative RNA translocation, essential for virus replication. Our work establishes a framework for understanding DMV pore formation and RNA translocation, providing a structural basis for the development of new antiviral strategies to combat coronavirus infection. A study details the molecular architecture of the double-membrane-spanning pore formed by the proteins nsp3 and nsp4 in double-membrane vesicles of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Systemic immune responses caused by chronic hypercholesterolaemia contribute to atherosclerosis initiation, progression and complications1. However, individuals often change their dietary habits over time2, and the effects of an alternating high-fat diet (HFD) on atherosclerosis remain unclear. Here, to address this relevant issue, we developed a protocol using atherosclerosis-prone mice to compare an alternating versus continuous HFD while maintaining similar overall exposure periods. We found that an alternating HFD accelerated atherosclerosis in Ldlr−/− and Apoe−/− mice compared with a continuous HFD. This pro-atherogenic effect of the alternating HFD was also observed in Apoe−/−Rag2−/− mice lacking T, B and natural killer T cells, ruling out the role of the adaptive immune system in the observed phenotype. Discontinuing the HFD in the alternating HFD group downregulated RUNX13, promoting inflammatory signalling in bone marrow myeloid progenitors. After re-exposure to an HFD, these cells produced IL-1β, leading to emergency myelopoiesis and increased neutrophil levels in blood. Neutrophils infiltrated plaques and released neutrophil extracellular traps, exacerbating atherosclerosis. Specific depletion of neutrophils or inhibition of IL-1β pathways abolished emergency myelopoiesis and reversed the pro-atherogenic effects of the alternating HFD. This study highlights the role of IL-1β-dependent neutrophil progenitor reprogramming in accelerated atherosclerosis induced by alternating HFD. Re-exposure to a high-fat diet in mice led to emergency myelopoiesis and increased neutrophils in the blood, which infiltrated plaques and released neutrophil extracellular traps, exacerbating atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Although fat is a crucial source of energy in diets, excessive intake leads to obesity. Fat absorption in the gut is prevailingly thought to occur organ-autonomously by diffusion1–3. Whether the process is controlled by the brain-to-gut axis, however, remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (DMV) plays a key part in this process. Inactivation of DMV neurons reduces intestinal fat absorption and consequently causes weight loss, whereas activation of the DMV increases fat absorption and weight gain. Notably, the inactivation of a subpopulation of DMV neurons that project to the jejunum shortens the length of microvilli, thereby reducing fat absorption. Moreover, we identify a natural compound, puerarin, that mimics the suppression of the DMV–vagus pathway, which in turn leads to reduced fat absorption. Photoaffinity chemical methods and cryogenic electron microscopy of the structure of a GABAA receptor–puerarin complex reveal that puerarin binds to an allosteric modulatory site. Notably, conditional Gabra1 knockout in the DMV largely abolishes puerarin-induced intestinal fat loss. In summary, we discover that suppression of the DMV–vagus–jejunum axis controls intestinal fat absorption by shortening the length of microvilli and illustrate the therapeutic potential of puerarin binding to GABRA1 in fat loss. Neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus are involved in the absorption of fat in the intestine, and the natural compound puerarin shows utility in modulating this brain–gut axis to reduce fat absorption.",

However, ascertaining the specific responsibility within the complex interactions of economies and consumption groups remains a challenging endeavour3–5. Here, using an expenditure database that includes up to 201 consumption groups across 168 countries, we investigate the distribution of 6 environmental footprint indicators and assess the impact of specific consumption expenditures on planetary boundary transgressions. We show that 31–67% and 51–91% of the planetary boundary breaching responsibility could be attributed to the global top 10% and top 20% of consumers, respectively, from both developed and developing countries. By following an effective mitigation pathway, the global top 20% of consumers could adopt the consumption levels and patterns that have the lowest environmental impacts within their quintile, yielding a reduction of 25–53% in environmental pressure. In this scenario, actions focused solely on the food and services sectors would reduce environmental pressure enough to bring land-system change and biosphere integrity back within their respective planetary boundaries. Our study highlights the critical need to focus on high-expenditure consumers for effectively addressing planetary boundary transgressions. An analysis of the environmental footprints of consumption finds that planetary boundary transgressions can be mitigated by following an effective mitigation pathway focused on the food and services sectors and high-expenditure consumers.",

    "abstract": "Animals crave sugars because of their energy potential and the pleasurable sensation of tasting sweetness. Yet all sugars are not metabolically equivalent, requiring mechanisms to detect and differentiate between chemically similar sweet substances. Insects use a family of ionotropic gustatory receptors to discriminate sugars1, each of which is selectively activated by specific sweet molecules2–6. Here, to gain insight into the molecular basis of sugar selectivity, we determined structures of Gr9, a gustatory receptor from the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmGr9), in the absence and presence of its sole activating ligand, d-fructose. These structures, along with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, illustrate how d-fructose is enveloped by a ligand-binding pocket that precisely matches the overall shape and pattern of chemical groups in d-fructose. However, our computational docking and experimental binding assays revealed that other sugars also bind BmGr9, yet they are unable to activate the receptor. We determined the structure of BmGr9 in complex with one such non-activating sugar, l-sorbose. Although both sugars bind a similar position, only d-fructose is capable of engaging a bridge of two conserved aromatic residues that connects the pocket to the pore helix, inducing a conformational change that allows the ion-conducting pore to open. Thus, chemical specificity does not depend solely on the selectivity of the ligand-binding pocket, but it is an emergent property arising from a combination of receptor–ligand interactions and allosteric coupling. Our results support a model whereby coarse receptor tuning is derived from the size and chemical characteristics of the pocket, whereas fine-tuning of receptor activation is achieved through the selective engagement of an allosteric pathway that regulates ion conduction. A study reports structures of an insect taste receptor in the absence and presence of different sugars, providing details on the molecular basis of sugar detection and selectivity in insects.",

    "abstract": "A wooden house frame consists of many different lumber pieces, but because of the regularity of these building blocks, the structure can be designed using straightforward geometrical principles. The design of multicomponent protein assemblies, in comparison, has been much more complex, largely owing to the irregular shapes of protein structures1. Here we describe extendable linear, curved and angled protein building blocks, as well as inter-block interactions, that conform to specified geometric standards; assemblies designed using these blocks inherit their extendability and regular interaction surfaces, enabling them to be expanded or contracted by varying the number of modules, and reinforced with secondary struts. Using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, we validate nanomaterial designs ranging from simple polygonal and circular oligomers that can be concentrically nested, up to large polyhedral nanocages and unbounded straight ‘train track’ assemblies with reconfigurable sizes and geometries that can be readily blueprinted. Because of the complexity of protein structures and sequence–structure relationships, it has not previously been possible to build up large protein assemblies by deliberate placement of protein backbones onto a blank three-dimensional canvas; the simplicity and geometric regularity of our design platform now enables construction of protein nanomaterials according to ‘back of an envelope’ architectural blueprints. A study describes an approach using designed building blocks that are far more regular in geometry than natural proteins to construct modular multicomponent protein assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Airway hillocks are stratified epithelial structures of unknown function1. Hillocks persist for months and have a unique population of basal stem cells that express genes associated with barrier function and cell adhesion. Hillock basal stem cells continually replenish overlying squamous barrier cells. They exhibit dramatically higher turnover than the abundant, largely quiescent classic pseudostratified airway epithelium. Hillocks resist a remarkably broad spectrum of injuries, including toxins, infection, acid and physical injury because hillock squamous cells shield underlying hillock basal stem cells from injury. Hillock basal stem cells are capable of massive clonal expansion that is sufficient to resurface denuded airway, and eventually regenerate normal airway epithelium with each of its six component cell types. Hillock basal stem cells preferentially stratify and keratinize in the setting of retinoic acid signalling inhibition, a known cause of squamous metaplasia2,3. Here we show that mouse hillock expansion is the cause of vitamin A deficiency-induced squamous metaplasia. Finally, we identify human hillocks whose basal stem cells generate functional squamous barrier structures in culture. The existence of hillocks reframes our understanding of airway epithelial regeneration. Furthermore, we show that hillocks are one origin of ‘squamous metaplasia’, which is long thought to be a precursor of lung cancer. In the lungs, recently identified epithelial structures known as hillocks can act as injury-resistant reservoirs of stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Enzymes play an increasingly important role in improving the benignity and efficiency of chemical production, yet the diversity of their applications lags heavily behind chemical catalysts as a result of the relatively narrow range of reaction mechanisms of enzymes. The creation of enzymes containing non-biological functionalities facilitates reaction mechanisms outside nature’s canon and paves the way towards fully programmable biocatalysis1–3. Here we present a completely genetically encoded boronic-acid-containing designer enzyme with organocatalytic reactivity not achievable with natural or engineered biocatalysts4,5. This boron enzyme catalyses the kinetic resolution of hydroxyketones by oxime formation, in which crucial interactions with the protein scaffold assist in the catalysis. A directed evolution campaign led to a variant with natural-enzyme-like enantioselectivities for several different substrates. The unique activation mode of the boron enzyme was confirmed using X-ray crystallography, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and 11B NMR spectroscopy. Our study demonstrates that genetic-code expansion can be used to create evolvable enantioselective enzymes that rely on xenobiotic catalytic moieties such as boronic acids and access reaction mechanisms not reachable through catalytic promiscuity of natural or engineered enzymes. A completely genetically encoded boronic-acid-containing designer enzyme was created and characterized using X-ray crystallography, high-resolution mass spectrometry and 11B NMR spectroscopy, allowing chemistry that is unknown in nature and currently not possible with small-molecule catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Tropical forest degradation from selective logging, fire and edge effects is a major driver of carbon and biodiversity loss1–3, with annual rates comparable to those of deforestation4. However, its actual extent and long-term impacts remain uncertain at global tropical scale5. Here we quantify the magnitude and persistence of multiple types of degradation on forest structure by combining satellite remote sensing data on pantropical moist forest cover changes4 with estimates of canopy height and biomass from spaceborne6 light detection and ranging (LiDAR). We estimate that forest height decreases owing to selective logging and fire by 15% and 50%, respectively, with low rates of recovery even after 20 years. Agriculture and road expansion trigger a 20% to 30% reduction in canopy height and biomass at the forest edge, with persistent effects being measurable up to 1.5 km inside the forest. Edge effects encroach on 18% (approximately 206 Mha) of the remaining tropical moist forests, an area more than 200% larger than previously estimated7. Finally, degraded forests with more than 50% canopy loss are significantly more vulnerable to subsequent deforestation. Collectively, our findings call for greater efforts to prevent degradation and protect already degraded forests to meet the conservation pledges made at recent United Nations Climate Change and Biodiversity conferences. A global survey on the magnitude and persistence of moist forest cover change and canopy height following degradation using satellite remote sensing data finds that the effects are substantial and persist for decades.",

    "abstract": "In vitro models of autoimmunity are constrained by an inability to culture affected epithelium alongside the complex tissue-resident immune microenvironment. Coeliac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disease in which dietary gluten-derived peptides bind to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II human leukocyte antigen molecules (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 to initiate immune-mediated duodenal mucosal injury1–4. Here, we generated air–liquid interface (ALI) duodenal organoids from intact fragments of endoscopic biopsies that preserve epithelium alongside native mesenchyme and tissue-resident immune cells as a unit without requiring reconstitution. The immune diversity of ALI organoids spanned T cells, B and plasma cells, natural killer (NK) cells and myeloid cells, with extensive T-cell and B-cell receptor repertoires. HLA-DQ2.5-restricted gluten peptides selectively instigated epithelial destruction in HLA-DQ2.5-expressing organoids derived from CeD patients, and this was antagonized by blocking MHC-II or NKG2C/D. Gluten epitopes stimulated a CeD organoid immune network response in lymphoid and myeloid subsets alongside anti-transglutaminase 2 (TG2) autoantibody production. Functional studies in CeD organoids revealed that interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a gluten-inducible pathogenic modulator that regulates CD8+ T-cell NKG2C/D expression and is necessary and sufficient for epithelial destruction. Furthermore, endogenous IL-7 was markedly upregulated in patient biopsies from active CeD compared with remission disease from gluten-free diets, predominantly in lamina propria mesenchyme. By preserving the epithelium alongside diverse immune populations, this human in vitro CeD model recapitulates gluten-dependent pathology, enables mechanistic investigation and establishes a proof of principle for the organoid modelling of autoimmunity. A human in vitro model of coeliac disease comprising duodenal organoids that maintain both epithelium and an immune microenvironment finds a previously unsuspected role for IL-7 in gluten-induced epithelial destruction.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine transporter has a crucial role in regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission by uptake of dopamine into neurons and contributes to the abuse potential of psychomotor stimulants1–3. Despite decades of study, the structure, substrate binding, conformational transitions and drug-binding poses of human dopamine transporter remain unknown. Here we report structures of the human dopamine transporter in its apo state, and in complex with the substrate dopamine, the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drug methylphenidate, and the dopamine-uptake inhibitors GBR12909 and benztropine. The dopamine-bound structure in the occluded state precisely illustrates the binding position of dopamine and associated ions. The structures bound to drugs are captured in outward-facing or inward-facing states, illuminating distinct binding modes and conformational transitions during substrate transport. Unlike the outward-facing state, which is stabilized by cocaine, GBR12909 and benztropine stabilize the dopamine transporter in the inward-facing state, revealing previously unseen drug-binding poses and providing insights into how they counteract the effects of cocaine. This study establishes a framework for understanding the functioning of the human dopamine transporter and developing therapeutic interventions for dopamine transporter-related disorders and cocaine addiction. Structural analyses of the human dopamine transporter in apo and substrate-bound states and in complex with drugs and inhibitors reveal key binding residues and conformational transitions that occur during substrate transport.",

    "abstract": "With large wildfires becoming more frequent1,2, we must rapidly learn how megafires impact biodiversity to prioritize mitigation and improve policy. A key challenge is to discover how interactions among fire-regime components, drought and land tenure shape wildfire impacts. The globally unprecedented3,4 2019–2020 Australian megafires burnt more than 10 million hectares5, prompting major investment in biodiversity monitoring. Collated data include responses of more than 2,000 taxa, providing an unparalleled opportunity to quantify how megafires affect biodiversity. We reveal that the largest effects on plants and animals were in areas with frequent or recent past fires and within extensively burnt areas. Areas burnt at high severity, outside protected areas or under extreme drought also had larger effects. The effects included declines and increases after fire, with the largest responses in rainforests and by mammals. Our results implicate species interactions, dispersal and extent of in situ survival as mechanisms underlying fire responses. Building wildfire resilience into these ecosystems depends on reducing fire recurrence, including with rapid wildfire suppression in areas frequently burnt. Defending wet ecosystems, expanding protected areas and considering localized drought could also contribute. While these countermeasures can help mitigate the impacts of more frequent megafires, reversing anthropogenic climate change remains the urgent broad-scale solution. Data collected from more than 2,000 taxa provide an unparalleled opportunity to quantify how extreme wildfires affect biodiversity, revealing that the largest effects on plants and animals were in areas with frequent or recent past fires and within extensively burnt areas.",

    "abstract": "Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are found in many everyday consumer products, often because of their high thermal and chemical stabilities, as well as their hydrophobic and oleophobic properties1. However, the inert carbon–fluorine (C–F) bonds that give PFASs their properties also provide resistance to decomposition through defluorination, leading to long-term persistence in the environment, as well as in the human body, raising substantial safety and health concerns1–5. Despite recent advances in non-incineration approaches for the destruction of functionalized PFASs, processes for the recycling of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as well as polymeric PFASs such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are limited to methods that use either elevated temperatures or strong reducing reagents. Here we report the defluorination of PFASs with a highly twisted carbazole-cored super-photoreductant KQGZ. A series of PFASs could be defluorinated photocatalytically at 40–60 °C. PTFE gave amorphous carbon and fluoride salts as the major products. Oligomeric PFASs such as PFCs, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), polyfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and derivatives give carbonate, formate, oxalate and trifluoroacetate as the defluorinated products. This allows for the recycling of fluorine in PFASs as inorganic fluoride salt. The mechanistic investigation reveals the difference in reaction behaviour and product components for PTFE and oligomeric PFASs. This work opens a window for the low-temperature photoreductive defluorination of the ‘forever chemicals’ PFASs, especially for PTFE, as well as the discovery of new super-photoreductants. Photocatalysis at 40–60 °C is shown to be able to defluorinate perfluoroalkyl substances, known as ‘forever chemicals’, allowing the recycling of fluorine in polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances as inorganic fluoride salt.",

    "abstract": "The tumour microenvironment is programmed by cancer cells and substantially influences anti-tumour immune responses1,2. Within the tumour microenvironment, CD8+ T cells undergo full effector differentiation and acquire cytotoxic anti-tumour functions in specialized niches3–7. Although interactions with type 1 conventional dendritic cells have been implicated in this process3–5,8–10, the underlying cellular players and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that inflammatory monocytes can adopt a pivotal role in intratumoral T cell stimulation. These cells express Cxcl9, Cxcl10 and Il15, but in contrast to type 1 conventional dendritic cells, which cross-present antigens, inflammatory monocytes obtain and present peptide–major histocompatibility complex class I complexes from tumour cells through ‘cross-dressing’. Hyperactivation of MAPK signalling in cancer cells hampers this process by coordinately blunting the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) cytokines and inducing the secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which impairs the inflammatory monocyte state and intratumoral T cell stimulation. Enhancing IFN-I cytokine production and blocking PGE2 secretion restores this process and re-sensitizes tumours to T cell-mediated immunity. Together, our work uncovers a central role of inflammatory monocytes in intratumoral T cell stimulation, elucidates how oncogenic signalling disrupts T cell responses through counter-regulation of PGE2 and IFN-I, and proposes rational combination therapies to enhance immunotherapies. Inflammatory monocytes are identified as important players in T cell restimulation in the tumour microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Organisms determine the transcription rates of thousands of genes through a few modes of regulation that recur across the genome1. In bacteria, the relationship between the regulatory architecture of a gene and its expression is well understood for individual model gene circuits2,3. However, a broader perspective of these dynamics at the genome scale is lacking, in part because bacterial transcriptomics has hitherto captured only a static snapshot of expression averaged across millions of cells4. As a result, the full diversity of gene expression dynamics and their relation to regulatory architecture remains unknown. Here we present a novel genome-wide classification of regulatory modes based on the transcriptional response of each gene to its own replication, which we term the transcription–replication interaction profile (TRIP). Analysing single-bacterium RNA-sequencing data, we found that the response to the universal perturbation of chromosomal replication integrates biological regulatory factors with biophysical molecular events on the chromosome to reveal the local regulatory context of a gene. Whereas the TRIPs of many genes conform to a gene dosage-dependent pattern, others diverge in distinct ways, and this is shaped by factors such as intra-operon position and repression state. By revealing the underlying mechanistic drivers of gene expression heterogeneity, this work provides a quantitative, biophysical framework for modelling replication-dependent expression dynamics. Single-cell expression data from bacteria are used to classify gene regulatory architectures in relation to gene expression dynamics and the cell cycle, revealing distinct categories of gene regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Humans are capable of generating extraordinarily diverse articulatory movement combinations to produce meaningful speech. This ability to orchestrate specific phonetic sequences, and their syllabification and inflection over subsecond timescales allows us to produce thousands of word sounds and is a core component of language1,2. The fundamental cellular units and constructs by which we plan and produce words during speech, however, remain largely unknown. Here, using acute ultrahigh-density Neuropixels recordings capable of sampling across the cortical column in humans, we discover neurons in the language-dominant prefrontal cortex that encoded detailed information about the phonetic arrangement and composition of planned words during the production of natural speech. These neurons represented the specific order and structure of articulatory events before utterance and reflected the segmentation of phonetic sequences into distinct syllables. They also accurately predicted the phonetic, syllabic and morphological components of upcoming words and showed a temporally ordered dynamic. Collectively, we show how these mixtures of cells are broadly organized along the cortical column and how their activity patterns transition from articulation planning to production. We also demonstrate how these cells reliably track the detailed composition of consonant and vowel sounds during perception and how they distinguish processes specifically related to speaking from those related to listening. Together, these findings reveal a remarkably structured organization and encoding cascade of phonetic representations by prefrontal neurons in humans and demonstrate a cellular process that can support the production of speech. Neuropixels recordings from the language-dominant prefrontal cortex reveal a structured organization of planned words, an encoding cascade of phonetic representations by prefrontal neurons in humans and a cellular process that could support the production of speech.",

    "abstract": "Macrophage activation is controlled by a balance between activating and inhibitory receptors1–7, which protect normal tissues from excessive damage during infection8,9 but promote tumour growth and metastasis in cancer7,10. Here we report that the Kupffer cell lineage-determining factor ID3 controls this balance and selectively endows Kupffer cells with the ability to phagocytose live tumour cells and orchestrate the recruitment, proliferation and activation of natural killer and CD8 T lymphoid effector cells in the liver to restrict the growth of a variety of tumours. ID3 shifts the macrophage inhibitory/activating receptor balance to promote the phagocytic and lymphoid response, at least in part by buffering the binding of the transcription factors ELK1 and E2A at the SIRPA locus. Furthermore, loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that ID3 is sufficient to confer this potent anti-tumour activity to mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages and human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived macrophages. Expression of ID3 is therefore necessary and sufficient to endow macrophages with the ability to form an efficient anti-tumour niche, which could be harnessed for cell therapy in cancer. The Kupffer cell lineage-determining factor ID3 selectively endows macrophages with the ability to phagocytose live tumour cells and orchestrate the recruitment, proliferation and activation of natural killer and CD8+ T lymphoid effector cells to restrict the growth of a variety of tumours.",

    "abstract": "Quantum systems have entered a competitive regime in which classical computers must make approximations to represent highly entangled quantum states1,2. However, in this beyond-classically-exact regime, fidelity comparisons between quantum and classical systems have so far been limited to digital quantum devices2–5, and it remains unsolved how to estimate the actual entanglement content of experiments6. Here, we perform fidelity benchmarking and mixed-state entanglement estimation with a 60-atom analogue Rydberg quantum simulator, reaching a high-entanglement entropy regime in which exact classical simulation becomes impractical. Our benchmarking protocol involves extrapolation from comparisons against an approximate classical algorithm, introduced here, with varying entanglement limits. We then develop and demonstrate an estimator of the experimental mixed-state entanglement6, finding our experiment is competitive with state-of-the-art digital quantum devices performing random circuit evolution2–5. Finally, we compare the experimental fidelity against that achieved by various approximate classical algorithms, and find that only the algorithm we introduce is able to keep pace with the experiment on the classical hardware we use. Our results enable a new model for evaluating the ability of both analogue and digital quantum devices to generate entanglement in the beyond-classically-exact regime, and highlight the evolving divide between quantum and classical systems. Fidelity benchmarking of an analogue quantum simulator reaches a high-entanglement regime where exact classical simulation of quantum systems becomes impractical, and enables a new method for evaluating the mixed-state entanglement of quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "The bone marrow adjusts blood cell production to meet physiological demands in response to insults. The spatial organization of normal and stress responses are unknown owing to the lack of methods to visualize most steps of blood production. Here we develop strategies to image multipotent haematopoiesis, erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis in mice. We combine these with imaging of myelopoiesis1 to define the anatomy of normal and stress haematopoiesis. In the steady state, across the skeleton, single stem cells and multipotent progenitors distribute through the marrow enriched near megakaryocytes. Lineage-committed progenitors are recruited to blood vessels, where they contribute to lineage-specific microanatomical structures composed of progenitors and immature cells, which function as the production sites for each major blood lineage. This overall anatomy is resilient to insults, as it was maintained after haemorrhage, systemic bacterial infection and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment, and during ageing. Production sites enable haematopoietic plasticity as they differentially and selectively modulate their numbers and output in response to insults. We found that stress responses are variable across the skeleton: the tibia and the sternum respond in opposite ways to G-CSF, and the skull does not increase erythropoiesis after haemorrhage. Our studies enable in situ analyses of haematopoiesis, define the anatomy of normal and stress responses, identify discrete microanatomical production sites that confer plasticity to haematopoiesis, and uncover unprecedented heterogeneity of stress responses across the skeleton. This study develops a method for spatially resolving multipotent haematopoiesis, erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis in mice and uncovers heterogeneous haematopoietic stress responses in different bones.",

    "abstract": "Fractals are patterns that are self-similar across multiple length-scales1. Macroscopic fractals are common in nature2–4; however, so far, molecular assembly into fractals is restricted to synthetic systems5–12. Here we report the discovery of a natural protein, citrate synthase from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, which self-assembles into Sierpiński triangles. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we reveal how the fractal assembles from a hexameric building block. Although different stimuli modulate the formation of fractal complexes and these complexes can regulate the enzymatic activity of citrate synthase in vitro, the fractal may not serve a physiological function in vivo. We use ancestral sequence reconstruction to retrace how the citrate synthase fractal evolved from non-fractal precursors, and the results suggest it may have emerged as a harmless evolutionary accident. Our findings expand the space of possible protein complexes and demonstrate that intricate and regulatable assemblies can evolve in a single substitution. Citrate synthase from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is shown to self-assemble into Sierpiński triangles, a finding that opens up the possibility that other naturally occurring molecular-scale fractals exist.",

    "abstract": "From ad 567–568, at the onset of the Avar period, populations from the Eurasian Steppe settled in the Carpathian Basin for approximately 250 years1. Extensive sampling for archaeogenomics (424 individuals) and isotopes, combined with archaeological, anthropological and historical contextualization of four Avar-period cemeteries, allowed for a detailed description of the genomic structure of these communities and their kinship and social practices. We present a set of large pedigrees, reconstructed using ancient DNA, spanning nine generations and comprising around 300 individuals. We uncover a strict patrilineal kinship system, in which patrilocality and female exogamy were the norm and multiple reproductive partnering and levirate unions were common. The absence of consanguinity indicates that this society maintained a detailed memory of ancestry over generations. These kinship practices correspond with previous evidence from historical sources and anthropological research on Eurasian Steppe societies2. Network analyses of identity-by-descent DNA connections suggest that social cohesion between communities was maintained via female exogamy. Finally, despite the absence of major ancestry shifts, the level of resolution of our analyses allowed us to detect genetic discontinuity caused by the replacement of a community at one of the sites. This was paralleled with changes in the archaeological record and was probably a result of local political realignment. Analysis of ancient DNA from 424 individuals in the Avar period, from the sixth to the ninth century AD, reveals population movement from the steppe and the prolonged existence of a steppe nomadic descent system centred around patrilineality and female exogamy in central Europe.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N2) fixation in oligotrophic surface waters is the main source of new nitrogen to the ocean1 and has a key role in fuelling the biological carbon pump2. Oceanic N2 fixation has been attributed almost exclusively to cyanobacteria, even though genes encoding nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes N2 into ammonia, are widespread among marine bacteria and archaea3–5. Little is known about these non-cyanobacterial N2 fixers, and direct proof that they can fix nitrogen in the ocean has so far been lacking. Here we report the discovery of a non-cyanobacterial N2-fixing symbiont, ‘Candidatus Tectiglobus diatomicola’, which provides its diatom host with fixed nitrogen in return for photosynthetic carbon. The N2-fixing symbiont belongs to the order Rhizobiales and its association with a unicellular diatom expands the known hosts for this order beyond the well-known N2-fixing rhizobia–legume symbioses on land6. Our results show that the rhizobia–diatom symbioses can contribute as much fixed nitrogen as can cyanobacterial N2 fixers in the tropical North Atlantic, and that they might be responsible for N2 fixation in the vast regions of the ocean in which cyanobacteria are too rare to account for the measured rates. A symbiosis between a diatom and a newly discovered species of alphaproteobacteria, ‘Candidatus Tectiglobus diatomicola’, can fix nitrogen in the ocean, providing evidence that nitrogen fixers other than cyanobacteria have a key role in the marine environment.",

    "abstract": "Accessing the natural genetic diversity of species unveils hidden genetic traits, clarifies gene functions and allows the generalizability of laboratory findings to be assessed. One notable discovery made in natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is that aneuploidy—an imbalance in chromosome copy numbers—is frequent1,2 (around 20%), which seems to contradict the substantial fitness costs and transient nature of aneuploidy when it is engineered in the laboratory3–5. Here we generate a proteomic resource and merge it with genomic1 and transcriptomic6 data for 796 euploid and aneuploid natural isolates. We find that natural and lab-generated aneuploids differ specifically at the proteome. In lab-generated aneuploids, some proteins—especially subunits of protein complexes—show reduced expression, but the overall protein levels correspond to the aneuploid gene dosage. By contrast, in natural isolates, more than 70% of proteins encoded on aneuploid chromosomes are dosage compensated, and average protein levels are shifted towards the euploid state chromosome-wide. At the molecular level, we detect an induction of structural components of the proteasome, increased levels of ubiquitination, and reveal an interdependency of protein turnover rates and attenuation. Our study thus highlights the role of protein turnover in mediating aneuploidy tolerance, and shows the utility of exploiting the natural diversity of species to attain generalizable molecular insights into complex biological processes. Proteomic data from natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae provide insight into how these cells tolerate aneuploidy (an imbalance in the number of chromosomes), and reveal differences between lab-engineered aneuploids and diverse natural yeasts.",

There is limited understanding of how and where conservation interventions are applied globally, or how well they work2,3. Here, using information from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List and other global databases, we find that for species at risk from three of the biggest drivers of biodiversity loss—habitat loss, overexploitation for international trade and invasive species4—many appear to lack the appropriate types of conservation interventions. Indeed, although there has been substantial recent expansion of the protected area network, we still find that 91% of threatened species have insufficient representation of their habitats within protected areas. Conservation interventions are not implemented uniformly across different taxa and regions and, even when present, have infrequently led to substantial improvements in the status of species. For 58% of the world’s threatened terrestrial species, we find conservation interventions to be notably insufficient or absent. We cannot determine whether such species are truly neglected, or whether efforts to recover them are not included in major conservation databases. If they are indeed neglected, the outlook for many of the world’s threatened species is grim without more and better targeted action. A global assessment of conservation interventions for threatened species across a range of data sources finds that interventions for most species remain insufficient or absent.",

    "abstract": "Insertion sequence (IS) elements are the simplest autonomous transposable elements found in prokaryotic genomes1. We recently discovered that IS110 family elements encode a recombinase and a non-coding bridge RNA (bRNA) that confers modular specificity for target DNA and donor DNA through two programmable loops2. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the IS110 recombinase in complex with its bRNA, target DNA and donor DNA in three different stages of the recombination reaction cycle. The IS110 synaptic complex comprises two recombinase dimers, one of which houses the target-binding loop of the bRNA and binds to target DNA, whereas the other coordinates the bRNA donor-binding loop and donor DNA. We uncovered the formation of a composite RuvC–Tnp active site that spans the two dimers, positioning the catalytic serine residues adjacent to the recombination sites in both target and donor DNA. A comparison of the three structures revealed that (1) the top strands of target and donor DNA are cleaved at the composite active sites to form covalent 5′-phosphoserine intermediates, (2) the cleaved DNA strands are exchanged and religated to create a Holliday junction intermediate, and (3) this intermediate is subsequently resolved by cleavage of the bottom strands. Overall, this study reveals the mechanism by which a bispecific RNA confers target and donor DNA specificity to IS110 recombinases for programmable DNA recombination. Using cryo-electron microscopy, the structural mechanism by which non-coding bridge RNA confers target and donor DNA specificity to IS110 recombinases for programmable DNA recombination is explored.",

    "abstract": "Exaggerated airway constriction triggered by repeated exposure to allergen, also called hyperreactivity, is a hallmark of asthma. Whereas vagal sensory neurons are known to function in allergen-induced hyperreactivity1–3, the identity of downstream nodes remains poorly understood. Here we mapped a full allergen circuit from the lung to the brainstem and back to the lung. Repeated exposure of mice to inhaled allergen activated the nuclei of solitary tract (nTS) neurons in a mast cell-, interleukin-4 (IL-4)- and vagal nerve-dependent manner. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing, followed by RNAscope assay at baseline and allergen challenges, showed that a Dbh+ nTS population is preferentially activated. Ablation or chemogenetic inactivation of Dbh+ nTS neurons blunted hyperreactivity whereas chemogenetic activation promoted it. Viral tracing indicated that Dbh+ nTS neurons project to the nucleus ambiguus (NA) and that NA neurons are necessary and sufficient to relay allergen signals to postganglionic neurons that directly drive airway constriction. Delivery of noradrenaline antagonists to the NA blunted hyperreactivity, suggesting noradrenaline as the transmitter between Dbh+ nTS and NA. Together, these findings provide molecular, anatomical and functional definitions of key nodes of a canonical allergen response circuit. This knowledge informs how neural modulation could be used to control allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity. Mapping a full allergen circuit from the lung to the brainstem and back, repeated exposure of mice to inhaled allergen activated the nuclei of solitary tract neurons in a mast cell-, interleukin-4- and vagal nerve-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of viruses generates proteins that are essential for infectivity and replication but with unknown functions, due to extreme sequence divergence1. Here, using a database of 67,715 newly predicted protein structures from 4,463 eukaryotic viral species, we found that 62% of viral proteins are structurally distinct and lack homologues in the AlphaFold database2,3. Among the remaining 38% of viral proteins, many have non-viral structural analogues that revealed surprising similarities between human pathogens and their eukaryotic hosts. Structural comparisons suggested putative functions for up to 25% of unannotated viral proteins, including those with roles in the evasion of innate immunity. In particular, RNA ligase T-like phosphodiesterases were found to resemble phage-encoded proteins that hydrolyse the host immune-activating cyclic dinucleotides 3′,3′- and 2′,3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Experimental analysis showed that RNA ligase T homologues encoded by avian poxviruses similarly hydrolyse cGAMP, showing that RNA ligase T-mediated targeting of cGAMP is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of immune evasion that is present in both bacteriophage and eukaryotic viruses. Together, the viral protein structural database and analyses presented here afford new opportunities to identify mechanisms of virus–host interactions that are common across the virome. Structural comparison of predicted viral protein structures with known protein structures suggests taxonomic relationships and functions for up to 25% of unannotated viral proteins, including many with putative functions in host immune evasion.",

Until now, metamaterial design has primarily relied on geometry, and materials nonlinearities such as viscoelasticity, fracture and plasticity have been largely left out of the design rationale. In fact, plastic deformations have been traditionally seen as a failure mode and thereby carefully avoided1,3,17,18. Here we embrace plasticity instead and discover a delicate balance between plasticity and buckling instability, which we term ‘yield buckling’. We exploit yield buckling to design metamaterials that buckle sequentially in an arbitrary large sequence of steps whilst keeping a load-bearing capacity. We make use of sequential yield buckling to create metamaterials that combine stiffness and dissipation—two properties that are usually incompatible—and that can be used several times. Hence, our metamaterials exhibit superior shock-absorption performance. Our findings add plasticity to the metamaterial toolbox and make mechanical metamaterials a burgeoning technology with serious potential for mass production. By not treating plasticity as a mode of failure and instead using it in balance with buckling instability, mechanical metamaterials can be designed that buckle sequentially and show superior shock-absorption performance.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is integral to cardiovascular health1,2. Yet, the circuits that connect cardiovascular pathology and sleep are incompletely understood. It remains unclear whether cardiac injury influences sleep and whether sleep-mediated neural outputs contribute to heart healing and inflammation. Here we report that in humans and mice, monocytes are actively recruited to the brain after myocardial infarction (MI) to augment sleep, which suppresses sympathetic outflow to the heart, limiting inflammation and promoting healing. After MI, microglia rapidly recruit circulating monocytes to the brain’s thalamic lateral posterior nucleus (LPN) via the choroid plexus, where they are reprogrammed to generate tumour necrosis factor (TNF). In the thalamic LPN, monocytic TNF engages Tnfrsf1a-expressing glutamatergic neurons to increase slow wave sleep pressure and abundance. Disrupting sleep after MI worsens cardiac function, decreases heart rate variability and causes spontaneous ventricular tachycardia. After MI, disrupting or curtailing sleep by manipulating glutamatergic TNF signalling in the thalamic LPN increases cardiac sympathetic input which signals through the β2-adrenergic receptor of macrophages to promote a chemotactic signature that increases monocyte influx. Poor sleep in the weeks following acute coronary syndrome increases susceptibility to secondary cardiovascular events and reduces the heart’s functional recovery. In parallel, insufficient sleep in humans reprogrammes β2-adrenergic receptor-expressing monocytes towards a chemotactic phenotype, enhancing their migratory capacity. Collectively, our data uncover cardiogenic regulation of sleep after heart injury, which restricts cardiac sympathetic input, limiting inflammation and damage. Studies in humans and mice show that myocardial infarction recruits monocytes to the brain’s thalamus, promoting sleep, which in turn restricts cardiac inflammation and sympathetic signalling and assists healing.",

    "abstract": "The digitization of health records and growing availability of tumour DNA sequencing provide an opportunity to study the determinants of cancer outcomes with unprecedented richness. Patient data are often stored in unstructured text and siloed datasets. Here we combine natural language processing annotations1,2 with structured medication, patient-reported demographic, tumour registry and tumour genomic data from 24,950 patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to generate a clinicogenomic, harmonized oncologic real-world dataset (MSK-CHORD). MSK-CHORD includes data for non-small-cell lung (n = 7,809), breast (n = 5,368), colorectal (n = 5,543), prostate (n = 3,211) and pancreatic (n = 3,109) cancers and enables discovery of clinicogenomic relationships not apparent in smaller datasets. Leveraging MSK-CHORD to train machine learning models to predict overall survival, we find that models including features derived from natural language processing, such as sites of disease, outperform those based on genomic data or stage alone as tested by cross-validation and an external, multi-institution dataset. By annotating 705,241 radiology reports, MSK-CHORD also uncovers predictors of metastasis to specific organ sites, including a relationship between SETD2 mutation and lower metastatic potential in immunotherapy-treated lung adenocarcinoma corroborated in independent datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of automated annotation from unstructured notes and its utility in predicting patient outcomes. The resulting data are provided as a public resource for real-world oncologic research. A study generates a clinicogenomics dataset resource, MSK-CHORD, that combines natural language processing-derived clinical annotations with patient medical data from various sources to improve models of cancer outcome.",

    "abstract": "Human embryonic bone and joint formation is determined by coordinated differentiation of progenitors in the nascent skeleton. The cell states, epigenetic processes and key regulatory factors that underlie lineage commitment of these cells remain elusive. Here we applied paired transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of approximately 336,000 nucleus droplets and spatial transcriptomics to establish a multi-omic atlas of human embryonic joint and cranium development between 5 and 11 weeks after conception. Using combined modelling of transcriptional and epigenetic data, we characterized regionally distinct limb and cranial osteoprogenitor trajectories across the embryonic skeleton and further described regulatory networks that govern intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Spatial localization of cell clusters in our in situ sequencing data using a new tool, ISS-Patcher, revealed mechanisms of progenitor zonation during bone and joint formation. Through trajectory analysis, we predicted potential non-canonical cellular origins for human chondrocytes from Schwann cells. We also introduce SNP2Cell, a tool to link cell-type-specific regulatory networks to polygenic traits such as osteoarthritis. Using osteolineage trajectories characterized here, we simulated in silico perturbations of genes that cause monogenic craniosynostosis and implicate potential cell states and disease mechanisms. This work forms a detailed and dynamic regulatory atlas of bone and cartilage maturation and advances our fundamental understanding of cell-fate determination in human skeletal development. A multiomic atlas of human embryonic joint and cranium development enables detailed analysis of bone and cartilage maturation.",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial animal biodiversity is increasingly being lost because of land-use change1,2. However, functional and energetic consequences aboveground and belowground and across trophic levels in megadiverse tropical ecosystems remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed changes in energy fluxes across ‘green’ aboveground (canopy arthropods and birds) and ‘brown’ belowground (soil arthropods and earthworms) animal food webs in tropical rainforests and plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our results showed that most of the energy in rainforests is channelled to the belowground animal food web. Oil palm and rubber plantations had similar or, in the case of rubber agroforest, higher total animal energy fluxes compared to rainforest but the key energetic nodes were distinctly different: in rainforest more than 90% of the total animal energy flux was channelled by arthropods in soil and canopy, whereas in plantations more than 50% of the energy was allocated to annelids (earthworms). Land-use change led to a consistent decline in multitrophic energy flux aboveground, whereas belowground food webs responded with reduced energy flux to higher trophic levels, down to −90%, and with shifts from slow (fungal) to fast (bacterial) energy channels and from faeces production towards consumption of soil organic matter. This coincides with previously reported soil carbon stock depletion3. Here we show that well-documented animal biodiversity declines with tropical land-use change4–6 are associated with vast energetic and functional restructuring in food webs across aboveground and belowground ecosystem compartments. Conversion of rainforest to plantations in Sumatra leads to higher energetic losses in animal food webs aboveground than belowground, with the belowground energy being reallocated from diverse arthropod communities to invasive earthworms.",

    "abstract": "Phagocyte NADPH oxidase, a protein complex with a core made up of NOX2 and p22 subunits, is responsible for transferring electrons from intracellular NADPH to extracellular oxygen1. This process generates superoxide anions that are vital for killing pathogens1. The activation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase requires membrane translocation and the binding of several cytosolic factors2. However, the exact mechanism by which cytosolic factors bind to and activate NOX2 is not well understood. Here we present the structure of the human NOX2–p22 complex activated by fragments of three cytosolic factors: p47, p67 and Rac1. The structure reveals that the p67–Rac1 complex clamps onto the dehydrogenase domain of NOX2 and induces its contraction, which stabilizes the binding of NADPH and results in a reduction of the distance between the NADPH-binding domain and the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain. Furthermore, the dehydrogenase domain docks onto the bottom of the transmembrane domain of NOX2, which reduces the distance between FAD and the inner haem. These structural rearrangements might facilitate the efficient transfer of electrons between the redox centres in NOX2 and lead to the activation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human phagocyte NADPH oxidase in the activated state provides insight into how cytosolic factors bind to and promote the activating conformational changes of NOX2, facilitating its efficient electron transfer.",

We invited a multidisciplinary, global group of researchers, practitioners, advocates and young people to complete sequential surveys to identify and prioritize the characteristics of a mental health-friendly city for young people. Here we show a set of ranked characteristic statements, grouped by personal, interpersonal, community, organizational, policy and environmental domains of intervention. Life skills for personal development, valuing and accepting young people’s ideas and choices, providing safe public space for social connection, employment and job security, centring youth input in urban planning and design, and addressing adverse social determinants were priorities by domain. We report the adversities that COVID-19 generated and link relevant actions to these data. Our findings highlight the need for intersectoral, multilevel intervention and for inclusive, equitable, participatory design of cities that support youth mental health. A study examining how cities can foster well-being and positive mental health in young residents synthesizes opinions from researchers, practitioners, advocates and young people, highlighting factors that policymakers and urban planners should consider.",

    "abstract": "The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) had an impact with Dimorphos (a satellite of the asteroid Didymos) on 26 September 20221. Ground-based observations showed that the Didymos system brightened by a factor of 8.3 after the impact because of ejecta, returning to the pre-impact brightness 23.7 days afterwards2. Hubble Space Telescope observations made from 15 minutes after impact to 18.5 days after, with a spatial resolution of 2.1 kilometres per pixel, showed a complex evolution of the ejecta3, consistent with other asteroid impact events. The momentum enhancement factor, determined using the measured binary period change4, ranges between 2.2 and 4.9, depending on the assumptions about the mass and density of Dimorphos5. Here we report observations from the LUKE and LEIA instruments on the LICIACube cube satellite, which was deployed 15 days in advance of the impact of DART. Data were taken from 71 seconds before the impact until 320 seconds afterwards. The ejecta plume was a cone with an aperture angle of 140 ± 4 degrees. The inner region of the plume was blue, becoming redder with increasing distance from Dimorphos. The ejecta plume exhibited a complex and inhomogeneous structure, characterized by filaments, dust grains and single or clustered boulders. The ejecta velocities ranged from a few tens of metres per second to about 500 metres per second. Dimorphos ejecta plume properties were revealed by the observations from the LICIACube cube satellite, which was deployed 15  days in advance of the impact of DART.",

Owing to their high nucleophilicity, cysteine and lysine residues are the most common points of attachment for protein bioconjugation chemistry through acid–base reactivity3,4. Here we report a redox-based strategy for bioconjugation of tryptophan, the rarest amino acid, using oxaziridine reagents that mimic oxidative cyclization reactions in indole-based alkaloid biosynthetic pathways to achieve highly efficient and specific tryptophan labelling. We establish the broad use of this method, termed tryptophan chemical ligation by cyclization (Trp-CLiC), for selectively appending payloads to tryptophan residues on peptides and proteins with reaction rates that rival traditional click reactions and enabling global profiling of hyper-reactive tryptophan sites across whole proteomes. Notably, these reagents reveal a systematic map of tryptophan residues that participate in cation–π interactions, including functional sites that can regulate protein-mediated phase-separation processes.

    "abstract": "Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors with an N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain mediate recognition of strain-specific pathogen effectors, typically via their C-terminal ligand-sensing domains1. Effector binding enables TIR-encoded enzymatic activities that are required for TIR–NLR (TNL)-mediated immunity2,3. Many truncated TNL proteins lack effector-sensing domains but retain similar enzymatic and immune activities4,5. The mechanism underlying the activation of these TIR domain proteins remain unclear. Here we show that binding of the TIR substrates NAD+ and ATP induces phase separation of TIR domain proteins in vitro. A similar condensation occurs with a TIR domain protein expressed via its native promoter in response to pathogen inoculation in planta. The formation of TIR condensates is mediated by conserved self-association interfaces and a predicted intrinsically disordered loop region of TIRs. Mutations that disrupt TIR condensates impair the cell death activity of TIR domain proteins. Our data reveal phase separation as a mechanism for the activation of TIR domain proteins and provide insight into substrate-induced autonomous activation of TIR signalling to confer plant immunity. Binding of the substrates NAD+ and ATP to the plant Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain proteins induces phase separation and, thereby, activation of TIR enzymatic and immune signalling activity.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in how immune cells in the meninges—the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord—contribute to homeostasis and disease in the central nervous system1,2. The outer layer of the meninges, the dura mater, has recently been described to contain both innate and adaptive immune cells, and functions as a site for B cell development3–6. Here we identify organized lymphoid structures that protect fenestrated vasculature in the dura mater. The most elaborate of these dural-associated lymphoid tissues (DALT) surrounded the rostral-rhinal confluence of the sinuses and included lymphatic vessels. We termed this structure, which interfaces with the skull bone marrow and a comparable venous plexus at the skull base, the rostral-rhinal venolymphatic hub. Immune aggregates were present in DALT during homeostasis and expanded with age or after challenge with systemic or nasal antigens. DALT contain germinal centre B cells and support the generation of somatically mutated, antibody-producing cells in response to a nasal pathogen challenge. Inhibition of lymphocyte entry into the rostral-rhinal hub at the time of nasal viral challenge abrogated the generation of germinal centre B cells and class-switched plasma cells, as did perturbation of B–T cell interactions. These data demonstrate a lymphoid structure around vasculature in the dura mater that can sample antigens and rapidly support humoral immune responses after local pathogen challenge. Dural-associated lymphoid tissues are lymphoid structures around vascular hubs in the dura mater that sample antigens and rapidly support humoral immune responses after local pathogen challenge.",

Chromatin complex compositions change during cellular differentiation and ageing, and are expected to be highly heterogeneous among terminally differentiated single cells4–7. Here we introduce the multinucleic acid interaction mapping in single cells (MUSIC) technique for concurrent profiling of multiplex chromatin interactions, gene expression and RNA–chromatin associations within individual nuclei. When applied to 14 human frontal cortex samples from older donors, MUSIC delineated diverse cortical cell types and states. We observed that nuclei exhibiting fewer short-range chromatin interactions were correlated with both an ‘older’ transcriptomic signature and Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Furthermore, the cell type exhibiting chromatin contacts between cis expression quantitative trait loci and a promoter tends to be that in which these cis expression quantitative trait loci specifically affect the expression of their target gene. In addition, female cortical cells exhibit highly heterogeneous interactions between XIST non-coding RNA and chromosome X, along with diverse spatial organizations of the X chromosomes. MUSIC presents a potent tool for exploration of chromatin architecture and transcription at cellular resolution in complex tissues. We introduce multinucleic acid interaction mapping in single cells (MUSIC), for concurrent profiling of multiplex chromatin interactions, gene expression and RNA–chromatin associations within individual nuclei, as a tool for exploring chromatin architecture and transcription.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal immune system is highly adapted to maintaining tolerance to the commensal microbiota and self-antigens while defending against invading pathogens1,2. Recognizing how the diverse network of local cells establish homeostasis and maintains it in the complex immune environment of the gut is critical to understanding how tolerance can be re-established following dysfunction, such as in inflammatory disorders. Although cell and molecular interactions that control T regulatory (Treg) cell development and function have been identified3,4, less is known about the cellular neighbourhoods and spatial compartmentalization that shapes microorganism-reactive Treg cell function. Here we used in vivo live imaging, photo-activation-guided single-cell RNA sequencing5–7 and spatial transcriptomics to follow the natural history of T cells that are reactive towards Helicobacter hepaticus through space and time in the settings of tolerance and inflammation. Although antigen stimulation can occur anywhere in the tissue, the lamina propria—but not embedded lymphoid aggregates—is the key microniche that supports effector Treg (eTreg) cell function. eTreg cells are stable once their niche is established; however, unleashing inflammation breaks down compartmentalization, leading to dominance of CD103+SIRPα+ dendritic cells in the lamina propria. We identify and validate the putative tolerogenic interaction between CD206+ macrophages and eTreg cells in the lamina propria and identify receptor–ligand pairs that are likely to govern the interaction. Our results reveal a spatial mechanism of tolerance in the lamina propria and demonstrate how knowledge of local interactions may contribute to the next generation of tolerance-inducing therapies. Studies in mice show that effector T regulatory cells in the gut are most functional in the lamina propria, but this homeostatic niche is disrupted in inflammation, suggesting a spatial mechanism of tolerance to commensal microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Phase-change memory (PCM) has been considered a promising candidate for solving von Neumann bottlenecks owing to its low latency, non-volatile memory property and high integration density1,2. However, PCMs usually require a large current for the reset process by melting the phase-change material into an amorphous phase, which deteriorates the energy efficiency2–5. Various studies have been conducted to reduce the operation current by minimizing the device dimensions, but this increases the fabrication cost while the reduction of the reset current is limited6,7. Here we show a device for reducing the reset current of a PCM by forming a phase-changeable SiTex nano-filament. Without sacrificing the fabrication cost, the developed nano-filament PCM achieves an ultra-low reset current (approximately 10 μA), which is about one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of highly scaled conventional PCMs. The device maintains favourable memory characteristics such as a large on/off ratio, fast speed, small variations and multilevel memory properties. Our finding is an important step towards developing novel computing paradigms for neuromorphic computing systems, edge processors, in-memory computing systems and even for conventional memory applications. We present a device that can reduce the phase-change memory reset current while maintaining a high on/off ratio, fast speed and small variations, representing advances for neuromorphic computing systems.",

    "abstract": "The tokamak approach, utilizing a toroidal magnetic field configuration to confine a hot plasma, is one of the most promising designs for developing reactors that can exploit nuclear fusion to generate electrical energy1,2. To reach the goal of an economical reactor, most tokamak reactor designs3–10 simultaneously require reaching a plasma line-averaged density above an empirical limit—the so-called Greenwald density11—and attaining an energy confinement quality better than the standard high-confinement mode12,13. However, such an operating regime has never been verified in experiments. In addition, a long-standing challenge in the high-confinement mode has been the compatibility between a high-performance core and avoiding large, transient edge perturbations that can cause very high heat loads on the plasma-facing-components in tokamaks. Here we report the demonstration of stable tokamak plasmas with a line-averaged density approximately 20% above the Greenwald density and an energy confinement quality of approximately 50% better than the standard high-confinement mode, which was realized by taking advantage of the enhanced suppression of turbulent transport granted by high density-gradients in the high-poloidal-beta scenario14,15. Furthermore, our experimental results show an integration of very low edge transient perturbations with the high normalized density and confinement core. The operating regime we report supports some critical requirements in many fusion reactor designs all over the world and opens a potential avenue to an operating point for producing economically attractive fusion energy. A stable tokamak plasma has been demonstrated with a high plasma density and a high energy confinement quality, both of which are simultaneously important for fusion reactors.",

Transforming pyrimidines into their corresponding N-arylpyrimidinium salts enables cleavage into a three-carbon iminoenamine building block, used for various heterocycle-forming reactions. This deconstruction–reconstruction sequence diversifies the initial pyrimidine core and enables access to various heterocycles, such as azoles4. In effect, this approach allows heterocycle formation on complex molecules, resulting in analogues that would be challenging to obtain by other methods. We anticipate that this deconstruction–reconstruction strategy will extend to other heterocycle classes. We present a synthetic method that transforms complex pyrimidine-containing structures into iminoenamines and then uses de novo heterocycle synthesis to obtain substituted pyrimidine and 1,2-azole analogues.",

    "abstract": "A large qubit capacity and an individual readout capability are two crucial requirements for large-scale quantum computing and simulation1. As one of the leading physical platforms for quantum information processing, the ion trap has achieved a quantum simulation of tens of ions with site-resolved readout in a one-dimensional Paul trap2–4 and of hundreds of ions with global observables in a two-dimensional (2D) Penning trap5,6. However, integrating these two features into a single system is still very challenging. Here we report the stable trapping of 512 ions in a 2D Wigner crystal and the sideband cooling of their transverse motion. We demonstrate the quantum simulation of long-range quantum Ising models with tunable coupling strengths and patterns, with or without frustration, using 300 ions. Enabled by the site resolution in the single-shot measurement, we observe rich spatial correlation patterns in the quasi-adiabatically prepared ground states, which allows us to verify quantum simulation results by comparing the measured two-spin correlations with the calculated collective phonon modes and with classical simulated annealing. We further probe the quench dynamics of the Ising model in a transverse field to demonstrate quantum sampling tasks. Our work paves the way for simulating classically intractable quantum dynamics and for running noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms7,8 using 2D ion trap quantum simulators. In this work, stable trapping of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal of above 500 ions is achieved, and the quantum simulation of 300 ions with individual state detection demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the factors governing the stability of fault slip is a crucial problem in fault mechanics1–3. The importance of fault geometry and roughness on fault-slip behaviour has been highlighted in recent lab experiments4–7 and numerical models8–11, and emerging evidence suggests that large-scale complexities in fault networks have a vital role in the fault-rupture process12–18. Here we present a new perspective on fault creep by investigating the link between fault-network geometry and surface creep rates in California, USA. Our analysis reveals that fault groups exhibiting creeping behaviour show smaller misalignment in their fault-network geometry. The observation indicates that the surface fault traces of creeping regions tend to be simple, whereas locked regions tend to be more complex. We propose that the presence of complex fault-network geometries results in geometric locking that promotes stick-slip behaviour characterized by earthquakes, whereas simpler geometries facilitate smooth fault creep. Our findings challenge traditional hypotheses on the physical origins of fault creep explained primarily in terms of fault friction19–21 and demonstrate the potential for a new framework in which large-scale earthquake frictional behaviour is determined by a combination of geometric factors and rheological yielding properties. Analysis of some of the main fault zones in California shows that the presence of complex earthquake fault-network geometries results in geometric locking that promotes stick-slip behaviour, whereas simpler geometries lead to smooth fault creep.",

    "abstract": "Mutations accumulate in the genome of every cell of the body throughout life, causing cancer and other diseases1,2. Most mutations begin as nucleotide mismatches or damage in one of the two strands of the DNA before becoming double-strand mutations if unrepaired or misrepaired3,4. However, current DNA-sequencing technologies cannot accurately resolve these initial single-strand events. Here we develop a single-molecule, long-read sequencing method (Hairpin Duplex Enhanced Fidelity sequencing (HiDEF-seq)) that achieves single-molecule fidelity for base substitutions when present in either one or both DNA strands. HiDEF-seq also detects cytosine deamination—a common type of DNA damage—with single-molecule fidelity. We profiled 134 samples from diverse tissues, including from individuals with cancer predisposition syndromes, and derive from them single-strand mismatch and damage signatures. We find correspondences between these single-strand signatures and known double-strand mutational signatures, which resolves the identity of the initiating lesions. Tumours deficient in both mismatch repair and replicative polymerase proofreading show distinct single-strand mismatch patterns compared to samples that are deficient in only polymerase proofreading. We also define a single-strand damage signature for APOBEC3A. In the mitochondrial genome, our findings support a mutagenic mechanism occurring primarily during replication. As double-strand DNA mutations are only the end point of the mutation process, our approach to detect the initiating single-strand events at single-molecule resolution will enable studies of how mutations arise in a variety of contexts, especially in cancer and ageing. A DNA sequencing method with single-molecule fidelity detects mismatches and damage present in only one of the two DNA strands with patterns that are both similar and distinct compared to known mutation patterns.",

    "abstract": "Black holes have been found over a wide range of masses, from stellar remnants with masses of 5–150 solar masses (M☉), to those found at the centres of galaxies with M > 105M☉. However, only a few debated candidate black holes exist between 150M☉ and 105M☉. Determining the population of these intermediate-mass black holes is an important step towards understanding supermassive black hole formation in the early universe1,2. Several studies have claimed the detection of a central black hole in ω Centauri, the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way3–5. However, these studies have been questioned because of the possible mass contribution of stellar mass black holes, their sensitivity to the cluster centre and the lack of fast-moving stars above the escape velocity6–9. Here we report the observations of seven fast-moving stars in the central 3 arcsec (0.08 pc) of ω Centauri. The velocities of the fast-moving stars are significantly higher than the expected central escape velocity of the star cluster, so their presence can be explained only by being bound to a massive black hole. From the velocities alone, we can infer a firm lower limit of the black hole mass of about 8,200M☉, making this a good case for an intermediate-mass black hole in the local universe. Observations of seven fast-moving stars in the central 3 arcsec (0.08  pc) of ω Centauri indicate an intermediate-mass black hole in ω Centauri.",

    "abstract": "Methanogenic archaea are main contributors to methane emissions, and have a crucial role in carbon cycling and global warming. Until recently, methanogens were confined to Euryarchaeota, but metagenomic studies revealed the presence of genes encoding the methyl coenzyme M reductase complex in other archaeal clades1–4, thereby opening up the premise that methanogenesis is taxonomically more widespread. Nevertheless, laboratory cultivation of these non-euryarchaeal methanogens was lacking to corroborate their potential methanogenic ability and physiology. Here we report the isolation of a thermophilic archaeon LWZ-6 from an oil field. This archaeon belongs to the class Methanosuratincolia (originally affiliated with ‘Candidatus Verstraetearchaeota’) in the phylum Thermoproteota. Methanosuratincola petrocarbonis LWZ-6 is a strict hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic methanogen. Although previous metagenomic studies speculated on the fermentative potential of Methanosuratincolia members, strain LWZ-6 does not ferment sugars, peptides or amino acids. Its energy metabolism is linked only to methanogenesis, with methanol and monomethylamine as electron acceptors and hydrogen as an electron donor. Comparative (meta)genome analysis confirmed that hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic methanogenesis is a widespread trait among Methanosuratincolia. Our findings confirm that the diversity of methanogens expands beyond the classical Euryarchaeota and imply the importance of hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic methanogenesis in global methane emissions and carbon cycle. Methanosuratincola petrocarbonis LWZ-6 is a strict hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic methanogen that does not ferment sugars, peptides or amino acids.",

    "abstract": "Allosteric modulation of protein function, wherein the binding of an effector to a protein triggers conformational changes at distant functional sites, plays a central part in the control of metabolism and cell signalling1–3. There has been considerable interest in designing allosteric systems, both to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying such ‘action at a distance’ modulation and to create synthetic proteins whose functions can be regulated by effectors4–7. However, emulating the subtle conformational changes distributed across many residues, characteristic of natural allosteric proteins, is a significant challenge8,9. Here, inspired by the classic Monod–Wyman–Changeux model of cooperativity10, we investigate the de novo design of allostery through rigid-body coupling of peptide-switchable hinge modules11 to protein interfaces12 that direct the formation of alternative oligomeric states. We find that this approach can be used to generate a wide variety of allosterically switchable systems, including cyclic rings that incorporate or eject subunits in response to peptide binding and dihedral cages that undergo effector-induced disassembly. Size-exclusion chromatography, mass photometry13 and electron microscopy reveal that these designed allosteric protein assemblies closely resemble the design models in both the presence and absence of peptide effectors and can have ligand-binding cooperativity comparable to classic natural systems such as haemoglobin14. Our results indicate that allostery can arise from global coupling of the energetics of protein substructures without optimized side-chain–side-chain allosteric communication pathways and provide a roadmap for generating allosterically triggerable delivery systems, protein nanomachines and cellular feedback control circuitry. We investigate the de novo design of allostery and suggest that it can arise from global coupling of the energetics of protein substructures without optimized allosteric communication pathways, providing a roadmap for the design of switchable molecular systems.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of an early pro-regenerative niche is crucial for tissue regeneration1,2. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent pyroptosis accounts for the release of inflammatory cytokines upon various insults3–5. However, little is known about its role in tissue regeneration followed by homeostatic maintenance. Here we show that macrophage GSDMD deficiency delays tissue recovery but has little effect on the local inflammatory milieu or the lytic pyroptosis process. Profiling of the metabolite secretome of hyperactivated macrophages revealed a non-canonical metabolite-secreting function of GSDMD. We further identified 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) as a bioactive, pro-healing oxylipin that is secreted from hyperactive macrophages in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Accumulation of 11,12-EET by direct supplementation or deletion of Ephx2, which encodes a 11,12-EET-hydrolytic enzyme, accelerated muscle regeneration. We further demonstrated that EPHX2 accumulated within aged muscle, and that consecutive 11,12-EET treatment rejuvenated aged muscle. Mechanistically, 11,12-EET amplifies fibroblast growth factor signalling by modulating liquid–liquid phase separation of fibroblast growth factors, thereby boosting the activation and proliferation of muscle stem cells. These data depict a GSDMD-guided metabolite crosstalk between macrophages and muscle stem cells that governs the repair process, which offers insights with therapeutic implications for the regeneration of injured or aged tissues. Untargeted metabolomics reveals that 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid released from macrophages via gasdermin G pores has a key role in promoting fibroblast growth factor-dependent muscle regeneration following injury.",

    "abstract": "The recent assembly of the adult Drosophila melanogaster central brain connectome, containing more than 125,000 neurons and 50 million synaptic connections, provides a template for examining sensory processing throughout the brain1,2. Here we create a leaky integrate-and-fire computational model of the entire Drosophila brain, on the basis of neural connectivity and neurotransmitter identity3, to study circuit properties of feeding and grooming behaviours. We show that activation of sugar-sensing or water-sensing gustatory neurons in the computational model accurately predicts neurons that respond to tastes and are required for feeding initiation4. In addition, using the model to activate neurons in the feeding region of the Drosophila brain predicts those that elicit motor neuron firing5—a testable hypothesis that we validate by optogenetic activation and behavioural studies. Activating different classes of gustatory neurons in the model makes accurate predictions of how several taste modalities interact, providing circuit-level insight into aversive and appetitive taste processing. Additionally, we applied this model to mechanosensory circuits and found that computational activation of mechanosensory neurons predicts activation of a small set of neurons comprising the antennal grooming circuit, and accurately describes the circuit response upon activation of different mechanosensory subtypes6–10. Our results demonstrate that modelling brain circuits using only synapse-level connectivity and predicted neurotransmitter identity generates experimentally testable hypotheses and can describe complete sensorimotor transformations. We create a computational model of the adult Drosophila brain that accurately describes circuit responses upon activation of different gustatory and mechanosensory subtypes and generates experimentally testable hypotheses to describe complete sensorimotor transformations.",

    "abstract": "In mice, intestinal tuft cells have been described as a long-lived, postmitotic cell type. Two distinct subsets have been identified: tuft-1 and tuft-2 (ref. 1). By combining analysis of primary human intestinal resection material and intestinal organoids, we identify four distinct human tuft cell states, two of which overlap with their murine counterparts. We show that tuft cell development depends on the presence of Wnt ligands, and that tuft cell numbers rapidly increase on interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 exposure, as reported previously in mice2–4. This occurs through proliferation of pre-existing tuft cells, rather than through increased de novo generation from stem cells. Indeed, proliferative tuft cells occur in vivo both in fetal and in adult human intestine. Single mature proliferating tuft cells can form organoids that contain all intestinal epithelial cell types. Unlike stem and progenitor cells, human tuft cells survive irradiation damage and retain the ability to generate all other epithelial cell types. Accordingly, organoids engineered to lack tuft cells fail to recover from radiation-induced damage. Thus, tuft cells represent a damage-induced reserve intestinal stem cell pool in humans. Four distinct tuft cell states are identified by combining analysis of primary human intestinal resection material and organoids, and studying tuft cell development shows that they represent a damage-induced reserve intestinal stem cell pool in humans.",

    "abstract": "Human prenatal skin is populated by innate immune cells, including macrophages, but whether they act solely in immunity or have additional functions in morphogenesis is unclear. Here we assembled a comprehensive multi-omics reference atlas of prenatal human skin (7–17 post-conception weeks), combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, to characterize the microanatomical tissue niches of the skin. This atlas revealed that crosstalk between non-immune and immune cells underpins the formation of hair follicles, is implicated in scarless wound healing and is crucial for skin angiogenesis. We systematically compared a hair-bearing skin organoid (SkO) model derived from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells to prenatal and adult skin1. The SkO model closely recapitulated in vivo skin epidermal and dermal cell types during hair follicle development and expression of genes implicated in the pathogenesis of genetic hair and skin disorders. However, the SkO model lacked immune cells and had markedly reduced endothelial cell heterogeneity and quantity. Our in vivo prenatal skin cell atlas indicated that macrophages and macrophage-derived growth factors have a role in driving endothelial development. Indeed, vascular network remodelling was enhanced following transfer of autologous macrophages derived from induced pluripotent stem cells into SkO cultures. Innate immune cells are therefore key players in skin morphogenesis beyond their conventional role in immunity, a function they achieve through crosstalk with non-immune cells. A comprehensive multi-omics reference atlas of prenatal human skin shows that innate immune cells crosstalk with non-immune cells to perform pivotal roles in skin morphogenesis, including the formation of hair follicles.",

    "abstract": "Autologous bone (AB) is the gold standard for bone-replacement surgeries1, despite its limited availability and the need for an extra surgical site. Traditionally, competitive biomaterials for bone repair have focused on mimicking the mineral aspect of bone, as evidenced by the widespread clinical use of bioactive ceramics2. However, AB also exhibits hierarchical organic structures that might substantially affect bone regeneration. Here, using a range of cell-free biomimetic-collagen-based materials in murine and ovine bone-defect models, we demonstrate that a hierarchical hybrid microstructure—specifically, the twisted plywood pattern of collagen and its association with poorly crystallized bioapatite—favourably influences bone regeneration. Our study shows that the most structurally biomimetic material has the potential to stimulate bone growth, highlighting the pivotal role of physicochemical properties in supporting bone formation and offering promising prospects as a competitive bone-graft material. By examining several cell-free biomimetic-collagen-based materials in murine and ovine bone-defect models, the twisted plywood pattern of collagen-based materials is shown to favourably influence bone regeneration and contributes to bone autograft performance.",

    "abstract": "Patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)1,2, partly because there are immunosuppressive myeloid cells in tumours3,4. However, the heterogeneity of myeloid cells has made them difficult to target, making blockade of the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) clinically ineffective. Here we use single-cell profiling on patient biopsies across the disease continuum and find that a distinct population of tumour-associated macrophages with elevated levels of SPP1 transcripts (SPP1hi-TAMs) becomes enriched with the progression of prostate cancer to mCRPC. In syngeneic mouse modelling, an analogous macrophage population suppresses CD8+ T cell activity in vitro and promotes ICI resistance in vivo. Furthermore, Spp1hi-TAMs are not responsive to anti-CSF1R antibody treatment. Pathway analysis identifies adenosine signalling as a potential mechanism for SPP1hi-TAM-mediated immunotherapeutic resistance. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) significantly reverses Spp1hi-TAM-mediated immunosuppression in CD8+ T cells in vitro and enhances CRPC responsiveness to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in vivo. Consistent with preclinical results, inhibition of A2ARs using ciforadenant in combination with programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade using atezolizumab induces clinical responses in patients with mCRPC. Moreover, inhibiting A2ARs results in a significant decrease in SPP1hi-TAM abundance in CRPC, indicating that this pathway is involved in both induction and downstream immunosuppression. Collectively, these findings establish SPP1hi-TAMs as key mediators of ICI resistance in mCRPC through adenosine signalling, emphasizing their importance as both a therapeutic target and a potential biomarker for predicting treatment efficacy. Single-cell profiling of human prostate cancer and studies in mouse models show that macrophages expressing SPP1 mediate immunotherapeutic resistance through adenosine pathway activation and represent a potential target for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Precise control of cell division is essential for proper patterning and growth during the development of multicellular organisms. Coordination of formative divisions that generate new tissue patterns with proliferative divisions that promote growth is poorly understood. SHORTROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR) are transcription factors that are required for formative divisions in the stem cell niche of Arabidopsis roots1,2. Here we show that levels of SHR and SCR early in the cell cycle determine the orientation of the division plane, resulting in either formative or proliferative cell division. We used 4D quantitative, long-term and frequent (every 15 min for up to 48 h) light sheet and confocal microscopy to probe the dynamics of SHR and SCR in tandem within single cells of living roots. Directly controlling their dynamics with an SHR induction system enabled us to challenge an existing bistable model3 of the SHR–SCR gene-regulatory network and to identify key features that are essential for rescue of formative divisions in shr mutants. SHR and SCR kinetics do not align with the expected behaviour of a bistable system, and only low transient levels, present early in the cell cycle, are required for formative divisions. These results reveal an uncharacterized mechanism by which developmental regulators directly coordinate patterning and growth. Quantitative time-resolved microscopy analysis of SHR and SCR dynamics in single cells of living Arabidopsis roots shows that these transcription factors coordinate formative and proliferative cell divisions early in the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) senses aberrant DNA during infection, cancer and inflammatory disease, and initiates potent innate immune responses through the synthesis of 2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)1–7. The indiscriminate activity of cGAS towards DNA demands tight regulatory mechanisms that are necessary to maintain cell and tissue homeostasis under normal conditions. Inside the cell nucleus, anchoring to nucleosomes and competition with chromatin architectural proteins jointly prohibit cGAS activation by genomic DNA8–15. However, the fate of nuclear cGAS and its role in cell physiology remains unclear. Here we show that the ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS) degrades nuclear cGAS in cycling cells. We identify SPSB3 as the cGAS-targeting substrate receptor that associates with the cullin–RING ubiquitin ligase 5 (CRL5) complex to ligate ubiquitin onto nuclear cGAS. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of nucleosome-bound cGAS in a complex with SPSB3 reveals a highly conserved Asn-Asn (NN) minimal degron motif at the C terminus of cGAS that directs SPSB3 recruitment, ubiquitylation and cGAS protein stability. Interference with SPSB3-regulated nuclear cGAS degradation primes cells for type I interferon signalling, conferring heightened protection against infection by DNA viruses. Our research defines protein degradation as a determinant of cGAS regulation in the nucleus and provides structural insights into an element of cGAS that is amenable to therapeutic exploitation. The ubiquitin proteasomal system degrades nuclear cGAS in cycling cells.",

    "abstract": "Heteroarenes are ubiquitous motifs in bioactive molecules, conferring favourable physical properties when compared to their arene counterparts1–3. In particular, semisaturated heteroarenes possess attractive solubility properties and a higher fraction of sp3 carbons, which can improve binding affinity and specificity. However, these desirable structures remain rare owing to limitations in current synthetic methods4–6. Indeed, semisaturated heterocycles are laboriously prepared by means of non-modular fit-for-purpose syntheses, which decrease throughput, limit chemical diversity and preclude their inclusion in many hit-to-lead campaigns7–10. Herein, we describe a more intuitive and modular couple-close approach to build semisaturated ring systems from dual radical precursors. This platform merges metallaphotoredox C(sp2)–C(sp3) cross-coupling with intramolecular Minisci-type radical cyclization to fuse abundant heteroaryl halides with simple bifunctional feedstocks, which serve as the diradical synthons, to rapidly assemble a variety of spirocyclic, bridged and substituted saturated ring types that would be extremely difficult to make by conventional methods. The broad availability of the requisite feedstock materials allows sampling of regions of underexplored chemical space. Reagent-controlled radical generation leads to a highly regioselective and stereospecific annulation that can be used for the late-stage functionalization of pharmaceutical scaffolds, replacing lengthy de novo syntheses. A couple-close approach used to build semisaturated ring systems from dual radical precursors allows sampling of regions of underexplored chemical space, leading to an annulation that can be used for late-stage functionalization of pharmaceutical scaffolds.",

    "abstract": "The myriad microorganisms that live in close association with humans have diverse effects on physiology, yet the molecular bases for these impacts remain mostly unknown1–3. Classical pathogens often invade host tissues and modulate immune responses through interactions with human extracellular and secreted proteins (the ‘exoproteome’). Commensal microorganisms may also facilitate niche colonization and shape host biology by engaging host exoproteins; however, direct exoproteome–microbiota interactions remain largely unexplored. Here we developed and validated a novel technology, BASEHIT, that enables proteome-scale assessment of human exoproteome–microbiome interactions. Using BASEHIT, we interrogated more than 1.7 million potential interactions between 519 human-associated bacterial strains from diverse phylogenies and tissues of origin and 3,324 human exoproteins. The resulting interactome revealed an extensive network of transkingdom connectivity consisting of thousands of previously undescribed host–microorganism interactions involving 383 strains and 651 host proteins. Specific binding patterns within this network implied underlying biological logic; for example, conspecific strains exhibited shared exoprotein-binding patterns, and individual tissue isolates uniquely bound tissue-specific exoproteins. Furthermore, we observed dozens of unique and often strain-specific interactions with potential roles in niche colonization, tissue remodelling and immunomodulation, and found that strains with differing host interaction profiles had divergent interactions with host cells in vitro and effects on the host immune system in vivo. Overall, these studies expose a previously unexplored landscape of molecular-level host–microbiota interactions that may underlie causal effects of indigenous microorganisms on human health and disease. A new technology for proteome-scale assessment of human exoproteome–microbiome interactions exposes an extensive network of transkingdom connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Antibody and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-mediated targeted therapies have improved survival in patients with solid and haematologic malignancies1–9. Adults with T cell leukaemias and lymphomas, collectively called T cell cancers, have short survival10,11 and lack such targeted therapies. Thus, T cell cancers particularly warrant the development of CAR T cells and antibodies to improve patient outcomes. Preclinical studies showed that targeting T cell receptor β-chain constant region 1 (TRBC1) can kill cancerous T cells while preserving sufficient healthy T cells to maintain immunity12, making TRBC1 an attractive target to treat T cell cancers. However, the first-in-human clinical trial of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells reported a low response rate and unexplained loss of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells13,14. Here we demonstrate that CAR T cells are lost due to killing by the patient’s normal T cells, reducing their efficacy. To circumvent this issue, we developed an antibody–drug conjugate that could kill TRBC1+ cancer cells in vitro and cure human T cell cancers in mouse models. The anti-TRBC1 antibody–drug conjugate may provide an optimal format for TRBC1 targeting and produce superior responses in patients with T cell cancers. Anti-TRBC1 antibody–drug conjugates may offer a more potent T cell cancer therapy by bypassing the fratricide that may be limiting the efficacy of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells in the clinical trial for patients with T cell cancers.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the intensity of emitted light and charge current is the basis of transferring and processing information1. By contrast, robust information storage and magnetic random-access memories are implemented using the spin of the carrier and the associated magnetization in ferromagnets2. The missing link between the respective disciplines of photonics, electronics and spintronics is to modulate the circular polarization of the emitted light, rather than its intensity, by electrically controlled magnetization. Here we demonstrate that this missing link is established at room temperature and zero applied magnetic field in light-emitting diodes2–7, through the transfer of angular momentum between photons, electrons and ferromagnets. With spin–orbit torque8–11, a charge current generates also a spin current to electrically switch the magnetization. This switching determines the spin orientation of injected carriers into semiconductors, in which the transfer of angular momentum from the electron spin to photon controls the circular polarization of the emitted light2. The spin–photon conversion with the nonvolatile control of magnetization opens paths to seamlessly integrate information transfer, processing and storage. Our results provide substantial advances towards electrically controlled ultrafast modulation of circular polarization and spin injection with magnetization dynamics for the next-generation information and communication technology12, including space–light data transfer. The same operating principle in scaled-down structures or using two-dimensional materials will enable transformative opportunities for quantum information processing with spin-controlled single-photon sources, as well as for implementing spin-dependent time-resolved spectroscopies. The helicity of light from a light-emitting diode can be electrically controlled by spin–orbit torque effects, enabling a seamless integration of magnetization dynamics with photonics.",

    "abstract": "Heteroplasmy occurs when wild-type and mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules co-exist in single cells1. Heteroplasmy levels change dynamically in development, disease and ageing2,3, but it is unclear whether these shifts are caused by selection or drift, and whether they occur at the level of cells or intracellularly. Here we investigate heteroplasmy dynamics in dividing cells by combining precise mtDNA base editing (DdCBE)4 with a new method, SCI-LITE (single-cell combinatorial indexing leveraged to interrogate targeted expression), which tracks single-cell heteroplasmy with ultra-high throughput. We engineered cells to have synonymous or nonsynonymous complex I mtDNA mutations and found that cell populations in standard culture conditions purge nonsynonymous mtDNA variants, whereas synonymous variants are maintained. This suggests that selection dominates over simple drift in shaping population heteroplasmy. We simultaneously tracked single-cell mtDNA heteroplasmy and ancestry, and found that, although the population heteroplasmy shifts, the heteroplasmy of individual cell lineages remains stable, arguing that selection acts at the level of cell fitness in dividing cells. Using these insights, we show that we can force cells to accumulate high levels of truncating complex I mtDNA heteroplasmy by placing them in environments where loss of biochemical complex I activity has been reported to benefit cell fitness. We conclude that in dividing cells, a given nonsynonymous mtDNA heteroplasmy can be harmful, neutral or even beneficial to cell fitness, but that the ‘sign’ of the effect is wholly dependent on the environment. A new method for tracking single-cell heteroplasmy, called SCI-LITE, is combined with mitochondrial DNA base editing to reveal principles of heteroplasmy dynamics in dividing cells.",

    "abstract": "Amazonia contains the most extensive tropical forests on Earth, but Amazon carbon sinks of atmospheric CO2 are declining, as deforestation and climate-change-associated droughts1–4 threaten to push these forests past a tipping point towards collapse5–8. Forests exhibit complex drought responses, indicating both resilience (photosynthetic greening) and vulnerability (browning and tree mortality), that are difficult to explain by climate variation alone9–17. Here we combine remotely sensed photosynthetic indices with ground-measured tree demography to identify mechanisms underlying drought resilience/vulnerability in different intact forest ecotopes18,19 (defined by water-table depth, soil fertility and texture, and vegetation characteristics). In higher-fertility southern Amazonia, drought response was structured by water-table depth, with resilient greening in shallow-water-table forests (where greater water availability heightened response to excess sunlight), contrasting with vulnerability (browning and excess tree mortality) over deeper water tables. Notably, the resilience of shallow-water-table forest weakened as drought lengthened. By contrast, lower-fertility northern Amazonia, with slower-growing but hardier trees (or, alternatively, tall forests, with deep-rooted water access), supported more-drought-resilient forests independent of water-table depth. This functional biogeography of drought response provides a framework for conservation decisions and improved predictions of heterogeneous forest responses to future climate changes, warning that Amazonia’s most productive forests are also at greatest risk, and that longer/more frequent droughts are undermining multiple ecohydrological strategies and capacities for Amazon forest resilience. Drought response is structured by water-table depth in higher-fertility Southern Amazonia, whereas lower-fertility Northern Amazonia supports more-drought-resilient forests independent of water-table depth.",

    "abstract": "Titanium:sapphire (Ti:sapphire) lasers have been essential for advancing fundamental research and technological applications, including the development of the optical frequency comb1, two-photon microscopy2 and experimental quantum optics3,4. Ti:sapphire lasers are unmatched in bandwidth and tuning range, yet their use is restricted because of their large size, cost and need for high optical pump powers5. Here we demonstrate a monocrystalline titanium:sapphire-on-insulator (Ti:SaOI) photonics platform that enables dramatic miniaturization, cost reduction and scalability of Ti:sapphire technology. First, through the fabrication of low-loss whispering-gallery-mode resonators, we realize a Ti:sapphire laser operating with an ultralow, sub-milliwatt lasing threshold. Then, through orders-of-magnitude improvement in mode confinement in Ti:SaOI waveguides, we realize an integrated solid-state (that is, non-semiconductor) optical amplifier operating below 1 μm. We demonstrate unprecedented distortion-free amplification of picosecond pulses to peak powers reaching 1.0 kW. Finally, we demonstrate a tunable integrated Ti:sapphire laser, which can be pumped with low-cost, miniature, off-the-shelf green laser diodes. This opens the doors to new modalities of Ti:sapphire lasers, such as massively scalable Ti:sapphire laser-array systems for several applications. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we use a Ti:SaOI laser array as the sole optical control for a cavity quantum electrodynamics experiment with artificial atoms in silicon carbide6. This work is a key step towards the democratization of Ti:sapphire technology through a three-orders-of-magnitude reduction in cost and footprint and introduces solid-state broadband amplification of sub-micron wavelength light. A photonic platform enables miniaturization and scalability of titanium:sapphire photonic technology, reducing footprint and cost by three orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Plants adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions by adjusting their metabolism and gene expression to maintain fitness1. In legumes, nitrogen homeostasis is maintained by balancing nitrogen acquired from soil resources with nitrogen fixation by symbiotic bacteria in root nodules2–8. Here we show that zinc, an essential plant micronutrient, acts as an intracellular second messenger that connects environmental changes to transcription factor control of metabolic activity in root nodules. We identify a transcriptional regulator, FIXATION UNDER NITRATE (FUN), which acts as a sensor, with zinc controlling the transition between an inactive filamentous megastructure and an active transcriptional regulator. Lower zinc concentrations in the nodule, which we show occur in response to higher levels of soil nitrate, dissociates the filament and activates FUN. FUN then directly targets multiple pathways to initiate breakdown of the nodule. The zinc-dependent filamentation mechanism thus establishes a concentration readout to adapt nodule function to the environmental nitrogen conditions. In a wider perspective, these results have implications for understanding the roles of metal ions in integration of environmental signals with plant development and optimizing delivery of fixed nitrogen in legume crops. Zinc acts as a second messenger in root nodules and regulates nitrogen homeostasis by controlling the transition between the active state and the inactive filamentous state of the novel transcriptional regulator FIXATION UNDER NITRATE (FUN).",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic activities have substantially enhanced the loadings of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in the Earth system since pre-industrial times1,2, contributing to widespread eutrophication and air pollution3–6. Increased Nr can also influence global climate through a variety of effects on atmospheric and land processes but the cumulative net climate effect is yet to be unravelled. Here we show that anthropogenic Nr causes a net negative direct radiative forcing of −0.34 [−0.20, −0.50] W m−2 in the year 2019 relative to the year 1850. This net cooling effect is the result of increased aerosol loading, reduced methane lifetime and increased terrestrial carbon sequestration associated with increases in anthropogenic Nr, which are not offset by the warming effects of enhanced atmospheric nitrous oxide and ozone. Future predictions using three representative scenarios show that this cooling effect may be weakened primarily as a result of reduced aerosol loading and increased lifetime of methane, whereas in particular N2O-induced warming will probably continue to increase under all scenarios. Our results indicate that future reductions in anthropogenic Nr to achieve environmental protection goals need to be accompanied by enhanced efforts to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to achieve climate change mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement. A comprehensive model framework is used to estimate the global net direct radiative forcing of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen as being about −0.34 W m−2, which has a cooling effect on the climate.",

    "abstract": "Methane is an important greenhouse gas1, but the role of trees in the methane budget remains uncertain2. Although it has been shown that wetland and some upland trees can emit soil-derived methane at the stem base3,4, it has also been suggested that upland trees can serve as a net sink for atmospheric methane5,6. Here we examine in situ woody surface methane exchange of upland tropical, temperate and boreal forest trees. We find that methane uptake on woody surfaces, in particular at and above about 2 m above the forest floor, can dominate the net ecosystem contribution of trees, resulting in a net tree methane sink. Stable carbon isotope measurement of methane in woody surface chamber air and process-level investigations on extracted wood cores are consistent with methanotrophy, suggesting a microbially mediated drawdown of methane on and in tree woody surfaces and tissues. By applying terrestrial laser scanning-derived allometry to quantify global forest tree woody surface area, a preliminary first estimate suggests that trees may contribute 24.6–49.9 Tg of atmospheric methane uptake globally. Our findings indicate that the climate benefits of tropical and temperate forest protection and reforestation may be greater than previously assumed. Studies of in situ woody surface methane exchange in upland tropical, temperate and boreal forest trees find that methane uptake can result in a net tree methane sink that is globally significant and demonstrates an additional climate benefit provided by trees.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates enable cell compartmentalization by acting as membraneless organelles1. How cells control the interactions of condensates with other cellular structures such as membranes to drive morphological transitions remains poorly understood. We discovered that formation of a tight-junction belt, which is essential for sealing epithelial tissues, is driven by a wetting phenomenon that promotes the growth of a condensed ZO-1 layer2 around the apical membrane interface. Using temporal proximity proteomics in combination with imaging and thermodynamic theory, we found that the polarity protein PATJ mediates a transition of ZO-1 into a condensed surface layer that elongates around the apical interface. In line with the experimental observations, our theory of condensate growth shows that the speed of elongation depends on the binding affinity of ZO-1 to the apical interface and is constant. Here, using PATJ mutations, we show that ZO-1 interface binding is necessary and sufficient for tight-junction belt formation. Our results demonstrate how cells exploit the collective biophysical properties of protein condensates at membrane interfaces to shape mesoscale structures. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that tight-junction formation depends on the growth of a condensed layer of ZO-1 proteins at the interface of the apical and lateral membrane, providing insight into self-assembly of complex mesoscale structures in cells.",

    "abstract": "The risk of early recurrent events after stroke remains high despite currently established secondary prevention strategies1. Risk is particularly high in patients with atherosclerosis, with more than 10% of patients experiencing early recurrent events1,2. However, despite the enormous medical burden of this clinical phenomenon, the underlying mechanisms leading to increased vascular risk and recurrent stroke are largely unknown. Here, using a novel mouse model of stroke-induced recurrent ischaemia, we show that stroke leads to activation of the AIM2 inflammasome in vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques via an increase of circulating cell-free DNA. Enhanced plaque inflammation post-stroke results in plaque destabilization and atherothrombosis, finally leading to arterioarterial embolism and recurrent stroke within days after the index stroke. We confirm key steps of plaque destabilization also after experimental myocardial infarction and in carotid artery plaque samples from patients with acute stroke. Rapid neutrophil NETosis was identified as the main source of cell-free DNA after stroke and NET–DNA as the causative agent leading to AIM2 inflammasome activation. Neutralization of cell-free DNA by DNase treatment or inhibition of inflammasome activation reduced the rate of stroke recurrence after experimental stroke. Our findings present an explanation for the high recurrence rate after incident ischaemic events in patients with atherosclerosis. The detailed mechanisms uncovered here provide clinically uncharted therapeutic targets for which we show high efficacy to prevent recurrent events. Targeting DNA-mediated inflammasome activation after remote tissue injury represents a promising avenue for further clinical development in the prevention of early recurrent events. This study describes sensing of circulating cell-free DNA after stroke as the mechanism leading to recurrent ischemic events.",

    "abstract": "Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a globally dominant crop and major source of calories and proteins for the human diet. Compared with its wild ancestors, modern bread wheat shows lower genetic diversity, caused by polyploidisation, domestication and breeding bottlenecks1,2. Wild wheat relatives represent genetic reservoirs, and harbour diversity and beneficial alleles that have not been incorporated into bread wheat. Here we establish and analyse extensive genome resources for Tausch’s goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii), the donor of the bread wheat D genome. Our analysis of 46 Ae. tauschii genomes enabled us to clone a disease resistance gene and perform haplotype analysis across a complex disease resistance locus, allowing us to discern alleles from paralogous gene copies. We also reveal the complex genetic composition and history of the bread wheat D genome, which involves contributions from genetically and geographically discrete Ae. tauschii subpopulations. Together, our results reveal the complex history of the bread wheat D genome and demonstrate the potential of wild relatives in crop improvement. Analysis of 46 newly sequenced or re-sequenced Tausch’s goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii) accessions establishes the origin of the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) D genome from genetically and geographically discrete Ae. tauschii subpopulations.",

    "abstract": "Despite a high response rate in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL)1–3, approximately 50% of patients relapse within the first year4–6, representing an urgent question to address in the next stage of cellular immunotherapy. Here, to investigate the molecular determinants of ultralong CAR T cell persistence, we obtained a single-cell multi-omics atlas from 695,819 pre-infusion CAR T cells at the basal level or after CAR-specific stimulation from 82 paediatric patients with ALL enrolled in the first two CAR T ALL clinical trials and 6 healthy donors. We identified that elevated type 2 functionality in CAR T infusion products is significantly associated with patients maintaining a median B cell aplasia duration of 8.4 years. Analysis of ligand–receptor interactions revealed that type 2 cells regulate a dysfunctional subset to maintain whole-population homeostasis, and the addition of IL-4 during antigen-specific activation alleviates CAR T cell dysfunction while enhancing fitness at both transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. Serial proteomic profiling of sera after treatment revealed a higher level of circulating type 2 cytokines in 5-year or 8-year relapse-free responders. In a leukaemic mouse model, type 2high CAR T cell products demonstrated superior expansion and antitumour activity, particularly after leukaemia rechallenge. Restoring antitumour efficacy in type 2low CAR T cells was attainable by enhancing their type 2 functionality, either through incorporating IL-4 into the manufacturing process or by priming manufactured CAR T products with IL-4 before infusion. Our findings provide insights into the mediators of durable CAR T therapy response and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to sustain long-term remission by boosting type 2 functionality in CAR T cells. Elevated type 2 functionality in CAR T cell infusion products is significantly associated with maintenance of a median B cell aplasia duration of 8.4 years in paediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia.",

    "abstract": "Ageing impairs the ability of neural stem cells (NSCs) to transition from quiescence to proliferation in the adult mammalian brain. Functional decline of NSCs results in the decreased production of new neurons and defective regeneration following injury during ageing1–4. Several genetic interventions have been found to ameliorate old brain function5–8, but systematic functional testing of genes in old NSCs—and more generally in old cells—has not been done. Here we develop in vitro and in vivo high-throughput CRISPR–Cas9 screening platforms to systematically uncover gene knockouts that boost NSC activation in old mice. Our genome-wide screens in primary cultures of young and old NSCs uncovered more than 300 gene knockouts that specifically restore the activation of old NSCs. The top gene knockouts are involved in cilium organization and glucose import. We also establish a scalable CRISPR–Cas9 screening platform in vivo, which identified 24 gene knockouts that boost NSC activation and the production of new neurons in old brains. Notably, the knockout of Slc2a4, which encodes the GLUT4 glucose transporter, is a top intervention that improves the function of old NSCs. Glucose uptake increases in NSCs during ageing, and transient glucose starvation restores the ability of old NSCs to activate. Thus, an increase in glucose uptake may contribute to the decline in NSC activation with age. Our work provides scalable platforms to systematically identify genetic interventions that boost the function of old NSCs, including in vivo, with important implications for countering regenerative decline during ageing. CRISPR–Cas9 screens in cultures of young and old neural stem cells (NSCs) and in vivo in old mice identify gene knockouts that can boost old NSC activation and neurogenesis, with Slc2a4, which encodes the glucose transporter GLUT4, showing particular efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are major drivers of gene mobilization by means of horizontal gene transfer and play a key role in spreading antimicrobial resistance among pathogens1,2. Despite various bacterial defence mechanisms such as CRISPR–Cas, restriction–modification systems and SOS-response genes that prevent the invasion of mobile genetic elements3, plasmids robustly transfer within bacterial populations through conjugation4,5. Here we show that the leading region of plasmids, the first to enter recipient cells, is a hotspot for an extensive repertoire of anti-defence systems, encoding anti-CRISPR, anti-restriction, anti-SOS and other counter-defence proteins. We further identified in the leading region a prevalence of promoters known to allow expression from single-stranded DNA6, potentially facilitating rapid protection against bacterial immunity during the early stages of plasmid establishment. We demonstrated experimentally the importance of anti-defence gene localization in the leading region for efficient conjugation. These results indicate that focusing on the leading region of plasmids could lead to the discovery of diverse anti-defence genes. Combined, our findings show a new facet of plasmid dissemination and provide theoretical foundations for developing efficient conjugative delivery systems for natural microbial communities. The leading region of plasmids is a hotspot for many anti-defence systems, encoding anti-CRISPR, anti-restriction and other counter-defence proteins; focusing on this region could lead to the discovery of diverse anti-defence genes, and improve strategies for the design of plasmid-based delivery systems for diverse microbial ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "In tomato, sugar content is highly correlated with consumer preferences, with most consumers preferring sweeter fruit1–4. However, the sugar content of commercial varieties is generally low, as it is inversely correlated with fruit size, and growers prioritize yield over flavour quality5–7. Here we identified two genes, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) calcium-dependent protein kinase 27 (SlCDPK27; also known as SlCPK27) and its paralogue SlCDPK26, that control fruit sugar content. They act as sugar brakes by phosphorylating a sucrose synthase, which promotes degradation of the sucrose synthase. Gene-edited SlCDPK27 and SlCDPK26 knockouts increased glucose and fructose contents by up to 30%, enhancing perceived sweetness without fruit weight or yield penalty. Although there are fewer, lighter seeds in the mutants, they exhibit normal germination. Together, these findings provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling fruit sugar accumulation in tomato and offer opportunities to increase sugar content in large-fruited cultivars without sacrificing size and yield. A study identifies two genes that act as brakes controlling the sugar content of tomatoes and demonstrates their manipulation to generate sweeter tomatoes without affecting the fruit size and yield.",

    "abstract": "Tight relationships exist in the local Universe between the central stellar properties of galaxies and the mass of their supermassive black hole (SMBH)1–3. These suggest that galaxies and black holes co-evolve, with the main regulation mechanism being energetic feedback from accretion onto the black hole during its quasar phase4–6. A crucial question is how the relationship between black holes and galaxies evolves with time; a key epoch to examine this relationship is at the peaks of star formation and black hole growth 8–12 billion years ago (redshifts 1–3)7. Here we report a dynamical measurement of the mass of the black hole in a luminous quasar at a redshift of 2, with a look back in time of 11 billion years, by spatially resolving the broad-line region (BLR). We detect a 40-μas (0.31-pc) spatial offset between the red and blue photocentres of the Hα line that traces the velocity gradient of a rotating BLR. The flux and differential phase spectra are well reproduced by a thick, moderately inclined disk of gas clouds within the sphere of influence of a central black hole with a mass of 3.2 × 108 solar masses. Molecular gas data reveal a dynamical mass for the host galaxy of 6 × 1011 solar masses, which indicates an undermassive black hole accreting at a super-Eddington rate. This suggests a host galaxy that grew faster than the SMBH, indicating a delay between galaxy and black hole formation for some systems. Using the GRAVITY+ instrument, dynamical measurement of the black hole mass in a quasar at a redshift of 2.3 (11 billion years ago) shows how the relationship between galaxies and black holes evolves with time.",

    "abstract": "The microscopic origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates remains unknown. It is widely believed that substantial progress could be achieved by better understanding of the pseudogap phase, a normal non-superconducting state of cuprates1,2. In particular, a central issue is whether the pseudogap could originate from strong pairing fluctuations3. Unitary Fermi gases4,5, in which the pseudogap—if it exists—necessarily arises from many-body pairing, offer ideal quantum simulators to address this question. Here we report the observation of a pair-fluctuation-driven pseudogap in homogeneous unitary Fermi gases of lithium-6 atoms, by precisely measuring the fermion spectral function through momentum-resolved microwave spectroscopy and without spurious effects from final-state interactions. The temperature dependence of the pairing gap, inverse pair lifetime and single-particle scattering rate are quantitatively determined by analysing the spectra. We find a large pseudogap above the superfluid transition temperature. The inverse pair lifetime exhibits a thermally activated exponential behaviour, uncovering the microscopic virtual pair breaking and recombination mechanism. The obtained large, temperature-independent single-particle scattering rate is comparable with that set by the Planckian limit6. Our findings quantitatively characterize the pseudogap in strongly interacting Fermi gases and they lend support for the role of preformed pairing as a precursor to superfluidity. This study describes experiments with ultracold lithium Fermi gases in which many-body pairing leads to the emergence of a pseudogap, and it confirms theoretical predictions relevant to cuprate superconductivity.",

    "abstract": "Quantum interference can deeply alter the nature of many-body phases of matter1. In the case of the Hubbard model, Nagaoka proved that introducing a single itinerant charge can transform a paramagnetic insulator into a ferromagnet through path interference2–4. However, a microscopic observation of this kinetic magnetism induced by individually imaged dopants has been so far elusive. Here we demonstrate the emergence of Nagaoka polarons in a Hubbard system realized with strongly interacting fermions in a triangular optical lattice5,6. Using quantum gas microscopy, we image these polarons as extended ferromagnetic bubbles around particle dopants arising from the local interplay of coherent dopant motion and spin exchange. By contrast, kinetic frustration due to the triangular geometry promotes antiferromagnetic polarons around hole dopants7. Our work augurs the exploration of exotic quantum phases driven by charge motion in strongly correlated systems and over sizes that are challenging for numerical simulation8–10. Emergence of Nagaoka polarons and kinetic magnetism is observed in a Hubbard system realized with strongly interacting fermions trapped in a triangular optical lattice.",

    "abstract": "Fentanyl is a powerful painkiller that elicits euphoria and positive reinforcement1. Fentanyl also leads to dependence, defined by the aversive withdrawal syndrome, which fuels negative reinforcement2,3 (that is, individuals retake the drug to avoid withdrawal). Positive and negative reinforcement maintain opioid consumption, which leads to addiction in one-fourth of users, the largest fraction for all addictive drugs4. Among the opioid receptors, µ-opioid receptors have a key role5, yet the induction loci of circuit adaptations that eventually lead to addiction remain unknown. Here we injected mice with fentanyl to acutely inhibit γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), causing disinhibition of dopamine neurons, which eventually increased dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Knockdown of µ-opioid receptors in VTA abolished dopamine transients and positive reinforcement, but withdrawal remained unchanged. We identified neurons expressing µ-opioid receptors in the central amygdala (CeA) whose activity was enhanced during withdrawal. Knockdown of µ-opioid receptors in CeA eliminated aversive symptoms, suggesting that they mediate negative reinforcement. Thus, optogenetic stimulation caused place aversion, and mice readily learned to press a lever to pause optogenetic stimulation of CeA neurons that express µ-opioid receptors. Our study parses the neuronal populations that trigger positive and negative reinforcement in VTA and CeA, respectively. We lay out the circuit organization to develop interventions for reducing fentanyl addiction and facilitating rehabilitation. Experiments using fentanyl treatment of mice show that µ-opioid receptors mediate positive reinforcement in the ventral tegmental area and negative reinforcement in central amygdala, thereby identifying the circuits that lead to opioid addiction.",

    "abstract": "Animals have exquisite control of their bodies, allowing them to perform a diverse range of behaviours. How such control is implemented by the brain, however, remains unclear. Advancing our understanding requires models that can relate principles of control to the structure of neural activity in behaving animals. Here, to facilitate this, we built a ‘virtual rodent’, in which an artificial neural network actuates a biomechanically realistic model of the rat1 in a physics simulator2. We used deep reinforcement learning3–5 to train the virtual agent to imitate the behaviour of freely moving rats, thus allowing us to compare neural activity recorded in real rats to the network activity of a virtual rodent mimicking their behaviour. We found that neural activity in the sensorimotor striatum and motor cortex was better predicted by the virtual rodent’s network activity than by any features of the real rat’s movements, consistent with both regions implementing inverse dynamics6. Furthermore, the network’s latent variability predicted the structure of neural variability across behaviours and afforded robustness in a way consistent with the minimal intervention principle of optimal feedback control7. These results demonstrate how physical simulation of biomechanically realistic virtual animals can help interpret the structure of neural activity across behaviour and relate it to theoretical principles of motor control. We built an artificial neural network to control a biomechanically realistic virtual rodent, which, when trained to imitate real rats, predicts neural activity and variability across natural behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Chiral superconductors, a unique class of unconventional superconductors in which the complex superconducting order parameter winds clockwise or anticlockwise in the momentum space1, represent a topologically non-trivial system with intrinsic time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) and direct implications for topological quantum computing2,3. Intrinsic chiral superconductors are extremely rare, with only a few arguable examples, including UTe2, UPt3 and Sr2RuO4 (refs. 4–7). It has been suggested that chiral superconductivity may exist in non-centrosymmetric superconductors8,9, although such non-centrosymmetry is uncommon in typical solid-state superconductors. Alternatively, chiral molecules with neither mirror nor inversion symmetry have been widely investigated. We suggest that an incorporation of chiral molecules into conventional superconductor lattices could introduce non-centrosymmetry and help realize chiral superconductivity10. Here we explore unconventional superconductivity in chiral molecule intercalated TaS2 hybrid superlattices. Our studies reveal an exceptionally large in-plane upper critical field Bc2,|| well beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit, a robust π-phase shift in Little–Parks measurements and a field-free superconducting diode effect (SDE). These experimental signatures of unconventional superconductivity suggest that the intriguing interplay between crystalline atomic layers and the self-assembled chiral molecular layers may lead to exotic topological materials. Our study highlights that the hybrid superlattices could lay a versatile path to artificial quantum materials by combining a vast library of layered crystals of rich physical properties with the nearly infinite variations of molecules of designable structural motifs and functional groups11. By incorporating chiral molecules into conventional superconductor lattices such as TaS2 to form a hybrid superlattice, non-centrosymmetry could be introduced and can be shown to help lead to unconventional superconductivity.",

    "abstract": "Previous dating research indicated that the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is host to some of the oldest known rock art1–3. That work was based on solution uranium-series (U-series) analysis of calcite deposits overlying rock art in the limestone caves of Maros-Pangkep, South Sulawesi1–3. Here we use a novel application of this approach—laser-ablation U-series imaging—to re-date some of the earliest cave art in this karst area and to determine the age of stylistically similar motifs at other Maros-Pangkep sites. This method provides enhanced spatial accuracy, resulting in older minimum ages for previously dated art. We show that a hunting scene from Leang Bulu’ Sipong 4, which was originally dated using the previous approach to a minimum of 43,900 thousand years ago (ka)3, has a minimum age of 50.2 ± 2.2 ka, and so is at least 4,040 years older than thought. Using the imaging approach, we also assign a minimum age of 53.5 ± 2.3 ka to a newly described cave art scene at Leang Karampuang. Painted at least 51,200 years ago, this narrative composition, which depicts human-like figures interacting with a pig, is now the earliest known surviving example of representational art, and visual storytelling, in the world3. Our findings show that figurative portrayals of anthropomorphic figures and animals have a deeper origin in the history of modern human (Homo sapiens) image-making than recognized to date, as does their representation in composed scenes. A cave art scene at Leang Karampuang, Indonesia, dated to at least 51,200 years ago using laser-ablation uranium-series imaging, depicts human-like figures interacting with a pig.",

Sunlight power5–7 is a potential alternative to improve the endurance of ultralight MAVs, but owing to the restricted payload capacity of the vehicle and low lift-to-power efficiency of traditional propulsion systems, previous studies have not achieved untethered sustained flight of MAVs fully powered by natural sunlight8,9. Here, to address these challenges, we introduce the CoulombFly, an electrostatic flyer consisting of an electrostatic-driven propulsion system with a high lift-to-power efficiency of 30.7 g W−1 and an ultralight kilovolt power system with a low power consumption of 0.568 W, to realize solar-powered sustained flight of an MAV under natural sunlight conditions (920 W m−2). The vehicle’s total mass is only 4.21 g, within 1/600 of the existing lightest sunlight-powered aerial vehicle6. Solar-powered, untethered, sustained flight of an ultralight micro aerial vehicle under natural sunlight conditions is achieved using an electrostatic-driven propulsion system with a high lift-to-power efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of transcriptional activity are encoded in our genome through regulatory elements such as promoters or enhancers that, paradoxically, contain similar assortments of sequence-specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites1–3. Knowledge of how these sequence motifs encode multiple, often overlapping, gene expression programs is central to understanding gene regulation and how mutations in non-coding DNA manifest in disease4,5. Here, by studying gene regulation from the perspective of individual transcription start sites (TSSs), using natural genetic variation, perturbation of endogenous TF protein levels and massively parallel analysis of natural and synthetic regulatory elements, we show that the effect of TF binding on transcription initiation is position dependent. Analysing TF-binding-site occurrences relative to the TSS, we identified several motifs with highly preferential positioning. We show that these patterns are a combination of a TF’s distinct functional profiles—many TFs, including canonical activators such as NRF1, NFY and Sp1, activate or repress transcription initiation depending on their precise position relative to the TSS. As such, TFs and their spacing collectively guide the site and frequency of transcription initiation. More broadly, these findings reveal how similar assortments of TF binding sites can generate distinct gene regulatory outcomes depending on their spatial configuration and how DNA sequence polymorphisms may contribute to transcription variation and disease and underscore a critical role for TSS data in decoding the regulatory information of our genome. The effect of transcription factor binding on transcription initiation is dependent on the position of the transcription factor binding site.",

    "abstract": "The global retreat of glaciers is dramatically altering mountain and high-latitude landscapes, with new ecosystems developing from apparently barren substrates1–4. The study of these emerging ecosystems is critical to understanding how climate change interacts with microhabitat and biotic communities and determines the future of ice-free terrains1,5. Here, using a comprehensive characterization of ecosystems (soil properties, microclimate, productivity and biodiversity by environmental DNA metabarcoding6) across 46 proglacial landscapes worldwide, we found that all the environmental properties change with time since glaciers retreated, and that temperature modulates the accumulation of soil nutrients. The richness of bacteria, fungi, plants and animals increases with time since deglaciation, but their temporal patterns differ. Microorganisms colonized most rapidly in the first decades after glacier retreat, whereas most macroorganisms took longer. Increased habitat suitability, growing complexity of biotic interactions and temporal colonization all contribute to the increase in biodiversity over time. These processes also modify community composition for all the groups of organisms. Plant communities show positive links with all other biodiversity components and have a key role in ecosystem development. These unifying patterns provide new insights into the early dynamics of deglaciated terrains and highlight the need for integrated surveillance of their multiple environmental properties5. Across 46 proglacial landscapes worldwide, environmental properties and biodiversity have shown complex patterns of change since glaciers retreated.",

    "abstract": "For over a century, fasting regimens have improved health, lifespan and tissue regeneration in diverse organisms, including humans1–6. However, how fasting and post-fast refeeding affect adult stem cells and tumour formation has yet to be explored in depth. Here we demonstrate that post-fast refeeding increases intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and tumour formation; post-fast refeeding augments the regenerative capacity of Lgr5+ ISCs, and loss of the tumour suppressor gene Apc in post-fast-refed ISCs leads to a higher tumour incidence in the small intestine and colon than in the fasted or ad libitum-fed states, demonstrating that post-fast refeeding is a distinct state. Mechanistically, we discovered that robust mTORC1 induction in post-fast-refed ISCs increases protein synthesis via polyamine metabolism to drive these changes, as inhibition of mTORC1, polyamine metabolite production or protein synthesis abrogates the regenerative or tumorigenic effects of post-fast refeeding. Given our findings, fast–refeeding cycles must be carefully considered and tested when planning diet-based strategies for regeneration without increasing cancer risk, as post-fast refeeding leads to a burst in stem-cell-driven regeneration and tumorigenicity. Post-fast refeeding increases intestinal stem cell function and tumour formation by augmenting protein synthesis via polyamine metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Superconductivity involving finite-momentum pairing1 can lead to spatial-gap and pair-density modulations, as well as Bogoliubov Fermi states within the superconducting gap. However, the experimental realization of their intertwined relations has been challenging. Here we detect chiral kagome superconductivity modulations with residual Fermi arcs in KV3Sb5 and CsV3Sb5 using normal and Josephson scanning tunnelling microscopy down to 30 millikelvin with a resolved electronic energy difference at the microelectronvolt level. We observe a U-shaped superconducting gap with flat residual in-gap states. This gap shows chiral 2a × 2a spatial modulations with magnetic-field-tunable chirality, which align with the chiral 2a × 2a pair-density modulations observed through Josephson tunnelling. These findings demonstrate a chiral pair density wave (PDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Quasiparticle interference imaging of the in-gap zero-energy states reveals segmented arcs, with high-temperature data linking them to parts of the reconstructed vanadium d-orbital states within the charge order. The detected residual Fermi arcs can be explained by the partial suppression of these d-orbital states through an interorbital 2a × 2a PDW and thus serve as candidate Bogoliubov Fermi states. In addition, we differentiate the observed PDW order from impurity-induced gap modulations. Our observations not only uncover a chiral PDW order with orbital selectivity but also show the fundamental space–momentum correspondence inherent in finite-momentum-paired superconductivity. Using normal and Josephson scanning tunnelling microscopy, chiral kagome superconductivity modulations with corresponding residual Fermi arcs are detected in KV3Sb5 and CsV3Sb5.",

    "abstract": "Monoatomic-layered carbon materials, such as graphene1 and amorphous monolayer carbon2,3, have stimulated intense fundamental and applied research owing to their unprecedented physical properties and a wide range of promising applications4,5. So far, such materials have mainly been produced by chemical vapour deposition, which typically requires stringent reaction conditions compared to solution-phase synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate the solution preparation of free-standing nitrogen-doped amorphous monolayer carbon with mixed five-, six- and seven-membered (5-6-7-membered) rings through the polymerization of pyrrole within the confined interlayer cavity of a removable layered-double-hydroxide template. Structural characterizations and first-principles calculations suggest that the nitrogen-doped amorphous monolayer carbon was formed by radical polymerization of pyrrole at the α, β and N sites subjected to confinement of the reaction space, which enables bond rearrangements through the Stone–Wales transformation. The spatial confinement inhibits the C–C bond rotation and chain entanglement during polymerization, resulting in an atom-thick continuous amorphous layer with an in-plane π-conjugation electronic structure. The spatially confined radical polymerization using solid templates and ion exchange strategy demonstrates potential as a universal synthesis approach for obtaining two-dimensional covalent networks, as exemplified by the successful synthesis of monolayers of polythiophene and polycarbazole. Free-standing nitrogen-doped amorphous monolayer carbon consisting of mixed five-, six- and seven-membered rings was prepared through the polymerization of pyrrole within the confined interlayer cavity of a removable layered-double-hydroxide template.",

    "abstract": "Natural disasters trigger complex chains of events within human societies1. Immediate deaths and damage are directly observed after a disaster and are widely studied, but delayed downstream outcomes, indirectly caused by the disaster, are difficult to trace back to the initial event1,2. Tropical cyclones (TCs)—that is, hurricanes and tropical storms—are widespread globally and have lasting economic impacts3–5, but their full health impact remains unknown. Here we conduct a large-scale evaluation of long-term effects of TCs on human mortality in the contiguous United States (CONUS) for all TCs between 1930 and 2015. We observe a robust increase in excess mortality that persists for 15 years after each geophysical event. We estimate that the average TC generates 7,000–11,000 excess deaths, exceeding the average of 24 immediate deaths reported in government statistics6,7. Tracking the effects of 501 historical storms, we compute that the TC climate of CONUS imposes an undocumented mortality burden that explains a substantial fraction of the higher mortality rates along the Atlantic coast and is equal to roughly 3.2–5.1% of all deaths. These findings suggest that the TC climate, previously thought to be unimportant for broader public health outcomes, is a meaningful underlying driver for the distribution of mortality risk in CONUS, especially among infants (less than 1 year of age), people 1–44 years of age, and the Black population. Understanding why TCs induce this excess mortality is likely to yield substantial health benefits. A large-scale evaluation of the long-term effects of tropical cyclones on human mortality in the contiguous United States estimates that the average tropical cyclone results in 7,000–11,000 excess deaths, far exceeding previous estimates.",

    "abstract": "Oil has long been the dominant feedstock for producing fuels and chemicals, but coal, natural gas and biomass are increasingly explored alternatives1–3. Their conversion first generates syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, which is then processed further using Fischer–Tropsch (FT) chemistry. However, although commercial FT technology for fuel production is established, using it to access valuable chemicals remains challenging. A case in point is linear α-olefins (LAOs), which are important chemical intermediates obtained by ethylene oligomerization at present4–8. The commercial high-temperature FT process and the FT-to-olefin process under development at present both convert syngas directly to LAOs, but also generate much CO2 waste that leads to a low carbon utilization efficiency9–14. The efficiency is further compromised by substantially fewer of the converted carbon atoms ending up as valuable C5–C10 LAOs than are found in the C2–C4 olefins that dominate the product mixtures9–14. Here we show that the use of the original phase-pure χ-iron carbide can minimize these syngas conversion problems: tailored and optimized for the process of FT to LAOs, this catalyst exhibits an activity at 290 °C that is 1–2 orders higher than dedicated FT-to-olefin catalysts can achieve above 320 °C (refs. 12–15), is stable for 200 h, and produces desired C2–C10 LAOs and unwanted CO2 with carbon-based selectivities of 51% and 9% under industrially relevant conditions. This higher catalytic performance, persisting over a wide temperature range (250–320 °C), demonstrates the potential of the system for developing a practically relevant technology. When used in its phase-pure form, iron carbide catalyses the conversion of syngas to linear α-olefins with high activity and selectivity under industrially relevant conditions.",

    "abstract": "T cells develop from circulating precursor cells, which enter the thymus and migrate through specialized subcompartments that support their maturation and selection1. In humans, this process starts in early fetal development and is highly active until thymic involution in adolescence. To map the microanatomical underpinnings of this process in pre- and early postnatal stages, we established a quantitative morphological framework for the thymus—the Cortico-Medullary Axis—and used it to perform a spatially resolved analysis. Here, by applying this framework to a curated multimodal single-cell atlas, spatial transcriptomics and high-resolution multiplex imaging data, we demonstrate establishment of the lobular cytokine network, canonical thymocyte trajectories and thymic epithelial cell distributions by the beginning of the the second trimester of fetal development. We pinpoint tissue niches of thymic epithelial cell progenitors and distinct subtypes associated with Hassall’s corpuscles and identify divergence in the timing of medullary entry between CD4 and CD8 T cell lineages. These findings provide a basis for a detailed understanding of T lymphocyte development and are complemented with a holistic toolkit for cross-platform imaging data analysis, annotation and OrganAxis construction (TissueTag), which can be applied to any tissue. A quantitative morphological framework for the human thymus reveals the establishment of the lobular cytokine network, canonical thymocyte trajectories and thymic epithelial cell distributions in fetal and paediatric thymic development.",

    "abstract": "Wheat is the second largest food crop with a very good breeding system and pedigree record in China. Investigating the genomic footprints of wheat cultivars will unveil potential avenues for future breeding efforts1,2. Here we report chromosome-level genome assemblies of 17 wheat cultivars that chronicle the breeding history of China. Comparative genomic analysis uncovered a wealth of structural rearrangements, identifying 249,976 structural variations with 49.03% (122,567) longer than 5 kb. Cultivars developed in 1980s displayed significant accumulations of structural variations, a pattern linked to the extensive incorporation of European and American varieties into breeding programmes of that era. We further proved that structural variations in the centromere-proximal regions are associated with a reduction of crossover events. We showed that common wheat evolved from spring to winter types via mutations and duplications of the VRN-A1 gene as an adaptation strategy to a changing environment. We confirmed shifts in wheat cultivars linked to dietary preferences, migration and cultural integration in Northwest China. We identified large presence or absence variations of pSc200 tandem repeats on the 1RS terminal, suggesting its own rapid evolution in the wheat genome. The high-quality genome assemblies of 17 representatives developed and their good complementarity to the 10+ pan-genomes offer a robust platform for future genomics-assisted breeding in wheat. The pan-genome of 17 wheat cultivars grown in China is explored, providing insights into the breeding history of wheat in East Asia.",

    "abstract": "Nanoscale detection and control of the magnetic order underpins a spectrum of condensed-matter research and device functionalities involving magnetism. The key principle involved is the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, which in ferromagnets is generated by an internal magnetization. However, the presence of a net magnetization limits device scalability and compatibility with phases, such as superconductors and topological insulators. Recently, altermagnetism has been proposed as a solution to these restrictions, as it shares the enabling time-reversal-symmetry-breaking characteristic of ferromagnetism, combined with the antiferromagnetic-like vanishing net magnetization1–4. So far, altermagnetic ordering has been inferred from spatially averaged probes4–19. Here we demonstrate nanoscale imaging of altermagnetic states from 100-nanometre-scale vortices and domain walls to 10-micrometre-scale single-domain states in manganese telluride (MnTe)2,7,9,14–16,18,20,21. We combine the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking sensitivity of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism12 with magnetic linear dichroism and photoemission electron microscopy to achieve maps of the local altermagnetic ordering vector. A variety of spin configurations are imposed using microstructure patterning and thermal cycling in magnetic fields. The demonstrated detection and controlled formation of altermagnetic spin configurations paves the way for future experimental studies across the theoretically predicted research landscape of altermagnetism, including unconventional spin-polarization phenomena, the interplay of altermagnetism with superconducting and topological phases, and highly scalable digital and neuromorphic spintronic devices3,14,22–24. Nanoscale imaging and control of altermagnetism in manganese telluride is achieved, paving the way for the experimental realization of the theoretically predicted field of altermagnetism.",

    "abstract": "The microbiota colonizes each barrier site and broadly controls host physiology1. However, when uncontrolled, microbial colonists can also promote inflammation and induce systemic infection2. The unique strategies used at each barrier tissue to control the coexistence of the host with its microbiota remain largely elusive. Here we uncover that, in the skin, host–microbiota symbiosis depends on the ability of the skin to act as an autonomous lymphoid organ. Notably, an encounter with a new skin commensal promotes two parallel responses, both under the control of Langerhans cells. On one hand, skin commensals induce the formation of classical germinal centres in the lymph node associated with immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG3 antibody responses. On the other hand, microbial colonization also leads to the development of tertiary lymphoid organs in the skin that can locally sustain IgG2b and IgG2c responses. These phenomena are supported by the ability of regulatory T cells to convert into T follicular helper cells. Skin autonomous production of antibodies is sufficient to control local microbial biomass, as well as subsequent systemic infection with the same microorganism. Collectively, these results reveal a compartmentalization of humoral responses to the microbiota allowing for control of both microbial symbiosis and potential pathogenesis. A study reveals that the skin acts as an autonomous lymphoid organ, producing antibodies to control the local biomass of the microbiota and protect against systemic infection, maintaining homeostasis between the host and its microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Pre-eclampsia is a placental disorder that affects 3–5% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity worldwide1,2. With no drug available to slow disease progression, engineering ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for extrahepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery to the placenta is an attractive therapeutic option for pre-eclampsia. Here we use high-throughput screening to evaluate a library of 98 LNP formulations in vivo and identify a placenta-tropic LNP (LNP 55) that mediates more than 100-fold greater mRNA delivery to the placenta in pregnant mice than a formulation based on the Food and Drug Administration-approved Onpattro LNP (DLin-MC3-DMA)3. We propose an endogenous targeting mechanism based on β2-glycoprotein I adsorption that enables LNP delivery to the placenta. In both inflammation- and hypoxia-induced models of pre-eclampsia, a single administration of LNP 55 encapsulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA resolves maternal hypertension until the end of gestation. In addition, with our VEGF mRNA LNP 55 therapeutic, we demonstrate improvements in fetal health and partially restore placental vasculature, the local and systemic immune landscape and serum levels of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, a clinical biomarker of pre-eclampsia1. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of this mRNA LNP platform for treating placental disorders such as pre-eclampsia. A platform for mRNA lipid nanoparticle delivery to the placenta to treat pre-eclampsia is shown to improve fetal and maternal health in mice and has potential clinical applications in obstetric disorders and women’s health.",

    "abstract": "Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare heterogenous disorder of the peripheral nervous system, which is usually triggered by a preceding infection, and causes a potentially life-threatening progressive muscle weakness1. Although GBS is considered an autoimmune disease, the mechanisms that underlie its distinct clinical subtypes remain largely unknown. Here, by combining in vitro T cell screening, single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, we identify autoreactive memory CD4+ cells, that show a cytotoxic T helper 1 (TH1)-like phenotype, and rare CD8+ T cells that target myelin antigens of the peripheral nerves in patients with the demyelinating disease variant. We characterized more than 1,000 autoreactive single T cell clones, which revealed a polyclonal TCR repertoire, short CDR3β lengths, preferential HLA-DR restrictions and recognition of immunodominant epitopes. We found that autoreactive TCRβ clonotypes were expanded in the blood of the same patient at distinct disease stages and, notably, that they were shared in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid across different patients with GBS, but not in control individuals. Finally, we identified myelin-reactive T cells in the nerve biopsy from one patient, which indicates that these cells contribute directly to disease pathophysiology. Collectively, our data provide clear evidence of autoreactive T cell immunity in a subset of patients with GBS, and open new perspectives in the field of inflammatory peripheral neuropathies, with potential impact for biomedical applications. Autoreactive T cells that target myelin antigens in the peripheral nerves are present in patients with the demyelinating form of Guillain–Barré syndrome, and these T cells are likely to contribute to disease pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Controlled charge flows are fundamental to many areas of science and technology, serving as carriers of energy and information, as probes of material properties and dynamics1 and as a means of revealing2,3 or even inducing4,5 broken symmetries. Emerging methods for light-based current control5–16 offer particularly promising routes beyond the speed and adaptability limitations of conventional voltage-driven systems. However, optical generation and manipulation of currents at nanometre spatial scales remains a basic challenge and a crucial step towards scalable optoelectronic systems for microelectronics and information science. Here we introduce vectorial optoelectronic metasurfaces in which ultrafast light pulses induce local directional charge flows around symmetry-broken plasmonic nanostructures, with tunable responses and arbitrary patterning down to subdiffractive nanometre scales. Local symmetries and vectorial currents are revealed by polarization-dependent and wavelength-sensitive electrical readout and terahertz (THz) emission, whereas spatially tailored global currents are demonstrated in the direct generation of elusive broadband THz vector beams17. We show that, in graphene, a detailed interplay between electrodynamic, thermodynamic and hydrodynamic degrees of freedom gives rise to rapidly evolving nanoscale driving forces and charge flows under the extremely spatially and temporally localized excitation. These results set the stage for versatile patterning and optical control over nanoscale currents in materials diagnostics, THz spectroscopies, nanomagnetism and ultrafast information processing. Vectorial optoelectronic metasurfaces are described, showing that light pulses can be used to drive and direct local charge flows around symmetry-broken plasmonic nanostructures, leading to tunable responses in terahertz emission.",

    "abstract": "Optical frequency combs have revolutionized precision measurement, time-keeping and molecular spectroscopy1–7. A substantial effort has developed around ‘microcombs’: integrating comb-generating technologies into compact photonic platforms5,7–9. Current approaches for generating these microcombs involve either the electro-optic10 or Kerr mechanisms11. Despite rapid progress, maintaining high efficiency and wide bandwidth remains challenging. Here we introduce a previously unknown class of microcomb—an integrated device that combines electro-optics and parametric amplification to yield a frequency-modulated optical parametric oscillator (FM-OPO). In contrast to the other solutions, it does not form pulses but maintains operational simplicity and highly efficient pump power use with an output resembling a frequency-modulated laser12. We outline the working principles of our device and demonstrate it by fabricating the complete optical system in thin-film lithium niobate. We measure pump-to-comb internal conversion efficiency exceeding 93% (34% out-coupled) over a nearly flat-top spectral distribution spanning about 200 modes (over 1 THz). Compared with an electro-optic comb, the cavity dispersion rather than loss determines the FM-OPO bandwidth, enabling broadband combs with a smaller radio-frequency modulation power. The FM-OPO microcomb offers robust operational dynamics, high efficiency and broad bandwidth, promising compact precision tools for metrology, spectroscopy, telecommunications, sensing and computing. An integrated device that combines optical parametric oscillation and electro-optic modulation in lithium niobate creates a flat-top frequency-comb-like output with low power requirements.",

    "abstract": "Overnight fires are emerging in North America with previously unknown drivers and implications. This notable phenomenon challenges the traditional understanding of the ‘active day, quiet night’ model of the diurnal fire cycle1–3 and current fire management practices4,5. Here we demonstrate that drought conditions promote overnight burning, which is a key mechanism fostering large active fires. We examined the hourly diurnal cycle of 23,557 fires and identified 1,095 overnight burning events (OBEs, each defined as a night when a fire burned through the night) in North America during 2017–2020 using geostationary satellite data and terrestrial fire records. A total of 99% of OBEs were associated with large fires (>1,000 ha) and at least one OBE was identified in 20% of these large fires. OBEs were early onset after ignition and OBE frequency was positively correlated with fire size. Although warming is weakening the climatological barrier to night-time fires6, we found that the main driver of recent OBEs in large fires was the accumulated fuel dryness and availability (that is, drought conditions), which tended to lead to consecutive OBEs in a single wildfire for several days and even weeks. Critically, we show that daytime drought indicators can predict whether an OBE will occur the following night, which could facilitate early detection and management of night-time fires. We also observed increases in fire weather conditions conducive to OBEs over recent decades, suggesting an accelerated disruption of the diurnal fire cycle. By examining the hourly diurnal cycle of 23,557 fires in North America during 2017–2020, 1,095 overnight burning events were identified, mostly associated with extreme fires and driven by long-term drought conditions.",

    "abstract": "The historical association of time with the rotation of Earth has meant that Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) closely follows this rotation1. Because the rotation rate is not constant, UTC contains discontinuities (leap seconds), which complicates its use in computer networks2. Since 1972, all UTC discontinuities have required that a leap second be added3. Here we show that increased melting of ice in Greenland and Antarctica, measured by satellite gravity4,5, has decreased the angular velocity of Earth more rapidly than before. Removing this effect from the observed angular velocity shows that since 1972, the angular velocity of the liquid core of Earth has been decreasing at a constant rate that has steadily increased the angular velocity of the rest of the Earth. Extrapolating the trends for the core and other relevant phenomena to predict future Earth orientation shows that UTC as now defined will require a negative discontinuity by 2029. This will pose an unprecedented problem for computer network timing and may require changes in UTC to be made earlier than is planned. If polar ice melting had not recently accelerated, this problem would occur 3 years earlier: global warming is already affecting global timekeeping. Increased melting of ice in Greenland and Antarctica, measured by satellite gravity, has decreased the angular velocity of Earth more rapidly than before and has already affected global timekeeping.",

    "abstract": "Whereas oncogenes can potentially be inhibited with small molecules, the loss of tumour suppressors is more common and is problematic because the tumour-suppressor proteins are no longer present to be targeted. Notable examples include SMARCB1-mutant cancers, which are highly lethal malignancies driven by the inactivation of a subunit of SWI/SNF (also known as BAF) chromatin-remodelling complexes. Here, to generate mechanistic insights into the consequences of SMARCB1 mutation and to identify vulnerabilities, we contributed 14 SMARCB1-mutant cell lines to a near genome-wide CRISPR screen as part of the Cancer Dependency Map Project1–3. We report that the little-studied gene DDB1–CUL4-associated factor 5 (DCAF5) is required for the survival of SMARCB1-mutant cancers. We show that DCAF5 has a quality-control function for SWI/SNF complexes and promotes the degradation of incompletely assembled SWI/SNF complexes in the absence of SMARCB1. After depletion of DCAF5, SMARCB1-deficient SWI/SNF complexes reaccumulate, bind to target loci and restore SWI/SNF-mediated gene expression to levels that are sufficient to reverse the cancer state, including in vivo. Consequently, cancer results not from the loss of SMARCB1 function per se, but rather from DCAF5-mediated degradation of SWI/SNF complexes. These data indicate that therapeutic targeting of ubiquitin-mediated quality-control factors may effectively reverse the malignant state of some cancers driven by disruption of tumour suppressor complexes. DCAF5 has a quality-control function for SWI/SNF complexes and promotes the degradation of incompletely assembled SWI/SNF complexes in the absence of SMARCB1.",

Developing analogous catalytic systems for remote C–H functionalization remains a significant challenge3–5. Here, we report the development of Cu(I)-catalysed bimodal dehydrogenation/lactonization reactions of synthetically common N-methoxyamides through radical abstractions of the γ-aliphatic C–H bonds. The feasibility of switching from dehydrogenation to lactonization is also demonstrated by altering reaction conditions. The use of a readily available amide as both radical precursor and internal oxidant allows for the development of redox-neutral C–H functionalization reactions with methanol as the sole side product. These C–H functionalization reactions using a Cu(I) catalyst with loading as low as 0.5 mol.% is applied to the diversification of a wide range of aliphatic acids including drug molecules and natural products. The exceptional compatibility of this catalytic system with a wide range of oxidatively sensitive functionality demonstrates the unique advantage of using a simple amide substrate as a mild internal oxidant. Use of N-methoxyamides as oxidants enables controllable, redox-neutral, green catalysis of bimodal dehydrogenation/lactonization reactions with methanol as the only by-product.",

    "abstract": "The pursuit of materials with enhanced functionality has led to the emergence of metamaterials—artificially engineered materials whose properties are determined by their structure rather than composition. Traditionally, the building blocks of metamaterials are arranged in fixed positions within a lattice structure1–19. However, recent research has revealed the potential of mixing disconnected building blocks in a fluidic medium20–27. Inspired by these recent advances, here we show that by mixing highly deformable spherical capsules into an incompressible fluid, we can realize a ‘metafluid’ with programmable compressibility, optical behaviour and viscosity. First, we experimentally and numerically demonstrate that the buckling of the shells endows the fluid with a highly nonlinear behaviour. Subsequently, we harness this behaviour to develop smart robotic systems, highly tunable logic gates and optical elements with switchable characteristics. Finally, we demonstrate that the collapse of the shells upon buckling leads to a large increase in the suspension viscosity in the laminar regime. As such, the proposed metafluid provides a promising platform for enhancing the functionality of existing fluidic devices by expanding the capabilities of the fluid itself. A metafluid with programmable compressibility, optical behaviour and viscosity is realized by mixing deformable spherical shells that undergo buckling within an incompressible fluid; the versatility of these metafluids opens up numerous opportunities for functionality.",

The γδ T cell receptor (TCR), which is generated by γδ T cells, recognizes a diverse range of antigens independently of the major histocompatibility complex2. The γδ TCR associates with CD3 subunits, initiating T cell activation and holding great potential in immunotherapy4. Here we report the structures of two prototypical human Vγ9Vδ2 and Vγ5Vδ1 TCR–CD3 complexes5,6, revealing two distinct assembly mechanisms that depend on Vγ usage. The Vγ9Vδ2 TCR–CD3 complex is monomeric, with considerable conformational flexibility in the TCRγ–TCRδ extracellular domain and connecting peptides. The length of the connecting peptides regulates the ligand association and T cell activation. A cholesterol-like molecule wedges into the transmembrane region, exerting an inhibitory role in TCR signalling. The Vγ5Vδ1 TCR–CD3 complex displays a dimeric architecture, whereby two protomers nestle back to back through the Vγ5 domains of the TCR extracellular domains. Our biochemical and biophysical assays further corroborate the dimeric structure. Importantly, the dimeric form of the Vγ5Vδ1 TCR is essential for T cell activation. These findings reveal organizing principles of the γδ TCR–CD3 complex, providing insights into the unique properties of γδ TCR and facilitating immunotherapeutic interventions. The assembly of the γδ TCR depends on Vγ usage.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex is composed of neuronal types with diverse gene expression that are organized into specialized cortical areas. These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture1,2, connectivity3,4 and neuronal activity5,6, are wired into modular networks3,4,7. However, it remains unclear whether these spatial organizations are reflected in neuronal transcriptomic signatures and how such signatures are established in development. Here we used BARseq, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 104 cell-type marker genes in 10.3 million cells, including 4,194,658 cortical neurons over nine mouse forebrain hemispheres, at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types consistent with previous single-cell RNA sequencing studies8,9. The composition of transcriptomic types is highly predictive of cortical area identity. Moreover, areas with similar compositions of transcriptomic types, which we defined as cortical modules, overlap with areas that are highly connected, suggesting that the same modular organization is reflected in both transcriptomic signatures and connectivity. To explore how the transcriptomic profiles of cortical neurons depend on development, we assessed cell-type distributions after neonatal binocular enucleation. Notably, binocular enucleation caused the shifting of the cell-type compositional profiles of visual areas towards neighbouring cortical areas within the same module, suggesting that peripheral inputs sharpen the distinct transcriptomic identities of areas within cortical modules. Enabled by the high throughput, low cost and reproducibility of BARseq, our study provides a proof of principle for the use of large-scale in situ sequencing to both reveal brain-wide molecular architecture and understand its development. BARseq interrogates the expression of 104 cell-type marker genes in 10.3 million cells over nine mouse forebrain hemispheres to reveal the role of peripheral inputs on cortical area development.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and superexchange spin interactions1–8. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices, itinerant spin polarons—bound states of a dopant and a spin flip—have been theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling9–14. Despite their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin polarons in a triangular-lattice Hubbard system realized with ultracold atoms, revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect15,16. We study the evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated systems10,11. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related phenomena in triangular-lattice moiré materials17–20. A triangular-lattice Hubbard system realized with ultracold atoms is used to directly image spin polarons, revealing ferromagnetic correlations around a charge dopant, a manifestation of the Nagaoka effect.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins play a pivotal role in plant immunity by recognizing pathogen effectors1,2. Maintaining a balanced immune response is crucial, as excessive NLR expression can lead to unintended autoimmunity3,4. Unlike most NLRs, the plant NLR required for cell death 2 (NRC2) belongs to a small NLR group characterized by constitutively high expression without self-activation5. The mechanisms underlying NRC2 autoinhibition and activation are not yet understood. Here we show that Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) NRC2 (SlNRC2) forms dimers and tetramers and higher-order oligomers at elevated concentrations. Cryo-electron microscopy shows an inactive conformation of SlNRC2 in these oligomers. Dimerization and oligomerization not only stabilize the inactive state but also sequester SlNRC2 from assembling into an active form. Mutations at the dimeric or interdimeric interfaces enhance pathogen-induced cell death and immunity in Nicotiana benthamiana. The cryo-electron microscopy structures unexpectedly show inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) or pentakisphosphate (IP5) bound to the inner surface of the C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain of SlNRC2, as confirmed by mass spectrometry. Mutations at the inositol phosphate-binding site impair inositol phosphate binding of SlNRC2 and pathogen-induced SlNRC2-mediated cell death in N. benthamiana. Our study indicates a negative regulatory mechanism of NLR activation and suggests inositol phosphates as cofactors of NRCs. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals that the tomato immune receptor NRC2 forms oligomers to stabilize its inactive state and sequester it from activation, with inositol phosphates acting as immunoregulatory cofactors.",

    "abstract": "Memories benefit from sleep1, and the reactivation and replay of waking experiences during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are considered to be crucial for this process2. However, little is known about how these patterns are impacted by sleep loss. Here we recorded CA1 neuronal activity over 12 h in rats across maze exploration, sleep and sleep deprivation, followed by recovery sleep. We found that SWRs showed sustained or higher rates during sleep deprivation but with lower power and higher frequency ripples. Pyramidal cells exhibited sustained firing during sleep deprivation and reduced firing during sleep, yet their firing rates were comparable during SWRs regardless of sleep state. Despite the robust firing and abundance of SWRs during sleep deprivation, we found that the reactivation and replay of neuronal firing patterns was diminished during these periods and, in some cases, completely abolished compared to ad libitum sleep. Reactivation partially rebounded after recovery sleep but failed to reach the levels found in natural sleep. These results delineate the adverse consequences of sleep loss on hippocampal function at the network level and reveal a dissociation between the many SWRs elicited during sleep deprivation and the few reactivations and replays that occur during these events. A study of neuronal activity in rats finds that sleep loss adversely affects hippocampal function and memory by dissociating hippocampal sharp-wave ripples from memory replay and reactivation events.",

    "abstract": "Broken time-reversal symmetry in the absence of spin order indicates the presence of unusual phases such as orbital magnetism and loop currents1–4. The recently discovered kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (where A is K, Rb or Cs)5,6 display an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) state and have emerged as a strong candidate for materials hosting a loop current phase. The idea that the CDW breaks time-reversal symmetry7–14 is, however, being intensely debated due to conflicting experimental data15–17. Here we use laser-coupled scanning tunnelling microscopy to study RbV3Sb5. By applying linearly polarized light along high-symmetry directions, we show that the relative intensities of the CDW peaks can be reversibly switched, implying a substantial electro-striction response, indicative of strong nonlinear electron–phonon coupling. A similar CDW intensity switching is observed with perpendicular magnetic fields, which implies an unusual piezo-magnetic response that, in turn, requires time-reversal symmetry breaking. We show that the simplest CDW that satisfies these constraints is an out-of-phase combination of bond charge order and loop currents that we dub a congruent CDW flux phase. Our laser scanning tunnelling microscopy data open the door to the possibility of dynamic optical control of complex quantum phenomenon in correlated materials. The charge-density-wave state in RbV3Sb5 can be optically manipulated by applying linearly polarized light along high-symmetry directions, which demonstrates the potential of light as a control knob to manipulate complex quantum phenomena in correlated materials.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation that influences gene expression and splicing is a key source of phenotypic diversity1–5. Although invaluable, studies investigating these links in humans have been strongly biased towards participants of European ancestries, which constrains generalizability and hinders evolutionary research. Here to address these limitations, we developed MAGE, an open-access RNA sequencing dataset of lymphoblastoid cell lines from 731 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project6, spread across 5 continental groups and 26 populations. Most variation in gene expression (92%) and splicing (95%) was distributed within versus between populations, which mirrored the variation in DNA sequence. We mapped associations between genetic variants and expression and splicing of nearby genes (cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and cis-splicing QTLs (sQTLs), respectively). We identified more than 15,000 putatively causal eQTLs and more than 16,000 putatively causal sQTLs that are enriched for relevant epigenomic signatures. These include 1,310 eQTLs and 1,657 sQTLs that are largely private to underrepresented populations. Our data further indicate that the magnitude and direction of causal eQTL effects are highly consistent across populations. Moreover, the apparent ‘population-specific’ effects observed in previous studies were largely driven by low resolution or additional independent eQTLs of the same genes that were not detected. Together, our study expands our understanding of human gene expression diversity and provides an inclusive resource for studying the evolution and function of human genomes. A new open-access RNA sequencing dataset, MAGE, of 731 individuals across geographically diverse human populations provides a valuable resource to study genetic diversity and evolution and expands the capacity to identify new genetic associations.",

    "abstract": "Gene replacement using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors is a promising therapeutic approach for many diseases1,2. However, this therapeutic modality is challenged by the packaging capacity of AAVs (approximately 4.7 kilobases)3, limiting its application for disorders involving large coding sequences, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with a 14 kilobase messenger RNA. Here we developed a new method for expressing large dystrophins by utilizing the protein trans-splicing mechanism mediated by split inteins. We identified several split intein pairs that efficiently join two or three fragments to generate a large midi-dystrophin or the full-length protein. We show that delivery of two or three AAVs into dystrophic mice results in robust expression of large dystrophins and significant physiological improvements compared with micro-dystrophins. Moreover, using the potent myotropic AAVMYO4, we demonstrate that low total doses (2 × 1013 viral genomes per kg) are sufficient to express large dystrophins in striated muscles body-wide with significant physiological corrections in dystrophic mice. Our data show a clear functional superiority of large dystrophins over micro-dystrophins that are being tested in clinical trials. This method could benefit many patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy, regardless of genotype, and could be adapted to numerous other disorders caused by mutations in large genes that exceed the AAV capacity. A method is developed for expressing large dystrophins to enhance muscle function in mouse models of muscular dystrophy, with potential clinical benefits for numerous disorders caused by mutations in large genes that exceed the adeno-associated virus capacity.",

    "abstract": "Mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia between 2016 and 2024 was driven by high sea surface temperatures (SST)1. The likelihood of temperature-induced bleaching is a key determinant for the future threat status of the GBR2, but the long-term context of recent temperatures in the region is unclear. Here we show that the January–March Coral Sea heat extremes in 2024, 2017 and 2020 (in order of descending mean SST anomalies) were the warmest in 400 years, exceeding the 95th-percentile uncertainty limit of our reconstructed pre-1900 maximum. The 2016, 2004 and 2022 events were the next warmest, exceeding the 90th-percentile limit. Climate model analysis confirms that human influence on the climate system is responsible for the rapid warming in recent decades. This attribution, together with the recent ocean temperature extremes, post-1900 warming trend and observed mass coral bleaching, shows that the existential threat to the GBR ecosystem from anthropogenic climate change is now realized. Without urgent intervention, the iconic GBR is at risk of experiencing temperatures conducive to near-annual coral bleaching3, with negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems services. A continuation on the current trajectory would further threaten the ecological function4 and outstanding universal value5 of one of Earth’s greatest natural wonders. High ocean temperatures that caused mass coral bleaching and mortality on the Great Barrier Reef in the past decade are the warmest in 400 years and are the result of human-caused climate change.",

    "abstract": "Humans have the remarkable cognitive capacity to rapidly adapt to changing environments. Central to this capacity is the ability to form high-level, abstract representations that take advantage of regularities in the world to support generalization1. However, little is known about how these representations are encoded in populations of neurons, how they emerge through learning and how they relate to behaviour2,3. Here we characterized the representational geometry of populations of neurons (single units) recorded in the hippocampus, amygdala, medial frontal cortex and ventral temporal cortex of neurosurgical patients performing an inferential reasoning task. We found that only the neural representations formed in the hippocampus simultaneously encode several task variables in an abstract, or disentangled, format. This representational geometry is uniquely observed after patients learn to perform inference, and consists of disentangled directly observable and discovered latent task variables. Learning to perform inference by trial and error or through verbal instructions led to the formation of hippocampal representations with similar geometric properties. The observed relation between representational format and inference behaviour suggests that abstract and disentangled representational geometries are important for complex cognition. A task in which participants learned to perform inference led to the formation of hippocampal representations whose geometric properties reflected the latent structure of the task, indicating that abstract or disentangled neural representations are important for complex cognition.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of neutrophil activation is critical for disease control. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are web-like structures composed of DNA and neutrophil-derived proteins, are formed following pro-inflammatory signals; however, if this process is uncontrolled, NETs contribute to disease pathogenesis, exacerbating inflammation and host tissue damage1,2. Here we show that myeloid inhibitory C-type lectin-like (MICL), an inhibitory C-type lectin receptor, directly recognizes DNA in NETs; this interaction is vital to regulate neutrophil activation. Loss or inhibition of MICL functionality leads to uncontrolled NET formation through the ROS–PAD4 pathway and the development of an auto-inflammatory feedback loop. We show that in the context of rheumatoid arthritis, such dysregulation leads to exacerbated pathology in both mouse models and in human patients, where autoantibodies to MICL inhibit key functions of this receptor. Of note, we also detect similarly inhibitory anti-MICL autoantibodies in patients with other diseases linked to aberrant NET formation, including lupus and severe COVID-19. By contrast, dysregulation of NET release is protective during systemic infection with the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Together, we show that the recognition of NETs by MICL represents a fundamental autoregulatory pathway that controls neutrophil activity and NET formation. How MICL recognizes and autoregulates the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps is explored in mouse models and human patients where disease severity is associated with aberrant neutrophil extracellular trap formation.",

Targeted multisensory engagement of these afferent units, however, faces persistent challenges, especially for wearable, programmable systems that need to operate adaptively across the body8–11. Here we present a miniaturized electromechanical structure that, when combined with skin as an elastic, energy-storing element, supports bistable, self-sensing modes of deformation. Targeting specific classes of mechanoreceptors as the basis for distinct, programmed sensory responses, this haptic unit can deliver both dynamic and static stimuli, directed as either normal or shear forces. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies establish foundational principles and practical criteria for low-energy operation across natural anatomical variations in the mechanical properties of human skin. A wireless, skin-conformable haptic interface, integrating an array of these bistable transducers, serves as a high-density channel capable of rendering input from smartphone-based 3D scanning and inertial sensors. Demonstrations of this system include sensory substitution designed to improve the quality of life for patients with visual and proprioceptive impairments. Inspired by the art of kirigami, a haptic device based on a miniaturized electromechanical structure combined with skin as an elastic, energy-storing element demonstrates bioelastic state recovery and can be used in sensory substitution.",

    "abstract": "Increasing extreme climatic events threaten the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems1,2. Because soil microbes govern key biogeochemical processes, understanding their response to climate extremes is crucial in predicting the consequences for ecosystem functioning3,4. Here we subjected soils from 30 grasslands across Europe to four contrasting extreme climatic events under common controlled conditions (drought, flood, freezing and heat), and compared the response of soil microbial communities and their functioning with those of undisturbed soils. Soil microbiomes exhibited a small, but highly consistent and phylogenetically conserved, response under the imposed extreme events. Heat treatment most strongly impacted soil microbiomes, enhancing dormancy and sporulation genes and decreasing metabolic versatility. Microbiome response to heat in particular could be predicted by local climatic conditions and soil properties, with soils that do not normally experience the extreme conditions being imposed being most vulnerable. Our results suggest that soil microbiomes from different climates share unified responses to extreme climatic events, but that predicting the extent of community change may require knowledge of the local microbiome. These findings advance our understanding of soil microbial responses to extreme events, and provide a first step for making general predictions about the impact of extreme climatic events on soil functioning. Soils from 30 grasslands across Europe were subjected to 4 contrasting extreme climatic events under drought, flood, freezing and heat conditions, with the results suggesting that soil microbiomes from different climates share unified responses to extreme climatic events.",

    "abstract": "Multijunction photovoltaics (PVs) are gaining prominence owing to their superior capability of achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond the radiative limit of single-junction cells1–8, for which improving narrow-bandgap (NBG) tin–lead perovskites is critical for thin-film devices9. Here, with a focus on understanding the chemistry of tin–lead perovskite precursor solutions, we find that Sn(ii) species dominate interactions with precursors and additives and uncover the exclusive role of carboxylic acid in regulating solution colloidal properties and film crystallization and ammonium in improving film optoelectronic properties. Materials that combine these two functional groups, amino acid salts, considerably improve the semiconducting quality and homogeneity of perovskite films, surpassing the effect of the individual functional groups when introduced as part of separate molecules. Our enhanced tin–lead perovskite layer allows us to fabricate solar cells with PCEs of 23.9%, 29.7% (certified 29.26%) and 28.7% for single-junction, double-junction and triple-junction devices, respectively. Our 1-cm2 triple-junction devices show PCEs of 28.4% (certified 27.28%). Encapsulated triple-junction cells maintain 80% of their initial efficiencies after 860 h maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in ambient. We further fabricate quadruple-junction devices and obtain PCEs of 27.9% with the highest open-circuit voltage of 4.94 V. This work establishes a new benchmark for multijunction PVs. Understanding the chemistry of perovskite precursor solutions enables improved film optoelectronic properties, allowing the fabrication of multijunction solar cells achieving power conversion efficiencies beyond the radiative limit of single-junction cells.",

    "abstract": "Trees structure the Earth’s most biodiverse ecosystem, tropical forests. The vast number of tree species presents a formidable challenge to understanding these forests, including their response to environmental change, as very little is known about most tropical tree species. A focus on the common species may circumvent this challenge. Here we investigate abundance patterns of common tree species using inventory data on 1,003,805 trees with trunk diameters of at least 10 cm across 1,568 locations1–6 in closed-canopy, structurally intact old-growth tropical forests in Africa, Amazonia and Southeast Asia. We estimate that 2.2%, 2.2% and 2.3% of species comprise 50% of the tropical trees in these regions, respectively. Extrapolating across all closed-canopy tropical forests, we estimate that just 1,053 species comprise half of Earth’s 800 billion tropical trees with trunk diameters of at least 10 cm. Despite differing biogeographic, climatic and anthropogenic histories7, we find notably consistent patterns of common species and species abundance distributions across the continents. This suggests that fundamental mechanisms of tree community assembly may apply to all tropical forests. Resampling analyses show that the most common species are likely to belong to a manageable list of known species, enabling targeted efforts to understand their ecology. Although they do not detract from the importance of rare species, our results open new opportunities to understand the world’s most diverse forests, including modelling their response to environmental change, by focusing on the common species that constitute the majority of their trees. Inventory data from more than 1 million trees across African, Amazonian and Southeast Asian tropical forests suggests that, despite their high diversity, just 1,053 species, representing a consistent ~2.2% of tropical tree species in each region, constitute half of Earth’s 800 billion tropical trees.",

    "abstract": "The recovery of top predators is thought to have cascading effects on vegetated ecosystems and their geomorphology1,2, but the evidence for this remains correlational and intensely debated3,4. Here we combine observational and experimental data to reveal that recolonization of sea otters in a US estuary generates a trophic cascade that facilitates coastal wetland plant biomass and suppresses the erosion of marsh edges—a process that otherwise leads to the severe loss of habitats and ecosystem services5,6. Monitoring of the Elkhorn Slough estuary over several decades suggested top-down control in the system, because the erosion of salt marsh edges has generally slowed with increasing sea otter abundance, despite the consistently increasing physical stress in the system (that is, nutrient loading, sea-level rise and tidal scour7–9). Predator-exclusion experiments in five marsh creeks revealed that sea otters suppress the abundance of burrowing crabs, a top-down effect that cascades to both increase marsh edge strength and reduce marsh erosion. Multi-creek surveys comparing marsh creeks pre- and post-sea otter colonization confirmed the presence of an interaction between the keystone sea otter, burrowing crabs and marsh creeks, demonstrating the spatial generality of predator control of ecosystem edge processes: densities of burrowing crabs and edge erosion have declined markedly in creeks that have high levels of sea otter recolonization. These results show that trophic downgrading could be a strong but underappreciated contributor to the loss of coastal wetlands, and suggest that restoring top predators can help to re-establish geomorphic stability. Sea otters recolonizing an estuary in California indirectly reduce erosion by reducing burrowing crab abundance, suggesting that restoring predators could be a key mechanism to improve the stability of coastal wetlands and other ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Late Pleistocene ice-age climates are routinely characterized as having imposed moisture stress on low- to mid-latitude ecosystems1–5. This idea is largely based on fossil pollen evidence for widespread, low-biomass glacial vegetation, interpreted as indicating climatic dryness6. However, woody plant growth is inhibited under low atmospheric CO2 (refs. 7,8), so understanding glacial environments requires the development of new palaeoclimate indicators that are independent of vegetation9. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, during the past 350 kyr, peaks in southern Australian climatic moisture availability were largely confined to glacial periods, including the Last Glacial Maximum, whereas warm interglacials were relatively dry. By measuring the timing of speleothem growth in the Southern Hemisphere subtropics, which today has a predominantly negative annual moisture balance, we developed a record of climatic moisture availability that is independent of vegetation and extends through multiple glacial–interglacial cycles. Our results demonstrate that a cool-moist response is consistent across the austral subtropics and, in part, may result from reduced evaporation under cool glacial temperatures. Insofar as cold glacial environments in the Southern Hemisphere subtropics have been portrayed as uniformly arid3,10,11, our findings suggest that their characterization as evolutionary or physiological obstacles to movement and expansion of animal, plant and, potentially, human populations10 should be reconsidered. Contrary to expectations from pollen and dust records, Southern Hemisphere subtropical regions experienced the greatest climatic moisture during glacial periods of the Late Pleistocene, which may not have been an obstacle to movement and expansion of animals and plants.",

    "abstract": "Moons potentially harbouring a global ocean are tending to become relatively common objects in the Solar System1. The presence of these long-lived global oceans is generally betrayed by surface modification owing to internal dynamics2. Hence, Mimas would be the most unlikely place to look for the presence of a global ocean3. Here, from detailed analysis of Mimas’s orbital motion based on Cassini data, with a particular focus on Mimas’s periapsis drift, we show that its heavily cratered icy shell hides a global ocean, at a depth of 20–30 kilometres. Eccentricity damping implies that the ocean is likely to be less than 25 million years old and still evolving. Our simulations show that the ocean–ice interface reached a depth of less than 30 kilometres only recently (less than 2–3 million years ago), a time span too short for signs of activity at Mimas’s surface to have appeared. An analysis of the orbital motion of Saturn’s moon Mimas shows that a recently formed global subsurface ocean lies beneath its cratered icy shell and that this ocean is probably still evolving.",

    "abstract": "Gravity simulators1 are laboratory systems in which small excitations such as sound2 or surface waves3,4 behave as fields propagating on a curved spacetime geometry. The analogy between gravity and fluids requires vanishing viscosity2–4, a feature naturally realized in superfluids such as liquid helium or cold atomic clouds5–8. Such systems have been successful in verifying key predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetime7–11. In particular, quantum simulations of rotating curved spacetimes indicative of astrophysical black holes require the realization of an extensive vortex flow12 in superfluid systems. Here we demonstrate that, despite the inherent instability of multiply quantized vortices13,14, a stationary giant quantum vortex can be stabilized in superfluid 4He. Its compact core carries thousands of circulation quanta, prevailing over current limitations in other physical systems such as magnons5, atomic clouds6,7 and polaritons15,16. We introduce a minimally invasive way to characterize the vortex flow17,18 by exploiting the interaction of micrometre-scale waves on the superfluid interface with the background velocity field. Intricate wave–vortex interactions, including the detection of bound states and distinctive analogue black hole ringdown signatures, have been observed. These results open new avenues to explore quantum-to-classical vortex transitions and use superfluid helium as a finite-temperature quantum field theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes19. By stabilizing a stationary giant quantum vortex in superfluid 4He and introducing a minimally invasive way to characterize the vortex flow, intricate wave–vortex interactions are shown to simulate black hole ringdown physics.",

    "abstract": "Exotic physics could emerge from interplay between geometry and correlation. In fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states1, novel collective excitations called chiral graviton modes (CGMs) are proposed as quanta of fluctuations of an internal quantum metric under a quantum geometry description2–5. Such modes are condensed-matter analogues of gravitons that are hypothetical spin-2 bosons. They are characterized by polarized states with chirality6–8 of +2 or −2, and energy gaps coinciding with the fundamental neutral collective excitations (namely, magnetorotons9,10) in the long-wavelength limit. However, CGMs remain experimentally inaccessible. Here we observe chiral spin-2 long-wavelength magnetorotons using inelastic scattering of circularly polarized lights, providing strong evidence for CGMs in FQH liquids. At filling factor v = 1/3, a gapped mode identified as the long-wavelength magnetoroton emerges under a specific polarization scheme corresponding to angular momentum S = −2, which persists at extremely long wavelength. Remarkably, the mode chirality remains −2 at v = 2/5 but becomes the opposite at v = 2/3 and 3/5. The modes have characteristic energies and sharp peaks with marked temperature and filling-factor dependence, corroborating the assignment of long-wavelength magnetorotons. The observations capture the essentials of CGMs and support the FQH geometrical description, paving the way to unveil rich physics of quantum metric effects in topological correlated systems. Through inelastic light scattering chiral spin-2 long-wavelength magnetorotons are observed, revealing chiral graviton modes in fractional quantum Hall states and aiding in understanding the quantum metric impacts in topological correlated systems.",

However, all known formation pathways rely on rare pure feedstocks and demand successive purification and mixing steps to suppress unwanted side reactions and enable high product yields. Here we show that heat flows through thin, crack-like geo-compartments could have provided a widely available yet selective mechanism that separates more than 50 prebiotically relevant building blocks from complex mixtures of amino acids, nucleobases, nucleotides, polyphosphates and 2-aminoazoles. Using measured thermophoretic properties7,8, we numerically model and experimentally prove the advantageous effect of geological networks of interconnected cracks9,10 that purify the previously mixed compounds, boosting their concentration ratios by up to three orders of magnitude. The importance for prebiotic chemistry is shown by the dimerization of glycine11,12, in which the selective purification of trimetaphosphate (TMP)13,14 increased reaction yields by five orders of magnitude. The observed effect is robust under various crack sizes, pH values, solvents and temperatures. Our results demonstrate how geologically driven non-equilibria could have explored highly parallelized reaction conditions to foster prebiotic chemistry. Heat flows through thin, crack-like geo-compartments are shown to purify previously mixed compounds and enhance their reactivity, providing a selective mechanism for separating molecules relevant to the chemical origins of life.",

Although TMT nanosheets have been produced by top-down exfoliation, their scale is below the gram level and requires a long processing time, restricting their effective application from laboratory to market4–8. We report the fast and scalable synthesis of a wide variety of MTe2 (M = Nb, Mo, W, Ta, Ti) nanosheets by the solid lithiation of bulk MTe2 within 10 min and their subsequent hydrolysis within seconds. Using NbTe2 as a representative, we produced more than a hundred grams (108 g) of NbTe2 nanosheets with 3.2 nm mean thickness, 6.2 µm mean lateral size and a high yield (>80%). Several interesting quantum phenomena, such as quantum oscillations and giant magnetoresistance, were observed that are generally restricted to highly crystalline MTe2 nanosheets. The TMT nanosheets also perform well as electrocatalysts for lithium–oxygen batteries and electrodes for microsupercapacitors (MSCs). Moreover, this synthesis method is efficient for preparing alloyed telluride, selenide and sulfide nanosheets. Our work opens new opportunities for the universal and scalable synthesis of TMT nanosheets for exploring new quantum phenomena, potential applications and commercialization. Fast and scalable synthesis of a variety of transition metal telluride nanosheets by solid lithiation and hydrolysis is demonstrated and several interesting quantum phenomena were observed, such as quantum oscillations and giant magnetoresistance.",

    "abstract": "Debate remains around the anatomical origins of specific brain cell subtypes and lineage relationships within the human forebrain1–7. Thus, direct observation in the mature human brain is critical for a complete understanding of its structural organization and cellular origins. Here we utilize brain mosaic variation within specific cell types as distinct indicators for clonal dynamics, denoted as cell-type-specific mosaic variant barcode analysis. From four hemispheres and two different human neurotypical donors, we identified 287 and 780 mosaic variants, respectively, that were used to deconvolve clonal dynamics. Clonal spread and allele fractions within the brain reveal that local hippocampal excitatory neurons are more lineage-restricted than resident neocortical excitatory neurons or resident basal ganglia GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, simultaneous genome transcriptome analysis at both a cell-type-specific and a single-cell level suggests a dorsal neocortical origin for a subgroup of DLX1+ inhibitory neurons that disperse radially from an origin shared with excitatory neurons. Finally, the distribution of mosaic variants across 17 locations within one parietal lobe reveals that restriction of clonal spread in the anterior–posterior axis precedes restriction in the dorsal–ventral axis for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Thus, cell-type-resolved somatic mosaicism can uncover lineage relationships governing the development of the human forebrain. Using mosaic variant barcode analysis, clonal dynamics of specific cell types are deconvolved in the human forebrain.",

    "abstract": "RAD52 is important for the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks1,2, mitotic DNA synthesis3–5 and alternative telomere length maintenance6,7. Central to these functions, RAD52 promotes the annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)8,9 and provides an alternative to BRCA2/RAD51-dependent homologous recombination repair10. Inactivation of RAD52 in homologous-recombination-deficient BRCA1- or BRCA2-defective cells is synthetically lethal11,12, and aberrant expression of RAD52 is associated with poor cancer prognosis13,14. As a consequence, RAD52 is an attractive therapeutic target against homologous-recombination-deficient breast, ovarian and prostate cancers15–17. Here we describe the structure of RAD52 and define the mechanism of annealing. As reported previously18–20, RAD52 forms undecameric (11-subunit) ring structures, but these rings do not represent the active form of the enzyme. Instead, cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical analyses revealed that ssDNA annealing is driven by RAD52 open rings in association with replication protein-A (RPA). Atomic models of the RAD52–ssDNA complex show that ssDNA sits in a positively charged channel around the ring. Annealing is driven by the RAD52 N-terminal domains, whereas the C-terminal regions modulate the open-ring conformation and RPA interaction. RPA associates with RAD52 at the site of ring opening with critical interactions occurring between the RPA-interacting domain of RAD52 and the winged helix domain of RPA2. Our studies provide structural snapshots throughout the annealing process and define the molecular mechanism of ssDNA annealing by the RAD52–RPA complex. Single-stranded DNA annealing is driven by RAD52 open rings in association with RPA.",

    "abstract": "In somatic tissue differentiation, chromatin accessibility changes govern priming and precursor commitment towards cellular fates1–3. Therefore, somatic mutations are likely to alter chromatin accessibility patterns, as they disrupt differentiation topologies leading to abnormal clonal outgrowth. However, defining the impact of somatic mutations on the epigenome in human samples is challenging due to admixed mutated and wild-type cells. Here, to chart how somatic mutations disrupt epigenetic landscapes in human clonal outgrowths, we developed genotyping of targeted loci with single-cell chromatin accessibility (GoT–ChA). This high-throughput platform links genotypes to chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution across thousands of cells within a single assay. We applied GoT–ChA to CD34+ cells from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms with JAK2V617F-mutated haematopoiesis. Differential accessibility analysis between wild-type and JAK2V617F-mutant progenitors revealed both cell-intrinsic and cell-state-specific shifts within mutant haematopoietic precursors, including cell-intrinsic pro-inflammatory signatures in haematopoietic stem cells, and a distinct profibrotic inflammatory chromatin landscape in megakaryocytic progenitors. Integration of mitochondrial genome profiling and cell-surface protein expression measurement allowed expansion of genotyping onto DOGMA-seq through imputation, enabling single-cell capture of genotypes, chromatin accessibility, RNA expression and cell-surface protein expression. Collectively, we show that the JAK2V617F mutation leads to epigenetic rewiring in a cell-intrinsic and cell type-specific manner, influencing inflammation states and differentiation trajectories. We envision that GoT–ChA will empower broad future investigations of the critical link between somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations across clonal populations in malignant and non-malignant contexts. The JAK2V617F mutation leads to epigenetic rewiring in a cell-intrinsic and cell-type-specific manner, influencing inflammation states and differentiation trajectories in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic reprogramming resets parental epigenetic memories and differentiates primordial germ cells (PGCs) into mitotic pro-spermatogonia or oogonia. This process ensures sexually dimorphic germ cell development for totipotency1. In vitro reconstitution of epigenetic reprogramming in humans remains a fundamental challenge. Here we establish a strategy for inducing epigenetic reprogramming and differentiation of pluripotent stem-cell-derived human PGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) into mitotic pro-spermatogonia or oogonia, coupled with their extensive amplification (about >1010-fold). Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling is a key driver of these processes. BMP-driven hPGCLC differentiation involves attenuation of the MAPK (ERK) pathway and both de novo and maintenance DNA methyltransferase activities, which probably promote replication-coupled, passive DNA demethylation. hPGCLCs deficient in TET1, an active DNA demethylase abundant in human germ cells2,3, differentiate into extraembryonic cells, including amnion, with de-repression of key genes that bear bivalent promoters. These cells fail to fully activate genes vital for spermatogenesis and oogenesis, and their promoters remain methylated. Our study provides a framework for epigenetic reprogramming in humans and an important advance in human biology. Through the generation of abundant mitotic pro-spermatogonia and oogonia-like cells, our results also represent a milestone for human in vitro gametogenesis research and its potential translation into reproductive medicine. A new strategy that involves signalling-molecule-driven differentiation can induce epigenetic reprogramming of human pluripotent stem cell-derived primordial germ cell-like cells to pro-spermatogonia and oogonia-like cells with massive propagation and high efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Bitter taste receptors, particularly TAS2R14, play central roles in discerning a wide array of bitter substances, ranging from dietary components to pharmaceutical agents1,2. TAS2R14 is also widely expressed in extragustatory tissues, suggesting its extra roles in diverse physiological processes and potential therapeutic applications3. Here we present cryogenic electron microscopy structures of TAS2R14 in complex with aristolochic acid, flufenamic acid and compound 28.1, coupling with different G-protein subtypes. Uniquely, a cholesterol molecule is observed occupying what is typically an orthosteric site in class A G-protein-coupled receptors. The three potent agonists bind, individually, to the intracellular pockets, suggesting a distinct activation mechanism for this receptor. Comprehensive structural analysis, combined with mutagenesis and molecular dynamic simulation studies, elucidate the broad-spectrum ligand recognition and activation of the receptor by means of intricate multiple ligand-binding sites. Our study also uncovers the specific coupling modes of TAS2R14 with gustducin and Gi1 proteins. These findings should be instrumental in advancing knowledge of bitter taste perception and its broader implications in sensory biology and drug discovery. A cryogenic electron microcopy study of structures of a human receptor for bitter taste finds that cholesterol can activate the receptor, while the tastant molecule acts allosterically on the receptor.",

    "abstract": "Human spaceflight has historically been managed by government agencies, such as in the NASA Twins Study1, but new commercial spaceflight opportunities have opened spaceflight to a broader population. In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission launched the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, which included the youngest American astronaut (aged 29), new in-flight experimental technologies (handheld ultrasound imaging, smartwatch wearables and immune profiling), ocular alignment measurements and new protocols for in-depth, multi-omic molecular and cellular profiling. Here we report the primary findings from the 3-day spaceflight mission, which induced a broad range of physiological and stress responses, neurovestibular changes indexed by ocular misalignment, and altered neurocognitive functioning, some of which match those of long-term spaceflight2, but almost all of which did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) after return to Earth. Overall, these preliminary civilian spaceflight data suggest that short-duration missions do not pose a significant health risk, and moreover present a rich opportunity to measure the earliest phases of adaptation to spaceflight in the human body at anatomical, cellular, physiological and cognitive levels. Finally, these methods and results lay the foundation for an open, rapidly expanding biomedical database for astronauts3, which can inform countermeasure development for both private and government-sponsored space missions. SpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission sent an all-civilian crew into orbit to study physiological, neurovestibular and neurocognitive changes in the astronauts and found that short-duration civilian space missions do not pose a major health risk.",

    "abstract": "Earth harbours an extraordinary plant phenotypic diversity1 that is at risk from ongoing global changes2,3. However, it remains unknown how increasing aridity and livestock grazing pressure—two major drivers of global change4–6—shape the trait covariation that underlies plant phenotypic diversity1,7. Here we assessed how covariation among 20 chemical and morphological traits responds to aridity and grazing pressure within global drylands. Our analysis involved 133,769 trait measurements spanning 1,347 observations of 301 perennial plant species surveyed across 326 plots from 6 continents. Crossing an aridity threshold of approximately 0.7 (close to the transition between semi-arid and arid zones) led to an unexpected 88% increase in trait diversity. This threshold appeared in the presence of grazers, and moved toward lower aridity levels with increasing grazing pressure. Moreover, 57% of observed trait diversity occurred only in the most arid and grazed drylands, highlighting the phenotypic uniqueness of these extreme environments. Our work indicates that drylands act as a global reservoir of plant phenotypic diversity and challenge the pervasive view that harsh environmental conditions reduce plant trait diversity8–10. They also highlight that many alternative strategies may enable plants to cope with increases in environmental stress induced by climate change and land-use intensification. Analysis of 20 chemical and morphological plant traits at diverse sites across 6 continents shows that the transition from semi-arid to arid zones is associated with an unexpected 88% increase in trait diversity.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks, deep-learning methods and the backpropagation algorithm1 form the foundation of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. These methods are almost always used in two phases, one in which the weights of the network are updated and one in which the weights are held constant while the network is used or evaluated. This contrasts with natural learning and many applications, which require continual learning. It has been unclear whether or not deep learning methods work in continual learning settings. Here we show that they do not—that standard deep-learning methods gradually lose plasticity in continual-learning settings until they learn no better than a shallow network. We show such loss of plasticity using the classic ImageNet dataset and reinforcement-learning problems across a wide range of variations in the network and the learning algorithm. Plasticity is maintained indefinitely only by algorithms that continually inject diversity into the network, such as our continual backpropagation algorithm, a variation of backpropagation in which a small fraction of less-used units are continually and randomly reinitialized. Our results indicate that methods based on gradient descent are not enough—that sustained deep learning requires a random, non-gradient component to maintain variability and plasticity. The pervasive problem of artificial neural networks losing plasticity in continual-learning settings is demonstrated and a simple solution called the continual backpropagation algorithm is described to prevent this issue.",

    "abstract": "Developmental myelination is a protracted process in the mammalian brain1. One theory for why oligodendrocytes mature so slowly posits that myelination may stabilize neuronal circuits and temper neuronal plasticity as animals age2–4. We tested this theory in the visual cortex, which has a well-defined critical period for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity5. During adolescence, visual experience modulated the rate of oligodendrocyte maturation in visual cortex. To determine whether oligodendrocyte maturation in turn regulates neuronal plasticity, we genetically blocked oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in adolescent mice. In adult mice lacking adolescent oligodendrogenesis, a brief period of monocular deprivation led to a significant decrease in visual cortex responses to the deprived eye, reminiscent of the plasticity normally restricted to adolescence. This enhanced functional plasticity was accompanied by a greater turnover of dendritic spines and coordinated reductions in spine size following deprivation. Furthermore, inhibitory synaptic transmission, which gates experience-dependent plasticity at the circuit level, was diminished in the absence of adolescent oligodendrogenesis. These results establish a critical role for oligodendrocytes in shaping the maturation and stabilization of cortical circuits and support the concept of developmental myelination acting as a functional brake on neuronal plasticity. Through genetic blocking of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in adolescent mice, we demonstrate that oligodendrocytes have a critical role in shaping the maturation and stabilization of visual cortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-guided closed-loop experimentation has emerged as a promising method for optimization of objective functions1,2, but the substantial potential of this traditionally black-box approach to uncovering new chemical knowledge has remained largely untapped. Here we report the integration of closed-loop experiments with physics-based feature selection and supervised learning, denoted as closed-loop transfer (CLT), to yield chemical insights in parallel with optimization of objective functions. CLT was used to examine the factors dictating the photostability in solution of light-harvesting donor–acceptor molecules used in a variety of organic electronics applications, and showed fundamental insights including the importance of high-energy regions of the triplet state manifold. This was possible following automated modular synthesis and experimental characterization of only around 1.5% of the theoretical chemical space. This physics-informed model for photostability was strengthened using multiple experimental test sets and validated by tuning the triplet excited-state energy of the solvent to break out of the observed plateau in the closed-loop photostability optimization process. Further applications of CLT to additional materials systems support the generalizability of this strategy for augmenting closed-loop strategies. Broadly, these findings show that combining interpretable supervised learning models and physics-based features with closed-loop discovery processes can rapidly provide fundamental chemical insights. Integration of closed-loop experiments with physics-based feature selection and supervised learning, denoted as closed-loop transfer, yields chemical insights in parallel with optimization of objective functions.",

    "abstract": "Mutation of tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (encoded by TET2) drives myeloid malignancy initiation and progression1–3. TET2 deficiency is known to cause a globally opened chromatin state and activation of genes contributing to aberrant haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal4,5. However, the open chromatin observed in TET2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells, leukaemic cells and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells5 is inconsistent with the designated role of DNA 5-methylcytosine oxidation of TET2. Here we show that chromatin-associated retrotransposon RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) can be recognized by the methyl-CpG-binding-domain protein MBD6, which guides deubiquitination of nearby monoubiquitinated Lys119 of histone H2A (H2AK119ub) to promote an open chromatin state. TET2 oxidizes m5C and antagonizes this MBD6-dependent H2AK119ub deubiquitination. TET2 depletion thereby leads to globally decreased H2AK119ub, more open chromatin and increased transcription in stem cells. TET2-mutant human leukaemia becomes dependent on this gene activation pathway, with MBD6 depletion selectively blocking proliferation of TET2-mutant leukaemic cells and largely reversing the haematopoiesis defects caused by Tet2 loss in mouse models. Together, our findings reveal a chromatin regulation pathway by TET2 through retrotransposon RNA m5C oxidation and identify the downstream MBD6 protein as a feasible target for developing therapies specific against TET2 mutant malignancies. Chromatin-associated retrotransposon RNA 5-methylcytosine can be recognized by the methyl-CpG-binding-domain protein MBD6, which guides deubiquitination of nearby monoubiquitinated Lys119 of histone H2A to promote an open chromatin state in TET2-deficient cells.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has an important yet often overlooked role in health and disease. Constraint models quantify the removal of deleterious variation from the population by selection and represent powerful tools for identifying genetic variation that underlies human phenotypes1–4. However, nuclear constraint models are not applicable to mtDNA, owing to its distinct features. Here we describe the development of a mitochondrial genome constraint model and its application to the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), a large-scale population dataset that reports mtDNA variation across 56,434 human participants5. Specifically, we analyse constraint by comparing the observed variation in gnomAD to that expected under neutrality, which was calculated using a mtDNA mutational model and observed maximum heteroplasmy-level data. Our results highlight strong depletion of expected variation, which suggests that many deleterious mtDNA variants remain undetected. To aid their discovery, we compute constraint metrics for every mitochondrial protein, tRNA and rRNA gene, which revealed a range of intolerance to variation. We further characterize the most constrained regions within genes through regional constraint and identify the most constrained sites within the entire mitochondrial genome through local constraint, which showed enrichment of pathogenic variation. Constraint also clustered in three-dimensional structures, which provided insight into functionally important domains and their disease relevance. Notably, we identify constraint at often overlooked sites, including in rRNA and noncoding regions. Last, we demonstrate that these metrics can improve the discovery of deleterious variation that underlies rare and common phenotypes. Development of a constraint model specifically for mitochondrial DNA and applied to data from the Genome Aggregation Database provides insights into which sites in the mitochondrial genome are important for health and disease.",

    "abstract": "DNA storage has shown potential to transcend current silicon-based data storage technologies in storage density, longevity and energy consumption1–3. However, writing large-scale data directly into DNA sequences by de novo synthesis remains uneconomical in time and cost4. We present an alternative, parallel strategy that enables the writing of arbitrary data on DNA using premade nucleic acids. Through self-assembly guided enzymatic methylation, epigenetic modifications, as information bits, can be introduced precisely onto universal DNA templates to enact molecular movable-type printing. By programming with a finite set of 700 DNA movable types and five templates, we achieved the synthesis-free writing of approximately 275,000 bits on an automated platform with 350 bits written per reaction. The data encoded in complex epigenetic patterns were retrieved high-throughput by nanopore sequencing, and algorithms were developed to finely resolve 240 modification patterns per sequencing reaction. With the epigenetic information bits framework, distributed and bespoke DNA storage was implemented by 60 volunteers lacking professional biolab experience. Our framework presents a new modality of DNA data storage that is parallel, programmable, stable and scalable. Such an unconventional modality opens up avenues towards practical data storage and dual-mode data functions in biomolecular systems. We present a DNA self-assembly based molecular data writing strategy to enable parallel movable-type printing for scalable DNA storage.",

    "abstract": "Extensive forest restoration is a key strategy to meet nature-based sustainable development goals and provide multiple social and environmental benefits1. Yet achieving forest restoration at scale requires cost-effective methods2. Tree planting in degraded landscapes is a popular but costly forest restoration method that often results in less biodiverse forests when compared to natural regeneration techniques under similar conditions3. Here we assess the current spatial distribution of pantropical natural forest (from 2000 to 2016) and use this to present a model of the potential for natural regeneration across tropical forested countries and biomes at a spatial resolution of 30 m. We estimate that an area of 215 million hectares—an area greater than the entire country of Mexico—has potential for natural forest regeneration, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration potential of 23.4 Gt C (range, 21.1–25.7 Gt) over 30 years. Five countries (Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Colombia) account for 52% of this estimated potential, showcasing the need for targeting restoration initiatives that leverage natural regeneration potential. Our results facilitate broader equitable decision-making processes that capitalize on the widespread opportunity for natural regeneration to help achieve national and global environmental agendas. An estimated area of 215 million hectares has the potential for natural forest regeneration across tropical forested countries and biomes, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration potential of 23.4 Gt C.",

    "abstract": "Pangenomes are collections of annotated genome sequences of multiple individuals of a species1. The structural variants uncovered by these datasets are a major asset to genetic analysis in crop plants2. Here we report a pangenome of barley comprising long-read sequence assemblies of 76 wild and domesticated genomes and short-read sequence data of 1,315 genotypes. An expanded catalogue of sequence variation in the crop includes structurally complex loci that are rich in gene copy number variation. To demonstrate the utility of the pangenome, we focus on four loci involved in disease resistance, plant architecture, nutrient release and trichome development. Novel allelic variation at a powdery mildew resistance locus and population-specific copy number gains in a regulator of vegetative branching were found. Expansion of a family of starch-cleaving enzymes in elite malting barleys was linked to shifts in enzymatic activity in micro-malting trials. Deletion of an enhancer motif is likely to change the developmental trajectory of the hairy appendages on barley grains. Our findings indicate that allelic diversity at structurally complex loci may have helped crop plants to adapt to new selective regimes in agricultural ecosystems. A pangenome analysis of 76 wild and domesticated barley accessions in combination with short-read sequence data of 1,315 barley genotypes indicates that allelic diversity at structurally complex loci may have helped crop plants to adapt to agricultural ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Human cellular models of neurodegeneration require reproducibility and longevity, which is necessary for simulating age-dependent diseases. Such systems are particularly needed for TDP-43 proteinopathies1, which involve human-specific mechanisms2–5 that cannot be directly studied in animal models. Here, to explore the emergence and consequences of TDP-43 pathologies, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived, colony morphology neural stem cells (iCoMoNSCs) via manual selection of neural precursors6. Single-cell transcriptomics and comparison to independent neural stem cells7 showed that iCoMoNSCs are uniquely homogenous and self-renewing. Differentiated iCoMoNSCs formed a self-organized multicellular system consisting of synaptically connected and electrophysiologically active neurons, which matured into long-lived functional networks (which we designate iNets). Neuronal and glial maturation in iNets was similar to that of cortical organoids8. Overexpression of wild-type TDP-43 in a minority of neurons within iNets led to progressive fragmentation and aggregation of the protein, resulting in a partial loss of function and neurotoxicity. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed a novel set of misregulated RNA targets in TDP-43-overexpressing neurons and in patients with TDP-43 proteinopathies exhibiting a loss of nuclear TDP-43. The strongest misregulated target encoded the synaptic protein NPTX2, the levels of which are controlled by TDP-43 binding on its 3′ untranslated region. When NPTX2 was overexpressed in iNets, it exhibited neurotoxicity, whereas correcting NPTX2 misregulation partially rescued neurons from TDP-43-induced neurodegeneration. Notably, NPTX2 was consistently misaccumulated in neurons from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology. Our work directly links TDP-43 misregulation and NPTX2 accumulation, thereby revealing a TDP-43-dependent pathway of neurotoxicity. A neural stem cell culture system derived from induced pluripotent stem cells forms a network of synaptically connected and electrophysiologically active neurons that were used as a model system to identify a mechanism of TDP-43-induced neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Each year, people spend less time reading and more time viewing images1, which are proliferating online2–4. Images from platforms such as Google and Wikipedia are downloaded by millions every day2,5,6, and millions more are interacting through social media, such as Instagram and TikTok, that primarily consist of exchanging visual content. In parallel, news agencies and digital advertisers are increasingly capturing attention online through the use of images7,8, which people process more quickly, implicitly and memorably than text9–12. Here we show that the rise of images online significantly exacerbates gender bias, both in its statistical prevalence and its psychological impact. We examine the gender associations of 3,495 social categories (such as ‘nurse’ or ‘banker’) in more than one million images from Google, Wikipedia and Internet Movie Database (IMDb), and in billions of words from these platforms. We find that gender bias is consistently more prevalent in images than text for both female- and male-typed categories. We also show that the documented underrepresentation of women online13–18 is substantially worse in images than in text, public opinion and US census data. Finally, we conducted a nationally representative, preregistered experiment that shows that googling for images rather than textual descriptions of occupations amplifies gender bias in participants’ beliefs. Addressing the societal effect of this large-scale shift towards visual communication will be essential for developing a fair and inclusive future for the internet. We find that gender bias is more prevalent in images than text, that the underrepresentation of women online is substantially worse in images and that googling for images amplifies gender bias in a person’s beliefs.",

    "abstract": "Stalled ribosomes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are covalently modified with the ubiquitin-like protein UFM1 on the 60S ribosomal subunit protein RPL26 (also known as uL24)1,2. This modification, which is known as UFMylation, is orchestrated by the UFM1 ribosome E3 ligase (UREL) complex, comprising UFL1, UFBP1 and CDK5RAP3 (ref. 3). However, the catalytic mechanism of UREL and the functional consequences of UFMylation are unclear. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of UREL bound to 60S ribosomes, revealing the basis of its substrate specificity. UREL wraps around the 60S subunit to form a C-shaped clamp architecture that blocks the tRNA-binding sites at one end, and the peptide exit tunnel at the other. A UFL1 loop inserts into and remodels the peptidyl transferase centre. These features of UREL suggest a crucial function for UFMylation in the release and recycling of stalled or terminated ribosomes from the ER membrane. In the absence of functional UREL, 60S–SEC61 translocon complexes accumulate at the ER membrane, demonstrating that UFMylation is necessary for releasing SEC61 from 60S subunits. Notably, this release is facilitated by a functional switch of UREL from a ‘writer’ to a ‘reader’ module that recognizes its product—UFMylated 60S ribosomes. Collectively, we identify a fundamental role for UREL in dissociating 60S subunits from the SEC61 translocon and the basis for UFMylation in regulating protein homeostasis at the ER. Attachment of the ubiquitin-like modifier UFM1 to 60S ribosomes has a critical function in the release and recycling of stalled or terminated ribosomes from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are heterogeneous glial cells of the central nervous system1–3. However, the physiological relevance of astrocyte diversity for neural circuits and behaviour remains unclear. Here we show that a specific population of astrocytes in the central striatum expresses μ-crystallin (encoded by Crym in mice and CRYM in humans) that is associated with several human diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders4–7. In adult mice, reducing the levels of μ-crystallin in striatal astrocytes through CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of Crym resulted in perseverative behaviours, increased fast synaptic excitation in medium spiny neurons and dysfunctional excitatory–inhibitory synaptic balance. Increased perseveration stemmed from the loss of astrocyte-gated control of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals of orbitofrontal cortex–striatum projections. We found that perseveration could be remedied using presynaptic inhibitory chemogenetics8, and that this treatment also corrected the synaptic deficits. Together, our findings reveal converging molecular, synaptic, circuit and behavioural mechanisms by which a molecularly defined and allocated population of striatal astrocytes gates perseveration phenotypes that accompany neuropsychiatric disorders9–12. Our data show that Crym-positive striatal astrocytes have key biological functions within the central nervous system, and uncover astrocyte–neuron interaction mechanisms that could be targeted in treatments for perseveration. In mice, a population of astrocytes in the central striatum, characterized by expression of μ-crystallin, has a role in perseveration phenotypes that are often associated with human neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome has major roles in modulating host physiology. One such function is colonization resistance, or the ability of the microbial collective to protect the host against enteric pathogens1–3, including enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) serotype O157:H7, an attaching and effacing (AE) food-borne pathogen that causes severe gastroenteritis, enterocolitis, bloody diarrhea and acute renal failure4,5 (haemolytic uremic syndrome). Although gut microorganisms can provide colonization resistance by outcompeting some pathogens or modulating host defence provided by the gut barrier and intestinal immune cells6,7, this phenomenon remains poorly understood. Here, we show that activation of the neurotransmitter receptor dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) in the intestinal epithelium by gut microbial metabolites produced upon dietary supplementation with the essential amino acid l-tryptophan protects the host against Citrobacter rodentium, a mouse AE pathogen that is widely used as a model for EHEC infection8,9. We further find that DRD2 activation by these tryptophan-derived metabolites decreases expression of a host actin regulatory protein involved in C. rodentium and EHEC attachment to the gut epithelium via formation of actin pedestals. Our results reveal a noncanonical colonization resistance pathway against AE pathogens that features an unconventional role for DRD2 outside the nervous system in controlling actin cytoskeletal organization in the gut epithelium. Our findings may inspire prophylactic and therapeutic approaches targeting DRD2 with dietary or pharmacological interventions to improve gut health and treat gastrointestinal infections, which afflict millions globally. In a mouse model of enteric pathogen infection, tryptophan metabolites protect against infection via activation of dopamine receptor D2 and regulation of actin cytoskeletal organization in intestinal epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "The convergence of topology and correlations represents a highly coveted realm in the pursuit of new quantum states of matter1. Introducing electron correlations to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator can lead to the emergence of a fractional topological insulator and other exotic time-reversal-symmetric topological order2–8, not possible in quantum Hall and Chern insulator systems. Here we report a new dual QSH insulator within the intrinsic monolayer crystal of TaIrTe4, arising from the interplay of its single-particle topology and density-tuned electron correlations. At charge neutrality, monolayer TaIrTe4 demonstrates the QSH insulator, manifesting enhanced nonlocal transport and quantized helical edge conductance. After introducing electrons from charge neutrality, TaIrTe4 shows metallic behaviour in only a small range of charge densities but quickly goes into a new insulating state, entirely unexpected on the basis of the single-particle band structure of TaIrTe4. This insulating state could arise from a strong electronic instability near the van Hove singularities, probably leading to a charge density wave (CDW). Remarkably, within this correlated insulating gap, we observe a resurgence of the QSH state. The observation of helical edge conduction in a CDW gap could bridge spin physics and charge orders. The discovery of a dual QSH insulator introduces a new method for creating topological flat minibands through CDW superlattices, which offer a promising platform for exploring time-reversal-symmetric fractional phases and electromagnetism2–4,9,10. A study reports a dual quantum spin Hall insulator in monolayer TaIrTe4, arising from the interplay of its single-particle topology and density-tuned electron correlations.",

    "abstract": "Plant pattern-recognition receptors perceive microorganism-associated molecular patterns to activate immune signalling1,2. Activation of the pattern-recognition receptor kinase CERK1 is essential for immunity, but tight inhibition of receptor kinases in the absence of pathogen is crucial to prevent autoimmunity3,4. Here we find that the U-box ubiquitin E3 ligase OsCIE1 acts as a molecular brake to inhibit OsCERK1 in rice. During homeostasis, OsCIE1 ubiquitinates OsCERK1, reducing its kinase activity. In the presence of the microorganism-associated molecular pattern chitin, active OsCERK1 phosphorylates OsCIE1 and blocks its E3 ligase activity, thus releasing the brake and promoting immunity. Phosphorylation of a serine within the U-box of OsCIE1 prevents its interaction with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and serves as a phosphorylation switch. This phosphorylation site is conserved in E3 ligases from plants to animals. Our work identifies a ligand-released brake that enables dynamic immune regulation. The ubiquitin E3 ligase OsCIE1 acts as a brake to inhibit OsCERK1 during homeostasis; this brake is released after chitin stimulation.",

    "abstract": "The parasite Cryptosporidium is a leading agent of diarrhoeal disease in young children, and a cause and consequence of chronic malnutrition1,2. There are no vaccines and only limited treatment options3. The parasite infects enterocytes, in which it engages in asexual and sexual replication4, both of which are essential to continued infection and transmission. However, their molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear5. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the gene expression programme of the entire Cryptosporidium parvum life cycle in culture and in infected animals. Diverging from the prevailing model6, we find support for only three intracellular stages: asexual type-I meronts, male gamonts and female gametes. We reveal a highly organized program for the assembly of components at each stage. Dissecting the underlying regulatory network, we identify the transcription factor Myb-M as the earliest determinant of male fate, in an organism that lacks genetic sex determination. Conditional expression of this factor overrides the developmental program and induces widespread maleness, while conditional deletion ablates male development. Both have a profound impact on the infection. A large set of stage-specific genes now provides the opportunity to understand, engineer and disrupt parasite sex and life cycle progression to advance the development of vaccines and treatments. The transcription factor Myb-M is the earliest determinant of male fate in the parasite Cryptosporidium parvum.",

    "abstract": "The canonical mitotic cell cycle coordinates DNA replication, centriole duplication and cytokinesis to generate two cells from one1. Some cells, such as mammalian trophoblast giant cells, use cell cycle variants like the endocycle to bypass mitosis2. Differentiating multiciliated cells, found in the mammalian airway, brain ventricles and reproductive tract, are post-mitotic but generate hundreds of centrioles, each of which matures into a basal body and nucleates a motile cilium3,4. Several cell cycle regulators have previously been implicated in specific steps of multiciliated cell differentiation5,6. Here we show that differentiating multiciliated cells integrate cell cycle regulators into a new alternative cell cycle, which we refer to as the multiciliation cycle. The multiciliation cycle redeploys many canonical cell cycle regulators, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their cognate cyclins. For example, cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6, which are regulators of mitotic G1-to-S progression, are required to initiate multiciliated cell differentiation. The multiciliation cycle amplifies some aspects of the canonical cell cycle, such as centriole synthesis, and blocks others, such as DNA replication. E2F7, a transcriptional regulator of canonical S-to-G2 progression, is expressed at high levels during the multiciliation cycle. In the multiciliation cycle, E2F7 directly dampens the expression of genes encoding DNA replication machinery and terminates the S phase-like gene expression program. Loss of E2F7 causes aberrant acquisition of DNA synthesis in multiciliated cells and dysregulation of multiciliation cycle progression, which disrupts centriole maturation and ciliogenesis. We conclude that multiciliated cells use an alternative cell cycle that orchestrates differentiation instead of controlling proliferation. A distinct cell cycle redeploys many canonical cell cycle regulators to control the differentiation of multiciliated cells, with the transcription factor E2F7 playing a pivotal part in this modified cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Composites from 2D nanomaterials show uniquely high electrical, thermal and mechanical properties1,2. Pairing their robustness with polarization rotation is needed for hyperspectral optics in extreme conditions3,4. However, the rigid nanoplatelets have randomized achiral shapes, which scramble the circular polarization of photons with comparable wavelengths. Here we show that multilayer nanocomposites from 2D nanomaterials with complex textured surfaces strongly and controllably rotate light polarization, despite being nano-achiral and partially disordered. The intense circular dichroism (CD) in nanocomposite films originates from the diagonal patterns of wrinkles, grooves or ridges, leading to an angular offset between axes of linear birefringence (LB) and linear dichroism (LD). Stratification of the layer-by-layer (LBL) assembled nanocomposites affords precise engineering of the polarization-active materials from imprecise nanoplatelets with an optical asymmetry g-factor of 1.0, exceeding those of typical nanomaterials by about 500 times. High thermal resilience of the composite optics enables operating temperature as high as 250 °C and imaging of hot emitters in the near-infrared (NIR) part of the spectrum. Combining LBL engineered nanocomposites with achiral dyes results in anisotropic factors for circularly polarized emission approaching the theoretical limit. The generality of the observed phenomena is demonstrated by nanocomposite polarizers from molybdenum sulfide (MoS2), MXene and graphene oxide (GO) and by two manufacturing methods. A large family of LBL optical nanocomponents can be computationally designed and additively engineered for ruggedized optics. Multilayer composites of 2D nanomaterials manufactured using a layer-by-layer methodology demonstrates strong polarization rotation, mechanical robustness and operational temperatures as high as 250 °C, despite being nano-achiral and partially disordered.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics measures in situ gene expression at millions of locations within a tissue1, hitherto with some trade-off between transcriptome depth, spatial resolution and sample size2. Although integration of image-based segmentation has enabled impactful work in this context, it is limited by imaging quality and tissue heterogeneity. By contrast, recent array-based technologies offer the ability to measure the entire transcriptome at subcellular resolution across large samples3–6. Presently, there exist no approaches for cell type identification that directly leverage this information to annotate individual cells. Here we propose a multiscale approach to automatically classify cell types at this subcellular level, using both transcriptomic information and spatial context. We showcase this on both targeted and whole-transcriptome spatial platforms, improving cell classification and morphology for human kidney tissue and pinpointing individual sparsely distributed renal mouse immune cells without reliance on image data. By integrating these predictions into a topological pipeline based on multiparameter persistent homology7–9, we identify cell spatial relationships characteristic of a mouse model of lupus nephritis, which we validate experimentally by immunofluorescence. The proposed framework readily generalizes to new platforms, providing a comprehensive pipeline bridging different levels of biological organization from genes through to tissues.  A method for topological automatic cell type classification across subcellular resolution spatial transcriptomic platforms is proposed, resolving cell type information and locating sparsely dispersed cells in human kidney and mouse kidney and brain.",

    "abstract": "Viruses compete with each other for limited cellular resources, and some deliver defence mechanisms that protect the host from competing genetic parasites1. The phage antirestriction induced system (PARIS) is a defence system, often encoded in viral genomes, that is composed of a 55 kDa ABC ATPase (AriA) and a 35 kDa TOPRIM nuclease (AriB)2. However, the mechanism by which AriA and AriB function in phage defence is unknown. Here we show that AriA and AriB assemble into a 425 kDa supramolecular immune complex. We use cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of this complex, thereby explaining how six molecules of AriA assemble into a propeller-shaped scaffold that coordinates three subunits of AriB. ATP-dependent detection of foreign proteins triggers the release of AriB, which assembles into a homodimeric nuclease that blocks infection by cleaving host lysine transfer RNA. Phage T5 subverts PARIS immunity through expression of a lysine transfer RNA variant that is not cleaved by PARIS, thereby restoring viral infection. Collectively, these data explain how AriA functions as an ATP-dependent sensor that detects viral proteins and activates the AriB toxin. PARIS is one of an emerging set of immune systems that form macromolecular complexes for the recognition of foreign proteins, rather than foreign nucleic acids3. Structural and functional studies reveal how viral proteins trigger the phage antirestriction induced system (PARIS) to degrade host tRNA and how viral tRNAs suppress the PARIS nuclease and thereby overcome this phage defense system.",

    "abstract": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe, post-infectious sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection1,2, yet the pathophysiological mechanism connecting the infection to the broad inflammatory syndrome remains unknown. Here we leveraged a large set of samples from patients with MIS-C to identify a distinct set of host proteins targeted by patient autoantibodies including a particular autoreactive epitope within SNX8, a protein involved in regulating an antiviral pathway associated with MIS-C pathogenesis. In parallel, we also probed antibody responses from patients with MIS-C to the complete SARS-CoV-2 proteome and found enriched reactivity against a distinct domain of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The immunogenic regions of the viral nucleocapsid and host SNX8 proteins bear remarkable sequence similarity. Consequently, we found that many children with anti-SNX8 autoantibodies also have cross-reactive T cells engaging both the SNX8 and the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein epitopes. Together, these findings suggest that patients with MIS-C develop a characteristic immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein that is associated with cross-reactivity to the self-protein SNX8, demonstrating a mechanistic link between the infection and the inflammatory syndrome, with implications for better understanding a range of post-infectious autoinflammatory diseases. A cross-reactive antibody and T cell response is identified in a large portion of patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.",

    "abstract": "Antiferromagnetic spintronics1,2 shows great potential for high-density and ultrafast information devices. Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), a key spintronic memory component that are typically formed from ferromagnetic materials, have seen rapid developments very recently using antiferromagnetic materials3,4. Here we demonstrate a twisting strategy for constructing all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions down to the atomic limit. By twisting two bilayers of CrSBr, a 2D antiferromagnet (AFM), a more than 700% nonvolatile tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio is shown at zero field (ZF) with the entire twisted stack acting as the tunnel barrier. This is determined by twisting two CrSBr monolayers for which the TMR is shown to be derived from accumulative coherent tunnelling across the individual CrSBr monolayers. The dependence of the TMR on the twist angle is calculated from the electron-parallel momentum-dependent decay across the twisted monolayers. This is in excellent agreement with our experiments that consider twist angles that vary from 0° to 90°. Moreover, we also find that the temperature dependence of the TMR is, surprisingly, much weaker for the twisted as compared with the untwisted junctions, making the twisted junctions even more attractive for applications. Our work shows that it is possible to push nonvolatile magnetic information storage to the atomically thin limit. By twisting two bilayers of CrSBr, which is a 2D antiferromagnet, a >700% nonvolatile tunnelling magnetoresistance at zero field is shown, demonstrating a new strategy for constructing all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions down to the atomic limit.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional materials (2DM) and their heterostructures offer tunable electrical and optical properties, primarily modifiable through electrostatic gating and twisting. Although electrostatic gating is a well-established method for manipulating 2DM, achieving real-time control over interfacial properties remains challenging in exploring 2DM physics and advanced quantum device technology1–6. Current methods, often reliant on scanning microscopes, are limited in their scope of application, lacking the accessibility and scalability of electrostatic gating at the device level. Here we introduce an on-chip platform for 2DM with in situ adjustable interfacial properties, using a microelectromechanical system (MEMS). This platform comprises compact and cost-effective devices with the ability of precise voltage-controlled manipulation of 2DM, including approaching, twisting and pressurizing actions. We demonstrate this technology by creating synthetic topological singularities, such as merons, in the nonlinear optical susceptibility of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)7–10. A key application of this technology is the development of integrated light sources with real-time and wide-range tunable polarization. Furthermore, we predict a quantum analogue that can generate entangled photon pairs with adjustable entanglement properties. Our work extends the abilities of existing technologies in manipulating low-dimensional quantum materials and paves the way for new hybrid two- and three-dimensional devices, with promising implications in condensed-matter physics, quantum optics and related fields. An on-chip platform with in situ adjustable interfacial properties, using a microelectromechanical system, provides multi-degree-of-freedom control of two-dimensional materials, including twisting and pressurizing.",

    "abstract": "Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed an unexpected abundance of massive-galaxy candidates in the early Universe, extending further in redshift and to lower luminosity than what had previously been found by submillimetre surveys1–6. These JWST candidates have been interpreted as challenging the Λ cold dark-matter cosmology (where Λ is the cosmological constant)7–9, but, so far, these studies have mostly relied on only rest-frame ultraviolet data and have lacked spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts10–16. Here we report a systematic study of 36 massive dust-obscured galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 5 and 9 from the JWST FRESCO survey. We find no tension with the Λ cold dark-matter model in our sample. However, three ultra-massive galaxies (logM★/M⊙ ≳ 11.0, where M★ is the stellar mass and M⊙ is the mass of the Sun) require an exceptional fraction of 50 per cent of baryons converted into stars—two to three times higher than the most efficient galaxies at later epochs. The contribution from an active galactic nucleus is unlikely because of their extended emission. Ultra-massive galaxies account for as much as 17 per cent of the total cosmic star-formation-rate density17 at redshifts between about five and six. A study of 36 massive galaxies at redshifts between 5 and 9 from the JWST FRESCO survey finds that galaxy formation of the most massive galaxies is 2–3 times higher than the most efficient galaxies at later epochs.",

    "abstract": "Iron is critical during host–microorganism interactions1–4. Restriction of available iron by the host during infection is an important defence strategy, described as nutritional immunity5. However, this poses a conundrum for externally facing, absorptive tissues such as the gut epithelium or the plant root epidermis that generate environments that favour iron bioavailability. For example, plant roots acquire iron mostly from the soil and, when iron deficient, increase iron availability through mechanisms that include rhizosphere acidification and secretion of iron chelators6–9. Yet, the elevated iron bioavailability would also be beneficial for the growth of bacteria that threaten plant health. Here we report that microorganism-associated molecular patterns such as flagellin lead to suppression of root iron acquisition through a localized degradation of the systemic iron-deficiency signalling peptide Iron Man 1 (IMA1) in Arabidopsis thaliana. This response is also elicited when bacteria enter root tissues, but not when they dwell on the outer root surface. IMA1 itself has a role in modulating immunity in root and shoot, affecting the levels of root colonization and the resistance to a bacterial foliar pathogen. Our findings reveal an adaptive molecular mechanism of nutritional immunity that affects iron bioavailability and uptake, as well as immune responses. Microorganism-associated molecular patterns such as flagellin lead to suppression of root iron acquisition through localized degradation of the systemic iron-deficiency signalling peptide Iron Man 1 in Arabidopsis thaliana.",

    "abstract": "Alkenes are indispensable feedstocks in chemistry. Functionalization at both carbons of the alkene—1,2-difunctionalization—is part of chemistry curricula worldwide1. Although difunctionalization at distal positions has been reported2–4, it typically relies on designer substrates featuring directing groups and/or stabilizing features, all of which determine the ultimate site of bond formation5–7. Here we introduce a method for the direct 1,3-difunctionalization of alkenes, based on a concept termed ‘charge relocation’, which enables stereodivergent access to 1,3-difunctionalized products of either syn- or anti-configuration from unactivated alkenes, without the need for directing groups or stabilizing features. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated in the synthesis of the pulmonary toxin 4-ipomeanol and its derivatives. We introduce a method for the direct 1,3-difunctionalization of alkenes, based on a concept termed ‘charge relocation’, which enables stereodivergent access to 1,3-difunctionalized products of either syn- or anti-configuration from unactivated alkenes.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown reduced performance in plants that are surrounded by neighbours of the same species1,2, a phenomenon known as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD)3. A long-held ecological hypothesis posits that CNDD is more pronounced in tropical than in temperate forests4,5, which increases community stabilization, species coexistence and the diversity of local tree species6,7. Previous analyses supporting such a latitudinal gradient in CNDD8,9 have suffered from methodological limitations related to the use of static data10–12. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of latitudinal CNDD patterns using dynamic mortality data to estimate species-site-specific CNDD across 23 sites. Averaged across species, we found that stabilizing CNDD was present at all except one site, but that average stabilizing CNDD was not stronger toward the tropics. However, in tropical tree communities, rare and intermediate abundant species experienced stronger stabilizing CNDD than did common species. This pattern was absent in temperate forests, which suggests that CNDD influences species abundances more strongly in tropical forests than it does in temperate ones13. We also found that interspecific variation in CNDD, which might attenuate its stabilizing effect on species diversity14,15, was high but not significantly different across latitudes. Although the consequences of these patterns for latitudinal diversity gradients are difficult to evaluate, we speculate that a more effective regulation of population abundances could translate into greater stabilization of tropical tree communities and thus contribute to the high local diversity of tropical forests. An analysis of tree survival data from forest sites worldwide shows that in the tropics, rare tree species experience stronger stabilizing density dependence than common species, wheras no correlation of stabilizing density dependence and abundance exists in the temperate zone.",

    "abstract": "White dwarfs are stellar remnants devoid of a nuclear energy source, gradually cooling over billions of years1,2 and eventually freezing into a solid state from the inside out3,4. Recently, it was discovered that a population of freezing white dwarfs maintains a constant luminosity for a duration comparable with the age of the universe5, signalling the presence of a powerful, yet unknown, energy source that inhibits the cooling. For certain core compositions, the freezing process is predicted to trigger a solid–liquid distillation mechanism, owing to the solid phase being depleted in heavy impurities6–8. The crystals thus formed are buoyant and float up, thereby displacing heavier liquid downward and releasing gravitational energy. Here we show that distillation interrupts the cooling for billions of years and explains all the observational properties of the unusual delayed population. With a steady luminosity surpassing that of some main-sequence stars, these white dwarfs defy their conventional portrayal as dead stars. Our results highlight the existence of peculiar merger remnants9,10 and have profound implications for the use of white dwarfs in dating stellar populations11,12. A population of freezing white dwarf stars maintaining a constant luminosity for a duration comparable with the age of the universe can be explained by a solid–liquid distillation mechanism interrupting cooling for billions of years.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how and why menopause has evolved is a long-standing challenge across disciplines. Females can typically maximize their reproductive success by reproducing for the whole of their adult life. In humans, however, women cease reproduction several decades before the end of their natural lifespan1,2. Although progress has been made in understanding the adaptive value of menopause in humans3,4, the generality of these findings remains unclear. Toothed whales are the only mammal taxon in which menopause has evolved several times5, providing a unique opportunity to test the theories of how and why menopause evolves in a comparative context. Here, we assemble and analyse a comparative database to test competing evolutionary hypotheses. We find that menopause evolved in toothed whales by females extending their lifespan without increasing their reproductive lifespan, as predicted by the ‘live-long’ hypotheses. We further show that menopause results in females increasing their opportunity for intergenerational help by increasing their lifespan overlap with their grandoffspring and offspring without increasing their reproductive overlap with their daughters. Our results provide an informative comparison for the evolution of human life history and demonstrate that the same pathway that led to menopause in humans can also explain the evolution of menopause in toothed whales. A comparative analysis tests competing evolutionary hypotheses in toothed whales in which menopause has evolved many times as females extended their overall lifespan but not their reproductive lifespan, increasing their opportunity for intergenerational help without increasing intergenerational reproductive competition.",

    "abstract": "In response to pathogen infection, gasdermin (GSDM) proteins form membrane pores that induce a host cell death process called pyroptosis1–3. Studies of human and mouse GSDM pores have revealed the functions and architectures of assemblies comprising 24 to 33 protomers4–9, but the mechanism and evolutionary origin of membrane targeting and GSDM pore formation remain unknown. Here we determine a structure of a bacterial GSDM (bGSDM) pore and define a conserved mechanism of pore assembly. Engineering a panel of bGSDMs for site-specific proteolytic activation, we demonstrate that diverse bGSDMs form distinct pore sizes that range from smaller mammalian-like assemblies to exceptionally large pores containing more than 50 protomers. We determine a cryo-electron microscopy structure of a Vitiosangium bGSDM in an active ‘slinky’-like oligomeric conformation and analyse bGSDM pores in a native lipid environment to create an atomic-level model of a full 52-mer bGSDM pore. Combining our structural analysis with molecular dynamics simulations and cellular assays, our results support a stepwise model of GSDM pore assembly and suggest that a covalently bound palmitoyl can leave a hydrophobic sheath and insert into the membrane before formation of the membrane-spanning β-strand regions. These results reveal the diversity of GSDM pores found in nature and explain the function of an ancient post-translational modification in enabling programmed host cell death. Cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics studies of a Vitiosangium gasdermin pore reveal insights into the assembly of this large and diverse family of membrane pore-forming proteins.",

Eukaryotic organisms use a conserved exoribonuclease-mediated mechanism to terminate the mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II)1–5. Here we report two cryogenic electron microscopy structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol II pre-termination transcription complexes bound to the 5′-to-3′ exoribonuclease Rat1 and its partner Rai1. Our structures show that Rat1 displaces the elongation factor Spt5 to dock at the Pol II stalk domain. Rat1 shields the RNA exit channel of Pol II, guides the nascent RNA towards its active centre and stacks three nucleotides at the 5′ terminus of the nascent RNA. The structures further show that Rat1 rotates towards Pol II as it shortens RNA. Our results provide the structural mechanism for the Rat1-mediated termination of mRNA transcription by Pol II in yeast and the exoribonuclease-mediated termination of mRNA transcription in other eukaryotes.

    "abstract": "Large-scale outflows driven by supermassive black holes are thought to have a fundamental role in suppressing star formation in massive galaxies. However, direct observational evidence for this hypothesis is still lacking, particularly in the young universe where star-formation quenching is remarkably rapid1–3, thus requiring effective removal of gas4 as opposed to slow gas heating5,6. Although outflows of ionized gas are frequently detected in massive distant galaxies7, the amount of ejected mass is too small to be able to suppress star formation8,9. Gas ejection is expected to be more efficient in the neutral and molecular phases10, but at high redshift these have only been observed in starbursts and quasars11,12. Here we report JWST spectroscopy of a massive galaxy experiencing rapid quenching at a redshift of 2.445. We detect a weak outflow of ionized gas and a powerful outflow of neutral gas, with a mass outflow rate that is sufficient to quench the star formation. Neither X-ray nor radio activity is detected; however, the presence of a supermassive black hole is suggested by the properties of the ionized gas emission lines. We thus conclude that supermassive black holes are able to rapidly suppress star formation in massive galaxies by efficiently ejecting neutral gas. JWST observations of a massive galaxy at a redshift of 2.45 show a powerful outflow of neutral gas, with a mass outflow rate that is sufficient to shut down star formation.",

    "abstract": "The shaping of human embryos begins with compaction, during which cells come into close contact1,2. Assisted reproductive technology studies indicate that human embryos fail compaction primarily because of defective adhesion3,4. On the basis of our current understanding of animal morphogenesis5,6, other morphogenetic engines, such as cell contractility, could be involved in shaping human embryos. However, the molecular, cellular and physical mechanisms driving human embryo morphogenesis remain uncharacterized. Using micropipette aspiration on human embryos donated to research, we have mapped cell surface tensions during compaction. This shows a fourfold increase of tension at the cell–medium interface whereas cell–cell contacts keep a steady tension. Therefore, increased tension at the cell–medium interface drives human embryo compaction, which is qualitatively similar to compaction in mouse embryos7. Further comparison between human and mouse shows qualitatively similar but quantitively different mechanical strategies, with human embryos being mechanically least efficient. Inhibition of cell contractility and cell–cell adhesion in human embryos shows that, whereas both cellular processes are required for compaction, only contractility controls the surface tensions responsible for compaction. Cell contractility and cell–cell adhesion exhibit distinct mechanical signatures when faulty. Analysing the mechanical signature of naturally failing embryos, we find evidence that non-compacting or partially compacting embryos containing excluded cells have defective contractility. Together, our study shows that an evolutionarily conserved increase in cell contractility is required to generate the forces driving the first morphogenetic movement shaping the human body. Using micropipette aspiration on donated human embryos, cell surface tensions during compaction were mapped, indicating a role for defective cell contractility in poor quality embryos.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, magnetic solids are divided into two main classes—ferromagnets and antiferromagnets with parallel and antiparallel spin orders, respectively. Although normally the antiferromagnets have zero magnetization, in some of them an additional antisymmetric spin–spin interaction arises owing to a strong spin–orbit coupling and results in canting of the spins, thereby producing net magnetization. The canted antiferromagnets combine antiferromagnetic order with phenomena typical of ferromagnets and hold great potential for spintronics and magnonics1–5. In this way, they can be identified as closely related to the recently proposed new class of magnetic materials called altermagnets6–9. Altermagnets are predicted to have strong magneto-optical effects, terahertz-frequency spin dynamics and degeneracy lifting for chiral spin waves10 (that is, all of the effects present in the canted antiferromagnets11,12). Here, by utilizing these unique phenomena, we demonstrate a new functionality of canted spin order for magnonics and show that it facilitates mechanisms converting a magnon at the centre of the Brillouin zone into propagating magnons using nonlinear magnon–magnon interactions activated by an ultrafast laser pulse. Our experimental findings supported by theoretical analysis show that the mechanism is enabled by the spin canting. A study demonstrates a new functionality of canted spin order for magnonics and shows that it facilitates mechanisms for ultrafast nonlinear conversion of magnons.",

However, the details of the interplay between GaN and Mg have remained largely unknown6–11. Here we observe that Mg-intercalated GaN superlattices can form spontaneously by annealing a metallic Mg film on GaN at atmospheric pressure. To our knowledge, this marks the first instance of a two-dimensional metal intercalated into a bulk semiconductor, with each Mg monolayer being intricately inserted between several monolayers of hexagonal GaN. Characterized as an interstitial intercalation, this process induces substantial uniaxial compressive strain perpendicular to the interstitial layers. Consequently, the GaN layers in the Mg-intercalated GaN superlattices exhibit an exceptional elastic strain exceeding −10% (equivalent to a stress of more than 20 GPa), among the highest recorded for thin-film materials12. The strain alters the electronic band structure and greatly enhances hole transport along the compression direction. Furthermore, the Mg sheets induce a unique periodic transition in GaN polarity, generating polarization-field-induced net charges. These characteristics offer fresh insights into semiconductor doping and conductivity enhancement, as well as into elastic strain engineering of nanomaterials and metal–semiconductor superlattices13. The spontaneous formation of magnesium-intercalated gallium nitride superlattices by the interstitial intercalation of two-dimensional magnesium results in considerable compressive strain perpendicular to the layers, leading to enhanced hole transport.",

    "abstract": "To convert intentions into actions, movement instructions must pass from the brain to downstream motor circuits through descending neurons (DNs). These include small sets of command-like neurons that are sufficient to drive behaviours1—the circuit mechanisms for which remain unclear. Here we show that command-like DNs in Drosophila directly recruit networks of additional DNs to orchestrate behaviours that require the active control of numerous body parts. Specifically, we found that command-like DNs previously thought to drive behaviours alone2–4 in fact co-activate larger populations of DNs. Connectome analyses and experimental manipulations revealed that this functional recruitment can be explained by direct excitatory connections between command-like DNs and networks of interconnected DNs in the brain. Descending population recruitment is necessary for behavioural control: DNs with many downstream descending partners require network co-activation to drive complete behaviours and drive only simple stereotyped movements in their absence. These DN networks reside within behaviour-specific clusters that inhibit one another. These results support a mechanism for command-like descending control in which behaviours are generated through the recruitment of increasingly large DN networks that compose behaviours by combining multiple motor subroutines. Command-like descending neurons in Drosophila melanogaster recruit additional descending neuronal networks to co-ordinate behaviours that require multiple motor subroutines controlling numerous body parts.",

Unexpectedly, we identified potent upregulation of the immunoregulatory checkpoint molecule cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) on ILC3s. This pathway was activated by gut microbes and IL-23 in a FOXO1- and STAT3-dependent manner. Mice lacking CTLA-4 on ILC3s exhibited reduced regulatory T cells, elevated inflammatory T cells and more-severe intestinal inflammation. IL-23 induction of CTLA-4+ ILC3s was necessary and sufficient to reduce co-stimulatory molecules and increase PD-L1 bioavailability on intestinal myeloid cells. Finally, human ILC3s upregulated CTLA-4 in response to IL-23 or gut inflammation and correlated with immunoregulation in inflammatory bowel disease. These results reveal ILC3-intrinsic CTLA-4 as an essential checkpoint that restrains the pathological outcomes of IL-23, suggesting that disruption of these lymphocytes, which occurs in inflammatory bowel disease5–7, contributes to chronic inflammation. Subsets of ILC3s upregulate the immunoregulatory checkpoint molecule CTLA-4 after stimulation in a microbiota-dependent manner, and advances to support CTLA-4+ ILC3s may represent a treatment opportunity in IL-23-driven chronic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Oligosaccharides have myriad functions throughout biological processes1,2. Chemical synthesis of these structurally complex molecules facilitates investigation of their functions. With a dense concentration of stereocentres and hydroxyl groups, oligosaccharide assembly through O-glycosylation requires simultaneous control of site, stereo- and chemoselectivities3,4. Chemists have traditionally relied on protecting group manipulations for this purpose5–8, adding considerable synthetic work. Here we report a glycosylation platform that enables selective coupling between unprotected or minimally protected donor and acceptor sugars, producing 1,2-cis-O-glycosides in a catalyst-controlled, site-selective manner. Radical-based activation9 of allyl glycosyl sulfones forms glycosyl bromides. A designed aminoboronic acid catalyst brings this reactive intermediate close to an acceptor through a network of non-covalent hydrogen bonding and reversible covalent B–O bonding interactions, allowing precise glycosyl transfer. The site of glycosylation can be switched with different aminoboronic acid catalysts by affecting their interaction modes with substrates. The method accommodates a wide range of sugar types, amenable to the preparation of naturally occurring sugar chains and pentasaccharides containing 11 free hydroxyls. Experimental and computational studies provide insights into the origin of selectivity outcomes. A glycosylation platform is demonstrated that enables selective coupling between a wide range of unprotected or minimally protected donor and acceptor sugars, producing 1,2-cis-O-glycosides in a catalyst-controlled, site-selective manner.",

    "abstract": "Phonon engineering at gigahertz frequencies forms the foundation of microwave acoustic filters1, acousto-optic modulators2 and quantum transducers3,4. Terahertz phonon engineering could lead to acoustic filters and modulators at higher bandwidth and speed, as well as quantum circuits operating at higher temperatures. Despite their potential, methods for engineering terahertz phonons have been limited due to the challenges of achieving the required material control at subnanometre precision and efficient phonon coupling at terahertz frequencies. Here we demonstrate the efficient generation, detection and manipulation of terahertz phonons through precise integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures. We used few-layer graphene as an ultrabroadband phonon transducer that converts femtosecond near-infrared pulses to acoustic-phonon pulses with spectral content up to 3 THz. A monolayer WSe2 is used as a sensor. The high-fidelity readout was enabled by the exciton–phonon coupling and strong light–matter interactions. By combining these capabilities in a single heterostructure and detecting responses to incident mechanical waves, we performed terahertz phononic spectroscopy. Using this platform, we demonstrate high-Q terahertz phononic cavities and show that a WSe2 monolayer embedded in hexagonal boron nitride can efficiently block the transmission of terahertz phonons. By comparing our measurements to a nanomechanical model, we obtained the force constants at the heterointerfaces. Our results could enable terahertz phononic metamaterials for ultrabroadband acoustic filters and modulators and could open new routes for thermal engineering. In an application of terahertz phonon engineering, terahertz phonons were generated, detected and manipulated through precise integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures.",

    "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects 300 million patients worldwide1,2, in whom virus-specific CD8 T cells by still ill-defined mechanisms lose their function and cannot eliminate HBV-infected hepatocytes3–7. Here we demonstrate that a liver immune rheostat renders virus-specific CD8 T cells refractory to activation and leads to their loss of effector functions. In preclinical models of persistent infection with hepatotropic viruses such as HBV, dysfunctional virus-specific CXCR6+ CD8 T cells accumulated in the liver and, as a characteristic hallmark, showed enhanced transcriptional activity of cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) distinct from T cell exhaustion. In patients with chronic hepatitis B, circulating and intrahepatic HBV-specific CXCR6+ CD8 T cells with enhanced CREM expression and transcriptional activity were detected at a frequency of 12–22% of HBV-specific CD8 T cells. Knocking out the inhibitory CREM/ICER isoform in T cells, however, failed to rescue T cell immunity. This indicates that CREM activity was a consequence, rather than the cause, of loss in T cell function, further supported by the observation of enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) which is upstream of CREM. Indeed, we found that enhanced cAMP–PKA-signalling from increased T cell adenylyl cyclase activity augmented CREM activity and curbed T cell activation and effector function in persistent hepatic infection. Mechanistically, CD8 T cells recognizing their antigen on hepatocytes established close and extensive contact with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, thereby enhancing adenylyl cyclase–cAMP–PKA signalling in T cells. In these hepatic CD8 T cells, which recognize their antigen on hepatocytes, phosphorylation of key signalling kinases of the T cell receptor signalling pathway was impaired, which rendered them refractory to activation. Thus, close contact with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells curbs the activation and effector function of HBV-specific CD8 T cells that target hepatocytes expressing viral antigens by means of the adenylyl cyclase–cAMP–PKA axis in an immune rheostat-like fashion. A liver-intrinsic mechanism is presented that suppresses effective anti-hepatitis virus B responses in mice and humans by rendering virus-specific CD8 T cells refractory to activation causing loss of effector functions.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells frequently alter their lipids to grow and adapt to their environment1–3. Despite the critical functions of lipid metabolism in membrane physiology, signalling and energy production, how specific lipids contribute to tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. Here, using functional genomics and lipidomic approaches, we identified de novo sphingolipid synthesis as an essential pathway for cancer immune evasion. Synthesis of sphingolipids is surprisingly dispensable for cancer cell proliferation in culture or in immunodeficient mice but required for tumour growth in multiple syngeneic models. Blocking sphingolipid production in cancer cells enhances the anti-proliferative effects of natural killer and CD8+ T cells partly via interferon-γ (IFNγ) signalling. Mechanistically, depletion of glycosphingolipids increases surface levels of IFNγ receptor subunit 1 (IFNGR1), which mediates IFNγ-induced growth arrest and pro-inflammatory signalling. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis synergizes with checkpoint blockade therapy to enhance anti-tumour immune response. Altogether, our work identifies glycosphingolipids as necessary and limiting metabolites for cancer immune evasion. Functional genomics and lipidomic analyses reveal that sphingolipid synthesis is required for tumour immune evasion and tumour growth in vivo, mediated in part by the impact of glycosphingolipid synthesis on cell surface expression of IFNγ receptors.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of living lungfishes can inform on the molecular-developmental basis of the Devonian sarcopterygian fish–tetrapod transition. We de novo sequenced the genomes of the African (Protopterus annectens) and South American lungfishes (Lepidosiren paradoxa). The Lepidosiren genome (about 91 Gb, roughly 30 times the human genome) is the largest animal genome sequenced so far and more than twice the size of the Australian (Neoceratodus forsteri)1 and African2 lungfishes owing to enlarged intergenic regions and introns with high repeat content (about 90%). All lungfish genomes continue to expand as some transposable elements (TEs) are still active today. In particular, Lepidosiren’s genome grew extremely fast during the past 100 million years (Myr), adding the equivalent of one human genome every 10 Myr. This massive genome expansion seems to be related to a reduction of PIWI-interacting RNAs and C2H2 zinc-finger and Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-domain protein genes that suppress TE expansions. Although TE abundance facilitates chromosomal rearrangements, lungfish chromosomes still conservatively reflect the ur-tetrapod karyotype. Neoceratodus’ limb-like fins still resemble those of their extinct relatives and remained phenotypically static for about 100 Myr. We show that the secondary loss of limb-like appendages in the Lepidosiren–Protopterus ancestor was probably due to loss of sonic hedgehog limb-specific enhancers. We find that massive genome expansion seems to be related to a reduction of PIWI-interacting RNAs and C2H2 zinc-finger and KRAB-domain protein genes that suppress transposable element expansion, and lungfish chromosomes still conservatively reflect the ur-tetrapod karyotype.",

    "abstract": "Crystallographic phase engineering plays an important part in the precise control of the physical and electronic properties of materials. In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs), phase engineering using chemical lithiation with the organometallization agent n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), to convert the semiconducting 2H (trigonal) to the metallic 1T (octahedral) phase, has been widely explored for applications in areas such as transistors, catalysis and batteries1–15. Although this chemical phase engineering can be performed at ambient temperatures and pressures, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and the use of n-BuLi raises notable safety concerns. Here we optically visualize the archetypical phase transition from the 2H to the 1T phase in mono- and bilayer 2D TMDs and discover that this reaction can be accelerated by up to six orders of magnitude using low-power illumination at 455 nm. We identify that the above-gap illumination improves the rate-limiting charge-transfer kinetics through a photoredox process. We use this method to achieve rapid and high-quality phase engineering of TMDs and demonstrate that this methodology can be harnessed to inscribe arbitrary phase patterns with diffraction-limited edge resolution into few-layer TMDs. Finally, we replace pyrophoric n-BuLi with safer polycyclic aromatic organolithiation agents and show that their performance exceeds that of n-BuLi as a phase transition agent. Our work opens opportunities for exploring the in situ characterization of electrochemical processes and paves the way for sustainably scaling up materials and devices by photoredox phase engineering. Chemical lithiation of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides can be accelerated by up to six orders of magnitude using low-power illumination and a variety of phase transition agents.",

    "abstract": "The brain functions as a prediction machine, utilizing an internal model of the world to anticipate sensations and the outcomes of our actions. Discrepancies between expected and actual events, referred to as prediction errors, are leveraged to update the internal model and guide our attention towards unexpected events1–10. Despite the importance of prediction-error signals for various neural computations across the brain, surprisingly little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms responsible for their implementation. Here we describe a thalamocortical disinhibitory circuit that is required for generating sensory prediction-error signals in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We show that violating animals’ predictions by an unexpected visual stimulus preferentially boosts responses of the layer 2/3 V1 neurons that are most selective for that stimulus. Prediction errors specifically amplify the unexpected visual input, rather than representing non-specific surprise or difference signals about how the visual input deviates from the animal’s predictions. This selective amplification is implemented by a cooperative mechanism requiring thalamic input from the pulvinar and cortical vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) inhibitory interneurons. In response to prediction errors, VIP neurons inhibit a specific subpopulation of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons that gate excitatory pulvinar input to V1, resulting in specific pulvinar-driven response amplification of the most stimulus-selective neurons in V1. Therefore, the brain prioritizes unpredicted sensory information by selectively increasing the salience of unpredicted sensory features through the synergistic interaction of thalamic input and neocortical disinhibitory circuits. Experiments in mice show that a cortico-thalamic circuit generates prediction-error signals in primary visual cortex that amplify visual input that deviates from animals’ expectations.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of agriculture triggered a rapid shift towards starch-rich diets in human populations1. Amylase genes facilitate starch digestion, and increased amylase copy number has been observed in some modern human populations with high-starch intake2, although evidence of recent selection is lacking3,4. Here, using 94 long-read haplotype-resolved assemblies and short-read data from approximately 5,600 contemporary and ancient humans, we resolve the diversity and evolutionary history of structural variation at the amylase locus. We find that amylase genes have higher copy numbers in agricultural populations than in fishing, hunting and pastoral populations. We identify 28 distinct amylase structural architectures and demonstrate that nearly identical structures have arisen recurrently on different haplotype backgrounds throughout recent human history. AMY1 and AMY2A genes each underwent multiple duplication/deletion events with mutation rates up to more than 10,000-fold the single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation rate, whereas AMY2B gene duplications share a single origin. Using a pangenome-based approach, we infer structural haplotypes across thousands of humans identifying extensively duplicated haplotypes at higher frequency in modern agricultural populations. Leveraging 533 ancient human genomes, we find that duplication-containing haplotypes (with more gene copies than the ancestral haplotype) have rapidly increased in frequency over the past 12,000 years in West Eurasians, suggestive of positive selection. Together, our study highlights the potential effects of the agricultural revolution on human genomes and the importance of structural variation in human adaptation. The impact of structural variation on the evolution of the amylase genes is explored using human pangenome resources and ancient DNA data.",

    "abstract": "Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Risk of cardiovascular events depends on cumulative lifetime exposure to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and, independently, on the time course of exposure to LDL-C, with early exposure being associated with a higher risk1. Furthermore, LDL-C fluctuations are associated with ASCVD outcomes2–4. However, the precise mechanisms behind this increased ASCVD risk are not understood. Here we find that early intermittent feeding of mice on a high-cholesterol Western-type diet (WD) accelerates atherosclerosis compared with late continuous exposure to the WD, despite similar cumulative circulating LDL-C levels. We find that early intermittent hyperlipidaemia alters the number and homeostatic phenotype of resident-like arterial macrophages. Macrophage genes with altered expression are enriched for genes linked to human ASCVD in genome-wide association studies. We show that LYVE1+ resident macrophages are atheroprotective, and identify biological pathways related to actin filament organization, of which alteration accelerates atherosclerosis. Using the Young Finns Study, we show that exposure to cholesterol early in life is significantly associated with the incidence and size of carotid atherosclerotic plaques in mid-adulthood. In summary, our results identify early intermittent exposure to cholesterol as a strong determinant of accelerated atherosclerosis, highlighting the importance of optimal control of hyperlipidaemia early in life, and providing insights into the underlying biological mechanisms. This knowledge will be essential to designing effective therapeutic strategies to combat ASCVD. Early intermittent feeding of mice with a high-cholesterol Western-type diet accelerates atherosclerosis compared with late continuous exposure to the Western-type diet, despite similar cumulative circulating LDL-C levels.",

    "abstract": "Early amniote development is highly self-organized, capable of adapting to interference through local and long-range cell–cell interactions. This process, called embryonic regulation1, has been well illustrated in experiments on avian embryos, in which subdividing the epiblast disk into different parts not only redirects cell fates to eventually form a complete and well-proportioned embryo at its original location, but also leads to the self-organization of additional, fully formed embryos2,3 in the other separated parts. The cellular interactions underlying embryonic self-organization are widely believed to be mediated by molecular signals, yet the identity of such signals is unclear. Here, by analysing intact and mechanically perturbed quail embryos, we show that the mechanical forces that drive embryogenesis self-organize, with contractility locally self-activating and the ensuing tension acting as a long-range inhibitor. This mechanical feedback governs the persistent pattern of tissue flows that shape the embryo4–6 and also steers the concomitant emergence of embryonic territories by modulating gene expression, ensuring the formation of a single embryo under normal conditions, yet allowing the emergence of multiple, well-proportioned embryos after perturbations. Thus, mechanical forces act at the core of embryonic self-organization, shaping both tissues and gene expression to robustly yet plastically canalize early development. Mechanical forces act at the core of bird embryonic self-organization, shaping both tissues and gene expression to robustly yet plastically canalize early development.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions rely on learned associations between sensory evidence and appropriate actions, involving the filtering and integration of relevant inputs to prepare and execute timely responses1,2. Despite the distributed nature of task-relevant representations3–10, it remains unclear how transformations between sensory input, evidence integration, motor planning and execution are orchestrated across brain areas and dimensions of neural activity. Here we addressed this question by recording brain-wide neural activity in mice learning to report changes in ambiguous visual input. After learning, evidence integration emerged across most brain areas in sparse neural populations that drive movement-preparatory activity. Visual responses evolved from transient activations in sensory areas to sustained representations in frontal-motor cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain and cerebellum, enabling parallel evidence accumulation. In areas that accumulate evidence, shared population activity patterns encode visual evidence and movement preparation, distinct from movement-execution dynamics. Activity in movement-preparatory subspace is driven by neurons integrating evidence, which collapses at movement onset, allowing the integration process to reset. Across premotor regions, evidence-integration timescales were independent of intrinsic regional dynamics, and thus depended on task experience. In summary, learning aligns evidence accumulation to action preparation in activity dynamics across dozens of brain regions. This leads to highly distributed and parallelized sensorimotor transformations during decision-making. Our work unifies concepts from decision-making and motor control fields into a brain-wide framework for understanding how sensory evidence controls actions. Brain-wide recordings in mice show that learning leads to sensory evidence integration in many brain areas simultaneously, allowing sensory input to drive global movement preparatory dynamics, which collapse upon movement onset.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria defend against phage infection through a variety of antiphage defence systems1. Many defence systems were recently shown to deplete cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in response to infection, by cleaving NAD+ into ADP-ribose (ADPR) and nicotinamide2–7. It was demonstrated that NAD+ depletion during infection deprives the phage of this essential molecule and impedes phage replication. Here we show that a substantial fraction of phages possess enzymatic pathways allowing reconstitution of NAD+ from its degradation products in infected cells. We describe NAD+ reconstitution pathway 1 (NARP1), a two-step pathway in which one enzyme phosphorylates ADPR to generate ADPR pyrophosphate (ADPR-PP), and the second enzyme conjugates ADPR-PP and nicotinamide to generate NAD+. Phages encoding NARP1 can overcome a diverse set of defence systems, including Thoeris, DSR1, DSR2, SIR2–HerA and SEFIR, all of which deplete NAD+ as part of their defensive mechanism. Phylogenetic analyses show that NARP1 is primarily encoded on phage genomes, suggesting a phage-specific function in countering bacterial defences. A second pathway, NARP2, allows phages to overcome bacterial defences by building NAD+ using metabolites different from ADPR-PP. Our findings reveal a unique immune evasion strategy in which viruses rebuild molecules depleted by defence systems, thus overcoming host immunity. A study shows that many phages are capable of evading antiphage defence systems of bacteria by reconstituting NAD+ from its degradation products in infected cells.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are luminous bursts of soft X-rays from the nuclei of galaxies, repeating on timescales of hours to weeks1–5. The mechanism behind these rare systems is uncertain, but most theories involve accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) undergoing instabilities6–8 or interacting with a stellar object in a close orbit9–11. It has been suggested that this disk could be created when the SMBH disrupts a passing star8,11, implying that many QPEs should be preceded by observable tidal disruption events (TDEs). Two known QPE sources show long-term decays in quiescent luminosity consistent with TDEs4,12 and two observed TDEs have exhibited X-ray flares consistent with individual eruptions13,14. TDEs and QPEs also occur preferentially in similar galaxies15. However, no confirmed repeating QPEs have been associated with a spectroscopically confirmed TDE or an optical TDE observed at peak brightness. Here we report the detection of nine X-ray QPEs with a mean recurrence time of approximately 48 h from AT2019qiz, a nearby and extensively studied optically selected TDE16. We detect and model the X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission from the accretion disk and show that an orbiting body colliding with this disk provides a plausible explanation for the QPEs. The detection and modelling of nine X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions from a nearby tidal disruption event shows that these eruptions arise in accretion disks around massive black holes, left behind by tidally disrupted stars, and that an orbiting body colliding with this disk is a plausible explanation for the X-ray variability.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine signalling modes differ in kinetics and spatial patterns of receptor activation1,2. How these modes contribute to motor function, motivation and learning has long been debated3–21. Here we show that action-potential-induced dopamine release is dispensable for movement initiation but supports reward-oriented behaviour. We generated mice with dopamine-neuron-specific knockout of the release site organizer protein RIM to disrupt action-potential-induced dopamine release. In these mice, rapid in vivo dopamine dynamics were strongly impaired, but baseline dopamine persisted and fully supported spontaneous movement. Conversely, reserpine-mediated dopamine depletion or blockade of dopamine receptors disrupted movement initiation. The dopamine precursor l-DOPA reversed reserpine-induced bradykinesia without restoring fast dopamine dynamics, a result that substantiated the conclusion that these dynamics are dispensable for movement initiation. In contrast to spontaneous movement, reward-oriented behaviour was impaired in dopamine-neuron-specific RIM knockout mice. In conditioned place preference and two-odour discrimination tasks, the mice effectively learned to distinguish the cues, which indicates that reward-based learning persists after RIM ablation. However, the performance vigour was reduced. During probabilistic cue-reward association, dopamine dynamics and conditioned responses assessed through anticipatory licking were disrupted. These results demonstrate that action-potential-induced dopamine release is dispensable for motor function and subsecond precision of movement initiation but promotes motivation and performance during reward-guided behaviours. Experiments using conditional RIM1 and RIM2 knockout mice and acute pharmacological manipulations clarify the role of rapid dopamine dynamics, whereby these dynamics are dispensable for movement initiation but important for reward-guided conditioned behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Various bacteria are suggested to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) development1–5, including pks+ Escherichia coli, which produces the genotoxin colibactin that induces characteristic mutational signatures in host epithelial cells6. However, it remains unclear how the highly unstable colibactin molecule is able to access host epithelial cells to cause harm. Here, using the microbiota-dependent ZEB2-transgenic mouse model of invasive CRC7, we demonstrate that the oncogenic potential of pks+ E. coli critically depends on bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells, mediated by the type 1 pilus adhesin FimH and the F9 pilus adhesin FmlH. Blocking bacterial adhesion using a pharmacological FimH inhibitor attenuates colibactin-mediated genotoxicity and CRC exacerbation. We also show that allelic switching of FimH strongly influences the genotoxic potential of pks+ E. coli and can induce a genotoxic gain-of-function in the probiotic strain Nissle 1917. Adhesin-mediated epithelial binding subsequently allows the production of the genotoxin colibactin in close proximity to host epithelial cells, which promotes DNA damage and drives CRC development. These findings present promising therapeutic routes for the development of anti-adhesive therapies aimed at mitigating colibactin-induced DNA damage and inhibiting the initiation and progression of CRC, particularly in individuals at risk for developing CRC. The oncogenic potential of pks+ Escherichia coli depends critically on bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells mediated by the type 1 pilus adhesin FimH and the F9 pilus adhesin FmlH.",

    "abstract": "Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to transform the way we move1–14, but current state-of-the-art controllers cannot accommodate the rich set of possible human behaviours that range from cyclic and predictable to transitory and unstructured. We introduce a task-agnostic controller that assists the user on the basis of instantaneous estimates of lower-limb biological joint moments from a deep neural network. By estimating both hip and knee moments in-the-loop, our approach provided multi-joint, coordinated assistance through our autonomous, clothing-integrated exoskeleton. When deployed during 28 activities, spanning cyclic locomotion to unstructured tasks (for example, passive meandering and high-speed lateral cutting), the network accurately estimated hip and knee moments with an average R2 of 0.83 relative to ground truth. Further, our approach significantly outperformed a best-case task classifier-based method constructed from splines and impedance parameters. When tested on ten activities (including level walking, running, lifting a 25 lb (roughly 11 kg) weight and lunging), our controller significantly reduced user energetics (metabolic cost or lower-limb biological joint work depending on the task) relative to the zero torque condition, ranging from 5.3 to 19.7%, without any manual controller modifications among activities. Thus, this task-agnostic controller can enable exoskeletons to aid users across a broad spectrum of human activities, a necessity for real-world viability. A task-agnostic controller assists the user on the basis of instantaneous estimates of lower-limb biological joint moments from a deep neural network so exoskeletons can aid users across a broad spectrum of human activities.",

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies with antibodies blocking immune checkpoint molecules are clinically active across multiple cancer entities and have markedly improved cancer treatment1. Yet, response rates are still limited, and tumour progression commonly occurs2. Soluble and cell-bound factors in the tumour microenvironment negatively affect cancer immunity. Recently, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a cytokine that is abundantly produced by many cancer types, was shown to interfere with antitumour immune response. In preclinical cancer models, GDF-15 blockade synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1-mediated checkpoint inhibition3. In a first-in-human phase 1–2a study (GDFATHER-1/2a trial, \n                NCT04725474\n                \n              ), patients with advanced cancers refractory to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (termed generally as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractoriness) were treated with the neutralizing anti-GDF-15 antibody visugromab (CTL-002) in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Here we show that durable and deep responses were achieved in some patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancer, two cancer entities identified as frequently immunosuppressed by GDF-15 in an in silico screening of approximately 10,000 tumour samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Increased levels of tumour infiltration, proliferation, interferon-γ-related signalling and granzyme B expression by cytotoxic T cells were observed in response to treatment. Neutralizing GDF-15 holds promise in overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer. A study reporting the results of a clinical trial co-administering the GDF-15-blocking antibody visugromab with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab demonstrates that neutralizing GDF-15 can overcome resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Lithocholic acid (LCA) is accumulated in mammals during calorie restriction and it can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to slow down ageing1. However, the molecular details of how LCA activates AMPK and induces these biological effects are unclear. Here we show that LCA enhances the activity of sirtuins to deacetylate and subsequently inhibit vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase), which leads to AMPK activation through the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway. Proteomics analyses of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) identified TUB-like protein 3 (TULP3), a sirtuin-interacting protein2, as a LCA receptor. In detail, LCA-bound TULP3 allosterically activates sirtuins, which then deacetylate the V1E1 subunit of v-ATPase on residues K52, K99 and K191. Muscle-specific expression of a V1E1 mutant (3KR), which mimics the deacetylated state, strongly activates AMPK and rejuvenates muscles in aged mice. In nematodes and flies, LCA depends on the TULP3 homologues tub-1 and ktub, respectively, to activate AMPK and extend lifespan and healthspan. Our study demonstrates that activation of the TULP3–sirtuin–v-ATPase–AMPK pathway by LCA reproduces the benefits of calorie restriction. The molecular mechanism underlying how lithocholic acid recapitulates the lifespan and healthspan benefits of calorie restriction is revealed to involve TULP3, sirtuins, v-ATPase and AMPK.",

    "abstract": "Moiré superlattices based on van der Waals bilayers1–4 created at small twist angles lead to a long wavelength pattern with approximate translational symmetry. At large twist angles (θt), moiré patterns are, in general, incommensurate except for a few discrete angles. Here we show that large-angle twisted bilayers offer distinctly different platforms. More specifically, by using twisted tungsten diselenide bilayers, we create the incommensurate dodecagon quasicrystals at θt = 30° and the commensurate moiré crystals at θt = 21.8° and 38.2°. Valley-resolved scanning tunnelling spectroscopy shows disparate behaviours between moiré crystals (with translational symmetry) and quasicrystals (with broken translational symmetry). In particular, the K valley shows rich electronic structures exemplified by the formation of mini-gaps near the valence band maximum. These discoveries demonstrate that bilayers with large twist angles offer a design platform to explore moiré physics beyond those formed with small twist angles. Using valley-resolved scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, twisted WSe2 bilayers are studied, including incommensurate dodecagon quasicrystals at 30° and commensurate moiré crystals at 21.8° and 38.2°.",

    "abstract": "Optical frequency-comb sources, which emit perfectly periodic and coherent waveforms of light1, have recently rapidly progressed towards chip-scale integrated solutions. Among them, two classes are particularly significant—semiconductor Fabry–Perót lasers2–6 and passive ring Kerr microresonators7–9. Here we merge the two technologies in a ring semiconductor laser10,11 and demonstrate a paradigm for the formation of free-running solitons, called Nozaki–Bekki solitons. These dissipative waveforms emerge in a family of travelling localized dark pulses, known within the complex Ginzburg–Landau equation12–14. We show that Nozaki–Bekki solitons are structurally stable in a ring laser and form spontaneously with tuning of the laser bias, eliminating the need for an external optical pump. By combining conclusive experimental findings and a complementary elaborate theoretical model, we reveal the salient characteristics of these solitons and provide guidelines for their generation. Beyond the fundamental soliton circulating inside the ring laser, we demonstrate multisoliton states as well, verifying their localized nature and offering an insight into formation of soliton crystals15. Our results consolidate a monolithic electrically driven platform for direct soliton generation and open the door for a research field at the junction of laser multimode dynamics and Kerr parametric processes. Free-running stable optical dissipative solitons, called Nozaki–Bekki solitons, are created in a ring semiconductor laser; their spontaneous formation with tuning of laser bias eliminates the need for an external optical pump.",

    "abstract": "An essential ingredient for the production of Majorana fermions for use in quantum computing is topological superconductivity1,2. As bulk topological superconductors remain elusive, the most promising approaches exploit proximity-induced superconductivity3, making systems fragile and difficult to realize4–7. Due to their intrinsic topology8, Weyl semimetals are also potential candidates1,2, but have always been connected with bulk superconductivity, leaving the possibility of intrinsic superconductivity of their topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, practically without attention, even from the theory side. Here, by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we identify topological Fermi arcs on two opposing surfaces of the non-centrosymmetric Weyl material trigonal PtBi2 (ref. 9). We show these states become superconducting at temperatures around 10 K. Remarkably, the corresponding coherence peaks appear as the strongest and sharpest excitations ever detected by photoemission from solids. Our findings indicate that superconductivity in PtBi2 can occur exclusively at the surface, rendering it a possible platform to host Majorana modes in intrinsically topological superconductor–normal metal–superconductor Josephson junctions. We provide evidence for superconducting topological Fermi arcs in PbBi2—a Weyl semimetal previously studied mostly for its bulk properties—from which Marjorama fermions could be derived for research in quantum computers.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are a major constituent of human genes, occupying approximately half of the intronic space. During pre-messenger RNA synthesis, intronic TEs are transcribed along with their host genes but rarely contribute to the final mRNA product because they are spliced out together with the intron and rapidly degraded. Paradoxically, TEs are an abundant source of RNA-processing signals through which they can create new introns1, and also functional2 or non-functional chimeric transcripts3. The rarity of these events implies the existence of a resilient splicing code that is able to suppress TE exonization without compromising host pre-mRNA processing. Here we show that SAFB proteins protect genome integrity by preventing retrotransposition of L1 elements while maintaining splicing integrity, via prevention of the exonization of previously integrated TEs. This unique dual role is possible because of L1’s conserved adenosine-rich coding sequences that are bound by SAFB proteins. The suppressive activity of SAFB extends to tissue-specific, giant protein-coding cassette exons, nested genes and Tigger DNA transposons. Moreover, SAFB also suppresses LTR/ERV elements in species in which they are still active, such as mice and flies. A significant subset of splicing events suppressed by SAFB in somatic cells are activated in the testis, coinciding with low SAFB expression in postmeiotic spermatids. Reminiscent of the division of labour between innate and adaptive immune systems that fight external pathogens, our results uncover SAFB proteins as an RNA-based, pattern-guided, non-adaptive defence system against TEs in the soma, complementing the RNA-based, adaptive Piwi-interacting RNA pathway of the germline. SAFB proteins protect genome integrity by preventing retrotransposition of L1 elements yet maintaining splicing integrity, via prevention of the exonization of previously integrated transposable elements, a major constituent of human genes.",

    "abstract": "High-intensity femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser enable pump–probe experiments for the investigation of electronic and nuclear changes during light-induced reactions. On timescales ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds and for a variety of biological systems, time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) has provided detailed structural data for light-induced isomerization, breakage or formation of chemical bonds and electron transfer1,2. However, all ultrafast TR-SFX studies to date have employed such high pump laser energies that nominally several photons were absorbed per chromophore3–17. As multiphoton absorption may force the protein response into non-physiological pathways, it is of great concern18,19 whether this experimental approach20 allows valid conclusions to be drawn vis-à-vis biologically relevant single-photon-induced reactions18,19. Here we describe ultrafast pump–probe SFX experiments on the photodissociation of carboxymyoglobin, showing that different pump laser fluences yield markedly different results. In particular, the dynamics of structural changes and observed indicators of the mechanistically important coherent oscillations of the Fe–CO bond distance (predicted by recent quantum wavepacket dynamics21) are seen to depend strongly on pump laser energy, in line with quantum chemical analysis. Our results confirm both the feasibility and necessity of performing ultrafast TR-SFX pump–probe experiments in the linear photoexcitation regime. We consider this to be a starting point for reassessing both the design and the interpretation of ultrafast TR-SFX pump–probe experiments20 such that mechanistically relevant insight emerges. Ultrafast time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography is used to investigate a photodissociation reaction in a protein, revealing the strong impact of the pump laser fluence on the structural changes  and the reaction mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Reversible modification of target proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) is widely used by eukaryotic cells to control protein fate and cell behaviour1. UFM1 is a UBL that predominantly modifies a single lysine residue on a single ribosomal protein, uL24 (also called RPL26), on ribosomes at the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)2,3. UFM1 conjugation (UFMylation) facilitates the rescue of 60S ribosomal subunits (60S) that are released after ribosome-associated quality-control-mediated splitting of ribosomes that stall during co-translational translocation of secretory proteins into the ER3,4. Neither the molecular mechanism by which the UFMylation machinery achieves such precise target selection nor how this ribosomal modification promotes 60S rescue is known. Here we show that ribosome UFMylation in vivo occurs on free 60S and we present sequential cryo-electron microscopy snapshots of the heterotrimeric UFM1 E3 ligase (E3(UFM1)) engaging its substrate uL24. E3(UFM1) binds the L1 stalk, empty transfer RNA-binding sites and the peptidyl transferase centre through carboxy-terminal domains of UFL1, which results in uL24 modification more than 150 Å away. After catalysing UFM1 transfer, E3(UFM1) remains stably bound to its product, UFMylated 60S, forming a C-shaped clamp that extends all the way around the 60S from the transfer RNA-binding sites to the polypeptide tunnel exit. Our structural and biochemical analyses suggest a role for E3(UFM1) in post-termination release and recycling of the large ribosomal subunit from the ER membrane. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal details of how UFM1 conjugation and deconjugation mediate ribosome recycling and quality control.",

    "abstract": "Distinct brain and behavioural states are associated with organized neural population dynamics that are thought to serve specific cognitive functions1–3. Memory replay events, for example, occur during synchronous population events called sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus while mice are in an ‘offline’ behavioural state, enabling cognitive mechanisms such as memory consolidation and planning4–11. But how does the brain re-engage with the external world during this behavioural state and permit access to current sensory information or promote new memory formation? Here we found that the hippocampal dentate spike, an understudied population event that frequently occurs between sharp-wave ripples12, may underlie such a mechanism. We show that dentate spikes are associated with distinctly elevated brain-wide firing rates, primarily observed in higher order networks, and couple to brief periods of arousal. Hippocampal place coding during dentate spikes aligns to the mouse’s current spatial location, unlike the memory replay accompanying sharp-wave ripples. Furthermore, inhibiting neural activity during dentate spikes disrupts associative memory formation. Thus, dentate spikes represent a distinct brain state and support memory during non-locomotor behaviour, extending the repertoire of cognitive processes beyond the classical offline functions. The hippocampal dentate spike, an understudied population event that frequently occurs between sharp-wave ripples, may underlie a mechanism re-engaging the brain with the external world during synchronous population events, and support memory during non-locomotor behaviour.",

Here we report the development of optical clocks with the requisite combination of size, performance and environmental insensitivity for operation on mobile platforms.

Three of these clocks operated continuously aboard a naval ship in the Pacific Ocean for 20 days while accruing timing errors below 300 ps per day. The clocks have comparable performance to active hydrogen masers in one-tenth the volume. Operating high-performance clocks at sea has been historically challenging and continues to be critical for navigation. This demonstration marks a significant technological advancement that heralds the arrival of future optical timekeeping networks.

    "abstract": "Chiral molecules, used in applications such as enantioselective photocatalysis1, circularly polarized light detection2 and emission3 and molecular switches4,5, exist in two geometrical configurations that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. These so-called (R) and (S) enantiomers exhibit different physical and chemical properties when interacting with other chiral entities. Attosecond technology might enable influence over such interactions, given that it can probe and even direct electron motion within molecules on the intrinsic electronic timescale6 and thereby control reactivity7–9. Electron currents in photoexcited chiral molecules have indeed been predicted to enable enantiosensitive molecular orientation10, but electron-driven chiral dynamics in neutral molecules have not yet been demonstrated owing to the lack of ultrashort, non-ionizing and perturbative light pulses. Here we use time-resolved photoelectron circular dichroism (TR-PECD)11–15 with an unprecedented temporal resolution of 2.9 fs to map the coherent electronic motion initiated by ultraviolet (UV) excitation of neutral chiral molecules. We find that electronic beatings between Rydberg states lead to periodic modulations of the chiroptical response on the few-femtosecond timescale, showing a sign inversion in less than 10 fs. Calculations validate this and also confirm that the combination of the photoinduced chiral current with a circularly polarized probe pulse realizes an enantioselective filter of molecular orientations following photoionization. We anticipate that our approach will enable further investigations of ultrafast electron dynamics in chiral systems and reveal a route towards enantiosensitive charge-directed reactivity. Time-resolved photoelectron circular dichroism with a temporal resolution of 2.9 fs is used to track the ultrafast electron dynamics following ultraviolet excitation of neutral chiral molecules, which generate chiral currents that exhibit periodic rotation direction reversal.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing challenge is how to formulate proteins and vaccines to retain function during storage and transport and to remove the burdens of cold-chain management. Any solution must be practical to use, with the protein being released or applied using clinically relevant triggers. Advanced biologic therapies are distributed cold, using substantial energy, limiting equitable distribution in low-resource countries and placing responsibility on the user for correct storage and handling. Cold-chain management is the best solution at present for protein transport but requires substantial infrastructure and energy. For example, in research laboratories, a single freezer at −80 °C consumes as much energy per day as a small household1. Of biological (protein or cell) therapies and all vaccines, 75% require cold-chain management; the cost of cold-chain management in clinical trials has increased by about 20% since 2015, reflecting this complexity. Bespoke formulations and excipients are now required, with trehalose2, sucrose or polymers3 widely used, which stabilize proteins by replacing surface water molecules and thereby make denaturation thermodynamically less likely; this has enabled both freeze-dried proteins and frozen proteins. For example, the human papilloma virus vaccine requires aluminium salt adjuvants to function, but these render it unstable against freeze–thaw4, leading to a very complex and expensive supply chain. Other ideas involve ensilication5 and chemical modification of proteins6. In short, protein stabilization is a challenge with no universal solution7,8. Here we designed a stiff hydrogel that stabilizes proteins against thermal denaturation even at 50 °C, and that can, unlike present technologies, deliver pure, excipient-free protein by mechanically releasing it from a syringe. Macromolecules can be loaded at up to 10 wt% without affecting the mechanism of release. This unique stabilization and excipient-free release synergy offers a practical, scalable and versatile solution to enable the low-cost, cold-chain-free and equitable delivery of therapies worldwide. A stiff hydrogel gel is presented that encapsulates and stabilizes proteins without additives or excipients and uses mechanical strain to release them, offering low-cost and versatile delivery of therapies.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression in Arabidopsis is regulated by more than 1,900 transcription factors (TFs), which have been identified genome-wide by the presence of well-conserved DNA-binding domains. Activator TFs contain activation domains (ADs) that recruit coactivator complexes; however, for nearly all Arabidopsis TFs, we lack knowledge about the presence, location and transcriptional strength of their ADs1. To address this gap, here we use a yeast library approach to experimentally identify Arabidopsis ADs on a proteome-wide scale, and find that more than half of the Arabidopsis TFs contain an AD. We annotate 1,553 ADs, the vast majority of which are, to our knowledge, previously unknown. Using the dataset generated, we develop a neural network to accurately predict ADs and to identify sequence features that are necessary to recruit coactivator complexes. We uncover six distinct combinations of sequence features that result in activation activity, providing a framework to interrogate the subfunctionalization of ADs. Furthermore, we identify ADs in the ancient AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR family of TFs, revealing that AD positioning is conserved in distinct clades. Our findings provide a deep resource for understanding transcriptional activation, a framework for examining function in intrinsically disordered regions and a predictive model of ADs. A high-throughput yeast-based assay is used to identify more than 1,500 activation domains (ADs) in Arabidopsis transcription factors, and a deep learning approach applied to this dataset can predict AD activity on the basis of sequence features.",

    "abstract": "Helical spin structures are expressions of magnetically induced chirality, entangling the dipolar and magnetic orders in materials1–4. The recent discovery of helical van der Waals multiferroics down to the ultrathin limit raises prospects of large chiral magnetoelectric correlations in two dimensions5,6. However, the exact nature and magnitude of these couplings have remained unknown so far. Here we perform a precision measurement of the dynamical magnetoelectric coupling for an enantiopure domain in an exfoliated van der Waals multiferroic. We evaluate this interaction in resonance with a collective electromagnon mode, capturing the impact of its oscillations on the dipolar and magnetic orders of the material with a suite of ultrafast optical probes. Our data show a giant natural optical activity at terahertz frequencies, characterized by quadrature modulations between the electric polarization and magnetization components. First-principles calculations further show that these chiral couplings originate from the synergy between the non-collinear spin texture and relativistic spin–orbit interactions, resulting in substantial enhancements over lattice-mediated effects. Our findings highlight the potential for intertwined orders to enable unique functionalities in the two-dimensional limit and pave the way for the development of van der Waals magnetoelectric devices operating at terahertz speeds. Precision measurement of the dynamical magnetoelectric coupling in an exfoliated van der Waals multiferroic shows a giant natural optical activity at terahertz frequencies.",

    "abstract": "Of the approximately 25 directly imaged planets to date, all are younger than 500 Myr, and all but six are younger than 100 Myr (ref. 1). Eps Ind A (HD209100, HIP108870) is a K5V star of roughly solar age (recently derived as 3.7–5.7 Gyr (ref. 2) and \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${3.5}_{-1.3}^{+0.8}$$\n                \n               Gyr (ref. 3)). A long-term radial-velocity trend4,5 and an astrometric acceleration6,7 led to claims of a giant planet2,8,9 orbiting the nearby star (3.6384 ± 0.0013 pc; ref. 10). Here we report JWST coronagraphic images which reveal a giant exoplanet that is consistent with these radial and astrometric measurements but inconsistent with the previously claimed planet properties. The new planet has a temperature of approximately 275 K and is remarkably bright at 10.65 and 15.50 µm. Non-detections between 3.5 and 5.0 µm indicate an unknown opacity source in the atmosphere, possibly suggesting a high-metallicity, high carbon-to-oxygen ratio planet. The best-fitting temperature of the planet is consistent with theoretical thermal evolution models, which were previously untested at this temperature range. The data indicate that this is probably the only giant planet in the system, and therefore we refer to it as b, despite it having significantly different orbital properties than the previously claimed planet b. We report on JWST images of a temperate super-Jupiter in the system Epsilon Ind A—a K5V star at a distance of just 3.6 pc—in the mid-infrared.",

    "abstract": "Fasting is associated with a range of health benefits1–6. How fasting signals elicit changes in the proteome to establish metabolic programmes remains poorly understood. Here we show that hepatocytes selectively remodel the translatome while global translation is paradoxically downregulated during fasting7,8. We discover that phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (P-eIF4E) is induced during fasting. We show that P-eIF4E is responsible for controlling the translation of genes involved in lipid catabolism and the production of ketone bodies. Inhibiting P-eIF4E impairs ketogenesis in response to fasting and a ketogenic diet. P-eIF4E regulates those messenger RNAs through a specific translation regulatory element within their 5′ untranslated regions (5′ UTRs). Our findings reveal a new signalling property of fatty acids, which are elevated during fasting. We found that fatty acids bind and induce AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) kinase activity that in turn enhances the phosphorylation of MAP kinase-interacting protein kinase (MNK), the kinase that phosphorylates eIF4E. The AMPK–MNK–eIF4E axis controls ketogenesis, revealing a new lipid-mediated kinase signalling pathway that links ketogenesis to translation control. Certain types of cancer use ketone bodies as an energy source9,10 that may rely on P-eIF4E. Our findings reveal that on a ketogenic diet, treatment with eFT508 (also known as tomivosertib; a P-eIF4E inhibitor) restrains pancreatic tumour growth. Thus, our findings unveil a new fatty acid-induced signalling pathway that activates selective translation, which underlies ketogenesis and provides a tailored diet intervention therapy for cancer. During fasting, hepatocytes selectively remodel the translatome while global translation is downregulated, showing a new signalling property of fatty acids and that, on a ketogenic diet, treatment with eFT508 (also known as tomivosertib; a P-eIF4E inhibitor) restrains pancreatic tumour growth.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito-borne diseases affect hundreds of millions of people annually and disproportionately impact the developing world1,2. One mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, is a primary vector of viruses that cause dengue, yellow fever and Zika. The attraction of Ae. aegypti female mosquitos to humans requires integrating multiple cues, including CO2 from breath, organic odours from skin and visual cues, all sensed at mid and long ranges, and other cues sensed at very close range3–6. Here we identify a cue that Ae. aegypti use as part of their sensory arsenal to find humans. We demonstrate that Ae. aegypti sense the infrared (IR) radiation emanating from their targets and use this information in combination with other cues for highly effective mid-range navigation. Detection of thermal IR requires the heat-activated channel TRPA1, which is expressed in neurons at the tip of the antenna. Two opsins are co-expressed with TRPA1 in these neurons and promote the detection of lower IR intensities. We propose that radiant energy causes local heating at the end of the antenna, thereby activating temperature-sensitive receptors in thermosensory neurons. The realization that thermal IR radiation is an outstanding mid-range directional cue expands our understanding as to how mosquitoes are exquisitely effective in locating hosts. The mosquito Aedes aegypti can detect humans through infrared radiation for highly effective mid-range navigation.",

    "abstract": "Human genetic studies of common variants have provided substantial insight into the biological mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing1. Here we report analyses of rare protein-coding variants in 106,973 women from the UK Biobank study, implicating genes with effects around five times larger than previously found for common variants (ETAA1, ZNF518A, PNPLA8, PALB2 and SAMHD1). The SAMHD1 association reinforces the link between ovarian ageing and cancer susceptibility1, with damaging germline variants being associated with extended reproductive lifespan and increased all-cause cancer risk in both men and women. Protein-truncating variants in ZNF518A are associated with shorter reproductive lifespan—that is, earlier age at menopause (by 5.61 years) and later age at menarche (by 0.56 years). Finally, using 8,089 sequenced trios from the 100,000 Genomes Project (100kGP), we observe that common genetic variants associated with earlier ovarian ageing associate with an increased rate of maternally derived de novo mutations. Although we were unable to replicate the finding in independent samples from the deCODE study, it is consistent with the expected role of DNA damage response genes in maintaining the genetic integrity of germ cells. This study provides evidence of genetic links between age of menopause and cancer risk. Analyses focusing on protein-truncating variants from 106,973 women from in the UK Biobank identify variants in genes that reinforce the link between reproductive lifespan in women and cancer risk in both sexes.",

High electromechanical responses are typically found in materials with strong structural instabilities, conventionally achieved by two strategies—morphotropic phase boundaries7 and nanoscale structural heterogeneity8. Here we demonstrate a different strategy to accomplish ultrahigh electromechanical response by inducing extreme structural instability from competing antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders. Guided by the phase diagram and theoretical calculations, we designed the coexistence of antiferroelectric orthorhombic and ferroelectric rhombohedral phases in sodium niobate thin films. These films show effective piezoelectric coefficients above 5,000 pm V−1 because of electric-field-induced antiferroelectric–ferroelectric phase transitions. Our results provide a general approach to design and exploit antiferroelectric materials for electromechanical devices. Ultrahigh electromechanical response is accomplished by inducing extreme structural instability from competing antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders.",

    "abstract": "Walking is a complex motor programme involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and the spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical component of walking control. Despite progress in identifying neurons driving halting1–6, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking state remain unclear. Here, using connectome-informed models7–9 and functional studies, we explain two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism (‘walk-OFF’) relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, whereas the second mechanism (‘brake’) relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. We show that two neurons that deploy the walk-OFF mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward walking or turning. The brake neurons, by constrast, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking-promotion neurons and increasing the resistance at the leg joints. We characterized two behavioural contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the walk-OFF mechanism was engaged for halting during feeding and the brake mechanism was engaged for halting and stability during grooming. Two halting mechanisms, ‘walk-OFF’ and ‘brake’, are shown to be engaged by distinct neural circuits in Drosophila, in a context dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs) have emerged as indispensable tools in chemosensing applications1–4. ISFETs operate by converting changes in the composition of chemical solutions into electrical signals, making them ideal for environmental monitoring5,6, healthcare diagnostics7 and industrial process control8. Recent advancements in ISFET technology, including functionalized multiplexed arrays and advanced data analytics, have improved their performance9,10. Here we illustrate the advantages of incorporating machine learning algorithms to construct predictive models using the extensive datasets generated by ISFET sensors for both classification and quantification tasks. This integration also sheds new light on the working of ISFETs beyond what can be derived solely from human expertise. Furthermore, it mitigates practical challenges associated with cycle-to-cycle, sensor-to-sensor and chip-to-chip variations, paving the way for the broader adoption of ISFETs in commercial applications. Specifically, we use data generated by non-functionalized graphene-based ISFET arrays to train artificial neural networks that possess a remarkable ability to discern instances of food fraud, food spoilage and food safety concerns. We anticipate that the fusion of compact, energy-efficient and reusable graphene-based ISFET technology with robust machine learning algorithms holds the potential to revolutionize the detection of subtle chemical and environmental changes, offering swift, data-driven insights applicable across a wide spectrum of applications.

    "abstract": "Cancer driver mutations often show distinct temporal acquisition patterns, but the biological basis for this, if any, remains unknown. RAS mutations occur invariably late in the course of acute myeloid leukaemia, upon progression or relapsed/refractory disease1–6. Here, by using human leukaemogenesis models, we first show that RAS mutations are obligatory late events that need to succeed earlier cooperating mutations. We provide the mechanistic explanation for this in a requirement for mutant RAS to specifically transform committed progenitors of the myelomonocytic lineage (granulocyte–monocyte progenitors) harbouring previously acquired driver mutations, showing that advanced leukaemic clones can originate from a different cell type in the haematopoietic hierarchy than ancestral clones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RAS-mutant leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) give rise to monocytic disease, as observed frequently in patients with poor responses to treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. We show that this is because RAS-mutant LSCs, in contrast to RAS-wild-type LSCs, have altered BCL2 family gene expression and are resistant to venetoclax, driving clinical resistance and relapse with monocytic features. Our findings demonstrate that a specific genetic driver shapes the non-genetic cellular hierarchy of acute myeloid leukaemia by imposing a specific LSC target cell restriction and critically affects therapeutic outcomes in patients. We find that RAS-mutant leukaemia stem cells are resistant to venetoclax, driving clinical resistance and relapse with monocytic features.",

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events detected from beyond the Milky Way. FRB emission characteristics favour highly magnetized neutron stars, or magnetars, as the sources1, as evidenced by FRB-like bursts from a galactic magnetar2,3, and the star-forming nature of FRB host galaxies4,5. However, the processes that produce FRB sources remain unknown6. Although galactic magnetars are often linked to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe)7, it is uncertain what determines which supernovae result in magnetars. The galactic environments of FRB sources can be used to investigate their progenitors. Here, we present the stellar population properties of 30 FRB host galaxies discovered by the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110). Our analysis shows a marked deficit of low-mass FRB hosts compared with the occurrence of star formation in the Universe, implying that FRBs are a biased tracer of star formation, preferentially selecting massive star-forming galaxies. This bias may be driven by galaxy metallicity, which is positively correlated with stellar mass8. Metal-rich environments may favour the formation of magnetar progenitors through stellar mergers9,10, as higher-metallicity stars are less compact and more likely to fill their Roche lobes, leading to unstable mass transfer. Although massive stars do not have convective interiors to generate strong magnetic fields by dynamo11, merger remnants are thought to have the requisite internal magnetic-field strengths to result in magnetars11,12. The preferential occurrence of FRBs in massive star-forming galaxies suggests that a core-collapse supernova of merger remnants preferentially forms magnetars. Analysis of the stellar population properties of 30 host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) suggests an abundance of FRBs in massive star-forming galaxies, and implies that the formation of FRB sources—magnetars—is linked to core-collapse supernovae of stellar merger remnants.",

    "abstract": "Organic halides are highly useful compounds in chemical synthesis, in which the halide serves as a versatile functional group for elimination, substitution and cross-coupling reactions with transition metals or photocatalysis1–3. However, the activation of carbon–fluorine (C–F) bonds—the most commercially abundant organohalide and found in polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), or ‘forever chemicals’—is much rarer. Current approaches based on photoredox chemistry for the activation of small-molecule C–F bonds are limited by the substrates and transition metal catalysts needed4. A general method for the direct activation of organofluorines would have considerable value in organic and environmental chemistry. Here we report an organic photoredox catalyst system that can efficiently reduce C–F bonds to generate carbon-centred radicals, which can then be intercepted for hydrodefluorination (swapping F for H) and cross-coupling reactions. This system enables the general use of organofluorines as synthons under mild reaction conditions. We extend this method to the defluorination of PFAS and fluorinated polymers, a critical challenge in the breakdown of persistent and environmentally damaging forever chemicals. An organic photoredox catalyst system efficiently reduces C–F bonds, generating carbon-centred radicals for hydrodefluorination and cross-coupling reactions, enabling the general use of organofluorines as synthons and breaking down environmentally damaging forever chemicals.",

    "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention used to promote health and longevity1,2. CR causes various metabolic changes in both the production and the circulation of metabolites1; however, it remains unclear which altered metabolites account for the physiological benefits of CR. Here we use metabolomics to analyse metabolites that exhibit changes in abundance during CR and perform subsequent functional validation. We show that lithocholic acid (LCA) is one of the metabolites that alone can recapitulate the effects of CR in mice. These effects include activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), enhancement of muscle regeneration and rejuvenation of grip strength and running capacity. LCA also activates AMPK and induces life-extending and health-extending effects in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. As C. elegans and D. melanogaster are not able to synthesize LCA, these results indicate that these animals are able to transmit the signalling effects of LCA once administered. Knockout of AMPK abrogates LCA-induced phenotypes in all the three animal models. Together, we identify that administration of the CR-mediated upregulated metabolite LCA alone can confer anti-ageing benefits to metazoans in an AMPK-dependent manner. Lithocholic acid is one of the metabolites upregulated during calorie restriction, and treatment of mice, worms and flies with this bile acid alone can reproduce the health benefits of calorie restriction.",

Although the structure of the protein capsid is known for many virus species1,2, the three-dimensional organization of viral genomes has mostly eluded experimental probes3,4. Here we report all-atom structural models of an HK97 virion5, including its entire 39,732 base pair genome, obtained through multiresolution simulations. Mimicking the action of a packaging motor6, the genome was gradually loaded into the capsid. The structure of the packaged capsid was then refined through simulations of increasing resolution, which produced a 26 million atom model of the complete virion, including water and ions confined within the capsid. DNA packaging occurs through a loop extrusion mechanism7 that produces globally different configurations of the packaged genome and gives each viral particle individual traits. Multiple microsecond-long all-atom simulations characterized the effect of the packaged genome on capsid structure, internal pressure, electrostatics and diffusion of water, ions and DNA, and revealed the structural imprints of the capsid onto the genome. Our approach can be generalized to obtain complete all-atom structural models of other virus species, thereby potentially revealing new drug targets at the genome–capsid interface. Multiresolution computational simulations generate all-atom models of a complete packaged virus particle.",

Typically, heteroatoms or aromatic substructures are required in the substrates and reagents to facilitate an efficient interaction with the chiral catalyst. Confined acids have recently been introduced as tools for homogenous asymmetric catalysis, specifically to enable the processing of small unbiased substrates1. However, asymmetric reactions in which both substrate and product are purely aliphatic hydrocarbons have not previously been catalysed by such super strong and confined acids. We describe here an imidodiphosphorimidate-catalysed asymmetric Wagner–Meerwein shift of aliphatic alkenyl cycloalkanes to cycloalkenes with excellent regio- and enantioselectivity. Despite their long history and high relevance for chemical synthesis and biosynthesis, Wagner–Meerwein reactions utilizing purely aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as those originally reported by Wagner and Meerwein, had previously eluded asymmetric catalysis.

    "abstract": "Survival requires the selection of appropriate behaviour in response to threats, and dysregulated defensive reactions are associated with psychiatric illnesses such as post-traumatic stress and panic disorder1. Threat-induced behaviours, including freezing and flight, are controlled by neuronal circuits in the central amygdala (CeA)2; however, the source of neuronal excitation of the CeA that contributes to high-intensity defensive responses is unknown. Here we used a combination of neuroanatomical mapping, in vivo calcium imaging, functional manipulations and electrophysiology to characterize a previously unknown projection from the dorsal peduncular (DP) prefrontal cortex to the CeA. DP-to-CeA neurons are glutamatergic and specifically target the medial CeA, the main amygdalar output nucleus mediating conditioned responses to threat. Using a behavioural paradigm that elicits both conditioned freezing and flight, we found that CeA-projecting DP neurons are activated by high-intensity threats in a context-dependent manner. Functional manipulations revealed that the DP-to-CeA pathway is necessary and sufficient for both avoidance behaviour and flight. Furthermore, we found that DP neurons synapse onto neurons within the medial CeA that project to midbrain flight centres. These results elucidate a non-canonical top-down pathway regulating defensive responses. This study describes a projection from the medial prefrontal cortex to the central amygdala that is involved in the regulation of defensive responses to threat.",

    "abstract": "In conventional Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer superconductors1, electrons with opposite momenta bind into Cooper pairs due to an attractive interaction mediated by phonons in the material. Although superconductivity naturally emerges at thermal equilibrium, it can also emerge out of equilibrium when the system parameters are abruptly changed2–8. The resulting out-of-equilibrium phases are predicted to occur in real materials and ultracold fermionic atoms, but not all have yet been directly observed. Here we realize an alternative way to generate the proposed dynamical phases using cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). Our system encodes the presence or absence of a Cooper pair in a long-lived electronic transition in 88Sr atoms coupled to an optical cavity and represents interactions between electrons as photon-mediated interactions through the cavity9,10. To fully explore the phase diagram, we manipulate the ratio between the single-particle dispersion and the interactions after a quench and perform real-time tracking of the subsequent dynamics of the superconducting order parameter using nondestructive measurements. We observe regimes in which the order parameter decays to zero (phase I)3,4, assumes a non-equilibrium steady-state value (phase II)2,3 or exhibits persistent oscillations (phase III)2,3. This opens up exciting prospects for quantum simulation, including the potential to engineer unconventional superconductors and to probe beyond mean-field effects like the spectral form factor11,12, and for increasing the coherence time for quantum sensing. The dynamical phases of out-of-equilibrium Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer superconductors have been simulated using cold atoms levitated inside an optical cavity.",

    "abstract": "To conserve energy during starvation and stress, many organisms use hibernation factor proteins to inhibit protein synthesis and protect their ribosomes from damage1,2. In bacteria, two families of hibernation factors have been described, but the low conservation of these proteins and the huge diversity of species, habitats and environmental stressors have confounded their discovery3–6. Here, by combining cryogenic electron microscopy, genetics and biochemistry, we identify Balon, a new hibernation factor in the cold-adapted bacterium Psychrobacter urativorans. We show that Balon is a distant homologue of the archaeo-eukaryotic translation factor aeRF1 and is found in 20% of representative bacteria. During cold shock or stationary phase, Balon occupies the ribosomal A site in both vacant and actively translating ribosomes in complex with EF-Tu, highlighting an unexpected role for EF-Tu in the cellular stress response. Unlike typical A-site substrates, Balon binds to ribosomes in an mRNA-independent manner, initiating a new mode of ribosome hibernation that can commence while ribosomes are still engaged in protein synthesis. Our work suggests that Balon–EF-Tu-regulated ribosome hibernation is a ubiquitous bacterial stress-response mechanism, and we demonstrate that putative Balon homologues in Mycobacteria bind to ribosomes in a similar fashion. This finding calls for a revision of the current model of ribosome hibernation inferred from common model organisms and holds numerous implications for how we understand and study ribosome hibernation. A study identifies a new bacterial ribosome hibernation factor, Balon, and describes its association with EF-Tu and its initiation of mRNA-independent hibernation during protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Motor neurons are the final common pathway1 through which the brain controls movement of the body, forming the basic elements from which all movement is composed. Yet how a single motor neuron contributes to control during natural movement remains unclear. Here we anatomically and functionally characterize the individual roles of the motor neurons that control head movement in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Counterintuitively, we find that activity in a single motor neuron rotates the head in different directions, depending on the starting posture of the head, such that the head converges towards a pose determined by the identity of the stimulated motor neuron. A feedback model predicts that this convergent behaviour results from motor neuron drive interacting with proprioceptive feedback. We identify and genetically2 suppress a single class of proprioceptive neuron3 that changes the motor neuron-induced convergence as predicted by the feedback model. These data suggest a framework for how the brain controls movements: instead of directly generating movement in a given direction by activating a fixed set of motor neurons, the brain controls movements by adding bias to a continuing proprioceptive–motor loop. Single motor neurons in Drosophila are stimulated to show that they direct head movements towards specific postures rather than generating fixed movement vectors, suggesting that the brain controls movements through a continuing proprioceptive–motor loop.",

    "abstract": "Climate change could pose an urgent threat to pollinators, with critical ecological and economic consequences. However, for most insect pollinator species, we lack the long-term data and mechanistic evidence that are necessary to identify climate-driven declines and predict future trends. Here we document 16 years of abundance patterns for a hyper-diverse bee assemblage1 in a warming and drying region2, link bee declines with experimentally determined heat and desiccation tolerances, and use climate sensitivity models to project bee communities into the future. Aridity strongly predicted bee abundance for 71% of 665 bee populations (species × ecosystem combinations). Bee taxa that best tolerated heat and desiccation increased the most over time. Models forecasted declines for 46% of species and predicted more homogeneous communities dominated by drought-tolerant taxa, even while total bee abundance may remain unchanged. Such community reordering could reduce pollination services, because diverse bee assemblages typically maximize pollination for plant communities3. Larger-bodied bees also dominated under intermediate to high aridity, identifying body size as a valuable trait for understanding how climate-driven shifts in bee communities influence pollination4. We provide evidence that climate change directly threatens bee diversity, indicating that bee conservation efforts should account for the stress of aridity on bee physiology. A 16-year dataset of abundance patterns of a diverse assemblage of bees in New Mexico, USA predicts declines for many bee species and indicates that drought-tolerant taxa will prevail in a warming and drying climate.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is a nearly universal behaviour with unclear functions1. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposes that sleep is required to renormalize the increases in synaptic number and strength that occur during wakefulness2. Some studies examining either large neuronal populations3 or small patches of dendrites4 have found evidence consistent with the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, but whether sleep merely functions as a permissive state or actively promotes synaptic downregulation at the scale of whole neurons is unclear. Here, by repeatedly imaging all excitatory synapses on single neurons across sleep–wake states of zebrafish larvae, we show that synapses are gained during periods of wake (either spontaneous or forced) and lost during sleep in a neuron-subtype-dependent manner. However, synapse loss is greatest during sleep associated with high sleep pressure after prolonged wakefulness, and lowest in the latter half of an undisrupted night. Conversely, sleep induced pharmacologically during periods of low sleep pressure is insufficient to trigger synapse loss unless adenosine levels are boosted while noradrenergic tone is inhibited. We conclude that sleep-dependent synapse loss is regulated by sleep pressure at the level of the single neuron and that not all sleep periods are equally capable of fulfilling the functions of synaptic homeostasis. Synapses are gained during spontaneous or forced periods of wake and lost during sleep in a neuron-subtype-dependent manner in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Ab initio calculations have an essential role in our fundamental understanding of quantum many-body systems across many subfields, from strongly correlated fermions1–3 to quantum chemistry4–6 and from atomic and molecular systems7–9 to nuclear physics10–14. One of the primary challenges is to perform accurate calculations for systems where the interactions may be complicated and difficult for the chosen computational method to handle. Here we address the problem by introducing an approach called wavefunction matching. Wavefunction matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wavefunctions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible owing to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancellations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations15,16 of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions17,18 and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii and nuclear-matter saturation in ab initio calculations19,20. An approach called wavefunction matching transforms particle interactions so that their wavefunctions match those of easily computable interactions, to allow for calculations of quantum many-body systems that would otherwise be difficult or impossible.",

    "abstract": "Nitrosopumilus maritimus is an ammonia-oxidizing archaeon that is crucial to the global nitrogen cycle1,2. A critical step for nitrogen oxidation is the entrapment of ammonium ions from a dilute marine environment at the cell surface and their subsequent channelling to the cell membrane of N. maritimus. Here we elucidate the structure of the molecular machinery responsible for this process, comprising the surface layer (S-layer), using electron cryotomography and subtomogram averaging from cells. We supplemented our in situ structure of the ammonium-binding S-layer array with a single-particle electron cryomicroscopy structure, revealing detailed features of this immunoglobulin-rich and glycan-decorated S-layer. Biochemical analyses showed strong ammonium binding by the cell surface, which was lost after S-layer disassembly. Sensitive bioinformatic analyses identified similar S-layers in many ammonia-oxidizing archaea, with conserved sequence and structural characteristics. Moreover, molecular simulations and structure determination of ammonium-enriched specimens enabled us to examine the cation-binding properties of the S-layer, revealing how it concentrates ammonium ions on its cell-facing side, effectively acting as a multichannel sieve on the cell membrane. This in situ structural study illuminates the biogeochemically essential process of ammonium binding and channelling, common to many marine microorganisms that are fundamental to the nitrogen cycle. The Nitrosopumilus maritimus surface layer (S-layer) concentrates ammonium ions on its cell-facing side, acting as a multichannel sieve on the cell membrane.",

    "abstract": "Measurements of gene expression or signal transduction activity are conventionally performed using methods that require either the destruction or live imaging of a biological sample within the timeframe of interest. Here we demonstrate an alternative paradigm in which such biological activities are stably recorded to the genome. Enhancer-driven genomic recording of transcriptional activity in multiplex (ENGRAM) is based on the signal-dependent production of prime editing guide RNAs that mediate the insertion of signal-specific barcodes (symbols) into a genomically encoded recording unit. We show how this strategy can be used for multiplex recording of the cell-type-specific activities of dozens to hundreds of cis-regulatory elements with high fidelity, sensitivity and reproducibility. Leveraging signal transduction pathway-responsive cis-regulatory elements, we also demonstrate time- and concentration-dependent genomic recording of WNT, NF-κB and Tet-On activities. By coupling ENGRAM to sequential genome editing via DNA Typewriter1, we stably record information about the temporal dynamics of two orthogonal signalling pathways to genomic DNA. Finally we apply ENGRAM to integratively record the transient activity of nearly 100 transcription factor consensus motifs across daily windows spanning the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into gastruloids, an in vitro model of early mammalian development. Although these are proof-of-concept experiments and much work remains to fully realize the possibilities, the symbolic recording of biological signals or states within cells, to the genome and over time, has broad potential to complement contemporary paradigms for how we make measurements in biological systems. Enhancer-driven genomic recording of transcriptional activity in multiplex (ENGRAM) is used for multiplex recording of the cell-type-specific activities of dozens to hundreds of cis-regulatory elements with high fidelity, sensitivity and reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated transcription due to disruption in histone lysine methylation dynamics is an established contributor to tumorigenesis1,2. However, whether analogous pathologic epigenetic mechanisms act directly on the ribosome to advance oncogenesis is unclear. Here we find that trimethylation of the core ribosomal protein L40 (rpL40) at lysine 22 (rpL40K22me3) by the lysine methyltransferase SMYD5 regulates mRNA translation output to promote malignant progression of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) with lethal peritoneal ascites. A biochemical–proteomics strategy identifies the monoubiquitin fusion protein partner rpL40 (ref. 3) as the principal physiological substrate of SMYD5 across diverse samples. Inhibiting the SMYD5–rpL40K22me3 axis in GAC cell lines reprogrammes protein synthesis to attenuate oncogenic gene expression signatures. SMYD5 and rpL40K22me3 are upregulated in samples from patients with GAC and negatively correlate with clinical outcomes. SMYD5 ablation in vivo in familial and sporadic mouse models of malignant GAC blocks metastatic disease, including peritoneal carcinomatosis. Suppressing SMYD5 methylation of rpL40 inhibits human cancer cell and patient-derived GAC xenograft growth and renders them hypersensitive to inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR. Finally, combining SMYD5 depletion with PI3K–mTOR inhibition and chimeric antigen receptor T cell administration cures an otherwise lethal in vivo mouse model of aggressive GAC-derived peritoneal carcinomatosis. Together, our work uncovers a ribosome-based epigenetic mechanism that facilitates the evolution of malignant GAC and proposes SMYD5 targeting as part of a potential combination therapy to treat this cancer. The lysine methyltransferase SMYD5 and its newly identified substrate ribosomal protein L40 are implicated in the progression of gastric adenocarcinoma, and ablation of SMYD5 prevents metastatic disease in mouse models of this cancer.",

    "abstract": "It is estimated that only 0.02% of disseminated tumour cells are able to seed overt metastases1. While this suggests the presence of environmental constraints to metastatic seeding, the landscape of host factors controlling this process remains largely unclear. Here, combining transposon technology2 and fluorescence niche labelling3, we developed an in vivo CRISPR activation screen to systematically investigate the interactions between hepatocytes and metastatic cells. We identify plexin B2 as a critical host-derived regulator of liver colonization in colorectal and pancreatic cancer and melanoma syngeneic mouse models. We dissect a mechanism through which plexin B2 interacts with class IV semaphorins on tumour cells, leading to KLF4 upregulation and thereby promoting the acquisition of epithelial traits. Our results highlight the essential role of signals from the liver parenchyma for the seeding of disseminated tumour cells before the establishment of a growth-promoting niche. Our findings further suggest that epithelialization is required for the adaptation of CRC metastases to their new tissue environment. Blocking the plexin-B2–semaphorin axis abolishes metastatic colonization of the liver and therefore represents a therapeutic strategy for the prevention of hepatic metastases. Finally, our screening approach, which evaluates host-derived extrinsic signals rather than tumour-intrinsic factors for their ability to promote metastatic seeding, is broadly applicable and lays a framework for the screening of environmental constraints to metastasis in other organs and cancer types. Interactions between plexin B2 on hepatocytes and sempahorins on disseminated tumour cells regulate metastatic seeding in the liver.",

    "abstract": "The long-term physiological consequences of respiratory viral infections, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic—termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)—are rapidly evolving into a major public health concern1–3. While the cellular and molecular aetiologies of these sequelae are poorly defined, increasing evidence implicates abnormal immune responses3–6 and/or impaired organ recovery7–9 after infection. However, the precise mechanisms that link these processes in the context of PASC remain unclear. Here, with insights from three cohorts of patients with respiratory PASC, we established a mouse model of post-viral lung disease and identified an aberrant immune–epithelial progenitor niche unique to fibroproliferation in respiratory PASC. Using spatial transcriptomics and imaging, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8+ T cell–macrophage interactions in impairing alveolar regeneration and driving fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Specifically, IFNγ and TNF derived from CD8+ T cells stimulated local macrophages to chronically release IL-1β, resulting in the long-term maintenance of dysplastic epithelial progenitors and lung fibrosis. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFNγ + TNF or IL-1β markedly improved alveolar regeneration and pulmonary function. In contrast to other approaches, which require early intervention10, we highlight therapeutic strategies to rescue fibrotic disease after the resolution of acute disease, addressing a current unmet need in the clinical management of PASC and post-viral disease. CD8+ T cell–macrophage interactions have a central role in impairing alveolar regeneration and driving fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia in a mouse model of long COVID.",

    "abstract": "Multivesicular bodies are key endosomal compartments implicated in cellular quality control through their degradation of membrane-bound cargo proteins1–3. The ATP-consuming ESCRT protein machinery mediates the capture and engulfment of membrane-bound cargo proteins through invagination and scission of multivesicular-body membranes to form intraluminal vesicles4,5. Here we report that the plant ESCRT component FREE16 forms liquid-like condensates that associate with membranes to drive intraluminal vesicle formation. We use a minimal physical model, reconstitution experiments and in silico simulations to identify the dynamics of this process and describe intermediate morphologies of nascent intraluminal vesicles. Furthermore, we find that condensate-wetting-induced line tension forces and membrane asymmetries are sufficient to mediate scission of the membrane neck without the ESCRT protein machinery or ATP consumption. Genetic manipulation of the ESCRT pathway in several eukaryotes provides additional evidence for condensate-mediated membrane scission in vivo. We find that the interplay between condensate and machinery-mediated scission mechanisms is indispensable for osmotic stress tolerance in plants. We propose that condensate-mediated scission represents a previously undescribed scission mechanism that depends on the physicomolecular properties of the condensate and is involved in a range of trafficking processes. More generally, FREE1 condensate-mediated membrane scission in multivesicular-body biogenesis highlights the fundamental role of wetting in intracellular dynamics and organization. Plant ESCRT component FREE1 forms liquid-like condensates that associate with membranes to drive intraluminal vesicle formation.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic text, often indistinguishable from human-written content, at a scale that can markedly affect the nature of the information ecosystem1–3. Watermarking can help identify synthetic text and limit accidental or deliberate misuse4, but has not been adopted in production systems owing to stringent quality, detectability and computational efficiency requirements. Here we describe SynthID-Text, a production-ready text watermarking scheme that preserves text quality and enables high detection accuracy, with minimal latency overhead. SynthID-Text does not affect LLM training and modifies only the sampling procedure; watermark detection is computationally efficient, without using the underlying LLM. To enable watermarking at scale, we develop an algorithm integrating watermarking with speculative sampling, an efficiency technique frequently used in production systems5. Evaluations across multiple LLMs empirically show that SynthID-Text provides improved detectability over comparable methods, and standard benchmarks and human side-by-side ratings indicate no change in LLM capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of watermarking in large-scale-production systems, we conducted a live experiment that assessed feedback from nearly 20 million Gemini6 responses, again confirming the preservation of text quality. We hope that the availability of SynthID-Text7 will facilitate further development of watermarking and responsible use of LLM systems. A scheme for watermarking the text generated by large language models shows high text quality preservation and detection accuracy and low latency, and is feasible in large-scale-production settings.",

    "abstract": "The chromosomal theory of inheritance dictates that genes on the same chromosome segregate together while genes on different chromosomes assort independently1. Extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are common in cancer and drive oncogene amplification, dysregulated gene expression and intratumoural heterogeneity through random segregation during cell division2,3. Distinct ecDNA sequences, termed ecDNA species, can co-exist to facilitate intermolecular cooperation in cancer cells4. How multiple ecDNA species within a tumour cell are assorted and maintained across somatic cell generations is unclear. Here we show that cooperative ecDNA species are coordinately inherited through mitotic co-segregation. Imaging and single-cell analyses show that multiple ecDNAs encoding distinct oncogenes co-occur and are correlated in copy number in human cancer cells. ecDNA species are coordinately segregated asymmetrically during mitosis, resulting in daughter cells with simultaneous copy-number gains in multiple ecDNA species before any selection. Intermolecular proximity and active transcription at the start of mitosis facilitate the coordinated segregation of ecDNA species, and transcription inhibition reduces co-segregation. Computational modelling reveals the quantitative principles of ecDNA co-segregation and co-selection, predicting their observed distributions in cancer cells. Coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs enables co-amplification of specialized ecDNAs containing only enhancer elements and guides therapeutic strategies to jointly deplete cooperating ecDNA oncogenes. Coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs confers stability to oncogene cooperation and novel gene regulatory circuits, allowing winning combinations of epigenetic states to be transmitted across cell generations. Cooperative species of extrachromosomal DNAs are coordinately inherited through mitotic co-segregation.",

    "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) presents a major challenge for cancer patients. ecDNA renders tumours treatment resistant by facilitating massive oncogene transcription and rapid genome evolution, contributing to poor patient survival1–7. At present, there are no ecDNA-specific treatments. Here we show that enhancing transcription–replication conflict enables targeted elimination of ecDNA-containing cancers. Stepwise analyses of ecDNA transcription reveal pervasive RNA transcription and associated single-stranded DNA, leading to excessive transcription–replication conflicts and replication stress compared with chromosomal loci. Nucleotide incorporation on ecDNA is markedly slower, and replication stress is significantly higher in ecDNA-containing tumours regardless of cancer type or oncogene cargo. pRPA2-S33, a mediator of DNA damage repair that binds single-stranded DNA, shows elevated localization on ecDNA in a transcription-dependent manner, along with increased DNA double strand breaks, and activation of the S-phase checkpoint kinase, CHK1. Genetic or pharmacological CHK1 inhibition causes extensive and preferential tumour cell death in ecDNA-containing tumours. We advance a highly selective, potent and bioavailable oral CHK1 inhibitor, BBI-2779, that preferentially kills ecDNA-containing tumour cells. In a gastric cancer model containing FGFR2 amplified on ecDNA, BBI-2779 suppresses tumour growth and prevents ecDNA-mediated acquired resistance to the pan-FGFR inhibitor infigratinib, resulting in potent and sustained tumour regression in mice. Transcription–replication conflict emerges as a target for ecDNA-directed therapy, exploiting a synthetic lethality of excess to treat cancer. Extrachromosomal DNA makes cancerous tumours resistant to treatment, but this research demonstrates that increasing transcription–replication conflict allows for targeted elimination of cancer cells containing extrachromosomal DNA, and thus sustained tumour regression in mice.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) in combination with endocrine therapy improve the outcomes of patients with hormone-receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and can be used early as first-line treatment or deferred to second-line treatment1–7. Randomized data comparing the use of CDK4/6i in the first- and second-line setting are lacking. The phase 3 SONIA trial (NCT03425838) randomized 1,050 patients who had not received previous therapy for advanced breast cancer to receive CDK4/6i in the first- or second-line setting8. All of the patients received the same endocrine therapy, consisting of an aromatase inhibitor for first-line treatment and fulvestrant for second-line treatment. The primary end point was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression after second-line treatment (progression-free survival 2 (PFS2)). We observed no statistically significant benefit for the use of CDK4/6i as a first-line compared with second-line treatment (median, 31.0 versus 26.8 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.87; 95% confidence interval = 0.74–1.03; P = 0.10). The health-related quality of life was similar in both groups. First-line CDK4/6i use was associated with a longer CDK4/6i treatment duration compared with second-line use (median CDK4/6i treatment duration of 24.6 versus 8.1 months, respectively) and more grade ≥3 adverse events (2,763 versus 1,591, respectively). These data challenge the need for first-line use of a CDK4/6i in all patients. The phase 3 SONIA trial challenges the benefits of using cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors as a first-line compared with second-line treatment.",

    "abstract": "Genomic research that targets large-scale, prospective birth cohorts constitutes an essential strategy for understanding the influence of genetics and environment on human health1. Nonetheless, such studies remain scarce, particularly in Asia. Here we present the phase I genome study of the Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study2 (BIGCS), which encompasses the sequencing and analysis of 4,053 Chinese individuals, primarily composed of trios or mother–infant duos residing in South China. Our analysis reveals novel genetic variants, a high-quality reference panel, and fine-scale local genetic structure within BIGCS. Notably, we identify previously unreported East Asian-specific genetic associations with maternal total bile acid, gestational weight gain and infant cord blood traits. Additionally, we observe prevalent age-specific genetic effects on lipid levels in mothers and infants. In an exploratory intergenerational Mendelian randomization analysis, we estimate the maternal putatively causal and fetal genetic effects of seven adult phenotypes on seven fetal growth-related measurements. These findings illuminate the genetic links between maternal and early-life traits in an East Asian population and lay the groundwork for future research into the intricate interplay of genetics, intrauterine exposures and early-life experiences in shaping long-term health. Analysis of data from the Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study comprising mainly of trios and mother–infant pairs reveals novel East Asian-specific genetic associations with maternal bile acid, gestational weight gain and infant cord blood traits.",

    "abstract": "Magnetars are neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields (≳1014 gauss) that exhibit various X-ray phenomena such as sporadic subsecond bursts, long-term persistent flux enhancements and variable rotation-period derivative1,2. In 2020, a fast radio burst (FRB), akin to cosmological millisecond-duration radio bursts, was detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 (refs. 3–5), confirming the long-suspected association between some FRBs and magnetars. However, the mechanism for FRB generation in magnetars remains unclear. Here we report the X-ray observation of two glitches in SGR 1935+2154 within a time interval of approximately nine hours, bracketing an FRB that occurred on 14 October 20226,7. Each glitch involved a significant increase in the magnetar’s spin frequency, being among the largest abrupt changes in neutron-star rotation8–10 observed so far. Between the glitches, the magnetar exhibited a rapid spin-down phase, accompanied by an increase and subsequent decline in its persistent X-ray emission and burst rate. We postulate that a strong, ephemeral, magnetospheric wind11 provides the torque that rapidly slows the star’s rotation. The trigger for the first glitch couples the star’s crust to its magnetosphere, enhances the various X-ray signals and spawns the wind that alters magnetospheric conditions that might produce the FRB. X-ray observations of two large glitches bracketing a fast radio burst in the active Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 reveal a connection between rapid spin change and radiative behaviours of the magnetar.",

    "abstract": "The ability to detect single photons has led to the advancement of numerous research fields1–11. Although various types of single-photon detector have been developed12, because of two main factors—that is, (1) the need for operating at cryogenic temperature13,14 and (2) the incompatibility with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes15,16—so far, to our knowledge, only Si-based single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)17,18 has gained mainstream success and has been used in consumer electronics. With the growing demand to shift the operation wavelength from near-infrared to short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) for better safety and performance19–21, an alternative solution is required because Si has negligible optical absorption for wavelengths beyond 1 µm. Here we report a CMOS-compatible, high-performing germanium–silicon SPAD operated at room temperature, featuring a noise-equivalent power improvement over the previous Ge-based SPADs22–28 by 2–3.5 orders of magnitude. Key parameters such as dark count rate, single-photon detection probability at 1,310 nm, timing jitter, after-pulsing characteristic time and after-pulsing probability are, respectively, measured as 19 kHz µm−2, 12%, 188 ps, ~90 ns and <1%, with a low breakdown voltage of 10.26 V and a small excess bias of 0.75 V. Three-dimensional point-cloud images are captured with direct time-of-flight technique as proof of concept. This work paves the way towards using single-photon-sensitive SWIR sensors, imagers and photonic integrated circuits in everyday life. A germanium–silicon single-photon avalanche diode operated at room temperature shows a noise-equivalent power improvement over the previous Ge-based single-photon avalanche diodes by 2–3.5 orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection can engender severe B cell lymphoproliferative diseases1,2. The primary infection is often asymptomatic or causes infectious mononucleosis (IM), a self-limiting lymphoproliferative disorder3. Selective vulnerability to EBV has been reported in association with inherited mutations impairing T cell immunity to EBV4. Here we report biallelic loss-of-function variants in IL27RA that underlie an acute and severe primary EBV infection with a nevertheless favourable outcome requiring a minimal treatment. One mutant allele (rs201107107) was enriched in the Finnish population (minor allele frequency = 0.0068) and carried a high risk of severe infectious mononucleosis when homozygous. IL27RA encodes the IL-27 receptor alpha subunit5,6. In the absence of IL-27RA, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 by IL-27 is abolished in T cells. In in vitro studies, IL-27 exerts a synergistic effect on T-cell-receptor-dependent T cell proliferation7 that is deficient in cells from the patients, leading to impaired expansion of potent anti-EBV effector cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. IL-27 is produced by EBV-infected B lymphocytes and an IL-27RA–IL-27 autocrine loop is required for the maintenance of EBV-transformed B cells. This potentially explains the eventual favourable outcome of the EBV-induced viral disease in patients with IL-27RA deficiency. Furthermore, we identified neutralizing anti-IL-27 autoantibodies in most individuals who developed sporadic infectious mononucleosis and chronic EBV infection. These results demonstrate the critical role of IL-27RA–IL-27 in immunity to EBV, but also the hijacking of this defence by EBV to promote the expansion of infected transformed B cells. IL-27RA–IL-27 has a critical role in the immunity to EBV, and this defence is hijacked by Epstein–Barr virus to promote the expansion of infected transformed B cells",

We report the experimental realization of its bosonic analogue2 in a nano-optomechanical network, in which the parametric interactions induce beam-splitter coupling and two-mode squeezing among the nanomechanical modes, analogous to hopping and p-wave pairing in the fermionic case, respectively. This specific structure gives rise to a set of extraordinary phenomena in the bosonic dynamics and transport. We observe quadrature-dependent chiral amplification, exponential scaling of the gain with system size and strong sensitivity to boundary conditions. All these are linked to the unique non-Hermitian topological nature of the bosonic Kitaev chain. We probe the topological phase transition and uncover a rich dynamical phase diagram by controlling interaction phases and amplitudes. Finally, we present an experimental demonstration of an exponentially enhanced response to a small perturbation3,4. These results represent the demonstration of a new synthetic phase of matter whose bosonic dynamics do not have fermionic parallels, and we have established a powerful system for studying non-Hermitian topology and its applications for signal manipulation and sensing. We report the experimental realization of a bosonic Kitaev chain in a nano-optomechanical network.",

    "abstract": "Throughout life, neuronal networks in the mammalian neocortex maintain a balance of excitation and inhibition, which is essential for neuronal computation1,2. Deviations from a balanced state have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and severe disruptions result in epilepsy3–5. To maintain balance, neuronal microcircuits composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons sense alterations in neural activity and adjust neuronal connectivity and function. Here we identify a signalling pathway in the adult mouse neocortex that is activated in response to increased neuronal network activity. Overactivation of excitatory neurons is signalled to the network through an increase in the levels of BMP2, a growth factor that is well known for its role as a morphogen in embryonic development. BMP2 acts on parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons through the transcription factor SMAD1, which controls an array of glutamatergic synapse proteins and components of perineuronal nets. PV-interneuron-specific disruption of BMP2–SMAD1 signalling is accompanied by a loss of glutamatergic innervation in PV cells, underdeveloped perineuronal nets and decreased excitability. Ultimately, this impairment of the functional recruitment of PV interneurons disrupts the cortical excitation–inhibition balance, with mice exhibiting spontaneous epileptic seizures. Our findings suggest that developmental morphogen signalling is repurposed to stabilize cortical networks in the adult mammalian brain. Signalling by the developmental morphogen BMP2 through the transcription factor SMAD1 has a key role in controlling the glutamatergic innervation of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition in the mammalian cortex.",

    "abstract": "Magnetar giant flares are rare explosive events releasing up to 1047 erg in gamma rays in less than 1 second from young neutron stars with magnetic fields up to 1015−16 G (refs. 1,2). Only three such flares have been seen from magnetars in our Galaxy3,4 and in the Large Magellanic Cloud5 in roughly 50 years. This small sample can be enlarged by the discovery of extragalactic events, as for a fraction of a second giant flares reach luminosities above 1046 erg s−1, which makes them visible up to a few tens of megaparsecs. However, at these distances they are difficult to distinguish from short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); much more distant and energetic (1050−53 erg) events, originating in compact binary mergers6. A few short GRBs have been proposed7–11, with different amounts of confidence, as candidate giant magnetar flares in nearby galaxies. Here we report observations of GRB 231115A, positionally coincident with the starburst galaxy M82 (ref. 12). Its spectral properties, along with the length of the burst, the limits on its X-ray and optical counterparts obtained within a few hours, and the lack of a gravitational wave signal, unambiguously qualify this burst as a giant flare from a magnetar in M82. We report observations of GRB 231115A, positionally coincident with the starburst galaxy M82, that unambiguously qualify this burst as a giant flare from a magnetar, which is a rare explosive event releasing gamma rays.",

    "abstract": "Bringing optical microscopy to the shortest possible length and time scales has been a long-sought goal, connecting nanoscopic elementary dynamics with the macroscopic functionalities of condensed matter. Super-resolution microscopy has circumvented the far-field diffraction limit by harnessing optical nonlinearities1. By exploiting linear interaction with tip-confined evanescent light fields2, near-field microscopy3,4 has reached even higher resolution, prompting a vibrant research field by exploring the nanocosm in motion5–19. Yet the finite radius of the nanometre-sized tip apex has prevented access to atomic resolution20. Here we leverage extreme atomic nonlinearities within tip-confined evanescent fields to push all-optical microscopy to picometric spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution. On these scales, we discover an unprecedented and efficient non-classical near-field response, in phase with the vector potential of light and strictly confined to atomic dimensions. This ultrafast signal is characterized by an optical phase delay of approximately π/2 and facilitates direct monitoring of tunnelling dynamics. We showcase the power of our optical concept by imaging nanometre-sized defects hidden to atomic force microscopy and by subcycle sampling of current transients on a semiconducting van der Waals material. Our results facilitate access to quantum light–matter interaction and electronic dynamics at ultimately short spatio-temporal scales in both conductive and insulating quantum materials. All-optical subcycle microscopy is achieved on atomic length scales, with picometric spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution.",

However, its impact is often overlooked in biophysical studies that are typically performed at non-physiological temperatures, potentially leading to inaccurate mechanistic and pharmacological insights. Here we demonstrate temperature-dependent changes in the structure and function of TRPM4, a temperature-sensitive Ca2+-activated ion channel3–7. By studying TRPM4 prepared at physiological temperature using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we identified a ‘warm’ conformation that is distinct from those observed at lower temperatures. This conformation is driven by a temperature-dependent Ca2+-binding site in the intracellular domain, and is essential for TRPM4 function in physiological contexts. We demonstrated that ligands, exemplified by decavanadate (a positive modulator)8 and ATP (an inhibitor)9, bind to different locations of TRPM4 at physiological temperatures than at lower temperatures10,11, and that these sites have bona fide functional relevance. We elucidated the TRPM4 gating mechanism by capturing structural snapshots of its different functional states at physiological temperatures, revealing the channel opening that is not observed at lower temperatures. Our study provides an example of temperature-dependent ligand recognition and modulation of an ion channel, underscoring the importance of studying macromolecules at physiological temperatures. It also provides a potential molecular framework for deciphering how thermosensitive TRPM channels perceive temperature changes. A temperature-dependent Ca2+-binding site in the intracellular domain of TRPM4 is essential for TRPM4 function in physiological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic vesicles are organelles with a precisely defined protein and lipid composition1,2, yet the molecular mechanisms for the biogenesis of synaptic vesicles are mainly unknown. Here we discovered a well-defined interface between the synaptic vesicle V-ATPase and synaptophysin by in situ cryo-electron tomography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of functional synaptic vesicles isolated from mouse brains3. The synaptic vesicle V-ATPase is an ATP-dependent proton pump that establishes the proton gradient across the synaptic vesicle, which in turn drives the uptake of neurotransmitters4,5. Synaptophysin6 and its paralogues synaptoporin7 and synaptogyrin8 belong to a family of abundant synaptic vesicle proteins whose function is still unclear. We performed structural and functional studies of synaptophysin-knockout mice, confirming the identity of synaptophysin as an interaction partner with the V-ATPase. Although there is little change in the conformation of the V-ATPase upon interaction with synaptophysin, the presence of synaptophysin in synaptic vesicles profoundly affects the copy number of V-ATPases. This effect on the topography of synaptic vesicles suggests that synaptophysin assists in their biogenesis. In support of this model, we observed that synaptophysin-knockout mice exhibit severe seizure susceptibility, suggesting an imbalance of neurotransmitter release as a physiological consequence of the absence of synaptophysin. Using cryo-electron tomography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of functional synaptic vesicles, a V-ATPase–synaptophysin interface was found to regulate synaptic vesicle biogenesis and alter seizure susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "All drugs of abuse induce long-lasting changes in synaptic transmission and neural circuit function that underlie substance-use disorders1,2. Another recently appreciated mechanism of neural circuit plasticity is mediated through activity-regulated changes in myelin that can tune circuit function and influence cognitive behaviour3–7. Here we explore the role of myelin plasticity in dopaminergic circuitry and reward learning. We demonstrate that dopaminergic neuronal activity-regulated myelin plasticity is a key modulator of dopaminergic circuit function and opioid reward. Oligodendroglial lineage cells respond to dopaminergic neuronal activity evoked by optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons, optogenetic inhibition of GABAergic neurons, or administration of morphine. These oligodendroglial changes are evident selectively within the ventral tegmental area but not along the axonal projections in the medial forebrain bundle nor within the target nucleus accumbens. Genetic blockade of oligodendrogenesis dampens dopamine release dynamics in nucleus accumbens and impairs behavioural conditioning to morphine. Taken together, these findings underscore a critical role for oligodendrogenesis in reward learning and identify dopaminergic neuronal activity-regulated myelin plasticity as an important circuit modification that is required for opioid reward. Oligodendrogenesis is shown to be involved in reward learning, with dopaminergic neuronal activity-regulated myelin plasticity being an important reward circuit modification.",

    "abstract": "The µ-opioid receptor (µOR) is a well-established target for analgesia1, yet conventional opioid receptor agonists cause serious adverse effects, notably addiction and respiratory depression. These factors have contributed to the current opioid overdose epidemic driven by fentanyl2, a highly potent synthetic opioid. µOR negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) may serve as useful tools in preventing opioid overdose deaths, but promising chemical scaffolds remain elusive. Here we screened a large DNA-encoded chemical library against inactive µOR, counter-screening with active, G-protein and agonist-bound receptor to ‘steer’ hits towards conformationally selective modulators. We discovered a NAM compound with high and selective enrichment to inactive µOR that enhances the affinity of the key opioid overdose reversal molecule, naloxone. The NAM works cooperatively with naloxone to potently block opioid agonist signalling. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we demonstrate that the NAM accomplishes this effect by binding a site on the extracellular vestibule in direct contact with naloxone while stabilizing a distinct inactive conformation of the extracellular portions of the second and seventh transmembrane helices. The NAM alters orthosteric ligand kinetics in therapeutically desirable ways and works cooperatively with low doses of naloxone to effectively inhibit various morphine-induced and fentanyl-induced behavioural effects in vivo while minimizing withdrawal behaviours. Our results provide detailed structural insights into the mechanism of negative allosteric modulation of the µOR and demonstrate how this can be exploited in vivo. A newly discovered negative allosteric modulator of the µ-opioid receptor works together with naloxone to potently block opioid agonist signalling with reduced adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Methane is the second most abundant climate-active gas, and understanding its sources and sinks is an important endeavour in microbiology, biogeochemistry, and climate sciences1,2. For decades, it was thought that methanogenesis, the ability to conserve energy coupled to methane production, was taxonomically restricted to a metabolically specialized group of archaea, the Euryarchaeota1. The discovery of marker genes for anaerobic alkane cycling in metagenome-assembled genomes obtained from diverse habitats has led to the hypothesis that archaeal lineages outside the Euryarchaeota are also involved in methanogenesis3–6. Here we cultured Candidatus Methanosuratincola verstraetei strain LCB70, a member of the archaeal class Methanomethylicia (formerly Verstraetearchaeota) within the phylum Thermoproteota, from a terrestrial hot spring. Growth experiments combined with activity assays, stable isotope tracing, and genomic and transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that this thermophilic archaeon grows by means of methyl-reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Cryo-electron tomography revealed that Ca. M. verstraetei are coccoid cells with archaella and chemoreceptor arrays, and that they can form intercellular bridges connecting two to three cells with continuous cytoplasm and S-layer. The wide environmental distribution of Ca. M. verstraetei suggests that they might play important and hitherto overlooked roles in carbon cycling within diverse anoxic habitats. We demonstrate that the ability to conserve energy coupled to methane production is not restricted to the Euryarchaeota and is much more widespread than originally thought.",

    "abstract": "The noradrenaline transporter (also known as norepinephrine transporter) (NET) has a critical role in terminating noradrenergic transmission by utilizing sodium and chloride gradients to drive the reuptake of noradrenaline (also known as norepinephrine) into presynaptic neurons1–3. It is a pharmacological target for various antidepressants and analgesic drugs4,5. Despite decades of research, its structure and the molecular mechanisms underpinning noradrenaline transport, coupling to ion gradients and non-competitive inhibition remain unknown. Here we present high-resolution complex structures of NET in two fundamental conformations: in the apo state, and bound to the substrate noradrenaline, an analogue of the χ-conotoxin MrlA (χ-MrlAEM), bupropion or ziprasidone. The noradrenaline-bound structure clearly demonstrates the binding modes of noradrenaline. The coordination of Na+ and Cl− undergoes notable alterations during conformational changes. Analysis of the structure of NET bound to χ-MrlAEM provides insight into how conotoxin binds allosterically and inhibits NET. Additionally, bupropion and ziprasidone stabilize NET in its inward-facing state, but they have distinct binding pockets. These structures define the mechanisms governing neurotransmitter transport and non-competitive inhibition in NET, providing a blueprint for future drug design. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the noradrenaline transporter (NET) reveal binding modes of adrenaline, coordination of sodium and chloride ion binding and the binding sites and mechanisms of inhibition by conotoxin, bupropion and ziprasidone.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate transmission and activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors are the fundamental means by which neurons control their excitability and neuroplasticity1. The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is unique among all ligand-gated channels, requiring two ligands—glutamate and glycine—for activation. These receptors function as heterotetrameric ion channels, with the channel opening dependent on the simultaneous binding of glycine and glutamate to the extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, respectively2,3. The exact molecular mechanism for channel gating by the two ligands has been unclear, particularly without structures representing the open channel and apo states. Here we show that the channel gate opening requires tension in the linker connecting the LBD and transmembrane domain (TMD) and rotation of the extracellular domain relative to the TMD. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we captured the structure of the GluN1–GluN2B (GluN1–2B) NMDAR in its open state bound to a positive allosteric modulator. This process rotates and bends the pore-forming helices in GluN1 and GluN2B, altering the symmetry of the TMD channel from pseudofourfold to twofold. Structures of GluN1–2B NMDAR in apo and single-liganded states showed that binding of either glycine or glutamate alone leads to distinct GluN1–2B dimer arrangements but insufficient tension in the LBD–TMD linker for channel opening. This mechanistic framework identifies a key determinant for channel gating and a potential pharmacological strategy for modulating NMDAR activity. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of NMDA receptors in open and apo states reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the dual ligand requirement for its channel gating and opening.",

    "abstract": "The neurotransmitter dopamine has central roles in mood, appetite, arousal and movement1. Despite its importance in brain physiology and function, and as a target for illicit and therapeutic drugs, the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) and mechanisms by which it is inhibited by small molecules and Zn2+ are without a high-resolution structural context. Here we determine the structure of hDAT in a tripartite complex with the competitive inhibitor and cocaine analogue, (–)-2-β-carbomethoxy-3-β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane2 (β-CFT), the non-competitive inhibitor MRS72923 and Zn2+ (ref. 4). We show how β-CFT occupies the central site, approximately halfway across the membrane, stabilizing the transporter in an outward-open conformation. MRS7292 binds to a structurally uncharacterized allosteric site, adjacent to the extracellular vestibule, sequestered underneath the extracellular loop 4 (EL4) and adjacent to transmembrane helix 1b (TM1b), acting as a wedge, precluding movement of TM1b and closure of the extracellular gate. A Zn2+ ion further stabilizes the outward-facing conformation by coupling EL4 to EL2, TM7 and TM8, thus providing specific insights into how Zn2+ restrains the movement of EL4 relative to EL2 and inhibits transport activity. Cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human dopamine transporter in complex with multiple inhibitors illuminates mechanisms of allosteric inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Billions of cells are eliminated daily from our bodies1–4. Although macrophages and dendritic cells are dedicated to migrating and engulfing dying cells and debris, many epithelial and mesenchymal tissue cells can digest nearby apoptotic corpses1–4. How these non-motile, non-professional phagocytes sense and eliminate dying cells while maintaining their normal tissue functions is unclear. Here we explore the mechanisms that underlie their multifunctionality by exploiting the cyclical bouts of tissue regeneration and degeneration during hair cycling. We show that hair follicle stem cells transiently unleash phagocytosis at the correct time and place through local molecular triggers that depend on both lipids released by neighbouring apoptotic corpses and retinoids released by healthy counterparts. We trace the heart of this dual ligand requirement to RARγ–RXRα, whose activation enables tight regulation of apoptotic cell clearance genes and provides an effective, tunable mechanism to offset phagocytic duties against the primary stem cell function of preserving tissue integrity during homeostasis. Finally, we provide functional evidence that hair follicle stem cell-mediated phagocytosis is not simply redundant with professional phagocytes but rather has clear benefits to tissue fitness. Our findings have broad implications for other non-motile tissue stem or progenitor cells that encounter cell death in an immune-privileged niche. The spatiotemporal activation of phagocytosis by hair follicle cells is orchestrated by lipids released from surrounding apoptotic cells and retinoids released by healthy cells.",

Following such injuries, the site is populated by a multitude of peripheral immune cells, including T cells, but a comprehensive understanding of the roles and antigen specificity of these endogenous T cells at the injury site has been lacking. This gap has impeded the development of immune-mediated cellular therapies for CNS injuries. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrated the clonal expansion of mouse and human spinal cord injury-associated T cells and identified that CD4+ T cell clones in mice exhibit antigen specificity towards self-peptides of myelin and neuronal proteins. Leveraging mRNA-based T cell receptor (TCR) reconstitution, a strategy aimed to minimize potential adverse effects from prolonged activation of self-reactive T cells, we generated engineered transiently autoimmune T cells. These cells demonstrated notable neuroprotective efficacy in CNS injury models, in part by modulating myeloid cells via IFNγ. Our findings elucidate mechanistic insight underlying the neuroprotective function of injury-responsive T cells and pave the way for the future development of T cell therapies for CNS injuries. This study presents a new T cell therapy targeting spinal cord injury, providing a potential new approach for injured CNS.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial populations that originate from a single bacterium are not strictly clonal and often contain subgroups with distinct phenotypes1. Bacteria can generate heterogeneity through phase variation—a preprogrammed, reversible mechanism that alters gene expression levels across a population1. One well-studied type of phase variation involves enzyme-mediated inversion of specific regions of genomic DNA2. Frequently, these DNA inversions flip the orientation of promoters, turning transcription of adjacent coding regions on or off2. Through this mechanism, inversion can affect fitness, survival or group dynamics3,4. Here, we describe the development of PhaVa, a computational tool that identifies DNA inversions using long-read datasets. We also identify 372 ‘intragenic invertons’, a novel class of DNA inversions found entirely within genes, in genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates. Intragenic invertons allow a gene to encode two or more versions of a protein by flipping a DNA sequence within the coding region, thereby increasing coding capacity without increasing genome size. We validate ten intragenic invertons in the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and experimentally characterize an intragenic inverton in the thiamine biosynthesis gene thiC. Reversible DNA inversions found entirely within genes enable increased coding capacity by encoding multiple versions of a protein in bacteria and archaea.",

Yet attaining the best sensitivity allowed by quantum theory in the presence of noise is an outstanding challenge, requiring optimal probe-state generation and read-out strategies3–7. Neutral-atom optical clocks8, which are the leading systems for measuring time, have shown recent progress in terms of entanglement generation9–11 but at present lack the control capabilities for realizing such schemes. Here we show universal quantum operations and ancilla-based read-out for ultranarrow optical transitions of neutral atoms. Our demonstration in a tweezer clock platform9,12–16 enables a circuit-based approach to quantum metrology with neutral-atom optical clocks. To this end, we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates with 99.62(3)% fidelity—averaged over symmetric input states—through Rydberg interactions15,17,18 and dynamical connectivity19 for optical clock qubits, which we combine with local addressing16 to implement universally programmable quantum circuits. Using this approach, we generate a near-optimal entangled probe state1,4, a cascade of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states of different sizes, and perform a dual-quadrature5 Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger read-out. We also show repeated fast phase detection with non-destructive conditional reset of clock qubits and minimal dead time between repetitions by implementing ancilla-based quantum logic spectroscopy20 for neutral atoms. Finally, we extend this to multi-qubit parity checks and measurement-based, heralded, Bell-state preparation21–24. Our work lays the foundation for hybrid processor–clock devices with neutral atoms and more generally points to a future of practical applications for quantum processors linked with quantum sensors25. We demonstrate high-fidelity entangling gates, universal quantum operations, and ancilla-based read-out for ultranarrow optical transitions of neutral atoms in a tweezer clock platform.",

    "abstract": "The balance between T helper type 1 (TH1) cells and other TH cells is critical for antiviral and anti-tumour responses1–3, but how this balance is achieved remains poorly understood. Here we dissected the dynamic regulation of TH1 cell differentiation during in vitro polarization, and during in vivo differentiation after acute viral infection. We identified regulators modulating T helper cell differentiation using a unique TH1–TH2 cell dichotomous culture system and systematically validated their regulatory functions through multiple in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screens. We found that RAMP3, a component of the receptor for the neuropeptide CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), has a cell-intrinsic role in TH1 cell fate determination. Extracellular CGRP signalling through the receptor RAMP3–CALCRL restricted the differentiation of TH2 cells, but promoted TH1 cell differentiation through the activation of downstream cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). ATF3 promoted TH1 cell differentiation by inducing the expression of Stat1, a key regulator of TH1 cell differentiation. After viral infection, an interaction between CGRP produced by neurons and RAMP3 expressed on T cells enhanced the anti-viral IFNγ-producing TH1 and CD8+ T cell response, and timely control of acute viral infection. Our research identifies a neuroimmune circuit in which neurons participate in T cell fate determination by producing the neuropeptide CGRP during acute viral infection, which acts on RAMP3-expressing T cells to induce an effective anti-viral TH1 cell response. RAMP3, a component of the receptor for the neuropeptide CGRP, has a cell-intrinsic role in T helper type 1 cell fate determination.",

    "abstract": "Islands are renowned as evolutionary laboratories and support many species that are not found elsewhere1,2. Islands are also of great conservation concern, with many of their endemic species currently threatened or extinct3. Here we present a standardized checklist of all known vascular plants that occur on islands and document their geographical and phylogenetic distribution and conservation risk. Our analyses of 304,103 plant species reveal that 94,052 species (31%) are native to islands, which constitute 5.3% of the global landmass4. Of these, 63,280 are island endemic species, which represent 21% of global plant diversity. Three-quarters of these are restricted to large or isolated islands. Compared with the world flora, island endemics are non-randomly distributed within the tree of life, with a total of 1,005 billion years of unique phylogenetic history with 17 families and 1,702 genera being entirely endemic to islands. Of all vascular plants assigned International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation categories5, 22% are island endemics. Among these endemic species, 51% are threatened, and 55% of all documented global extinctions have occurred on islands. We find that of all single-island endemic species, only 6% occur on islands meeting the United Nations 30×30 conservation target. Urgent measures including habitat restoration, invasive species removal and ex situ programmes are needed to protect the world’s island flora. Our checklist quantifies the uniqueness of island life, provides a basis for future studies of island floras, and highlights the urgent need to take actions for conserving them. A standardized checklist of all known vascular plants shows the distribution of island native and endemic species, identifies their conservation status and highlights the need for actions to conserve them.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens like vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) are a critical threat to human health1. Daptomycin is a last-resort antibiotic for VREfm infections with a novel mode of action2, but for which resistance has been widely reported but is unexplained. Here we show that rifaximin, an unrelated antibiotic used prophylactically to prevent hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver disease3, causes cross-resistance to daptomycin in VREfm. Amino acid changes arising within the bacterial RNA polymerase in response to rifaximin exposure cause upregulation of a previously uncharacterized operon (prdRAB) that leads to cell membrane remodelling and cross-resistance to daptomycin through reduced binding of the antibiotic. VREfm with these mutations are spread globally, making this a major mechanism of resistance. Rifaximin has been considered ‘low risk’ for the development of antibiotic resistance. Our study shows that this assumption is flawed and that widespread rifaximin use, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis, may be compromising the clinical use of daptomycin, a major last-resort intervention for multidrug-resistant pathogens. These findings demonstrate how unanticipated antibiotic cross-resistance can undermine global strategies designed to preserve the clinical use of critical antibiotics. Rifaximin use, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis, may be compromising the clinical use of daptomycin.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is an adipose tissue hormone that maintains homeostatic control of adipose tissue mass by regulating the activity of specific neural populations controlling appetite and metabolism1. Leptin regulates food intake by inhibiting orexigenic agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons and activating anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons2. However, whereas AGRP neurons regulate food intake on a rapid time scale, acute activation of POMC neurons has only a minimal effect3–5. This has raised the possibility that there is a heretofore unidentified leptin-regulated neural population that rapidly suppresses appetite. Here we report the discovery of a new population of leptin-target neurons expressing basonuclin 2 (Bnc2) in the arcuate nucleus that acutely suppress appetite by directly inhibiting AGRP neurons. Opposite to the effect of AGRP activation, BNC2 neuronal activation elicited a place preference indicative of positive valence in hungry but not fed mice. The activity of BNC2 neurons is modulated by leptin, sensory food cues and nutritional status. Finally, deleting leptin receptors in BNC2 neurons caused marked hyperphagia and obesity, similar to that observed in a leptin receptor knockout in AGRP neurons. These data indicate that BNC2-expressing neurons are a key component of the neural circuit that maintains energy balance, thus filling an important gap in our understanding of the regulation of food intake and leptin action. We find that leptin-target neurons expressing basonuclin 2 in the arcuate nucleus that acutely suppress appetite by directly inhibiting agouti-related protein neurons are a key component of the neural circuit that maintains energy balance.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing is an expanding multidisciplinary field encompassing applications including medical devices1, aerospace components2, microfabrication strategies3,4 and artificial organs5. Among additive manufacturing approaches, light-based printing technologies, including two-photon polymerization6, projection micro stereolithography7,8 and volumetric printing9–14, have garnered significant attention due to their speed, resolution or potential applications for biofabrication. Here we introduce dynamic interface printing, a new 3D printing approach that leverages an acoustically modulated, constrained air–liquid boundary to rapidly generate centimetre-scale 3D structures within tens of seconds. Unlike volumetric approaches, this process eliminates the need for intricate feedback systems, specialized chemistry or complex optics while maintaining rapid printing speeds. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique across a broad array of materials and intricate geometries, including those that would be impossible to print with conventional layer-by-layer methods. In doing so, we demonstrate the rapid fabrication of complex structures in situ, overprinting, structural parallelization and biofabrication utility. Moreover, we show that the formation of surface waves at the air–liquid boundary enables enhanced mass transport, improves material flexibility and permits 3D particle patterning. We, therefore, anticipate that this approach will be invaluable for applications where high-resolution, scalable throughput and biocompatible printing is required. Dynamic interface printing is a new form of 3D printing that leverages an acoustically modulated, constrained air–liquid boundary to rapidly generate centimetre-scale 3D structures within tens of seconds.",

    "abstract": "Despite the presence of strategically positioned anatomical barriers designed to protect the central nervous system (CNS), it is not entirely isolated from the immune system1,2. In fact, it remains physically connected to, and can be influenced by, the peripheral immune system1. How the CNS retains such responsiveness while maintaining an immunologically unique status remains an outstanding question. Here, in searching for molecular cues that derive from the CNS and enable its direct communication with the immune system, we identified an endogenous repertoire of CNS-derived regulatory self-peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules in the CNS and at its borders. During homeostasis, these regulatory self-peptides were found to be bound to MHC-II molecules throughout the path of lymphatic drainage from the brain to its surrounding meninges and its draining cervical lymph nodes. However, in neuroinflammatory disease, the presentation of regulatory self-peptides diminished. After boosting the presentation of these regulatory self-peptides, a population of suppressor CD4+ T cells was expanded, controlling CNS autoimmunity in a CTLA-4- and TGFβ-dependent manner. CNS-derived regulatory self-peptides may be the molecular key to ensuring a continuous dialogue between the CNS and the immune system while balancing overt autoreactivity. This sheds light on how we conceptually think about and therapeutically target neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Central nervous system (CNS)-derived regulatory self-peptides are essential for maintaining a continuous dialogue between the CNS and the immune system while balancing overt autoreactivity.",

    "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis is used by the most productive plants on the planet, and compared with the ancestral C3 pathway, it confers a 50% increase in efficiency1. In more than 60 C4 lineages, CO2 fixation is compartmentalized between tissues, and bundle-sheath cells become photosynthetically activated2. How the bundle sheath acquires this alternate identity that allows efficient photosynthesis is unclear. Here we show that changes to bundle-sheath gene expression in C4 leaves are associated with the gain of a pre-existing cis-code found in the C3 leaf. From single-nucleus gene-expression and chromatin-accessibility atlases, we uncover DNA binding with one finger (DOF) motifs that define bundle-sheath identity in the major crops C3 rice and C4 sorghum. Photosynthesis genes that are rewired to be strongly expressed in the bundle-sheath cells of C4 sorghum acquire cis-elements that are recognized by DOFs. Our findings are consistent with a simple model in which C4 photosynthesis is based on the recruitment of an ancestral cis-code associated with bundle-sheath identity. Gain of such elements harnessed a stable patterning of transcription factors between cell types that are found in both C3 and C4 leaves to activate photosynthesis in the bundle sheath. Our findings provide molecular insights into the evolution of the complex C4 pathway, and might also guide the rational engineering of C4 photosynthesis in C3 crops to improve crop productivity and resilience3,4. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and chromatin-accessibility analyses in rice (a C3 plant) and sorghum (a C4 plant) provide insight into how C4 photosynthesis evolved in bundle-sheath cells, revealing that the acquisition of ancestral cis-elements was key.",

    "abstract": "The global aim to move away from fossil fuels requires efficient, inexpensive and sustainable energy storage to fully use renewable energy sources. Thermal energy storage materials1,2 in combination with a Carnot battery3–5 could revolutionize the energy storage sector. However, a lack of stable, inexpensive and energy-dense thermal energy storage materials impedes the advancement of this technology. Here we report the first, to our knowledge, ‘trimodal’ material that synergistically stores large amounts of thermal energy by integrating three distinct energy storage modes—latent, thermochemical and sensible. The eutectic mixture of boric and succinic acids undergoes a transition at around 150 °C, with a record high reversible thermal energy uptake of 394 ± 5% J g−1. We show that the transition involves melting of the boric acid component, which simultaneously undergoes dehydration into metaboric acid and water that dissolve into the liquid. Being retained in the liquid state allows the metaboric acid to readily rehydrate to re-form boric acid on cooling. Thermal stability is demonstrated over 1,000 heating–cooling cycles. The material is very low cost, environmentally friendly and sustainable. This combination of a solid–liquid phase transition and a chemical reaction demonstrated here opens new pathways in the development of high energy capacity materials. A eutectic phase change material composed of boric and succinic acids demonstrates a transition at around 150 °C, with a record high reversible thermal energy uptake and thermal stability over 1,000 heating–cooling cycles.",

    "abstract": "Heavy-fermion metals are prototype systems for observing emergent quantum phases driven by electronic interactions1–6. A long-standing aspiration is the dimensional reduction of these materials to exert control over their quantum phases7–11, which remains a significant challenge because traditional intermetallic heavy-fermion compounds have three-dimensional atomic and electronic structures. Here we report comprehensive thermodynamic and spectroscopic evidence of an antiferromagnetically ordered heavy-fermion ground state in CeSiI, an intermetallic comprising two-dimensional (2D) metallic sheets held together by weak interlayer van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Owing to its vdW nature, CeSiI has a quasi-2D electronic structure, and we can control its physical dimension through exfoliation. The emergence of coherent hybridization of f and conduction electrons at low temperature is supported by the temperature evolution of angle-resolved photoemission and scanning tunnelling spectra near the Fermi level and by heat capacity measurements. Electrical transport measurements on few-layer flakes reveal heavy-fermion behaviour and magnetic order down to the ultra-thin regime. Our work establishes CeSiI and related materials as a unique platform for studying dimensionally confined heavy fermions in bulk crystals and employing 2D device fabrication techniques and vdW heterostructures12 to manipulate the interplay between Kondo screening, magnetic order and proximity effects. We present comprehensive thermodynamic and spectroscopic evidence for an antiferromagnetically ordered heavy-fermion ground state in the van der Waals metal CeSiI.",

However, the distinct neural mechanisms by which threats are learned through social observation (known as observational fear learning1–4 (OFL)) to generate behavioural responses specific to such threats remain poorly understood. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) performs several key functions that may underlie OFL, including processing of social information and disambiguation of threat cues5–11. Here we show that dmPFC is recruited and required for OFL in mice. Using cellular-resolution microendoscopic calcium imaging, we demonstrate that dmPFC neurons code for observational fear and do so in a manner that is distinct from direct experience. We find that dmPFC neuronal activity predicts upcoming switches between freezing and moving state elicited by threat. By combining neuronal circuit mapping, calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings and optogenetics, we show that dmPFC projections to the midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG) constrain observer freezing, and that amygdalar and hippocampal inputs to dmPFC opposingly modulate observer freezing. Together our findings reveal that dmPFC neurons compute a distinct code for observational fear and coordinate long-range neural circuits to select behavioural responses. Studies in mice show that observational fear learning is encoded by neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in a manner that is distinct from the encoding of fear learned by direct experience.",

    "abstract": "Genomic instability arising from defective responses to DNA damage1 or mitotic chromosomal imbalances2 can lead to the sequestration of DNA in aberrant extranuclear structures called micronuclei (MN). Although MN are a hallmark of ageing and diseases associated with genomic instability, the catalogue of genetic players that regulate the generation of MN remains to be determined. Here we analyse 997 mouse mutant lines, revealing 145 genes whose loss significantly increases (n = 71) or decreases (n = 74) MN formation, including many genes whose orthologues are linked to human disease. We found that mice null for Dscc1, which showed the most significant increase in MN, also displayed a range of phenotypes characteristic of patients with cohesinopathy disorders. After validating the DSCC1-associated MN instability phenotype in human cells, we used genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening to define synthetic lethal and synthetic rescue interactors. We found that the loss of SIRT1 can rescue phenotypes associated with DSCC1 loss in a manner paralleling restoration of protein acetylation of SMC3. Our study reveals factors involved in maintaining genomic stability and shows how this information can be used to identify mechanisms that are relevant to human disease biology1. Genetic screening identifies a rich catalogue of regulators of micronucleus formation.",

    "abstract": "Plasma cells produce large quantities of antibodies and so play essential roles in immune protection1. Plasma cells, including a long-lived subset, reside in the bone marrow where they depend on poorly defined microenvironment-linked survival signals1. We show that bone marrow plasma cells use the ligand-gated purinergic ion channel P2RX4 to sense extracellular ATP released by bone marrow osteoblasts through the gap-junction protein pannexin 3 (PANX3). Mutation of Panx3 or P2rx4 each caused decreased serum antibodies and selective loss of bone marrow plasma cells. Compared to their wild-type counterparts, PANX3-null osteoblasts secreted less extracellular ATP and failed to support plasma cells in vitro. The P2RX4-specific inhibitor 5-BDBD abrogated the impact of extracellular ATP on bone marrow plasma cells in vitro, depleted bone marrow plasma cells in vivo and reduced pre-induced antigen-specific serum antibody titre with little posttreatment rebound. P2RX4 blockade also reduced autoantibody titre and kidney disease in two mouse models of humoral autoimmunity. P2RX4 promotes plasma cell survival by regulating endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, as short-term P2RX4 blockade caused accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated regulatory proteins including ATF4 and B-lineage mutation of the pro-apoptotic ATF4 target Chop prevented bone marrow plasma cell demise on P2RX4 inhibition. Thus, generating mature protective and pathogenic plasma cells requires P2RX4 signalling controlled by PANX3-regulated extracellular ATP release from bone marrow niche cells. We demonstrate the role of the ligand-gated purinergic ion channel P2RX4 in maintaining mouse plasma cells in their bone marrow niche.",

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet spectroscopy provides unique insights into the structure of matter with applications ranging from fundamental tests to photochemistry in the Earth’s atmosphere and astronomical observations from space telescopes1–8. At longer wavelengths, dual-comb spectroscopy, using two interfering laser frequency combs, has become a powerful technique capable of simultaneously providing a broad spectral range and very high resolution9. Here we demonstrate a photon-counting approach that can extend the unique advantages of this method into ultraviolet regions where nonlinear frequency conversion tends to be very inefficient. Our spectrometer, based on two frequency combs with slightly different repetition frequencies, provides a wide-span, high-resolution frequency calibration within the accuracy of an atomic clock, and overall consistency of the spectra. We demonstrate a signal-to-noise ratio at the quantum limit and an optimal use of the measurement time, provided by the multiplexed recording of all spectral data on a single photon-counter10. Our initial experiments are performed in the near-ultraviolet and in the visible spectral ranges with alkali-atom vapour, with a power per comb line as low as a femtowatt. This crucial step towards precision broadband spectroscopy at short wavelengths paves the way for extreme-ultraviolet dual-comb spectroscopy, and, more generally, opens up a new realm of applications for photon-level diagnostics, as encountered, for example, when driving single atoms or molecules. We demonstrate a photon-counting approach that extends the unique advantages of spectroscopy with interfering frequency combs into regions where nonlinear frequency conversion tends to be very inefficient, providing a step towards precision broadband spectroscopy at short wavelengths and extreme-ultraviolet dual-comb spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "Ranging from subcellular organelle biogenesis to embryo development, the formation of self-organized structures is a hallmark of living systems. Whereas the emergence of ordered spatial patterns in biology is often driven by intricate chemical signalling that coordinates cellular behaviour and differentiation1–4, purely physical interactions can drive the formation of regular biological patterns such as crystalline vortex arrays in suspensions of spermatozoa5 and bacteria6. Here we discovered a new route to self-organized pattern formation driven by physical interactions, which creates large-scale regular spatial structures with multiscale ordering. Specifically we found that dense bacterial living matter spontaneously developed a lattice of mesoscale, fast-spinning vortices; these vortices each consisted of around 104–105 motile bacterial cells and were arranged in space at greater than centimetre scale and with apparent hexagonal order, whereas individual cells in the vortices moved in coordinated directions with strong polar and vortical order. Single-cell tracking and numerical simulations suggest that the phenomenon is enabled by self-enhanced mobility in the system—that is, the speed of individual cells increasing with cell-generated collective stresses at a given cell density. Stress-induced mobility enhancement and fluidization is prevalent in dense living matter at various scales of length7–9. Our findings demonstrate that self-enhanced mobility offers a simple physical mechanism for pattern formation in living systems and, more generally, in other active matter systems10 near the boundary of fluid- and solid-like behaviours11–17.

    "abstract": "Drug-resistant bacteria are emerging as a global threat, despite frequently being less fit than their drug-susceptible ancestors1–8. Here we sought to define the mechanisms that drive or buffer the fitness cost of rifampicin resistance (RifR) in the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Rifampicin inhibits RNA polymerase (RNAP) and is a cornerstone of modern short-course tuberculosis therapy9,10. However, RifR Mtb accounts for one-quarter of all deaths due to drug-resistant bacteria11,12. We took a comparative functional genomics approach to define processes that are differentially vulnerable to CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) inhibition in RifR Mtb. Among other hits, we found that the universally conserved transcription factor NusG is crucial for the fitness of RifR Mtb. In contrast to its role in Escherichia coli, Mtb NusG has an essential RNAP pro-pausing function mediated by distinct contacts with RNAP and the DNA13. We find this pro-pausing NusG–RNAP interface to be under positive selection in clinical RifR Mtb isolates. Mutations in the NusG–RNAP interface reduce pro-pausing activity and increase fitness of RifR Mtb. Collectively, these results define excessive RNAP pausing as a molecular mechanism that drives the fitness cost of RifR in Mtb, identify a new mechanism of compensation to overcome this cost, suggest rational approaches to exacerbate the fitness cost, and, more broadly, could inform new therapeutic approaches to develop drug combinations to slow the evolution of RifR in Mtb. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the fitness cost of rifampicin resistance is partially due to excessive RNA polymerase pausing and is rescued by mutations in the pro-pausing transcription factor NusG.",

    "abstract": "Thorium-229 (229Th) possesses an optical nuclear transition between the ground state (229gTh) and low-lying isomer (229mTh). A nuclear clock based on this nuclear-transition frequency is expected to surpass existing atomic clocks owing to its insusceptibility to surrounding fields1–5. In contrast to other charge states, triply charged 229Th (229Th3+) is the most suitable for highly accurate nuclear clocks because it has closed electronic transitions that enable laser cooling, laser-induced fluorescence detection and state preparation of ions1,6–8. Although laser spectroscopic studies of 229Th3+ in the nuclear ground state have been performed8, properties of 229mTh3+, including its nuclear decay lifetime that is essential to specify the intrinsic linewidth of the nuclear-clock transition, remain unknown. Here we report the trapping of 229mTh3+ continuously supplied by a 233U source and the determination of nuclear decay half-life of the isolated 229mTh3+ to be \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${{\\rm{1,400}}}_{-300}^{+600}\\,{\\rm{s}}$$\n                \n               through nuclear-state-selective laser spectroscopy. Furthermore, by determining the hyperfine constants of 229mTh3+, we reduced the uncertainty of the sensitivity of the 229Th nuclear clock to variations in the fine-structure constant by a factor of four. These results offer key parameters for the 229Th3+ nuclear clock and its applications in the search for new physics. The trapping of triply charged 229mTh3+ is described and its nuclear decay half-life determined, showing useful properties for the development of a nuclear clock and applications in the search for new physics.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenin, an RNase-A-family protein, promotes angiogenesis and has been implicated in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and epigenetic inheritance1–10. After activation during cellular stress, angiogenin cleaves tRNAs at the anticodon loop, resulting in translation repression11–15. However, the catalytic activity of isolated angiogenin is very low, and the mechanisms of the enzyme activation and tRNA specificity have remained a puzzle3,16–23. Here we identify these mechanisms using biochemical assays and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our study reveals that the cytosolic ribosome is the activator of angiogenin. A cryo-EM structure features angiogenin bound in the A site of the 80S ribosome. The C-terminal tail of angiogenin is rearranged by interactions with the ribosome to activate the RNase catalytic centre, making the enzyme several orders of magnitude more efficient in tRNA cleavage. Additional 80S–angiogenin structures capture how tRNA substrate is directed by the ribosome into angiogenin’s active site, demonstrating that the ribosome acts as the specificity factor. Our findings therefore suggest that angiogenin is activated by ribosomes with a vacant A site, the abundance of which increases during cellular stress24–27. These results may facilitate the development of therapeutics to treat cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Angiogenin binds to the ribosomal A site to cleave tRNA.",

    "abstract": "Although eukaryotic Argonautes have a pivotal role in post-transcriptional gene regulation through nucleic acid cleavage, some short prokaryotic Argonaute variants (pAgos) rely on auxiliary nuclease factors for efficient foreign DNA degradation1. Here we reveal the activation pathway of the DNA defence module DdmDE system, which rapidly eliminates small, multicopy plasmids from the Vibrio cholerae seventh pandemic strain (7PET)2. Through a combination of cryo-electron microscopy, biochemistry and in vivo plasmid clearance assays, we demonstrate that DdmE is a catalytically inactive, DNA-guided, DNA-targeting pAgo with a distinctive insertion domain. We observe that the helicase-nuclease DdmD transitions from an autoinhibited, dimeric complex to a monomeric state upon loading of single-stranded DNA targets. Furthermore, the complete structure of the DdmDE–guide–target handover complex provides a comprehensive view into how DNA recognition triggers processive plasmid destruction. Our work establishes a mechanistic foundation for how pAgos utilize ancillary factors to achieve plasmid clearance, and provides insights into anti-plasmid immunity in bacteria. Using cryo-electron microscopy, insights into the structural and mechanistic function of the DdmDE system that is responsible for plasmid elimination in Vibrio cholerae seventh pandemic strains are explored.",

Dysfunction of noradrenaline transporter has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder2. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of noradrenaline transporter in apo and substrate-bound forms, and as complexes with six antidepressants. The structures reveal a noradrenaline transporter dimer interface that is mediated predominantly by cholesterol and lipid molecules. The substrate noradrenaline binds deep in the central binding pocket, and its amine group interacts with a conserved aspartate residue. Our structures also provide insight into antidepressant recognition and monoamine transporter selectivity. Together, these findings advance our understanding of noradrenaline transporter regulation and inhibition, and provide templates for designing improved antidepressants to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the noradrenaline transporter in the apo state, bound to noradrenaline and bound to various antidepressants shed light on the substrate transport, molecular recognition and dimeric architecture of this protein.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotes have evolved towards one of two extremes along a spectrum of strategies for remodelling the nuclear envelope during cell division: disassembling the nuclear envelope in an open mitosis or constructing an intranuclear spindle in a closed mitosis1,2. Both classes of mitotic remodelling involve key differences in the core division machinery but the evolutionary reasons for adopting a specific mechanism are unclear. Here we use an integrated comparative genomics and ultrastructural imaging approach to investigate mitotic strategies in Ichthyosporea, close relatives of animals and fungi. We show that species in this clade have diverged towards either a fungal-like closed mitosis or an animal-like open mitosis, probably to support distinct multinucleated or uninucleated states. Our results indicate that multinucleated life cycles favour the evolution of closed mitosis. We analyse cell division in ichthyosporeans and find that multinucleated life cycles favour the evolution of closed mitosis, in which the cell constructs a spindle within an intact nucleus.",

However, scaling quality NMT requires large volumes of parallel bilingual data, which are not equally available for the 7,000+ languages in the world1. Focusing on improving the translation qualities of a relatively small group of high-resource languages comes at the expense of directing research attention to low-resource languages, exacerbating digital inequities in the long run. To break this pattern, here we introduce No Language Left Behind—a single massively multilingual model that leverages transfer learning across languages. We developed a conditional computational model based on the Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts architecture2–7, which we trained on data obtained with new mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages. Furthermore, we devised multiple architectural and training improvements to counteract overfitting while training on thousands of tasks. We evaluated the performance of our model over 40,000 translation directions using tools created specifically for this purpose—an automatic benchmark (FLORES-200), a human evaluation metric (XSTS) and a toxicity detector that covers every language in our model. Compared with the previous state-of-the-art models, our model achieves an average of 44% improvement in translation quality as measured by BLEU. By demonstrating how to scale NMT to 200 languages and making all contributions in this effort freely available for non-commercial use, our work lays important groundwork for the development of a universal translation system. Scaling neural machine translation to 200 languages is achieved by No Language Left Behind, a single massively multilingual model that leverages transfer learning across languages.",

    "abstract": "From sequences of speech sounds1,2 or letters3, humans can extract rich and nuanced meaning through language. This capacity is essential for human communication. Yet, despite a growing understanding of the brain areas that support linguistic and semantic processing4–12, the derivation of linguistic meaning in neural tissue at the cellular level and over the timescale of action potentials remains largely unknown. Here we recorded from single cells in the left language-dominant prefrontal cortex as participants listened to semantically diverse sentences and naturalistic stories. By tracking their activities during natural speech processing, we discover a fine-scale cortical representation of semantic information by individual neurons. These neurons responded selectively to specific word meanings and reliably distinguished words from nonwords. Moreover, rather than responding to the words as fixed memory representations, their activities were highly dynamic, reflecting the words’ meanings based on their specific sentence contexts and independent of their phonetic form. Collectively, we show how these cell ensembles accurately predicted the broad semantic categories of the words as they were heard in real time during speech and how they tracked the sentences in which they appeared. We also show how they encoded the hierarchical structure of these meaning representations and how these representations mapped onto the cell population. Together, these findings reveal a finely detailed cortical organization of semantic representations at the neuron scale in humans and begin to illuminate the cellular-level processing of meaning during language comprehension. By tracking the activity of individual neurons using microarrays and Neuropixels probes, a study examines the representation of linguistic meaning, at the single-cell level, during natural speech processing in humans.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate is traditionally viewed as the first messenger to activate NMDAR (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor)-dependent cell death pathways in stroke1,2, but unsuccessful clinical trials with NMDAR antagonists implicate the engagement of other mechanisms3–7. Here we show that glutamate and its structural analogues, including NMDAR antagonist l-AP5 (also known as APV), robustly potentiate currents mediated by acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) associated with acidosis-induced neurotoxicity in stroke4. Glutamate increases the affinity of ASICs for protons and their open probability, aggravating ischaemic neurotoxicity in both in vitro and in vivo models. Site-directed mutagenesis, structure-based modelling and functional assays reveal a bona fide glutamate-binding cavity in the extracellular domain of ASIC1a. Computational drug screening identified a small molecule, LK-2, that binds to this cavity and abolishes glutamate-dependent potentiation of ASIC currents but spares NMDARs. LK-2 reduces the infarct volume and improves sensorimotor recovery in a mouse model of ischaemic stroke, reminiscent of that seen in mice with Asic1a knockout or knockout of other cation channels4–7. We conclude that glutamate functions as a positive allosteric modulator for ASICs to exacerbate neurotoxicity, and preferential targeting of the glutamate-binding site on ASICs over that on NMDARs may be strategized for developing stroke therapeutics lacking the psychotic side effects of NMDAR antagonists. Glutamate functions as a positive allosteric modulator for acid-sensing ion channels to exacerbate ischaemic neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Fungi are among the most diverse and ecologically important kingdoms in life. However, the distributional ranges of fungi remain largely unknown as do the ecological mechanisms that shape their distributions1,2. To provide an integrated view of the spatial and seasonal dynamics of fungi, we implemented a globally distributed standardized aerial sampling of fungal spores3. The vast majority of operational taxonomic units were detected within only one climatic zone, and the spatiotemporal patterns of species richness and community composition were mostly explained by annual mean air temperature. Tropical regions hosted the highest fungal diversity except for lichenized, ericoid mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi, which reached their peak diversity in temperate regions. The sensitivity in climatic responses was associated with phylogenetic relatedness, suggesting that large-scale distributions of some fungal groups are partially constrained by their ancestral niche. There was a strong phylogenetic signal in seasonal sensitivity, suggesting that some groups of fungi have retained their ancestral trait of sporulating for only a short period. Overall, our results show that the hyperdiverse kingdom of fungi follows globally highly predictable spatial and temporal dynamics, with seasonality in both species richness and community composition increasing with latitude. Our study reports patterns resembling those described for other major groups of organisms, thus making a major contribution to the long-standing debate on whether organisms with a microbial lifestyle follow the global biodiversity paradigms known for macroorganisms4,5. Using a globally distributed standardized aerial sampling of fungal spores, we show that the hyperdiverse kingdom of fungi follows globally highly predictable spatial and temporal dynamics, with seasonality in both species richness and community composition increasing with latitude.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination is initiated by DNA end resection, a process involving the controlled degradation of the 5′-terminated strands at DSB sites1,2. The breast cancer suppressor BRCA1–BARD1 not only promotes resection and homologous recombination, but it also protects DNA upon replication stress1,3–9. BRCA1–BARD1 counteracts the anti-resection and pro-non-homologous end-joining factor 53BP1, but whether it functions in resection directly has been unclear10–16. Using purified recombinant proteins, we show here that BRCA1–BARD1 directly promotes long-range DNA end resection pathways catalysed by the EXO1 or DNA2 nucleases. In the DNA2-dependent pathway, BRCA1–BARD1 stimulates DNA unwinding by the Werner or Bloom helicase. Together with MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 and phosphorylated CtIP, BRCA1–BARD1 forms the BRCA1–C complex17,18, which stimulates resection synergistically to an even greater extent. A mutation in phosphorylated CtIP (S327A), which disrupts its binding to the BRCT repeats of BRCA1 and hence the integrity of the BRCA1–C complex19–21, inhibits resection, showing that BRCA1–C is a functionally integrated ensemble. Whereas BRCA1–BARD1 stimulates resection in DSB repair, it paradoxically also protects replication forks from unscheduled degradation upon stress, which involves a homologous recombination-independent function of the recombinase RAD51 (refs. 4–6,8). We show that in the presence of RAD51, BRCA1–BARD1 instead inhibits DNA degradation. On the basis of our data, the presence and local concentration of RAD51 might determine the balance between the pronuclease and the DNA protection functions of BRCA1–BARD1 in various physiological contexts. BRCA1–BARD1 directly promotes double-strand break repair by stimulating long-range DNA end resection pathways.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing dogma for morphological patterning in developing organisms argues that the combined inputs of transcription factor networks and signalling morphogens alone generate spatially and temporally distinct expression patterns. However, metabolism has also emerged as a critical developmental regulator1–10, independent of its functions in energy production and growth. The mechanistic role of nutrient utilization in instructing cellular programmes to shape the in vivo developing mammalian embryo remains unknown. Here we reveal two spatially resolved, cell-type- and stage-specific waves of glucose metabolism during mammalian gastrulation by using single-cell-resolution quantitative imaging of developing mouse embryos, stem cell models and embryo-derived tissue explants. We identify that the first spatiotemporal wave of glucose metabolism occurs through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway to drive fate acquisition in the epiblast, and the second wave uses glycolysis to guide mesoderm migration and lateral expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that glucose exerts its influence on these developmental processes through cellular signalling pathways, with distinct mechanisms connecting glucose with the ERK activity in each wave. Our findings underscore that—in synergy with genetic mechanisms and morphogenic gradients—compartmentalized cellular metabolism is integral in guiding cell fate and specialized functions during development. This study challenges the view of the generic and housekeeping nature of cellular metabolism, offering valuable insights into its roles in various developmental contexts. Two waves of glucose metabolism provide distinct ERK-mediated cellular signals during gastrulation, which regulate cell fate and specialized cellular functions that are necessary for development.",

    "abstract": "Mounting effective immunity against pathogens and tumours relies on the successful metabolic programming of T cells by extracellular fatty acids1–3. Fatty-acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) has a key role in this process by coordinating the efficient import and trafficking of lipids that fuel mitochondrial respiration to sustain the bioenergetic requirements of protective CD8+ T cells4,5. However, the mechanisms that govern this immunometabolic axis remain unexplored. Here we report that the cytoskeletal organizer transgelin 2 (TAGLN2) is necessary for optimal fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial respiration and anticancer function in CD8+ T cells. TAGLN2 interacts with FABP5 to facilitate its cell surface localization and function in activated CD8+ T cells. Analyses of ovarian cancer specimens revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses induced by the tumour microenvironment repress TAGLN2 in infiltrating CD8+ T cells, thereby enforcing their dysfunctional state. Restoring TAGLN2 expression in ER-stressed CD8+ T cells increased their lipid uptake, mitochondrial respiration and cytotoxic capacity. Accordingly, chimeric antigen receptor T cells overexpressing TAGLN2 bypassed the detrimental effects of tumour-induced ER stress and demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in mice with metastatic ovarian cancer. Our study establishes the role of cytoskeletal TAGLN2 in T cell lipid metabolism and highlights the potential to enhance cellular immunotherapy in solid malignancies by preserving the TAGLN2–FABP5 axis. Together with the fatty-acid-binding protein  FABP5, the cytoskeletal organizer TAGLN2 is an essential factor for fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial respiration and anticancer function in CD8+ T cells.",

    "abstract": "Atomic nuclei are self-organized, many-body quantum systems bound by strong nuclear forces within femtometre-scale space. These complex systems manifest a variety of shapes1–3, traditionally explored using non-invasive spectroscopic techniques at low energies4,5. However, at these energies, their instantaneous shapes are obscured by long-timescale quantum fluctuations, making direct observation challenging. Here we introduce the collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method, which images the nuclear global shape by colliding them at ultrarelativistic speeds and analysing the collective response of outgoing debris. This technique captures a collision-specific snapshot of the spatial matter distribution within the nuclei, which, through the hydrodynamic expansion, imprints patterns on the particle momentum distribution observed in detectors6,7. We benchmark this method in collisions of ground-state uranium-238 nuclei, known for their elongated, axial-symmetric shape. Our findings show a large deformation with a slight deviation from axial symmetry in the nuclear ground state, aligning broadly with previous low-energy experiments. This approach offers a new method for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances our understanding of the initial conditions in high-energy collisions and addresses the important issue of nuclear structure evolution across energy scales. The collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method images the nuclear global shape by colliding them at ultrarelativistic speeds and analysing the collective response of outgoing debris.",

    "abstract": "Neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes are the remnants of massive star explosions1. Most massive stars reside in close binary systems2, and the interplay between the companion star and the newly formed compact object has been theoretically explored3, but signatures for binarity or evidence for the formation of a compact object during a supernova explosion are still lacking. Here we report a stripped-envelope supernova, SN 2022jli, which shows 12.4-day periodic undulations during the declining light curve. Narrow Hα emission is detected in late-time spectra with concordant periodic velocity shifts, probably arising from hydrogen gas stripped from a companion and accreted onto the compact remnant. A new Fermi-LAT γ-ray source is temporally and positionally consistent with SN 2022jli. The observed properties of SN 2022jli, including periodic undulations in the optical light curve, coherent Hα emission shifting and evidence for association with a γ-ray source, point to the explosion of a massive star in a binary system leaving behind a bound compact remnant. Mass accretion from the companion star onto the compact object powers the light curve of the supernova and generates the γ-ray emission. A stripped-envelope supernova, SN 2022jli, shows 12.4-day periodic undulations during the declining light curve, and narrow Hα emission is detected in late-time spectra with concordant periodic velocity shifts.",

    "abstract": "Repeated interactions provide an evolutionary explanation for one-shot human cooperation that is counterintuitive but orthodox1–3. Intergroup competition4–7 provides an explanation that is intuitive but heterodox. Here, using models and a behavioural experiment, we show that neither mechanism reliably supports cooperation. Ambiguous reciprocity, a class of strategies that is generally ignored in models of reciprocal altruism, undermines cooperation under repeated interactions. This finding challenges repeated interactions as an evolutionary explanation for cooperation in general, which further challenges the claim that repeated interactions in the past can explain one-shot cooperation in the present. Intergroup competitions also do not reliably support cooperation because groups quickly become extremely similar, which limits scope for group selection. Moreover, even if groups vary, group competitions may generate little group selection for multiple reasons. Cooperative groups, for example, may tend to compete against each other8. Whereas repeated interactions and group competitions do not support cooperation by themselves, combining them triggers powerful synergies because group competitions constrain the corrosive effect of ambiguous reciprocity. Evolved strategies often consist of cooperative reciprocity with ingroup partners and uncooperative reciprocity with outgroup partners. Results from a behavioural experiment in Papua New Guinea fit exactly this pattern. They thus suggest neither an evolutionary history of repeated interactions without group competition nor a history of group competition without repeated interactions. Instead, our results suggest social motives that evolved under the joint influence of both mechanisms. Models show that human cooperation cannot evolve reliably under repeated interactions or under intergroup competitions, but combining the two mechanisms predicts a distinctive strategy, observed experimentally in Papua New Guinea, in which individuals exhibit cooperative reciprocity with ingroup partners and uncooperative reciprocity with outgroup partners.",

    "abstract": "Mass loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been driven primarily by the thinning of the floating ice shelves that fringe the ice sheet1, reducing their buttressing potential and causing land ice to accelerate into the ocean2. Observations of ice-shelf thickness change by satellite altimetry stretch back only to 1992 (refs. 1,3–5) and previous information about thinning remains unquantified. However, extending the record of ice-shelf thickness change is possible by proxy, by measuring the change in area of the surface expression of pinning points—local bathymetric highs on which ice shelves are anchored6. Here we measure pinning-point change over three epochs spanning the periods 1973–1989, 1989–2000 and 2000−2022, and thus by proxy infer changes to ice-shelf thickness back to 1973–1989. We show that only small localized pockets of ice shelves were thinning between 1973 and 1989, located primarily in the Amundsen Sea Embayment and the Wilkes Land coastline. Ice-shelf thinning spreads rapidly into the 1990s and 2000s and is best characterized by the proportion of pinning points reducing in extent. Only 15% of pinning points reduced from 1973 to 1989, before increasing to 25% from 1989 to 2000 and 37% from 2000 to 2022. A continuation of this trend would further reduce the buttressing potential of ice shelves, enhancing ice discharge and accelerating the contribution of Antarctica to sea-level rise. Pinning-point changes over three epochs spanning the periods 1973–1989, 1989–2000 and 2000−2022 were measured, and by proxy the changes to ice-shelf thickness back to 1973–1989 were inferred.",

    "abstract": "Polyatomic molecules have rich structural features that make them uniquely suited to applications in quantum information science1–3, quantum simulation4–6, ultracold chemistry7 and searches for physics beyond the standard model8–10. However, a key challenge is fully controlling both the internal quantum state and the motional degrees of freedom of the molecules. Here we demonstrate the creation of an optical tweezer array of individual polyatomic molecules, CaOH, with quantum control of their internal quantum state. The complex quantum structure of CaOH results in a non-trivial dependence of the molecules’ behaviour on the tweezer light wavelength. We control this interaction and directly and non-destructively image individual molecules in the tweezer array with a fidelity greater than 90%. The molecules are manipulated at the single internal quantum state level, thus demonstrating coherent state control in a tweezer array. The platform demonstrated here will enable a variety of experiments using individual polyatomic molecules with arbitrary spatial arrangement. An optical tweezer array of individual polyatomic molecules is created, revealing the obvious state control in the tweezer array and enabling further research on polyatomic molecules with diverse spatial arrangements.",

    "abstract": "More than a quarter of the world’s tropical forests are exploited for timber1. Logging impacts biodiversity in these ecosystems, primarily through the creation of forest roads that facilitate hunting for wildlife over extensive areas. Forest management certification schemes such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) are expected to mitigate impacts on biodiversity, but so far very little is known about the effectiveness of FSC certification because of research design challenges, predominantly limited sample sizes2,3. Here we provide this evidence by using 1.3 million camera-trap photos of 55 mammal species in 14 logging concessions in western equatorial Africa. We observed higher mammal encounter rates in FSC-certified than in non-FSC logging concessions. The effect was most pronounced for species weighing more than 10 kg and for species of high conservation priority such as the critically endangered forest elephant and western lowland gorilla. Across the whole mammal community, non-FSC concessions contained proportionally more rodents and other small species than did FSC-certified concessions. The first priority for species protection should be to maintain unlogged forests with effective law enforcement, but for logged forests our findings provide convincing data that FSC-certified forest management is less damaging to the mammal community than is non-FSC forest management. This study provides strong evidence that FSC-certified forest management or equivalently stringent requirements and controlling mechanisms should become the norm for timber extraction to avoid half-empty forests dominated by rodents and other small species. Camera-trap images of 55 mammal species in 14 logging concessions in western equatorial Africa reveal greater animal encounter rates in FSC-certified than in non-certified forests, especially for large mammals and species of high conservation priority.",

    "abstract": "Insects constitute the most species-rich radiation of metazoa, a success that is due to the evolution of active flight. Unlike pterosaurs, birds and bats, the wings of insects did not evolve from legs1, but are novel structures that are attached to the body via a biomechanically complex hinge that transforms tiny, high-frequency oscillations of specialized power muscles into the sweeping back-and-forth motion of the wings2. The hinge consists of a system of tiny, hardened structures called sclerites that are interconnected to one another via flexible joints and regulated by the activity of specialized control muscles. Here we imaged the activity of these muscles in a fly using a genetically encoded calcium indicator, while simultaneously tracking the three-dimensional motion of the wings with high-speed cameras. Using machine learning, we created a convolutional neural network3 that accurately predicts wing motion from the activity of the steering muscles, and an encoder–decoder4 that predicts the role of the individual sclerites on wing motion. By replaying patterns of wing motion on a dynamically scaled robotic fly, we quantified the effects of steering muscle activity on aerodynamic forces. A physics-based simulation incorporating our hinge model generates flight manoeuvres that are remarkably similar to those of free-flying flies. This integrative, multi-disciplinary approach reveals the mechanical control logic of the insect wing hinge, arguably among the most sophisticated and evolutionarily important skeletal structures in the natural world. Measurements of fly muscle activity using a genetically encoded calcium indicator and high-speed imaging of wing movement were used to construct a model of the insect wing hinge and the role of steering muscles in flight control.",

To date, there have been no systematic global comparisons of humans’ ability to absorb and recover from disturbances through time4,5. Here we synthesized resilience across a broad sample of prehistoric population time–frequency data, spanning 30,000 years of human history. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of population decline show that frequent disturbances enhance a population’s capacity to resist and recover from later downturns. Land-use patterns are important mediators of the strength of this positive association: farming and herding societies are more vulnerable but also more resilient overall. The results show that important trade-offs exist when adopting new or alternative land-use strategies. Analysis of population decline shows that frequent disturbances enhance a population’s capacity to resist and recover from downturns and that trade-offs exist when adopting new or alternative land-use strategies.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the two most abundant phospholipids in mammalian cells, are synthesized de novo by the Kennedy pathway from choline and ethanolamine, respectively1–6. Despite the essential roles of these lipids, the mechanisms that enable the cellular uptake of choline and ethanolamine remain unknown. Here we show that the protein encoded by FLVCR1, whose mutation leads to the neurodegenerative syndrome posterior column ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa7–9, transports extracellular choline and ethanolamine into cells for phosphorylation by downstream kinases to initiate the Kennedy pathway. Structures of FLVCR1 in the presence of choline and ethanolamine reveal that both metabolites bind to a common binding site comprising aromatic and polar residues. Despite binding to a common site, FLVCR1 interacts in different ways with the larger quaternary amine of choline in and with the primary amine of ethanolamine. Structure-guided mutagenesis identified residues that are crucial for the transport of ethanolamine, but dispensable for choline transport, enabling functional separation of the entry points into the two branches of the Kennedy pathway. Altogether, these studies reveal how FLVCR1 is a high-affinity metabolite transporter that serves as the common origin for phospholipid biosynthesis by two branches of the Kennedy pathway. A structural, biochemical and metabolomic analysis reveals the mechanistic basis for transport of extracellular choline and ethanolamine into cells by the human transport protein FLVCR1.",

    "abstract": "Most chemistry and biology occurs in solution, in which conformational dynamics and complexation underlie behaviour and function. Single-molecule techniques1 are uniquely suited to resolving molecular diversity and new label-free approaches are reshaping the power of single-molecule measurements. A label-free single-molecule method2–16 capable of revealing details of molecular conformation in solution17,18 would allow a new microscopic perspective of unprecedented detail. Here we use the enhanced light–molecule interactions in high-finesse fibre-based Fabry–Pérot microcavities19–21 to detect individual biomolecules as small as 1.2 kDa, a ten-amino-acid peptide, with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) >100, even as the molecules are unlabelled and freely diffusing in solution. Our method delivers 2D intensity and temporal profiles, enabling the distinction of subpopulations in mixed samples. Notably, we observe a linear relationship between passage time and molecular radius, unlocking the potential to gather crucial information about diffusion and solution-phase conformation. Furthermore, mixtures of biomolecule isomers of the same molecular weight and composition but different conformation can also be resolved. Detection is based on the creation of a new molecular velocity filter window and a dynamic thermal priming mechanism that make use of the interplay between optical and thermal dynamics22,23 and Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH) cavity locking24 to reveal molecular motion even while suppressing environmental noise. New in vitro ways of revealing molecular conformation, diversity and dynamics can find broad potential for applications in the life and chemical sciences. Enhanced light–molecule interactions in high-finesse fibre-based Fabry–Pérot microcavities are used to detect and profile individual unlabelled solution-phase biomolecules, leading to potential applications in the life and chemical sciences.",

    "abstract": "The ability to tame high-energy intermediates is important for synthetic chemistry, enabling the construction of complex molecules and propelling advances in the field of synthesis. Along these lines, carbenes and carbenoid intermediates are particularly attractive, but often unknown, high-energy intermediates1,2. Classical methods to access metal carbene intermediates exploit two-electron chemistry to form the carbon–metal bond. However, these methods are usually prohibitive because of reagent safety concerns, limiting their broad implementation in synthesis3–6. Mechanistically, an alternative approach to carbene intermediates that could circumvent these pitfalls would involve two single-electron steps: radical addition to metal to forge the initial carbon–metal bond followed by redox-promoted α-elimination to yield the desired metal carbene intermediate. Here we realize this strategy through a metallaphotoredox platform that exploits iron carbene reactivity using readily available chemical feedstocks as radical sources and α-elimination from six classes of previously underexploited leaving groups. These discoveries permit cyclopropanation and σ-bond insertion into N–H, S–H and P–H bonds from abundant and bench-stable carboxylic acids, amino acids and alcohols, thereby providing a general solution to the challenge of carbene-mediated chemical diversification. Metal carbenes are accessed using a metallaphotoredox platform that exploits iron carbene reactivity using readily available chemical feedstocks and α-elimination.",

The physiological properties and functions of Krause corpuscles have remained unclear since their discovery. Here we report the anatomical and physiological properties of Krause corpuscles of the mouse clitoris and penis and their roles in sexual behaviour. We observed a high density of Krause corpuscles in the clitoris compared with the penis. Using mouse genetic tools, we identified two distinct somatosensory neuron subtypes that innervate Krause corpuscles of both the clitoris and penis and project to a unique sensory terminal region of the spinal cord. In vivo electrophysiology and calcium imaging experiments showed that both Krause corpuscle afferent types are A-fibre rapid-adapting low-threshold mechanoreceptors, optimally tuned to dynamic, light-touch and mechanical vibrations (40–80 Hz) applied to the clitoris or penis. Functionally, selective optogenetic activation of Krause corpuscle afferent terminals evoked penile erection in male mice and vaginal contraction in female mice, while genetic ablation of Krause corpuscles impaired intromission and ejaculation of males and reduced sexual receptivity of females. Thus, Krause corpuscles of the clitoris and penis are highly sensitive mechanical vibration detectors that mediate sexually dimorphic mating behaviours. Krause corpuscles of the clitoris and penis are highly sensitive mechanical vibration detectors that mediate sexually dimorphic mating behaviours in mice.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and fragmented palaeoanthropological data suggest that Denisovans were once widely distributed across eastern Eurasia1–3. Despite limited archaeological evidence, this indicates that Denisovans were capable of adapting to a highly diverse range of environments. Here we integrate zooarchaeological and proteomic analyses of the late Middle to Late Pleistocene faunal assemblage from Baishiya Karst Cave on the Tibetan Plateau, where a Denisovan mandible and Denisovan sedimentary mitochondrial DNA were found3,4. Using zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry, we identify a new hominin rib specimen that dates to approximately 48–32 thousand years ago (layer 3). Shotgun proteomic analysis taxonomically assigns this specimen to the Denisovan lineage, extending their presence at Baishiya Karst Cave well into the Late Pleistocene. Throughout the stratigraphic sequence, the faunal assemblage is dominated by Caprinae, together with megaherbivores, carnivores, small mammals and birds. The high proportion of anthropogenic modifications on the bone surfaces suggests that Denisovans were the primary agent of faunal accumulation. The chaîne opératoire of carcass processing indicates that animal taxa were exploited for their meat, marrow and hides, while bone was also used as raw material for the production of tools. Our results shed light on the behaviour of Denisovans and their adaptations to the diverse and fluctuating environments of the late Middle and Late Pleistocene of eastern Eurasia. Zooarchaeological and proteomic analyses of bones from Baishiya Karst Cave on the Tibetan Plateau identify a hominin rib specimen, and provide insight into the ways Denisovans interacted with their surrounding environment and made use of animal resources.",

    "abstract": "As the closest transiting hot Jupiter to Earth, HD 189733b has been the benchmark planet for atmospheric characterization1–3. It has also been the anchor point for much of our theoretical understanding of exoplanet atmospheres from composition4, chemistry5,6, aerosols7 to atmospheric dynamics8, escape9 and modelling techniques10,11. Previous studies of HD 189733b have detected carbon and oxygen-bearing molecules H2O and CO (refs. 12,13) in the atmosphere. The presence of CO2 and CH4 has been claimed14,15 but later disputed12,16,17. The inferred metallicity based on these measurements, a key parameter in tracing planet formation locations18, varies from depletion19,20 to enhancement21,22, hindered by limited wavelength coverage and precision of the observations. Here we report detections of H2O (13.4σ), CO2 (11.2σ), CO (5σ) and H2S (4.5σ) in the transmission spectrum (2.4–5.0 μm) of HD 189733b. With an equilibrium temperature of about 1,200 K, H2O, CO and H2S are the main reservoirs for oxygen, carbon and sulfur. Based on the measured abundances of these three main volatile elements, we infer an atmospheric metallicity of three to five times stellar. The upper limit on the methane abundance at 5σ is 0.1 ppm, which indicates a low carbon-to-oxygen ratio (<0.2), suggesting formation through the accretion of water-rich icy planetesimals. The low oxygen-to-sulfur and carbon-to-sulfur ratios also support the planetesimal accretion formation pathway23. The exoplanet HD 189733b has a metal-enriched atmosphere with the possible presence of H2O (13.4σ), CO2 (11.2σ), CO (5σ) and H2S (4.5σ).",

    "abstract": "The fermionic Hubbard model (FHM)1 describes a wide range of physical phenomena resulting from strong electron–electron correlations, including conjectured mechanisms for unconventional superconductivity. Resolving its low-temperature physics is, however, challenging theoretically or numerically. Ultracold fermions in optical lattices2,3 provide a clean and well-controlled platform offering a path to simulate the FHM. Doping the antiferromagnetic ground state of a FHM simulator at half-filling is expected to yield various exotic phases, including stripe order4, pseudogap5, and d-wave superfluid6, offering valuable insights into high-temperature superconductivity7–9. Although the observation of antiferromagnetic correlations over short10 and extended distances11 has been obtained, the antiferromagnetic phase has yet to be realized as it requires sufficiently low temperatures in a large and uniform quantum simulator. Here we report the observation of the antiferromagnetic phase transition in a three-dimensional fermionic Hubbard system comprising lithium-6 atoms in a uniform optical lattice with approximately 800,000 sites. When the interaction strength, temperature and doping concentration are finely tuned to approach their respective critical values, a sharp increase in the spin structure factor is observed. These observations can be well described by a power-law divergence, with a critical exponent of 1.396 from the Heisenberg universality class12. At half-filling and with optimal interaction strength, the measured spin structure factor reaches 123(8), signifying the establishment of an antiferromagnetic phase. Our results provide opportunities for exploring the low-temperature phase diagram of the FHM. Antiferromagnetic phase transition is observed in a three-dimensional fermionic Hubbard system comprising lithium-6 atoms in a uniform optical lattice with approximately 800,000 sites.",

    "abstract": "Coherent optical driving in quantum solids is emerging as a research frontier, with many reports of interesting non-equilibrium quantum phases1–4 and transient photo-induced functional phenomena such as ferroelectricity5,6, magnetism7–10 and superconductivity11–14. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, coherent driving of certain phonon modes has resulted in a transient state with superconducting-like optical properties, observed far above their transition temperature Tc and throughout the pseudogap phase15–18. However, questions remain on the microscopic nature of this transient state and how to distinguish it from a non-superconducting state with enhanced carrier mobility. For example, it is not known whether cuprates driven in this fashion exhibit Meissner diamagnetism. Here we examine the time-dependent magnetic field surrounding an optically driven YBa2Cu3O6.48 crystal by measuring Faraday rotation in a magneto-optic material placed in the vicinity of the sample. For a constant applied magnetic field and under the same driving conditions that result in superconducting-like optical properties15–18, a transient diamagnetic response was observed. This response is comparable in size with that expected in an equilibrium type II superconductor of similar shape and size with a volume susceptibility χv of order −0.3. This value is incompatible with a photo-induced increase in mobility without superconductivity. Rather, it underscores the notion of a pseudogap phase in which incipient superconducting correlations are enhanced or synchronized by the drive. A time-dependent magnetic field expulsion was measured in optically driven YBa2Cu3O6.48 above the equilibrium superconducting transition temperature and all the way to room temperature.",

    "abstract": "In lactating mothers, the high calcium (Ca2+) demand for milk production triggers significant bone loss1. Although oestrogen normally counteracts excessive bone resorption by promoting bone formation, this sex steroid drops precipitously during this postpartum period. Here we report that brain-derived cellular communication network factor 3 (CCN3) secreted from KISS1 neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARCKISS1) fills this void and functions as a potent osteoanabolic factor to build bone in lactating females. We began by showing that our previously reported female-specific, dense bone phenotype2 originates from a humoral factor that promotes bone mass and acts on skeletal stem cells to increase their frequency and osteochondrogenic potential. This circulatory factor was then identified as CCN3, a brain-derived hormone from ARCKISS1 neurons that is able to stimulate mouse and human skeletal stem cell activity, increase bone remodelling and accelerate fracture repair in young and old mice of both sexes. The role of CCN3 in normal female physiology was revealed after detecting a burst of CCN3 expression in ARCKISS1 neurons coincident with lactation. After reducing CCN3 in ARCKISS1 neurons, lactating mothers lost bone and failed to sustain their progeny when challenged with a low-calcium diet. Our findings establish CCN3 as a potentially new therapeutic osteoanabolic hormone for both sexes and define a new maternal brain hormone for ensuring species survival in mammals. A brain-derived hormone, CCN3, is newly identified to have a role as an osteoanabolic factor to build bone in lactating females and in the viability of offspring.",

Here we studied an antiphage defence system in bacteria, comprising a ubiquitin-like protein, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E1 and E2, and a deubiquitinase. We show that during phage infection, this system specifically conjugates the ubiquitin-like protein to the phage central tail fibre, a protein at the tip of the tail that is essential for tail assembly as well as for recognition of the target host receptor. Following infection, cells encoding this defence system release a mixture of partially assembled, tailless phage particles and fully assembled phages in which the central tail fibre is obstructed by the covalently attached ubiquitin-like protein. These phages show severely impaired infectivity, explaining how the defence system protects the bacterial population from the spread of phage infection. Our findings demonstrate that conjugation of ubiquitin-like proteins is an antiviral strategy conserved across the tree of life. To mitigate phage infection, an antiphage defence system in bacteria conjugates a ubiquitin-like protein to a structural protein of the phage, demonstrating that conjugation of ubiquitin-like proteins is an antiviral strategy conserved across all life forms.",

    "abstract": "Compressing the optical field to the atomic scale opens up possibilities for directly observing individual molecules, offering innovative imaging and research tools for both physical and life sciences. However, the diffraction limit imposes a fundamental constraint on how much the optical field can be compressed, based on the achievable photon momentum1,2. In contrast to dielectric structures, plasmonics offer superior field confinement by coupling the light field with the oscillations of free electrons in metals3–6. Nevertheless, plasmonics suffer from inherent ohmic loss, leading to heat generation, increased power consumption and limitations on the coherence time of plasmonic devices7,8. Here we propose and demonstrate singular dielectric nanolasers showing a mode volume that breaks the optical diffraction limit. Derived from Maxwell’s equations, we discover that the electric-field singularity sustained in a dielectric bowtie nanoantenna originates from divergence of momentum. The singular dielectric nanolaser is constructed by integrating a dielectric bowtie nanoantenna into the centre of a twisted lattice nanocavity. The synergistic integration surpasses the diffraction limit, enabling the singular dielectric nanolaser to achieve an ultrasmall mode volume of about 0.0005 λ3 (λ, free-space wavelength), along with an exceptionally small feature size at the 1-nanometre scale. To fabricate the required dielectric bowtie nanoantenna with a single-nanometre gap, we develop a two-step process involving etching and atomic deposition. Our research showcases the ability to achieve atomic-scale field localization in laser devices, paving the way for ultra-precise measurements, super-resolution imaging, ultra-efficient computing and communication, and the exploration of light–matter interactions within the realm of extreme optical field localization. Singularity enables breaking the optical diffraction limit in a dielectric nanolaser.",

Beetles (Coleoptera) display one of the most complex mechanisms. In rhinoceros beetles, Allomyrina dichotoma, wing deployment is initiated by complete release of the elytra and partial release of the hindwings at their bases. Subsequently, the beetle starts flapping, elevates the hindwing bases and unfolds the hindwing tips in an origami-like fashion. Although the origami-like fold has been extensively explored3–8, limited attention has been given to the hindwing base movements, which are believed to be driven by the thoracic muscles5,9–11. Here we demonstrate that rhinoceros beetles can effortlessly deploy their hindwings without necessitating muscular activity. We show that opening the elytra triggers a spring-like partial release of the hindwings from the body, allowing the clearance needed for the subsequent flapping motion that brings the hindwings into the flight position. After flight, the beetle can use the elytra to push the hindwings back into the resting position, further strengthening the hypothesis of passive deployment. We validated the hypothesis using a flapping microrobot that passively deployed its wings for stable, controlled flight and retracted them neatly upon landing, demonstrating a simple, yet effective, approach to the design of insect-like flying micromachines. We find that rhinoceros beetles passively deploy and retract their hindwings without muscular activity, demonstrating this with insect-like microrobots.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages or phages) are engaged in an intense evolutionary arms race1–5. While the mechanisms of many bacterial antiphage defence systems are known1, how these systems avoid toxicity outside infection yet activate quickly after infection is less well understood. Here we show that the bacterial phage anti-restriction-induced system (PARIS) operates as a toxin–antitoxin system, in which the antitoxin AriA sequesters and inactivates the toxin AriB until triggered by the T7 phage counterdefence protein Ocr. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that AriA is related to SMC-family ATPases but assembles into a distinctive homohexameric complex through two oligomerization interfaces. In uninfected cells, the AriA hexamer binds to up to three monomers of AriB, maintaining them in an inactive state. After Ocr binding, the AriA hexamer undergoes a structural rearrangement, releasing AriB and allowing it to dimerize and activate. AriB is a toprim/OLD-family nuclease, the activation of which arrests cell growth and inhibits phage propagation by globally inhibiting protein translation through specific cleavage of a lysine tRNA. Collectively, our findings reveal the intricate molecular mechanisms of a bacterial defence system triggered by a phage counterdefence protein, and highlight how an SMC-family ATPase has been adapted as a bacterial infection sensor. The bacterial phage anti-restriction-induced system, PARIS, operates as a toxin–antitoxin system, in which the antitoxin AriA sequesters and inactivates the toxin AriB until triggered by the T7 phage counterdefence protein Ocr.",

    "abstract": "Human mutations in neuropeptide Y (NPY) have been linked to high body mass index but not altered dietary patterns1. Here we uncover the mechanism by which NPY in sympathetic neurons2,3 protects from obesity. Imaging of cleared mouse brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT, respectively) established that NPY+ sympathetic axons are a smaller subset that mostly maps to the perivasculature; analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets identified mural cells as the main NPY-responsive cells in adipose tissues. We show that NPY sustains the proliferation of mural cells, which are a source of thermogenic adipocytes in both BAT and WAT4–6. We found that diet-induced obesity leads to neuropathy of NPY+ axons and concomitant depletion of mural cells. This defect was replicated in mice with NPY abrogated from sympathetic neurons. The loss of NPY in sympathetic neurons whitened interscapular BAT, reducing its thermogenic ability and decreasing energy expenditure before the onset of obesity. It also caused adult-onset obesity of mice fed on a regular chow diet and rendered them more susceptible to diet-induced obesity without increasing food consumption. Our results indicate that, relative to central NPY, peripheral NPY produced by sympathetic nerves has the opposite effect on body weight by sustaining energy expenditure independently of food intake. We find that, relative to central neuropeptide Y, peripheral neuropeptide Y produced by sympathetic nerves has the opposite effect on body weight by sustaining energy expenditure independently of food intake.",

    "abstract": "Severe defects in human IFNγ immunity predispose individuals to both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis, whereas milder defects predispose only to tuberculosis1. Here we report two adults with recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis who are homozygous for a private loss-of-function TNF variant. Neither has any other clinical phenotype and both mount normal clinical and biological inflammatory responses. Their leukocytes, including monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) do not produce TNF, even after stimulation with IFNγ. Blood leukocyte subset development is normal in these patients. However, an impairment in the respiratory burst was observed in granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-matured MDMs and alveolar macrophage-like (AML) cells2 from both patients with TNF deficiency, TNF- or TNFR1-deficient induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived GM-CSF-matured macrophages, and healthy control MDMs and AML cells differentiated with TNF blockers in vitro, and in lung macrophages treated with TNF blockers ex vivo. The stimulation of TNF-deficient iPS-cell-derived macrophages with TNF rescued the respiratory burst. These findings contrast with those for patients with inherited complete deficiency of the respiratory burst across all phagocytes, who are prone to multiple infections, including both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis3. Human TNF is required for respiratory-burst-dependent immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages but is surprisingly redundant otherwise, including for inflammation and immunity to weakly virulent mycobacteria and many other infectious agents. Human TNF is required for respiratory-burst-dependent immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages but seems to be largely redundant physiologically.",

    "abstract": "Viral glycoproteins drive membrane fusion in enveloped viruses and determine host range, tissue tropism and pathogenesis1. Despite their importance, there is a fragmentary understanding of glycoproteins within the Flaviviridae2, a large virus family that include pathogens such as hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses, and numerous other human, animal and emergent viruses. For many flaviviruses the glycoproteins have not yet been identified, for others, such as the hepaciviruses, the molecular mechanisms of membrane fusion remain uncharacterized3. Here we combine phylogenetic analyses with protein structure prediction to survey glycoproteins across the entire Flaviviridae. We find class II fusion systems, homologous to the Orthoflavivirus E glycoprotein in most species, including highly divergent jingmenviruses and large genome flaviviruses. However, the E1E2 glycoproteins of the hepaciviruses, pegiviruses and pestiviruses are structurally distinct, may represent a novel class of fusion mechanism, and are strictly associated with infection of vertebrate hosts. By mapping glycoprotein distribution onto the underlying phylogeny, we reveal a complex evolutionary history marked by the capture of bacterial genes and potentially inter-genus recombination. These insights, made possible through protein structure prediction, refine our understanding of viral fusion mechanisms and reveal the events that have shaped the diverse virology and ecology of the Flaviviridae. Combined phylogenetic analyses and glycoprotein structure prediction across the Flaviviridae reveals divergent membrane fusion systems and provides insights into the complex evolutionary history within this family of viruses.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the domain of large resource-intensive data centres that limit access to a small community of developers1,2. Neuromorphic hardware promises greatly improved space and energy efficiency for AI but is presently only capable of low-accuracy operations, such as inferencing in neural networks3–5. Core computing tasks of signal processing, neural network training and natural language processing demand far higher computing resolution, beyond that of individual neuromorphic circuit elements6–8. Here we introduce an analog molecular memristor based on a Ru-complex of an azo-aromatic ligand with 14-bit resolution. Precise kinetic control over a transition between two thermodynamically stable molecular electronic states facilitates 16,520 distinct analog conductance levels, which can be linearly and symmetrically updated or written individually in one time step, substantially simplifying the weight update procedure over existing neuromorphic platforms3. The circuit elements are unidirectional, facilitating a selector-less 64 × 64 crossbar-based dot-product engine that enables vector–matrix multiplication, including Fourier transform, in a single time step. We achieved more than 73 dB signal-to-noise-ratio, four orders of magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art methods9–11, while consuming 460× less energy than digital computers12,13. Accelerators leveraging these molecular crossbars could transform neuromorphic computing, extending it beyond niche applications and augmenting the core of digital electronics from the cloud to the edge12,13. Harnessing precise molecular kinetics, a 14-bit, energy-efficient dot product engine is realized that unlocks neuromorphic hardware’s potential for core computations.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and has the highest rate of recurrence1. The predominant standard of care for advanced TNBC is systemic chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy; however, responses are typically short lived1,2. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments. Components of the PI3K pathway represent plausible therapeutic targets; more than 70% of TNBCs have alterations in PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN3–6. However, in contrast to hormone-receptor-positive tumours, it is still unclear whether or how triple-negative disease will respond to PI3K pathway inhibitors7. Here we describe a promising AKT-inhibitor-based therapeutic combination for TNBC. Specifically, we show that AKT inhibitors synergize with agents that suppress the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and promote robust tumour regression in multiple TNBC models in vivo. AKT and EZH2 inhibitors exert these effects by first cooperatively driving basal-like TNBC cells into a more differentiated, luminal-like state, which cannot be effectively induced by either agent alone. Once TNBCs are differentiated, these agents kill them by hijacking signals that normally drive mammary gland involution. Using a machine learning approach, we developed a classifier that can be used to predict sensitivity. Together, these findings identify a promising therapeutic strategy for this highly aggressive tumour type and illustrate how deregulated epigenetic enzymes can insulate tumours from oncogenic vulnerabilities. These studies also reveal how developmental tissue-specific cell death pathways may be co-opted for therapeutic benefit. AKT inhibitors synergize with agents that suppress the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and promote robust tumour regression in multiple triple-negative breast cancer models in vivo by triggering an involution-like process.",

    "abstract": "Multicomponent reactions—those where three or more substrates combine into a product—have been highly useful in rapidly building chemical building blocks of increased complexity1, but achieving this enzymatically has remained rare2–5. This limitation primarily arises because an enzyme’s active site is not typically set up to address multiple substrates, especially in cases involving multiple radical intermediates6. Recently, chemical catalytic radical sorting has emerged as an enabling strategy for a variety of useful reactions7,8. However, making such processes enantioselective is highly challenging owing to the inherent difficulty in the stereochemical control of radicals9. Here we repurpose a thiamine-dependent enzyme10,11 through directed evolution and combine it with photoredox catalysis to achieve a photobiocatalytic enantioselective three-component radical cross-coupling. This approach combines three readily available starting materials—aldehydes, α-bromo-carbonyls and alkenes—to give access to enantioenriched ketone products. Mechanistic investigations provide insights into how this dual photocatalyst–enzyme system precisely directs the three distinct radicals involved in the transformation, unlocking enzyme reactivity. Our approach has achieved exceptional stereoselectivity, with 24 out of 33 examples achieving ≥97% enantiomeric excess. Enantioselective three-component radical cross-coupling is achieved using a thiamine-dependent enzyme and photoredox catalysis, giving access to ketone products with exceptional stereoselectivity.",

    "abstract": "Two newly duplicated copies of genomic DNA are held together by the ring-shaped cohesin complex to ensure faithful inheritance of the genome during cell division1–3. Cohesin mediates sister chromatid cohesion by topologically entrapping two sister DNAs during DNA replication4,5, but how cohesion is established at the replication fork is poorly understood. Here, we studied the interplay between cohesin and replication by reconstituting a functional replisome using purified proteins. Once DNA is encircled before replication, the cohesin ring accommodates replication in its entirety, from initiation to termination, leading to topological capture of newly synthesized DNA. This suggests that topological cohesin loading is a critical molecular prerequisite to cope with replication. Paradoxically, topological loading per se is highly rate limiting and hardly occurs under the replication-competent physiological salt concentration. This inconsistency is resolved by the replisome-associated cohesion establishment factors Chl1 helicase and Ctf4 (refs. 6,7), which promote cohesin loading specifically during continuing replication. Accordingly, we found that bubble DNA, which mimics the state of DNA unwinding, induces topological cohesin loading and this is further promoted by Chl1. Thus, we propose that cohesin converts the initial electrostatic DNA-binding mode to a topological embrace when it encounters unwound DNA structures driven by enzymatic activities including replication. Together, our results show how cohesin initially responds to replication, and provide a molecular model for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. We study the interplay between cohesin and replication by reconstituting a functional replisome using purified proteins, showing how cohesin initially responds to replication and providing a molecular model for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.",

    "abstract": "Although KDM5C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in X-linked intellectual disability1, the exact mechanisms that lead to cognitive impairment remain unknown. Here we use human patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and Kdm5c knockout mice to conduct cellular, transcriptomic, chromatin and behavioural studies. KDM5C is identified as a safeguard to ensure that neurodevelopment occurs at an appropriate timescale, the disruption of which leads to intellectual disability. Specifically, there is a developmental window during which KDM5C directly controls WNT output to regulate the timely transition of primary to intermediate progenitor cells and consequently neurogenesis. Treatment with WNT signalling modulators at specific times reveal that only a transient alteration of the canonical WNT signalling pathway is sufficient to rescue the transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes in patient-derived cells and to induce these changes in wild-type cells. Notably, WNT inhibition during this developmental period also rescues behavioural changes of Kdm5c knockout mice. Conversely, a single injection of WNT3A into the brains of wild-type embryonic mice cause anxiety and memory alterations. Our work identifies KDM5C as a crucial sentinel for neurodevelopment and sheds new light on KDM5C mutation-associated intellectual disability. The results also increase our general understanding of memory and anxiety formation, with the identification of WNT functioning in a transient nature to affect long-lasting cognitive function. The demethylase KDM5C, mutations in which often lead to intellectual disability, is identified as a crucial player in regulating the precise timing of neurodevelopment together with the WNT signalling pathway.",

    "abstract": "AIRE is an unconventional transcription factor that enhances the expression of thousands of genes in medullary thymic epithelial cells and promotes clonal deletion or phenotypic diversion of self-reactive T cells1–4. The biological logic of AIRE’s target specificity remains largely unclear as, in contrast to many transcription factors, it does not bind to a particular DNA sequence motif. Here we implemented two orthogonal approaches to investigate AIRE’s cis-regulatory mechanisms: construction of a convolutional neural network and leveraging natural genetic variation through analysis of F1 hybrid mice5. Both approaches nominated Z-DNA and NFE2–MAF as putative positive influences on AIRE’s target choices. Genome-wide mapping studies revealed that Z-DNA-forming and NFE2L2-binding motifs were positively associated with the inherent ability of a gene’s promoter to generate DNA double-stranded breaks, and promoters showing strong double-stranded break generation were more likely to enter a poised state with accessible chromatin and already-assembled transcriptional machinery. Consequently, AIRE preferentially targets genes with poised promoters. We propose a model in which Z-DNA anchors the AIRE-mediated transcriptional program by enhancing double-stranded break generation and promoter poising. Beyond resolving a long-standing mechanistic conundrum, these findings suggest routes for manipulating T cell tolerance. Z-DNA anchors the AIRE-mediated transcriptional program by enhancing the generation of double-stranded breaks and promoter poising.",

    "abstract": "Fully developed turbulence is a universal and scale-invariant chaotic state characterized by an energy cascade from large to small scales at which the cascade is eventually arrested by dissipation1–6. Here we show how to harness these seemingly structureless turbulent cascades to generate patterns. Pattern formation entails a process of wavelength selection, which can usually be traced to the linear instability of a homogeneous state7. By contrast, the mechanism we propose here is fully nonlinear. It is triggered by the non-dissipative arrest of turbulent cascades: energy piles up at an intermediate scale, which is neither the system size nor the smallest scales at which energy is usually dissipated. Using a combination of theory and large-scale simulations, we show that the tunable wavelength of these cascade-induced patterns can be set by a non-dissipative transport coefficient called odd viscosity, ubiquitous in chiral fluids ranging from bioactive to quantum systems8–12. Odd viscosity, which acts as a scale-dependent Coriolis-like force, leads to a two-dimensionalization of the flow at small scales, in contrast with rotating fluids in which a two-dimensionalization occurs at large scales4. Apart from odd viscosity fluids, we discuss how cascade-induced patterns can arise in natural systems, including atmospheric flows13–19, stellar plasma such as the solar wind20–22, or the pulverization and coagulation of objects or droplets in which mass rather than energy cascades23–25. Turbulent energy cascades can be arrested by non-dissipative viscosities, resulting in pattern formation at intermediate length scales.",

    "abstract": "Topology1–3 and interactions are foundational concepts in the modern understanding of quantum matter. Their nexus yields three important research directions: (1) the competition between distinct interactions, as in several intertwined phases, (2) the interplay between interactions and topology that drives the phenomena in twisted layered materials and topological magnets, and (3) the coalescence of several topological orders to generate distinct novel phases. The first two examples have grown into major areas of research, although the last example remains mostly unexplored, mainly because of the lack of a material platform for experimental studies. Here, using tunnelling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy and a theoretical analysis, we unveil a ‘hybrid’ topological phase of matter in the simple elemental-solid arsenic. Through a unique bulk-surface-edge correspondence, we uncover that arsenic features a conjoined strong and higher-order topology that stabilizes a hybrid topological phase. Although momentum-space spectroscopy measurements show signs of topological surface states, real-space microscopy measurements unravel a unique geometry of topologically induced step-edge conduction channels revealed on various natural nanostructures on the surface. Using theoretical models, we show that the existence of gapless step-edge states in arsenic relies on the simultaneous presence of both a non-trivial strong Z2 invariant and a non-trivial higher-order topological invariant, which provide experimental evidence for hybrid topology. Our study highlights pathways for exploring the interplay of different band topologies and harnessing the associated topological conduction channels in engineered quantum or nano-devices. A hybrid topological phase of matter is discovered in the simple elemental-solid arsenic and explored using tunnelling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy and a theoretical analysis.",

    "abstract": "The human brain develops through a tightly organized cascade of patterning events, induced by transcription factor expression and changes in chromatin accessibility. Although gene expression across the developing brain has been described at single-cell resolution1, similar atlases of chromatin accessibility have been primarily focused on the forebrain2–4. Here we describe chromatin accessibility and paired gene expression across the entire developing human brain during the first trimester (6–13 weeks after conception). We defined 135 clusters and used multiomic measurements to link candidate cis-regulatory elements to gene expression. The number of accessible regions increased both with age and along neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network, we identified putative functional transcription factor-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes. We applied this model to cis-regulatory elements linked to ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism in the Purkinje cell lineage. Finally, by linking disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms to cis-regulatory elements, we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder-related mutations. Our findings provide a more detailed view of key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of brain cell types during the first trimester and a comprehensive reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment. A study describes chromatin accessibility and paired gene expression across the entire developing human brain during the first trimester in the context of gene regulation and neurodevelopmental disease.",

    "abstract": "The rich variety of behaviours observed in animals arises through the interplay between sensory processing and motor control. To understand these sensorimotor transformations, it is useful to build models that predict not only neural responses to sensory input1–5 but also how each neuron causally contributes to behaviour6,7. Here we demonstrate a novel modelling approach to identify a one-to-one mapping between internal units in a deep neural network and real neurons by predicting the behavioural changes that arise from systematic perturbations of more than a dozen neuronal cell types. A key ingredient that we introduce is ‘knockout training’, which involves perturbing the network during training to match the perturbations of the real neurons during behavioural experiments. We apply this approach to model the sensorimotor transformations of Drosophila melanogaster males during a complex, visually guided social behaviour8–11. The visual projection neurons at the interface between the optic lobe and central brain form a set of discrete channels12, and prior work indicates that each channel encodes a specific visual feature to drive a particular behaviour13,14. Our model reaches a different conclusion: combinations of visual projection neurons, including those involved in non-social behaviours, drive male interactions with the female, forming a rich population code for behaviour. Overall, our framework consolidates behavioural effects elicited from various neural perturbations into a single, unified model, providing a map from stimulus to neuronal cell type to behaviour, and enabling future incorporation of wiring diagrams of the brain15 into the model. A deep neural network with ‘knockout training’ is used to model sensorimotor transformations and neural perturbations of male Drosophila melanogaster during visually guided social behaviour and provides predictions and insights into relationships between stimuli, neurons and behaviour.",

Here we use spatial transcriptomics, spatial proteomics and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization to reconstruct a comprehensive spatial expression atlas of the adult human proximal small intestine. We describe zonated expression and cell type representation for epithelial, mesenchymal and immune cell types. We find that migrating enterocytes switch from lipid droplet assembly and iron uptake at the villus bottom to chylomicron biosynthesis and iron release at the tip. Villus tip cells are pro-immunogenic, recruiting γδ T cells and macrophages to the tip, in contrast to their immunosuppressive roles in mouse. We also show that the human small intestine contains abundant serrated and branched villi that are enriched at the tops of circular folds.

Only a very small fraction of such a vast sequence space can ever be experimentally or computationally surveyed. Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to navigate high-dimensional sequence spaces1. However, these models are extremely complicated. Here, by experimentally sampling from sequence spaces larger than 1010, we show that the genetic architecture of at least some proteins is remarkably simple, allowing accurate genetic prediction in high-dimensional sequence spaces with fully interpretable energy models. These models capture the nonlinear relationships between free energies and phenotypes but otherwise consist of additive free energy changes with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. These energetic couplings are sparse and associated with structural contacts and backbone proximity. Our results indicate that protein genetics is actually both rather simple and intelligible. By experimentally sampling from sequence spaces larger than 1010 and using thermodynamic models, the genetic structure of at least some proteins can be well described, indicating that protein genetics is simpler than anticipated.",

    "abstract": "Extracting the underlying temporal structure of experience is a fundamental aspect of learning and memory that allows us to predict what is likely to happen next. Current knowledge about the neural underpinnings of this cognitive process in humans stems from functional neuroimaging research1–5. As these methods lack direct access to the neuronal level, it remains unknown how this process is computed by neurons in the human brain. Here we record from single neurons in individuals who have been implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical reasons, and show that human hippocampal and entorhinal neurons gradually modify their activity to encode the temporal structure of a complex image presentation sequence. This representation was formed rapidly, without providing specific instructions to the participants, and persisted when the prescribed experience was no longer present. Furthermore, the structure recovered from the population activity of hippocampal–entorhinal neurons closely resembled the structural graph defining the sequence, but at the same time, also reflected the probability of upcoming stimuli. Finally, learning of the sequence graph was related to spontaneous, time-compressed replay of individual neurons’ activity corresponding to previously experienced graph trajectories. These findings demonstrate that neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex integrate the ‘what’ and ‘when’ information to extract durable and predictive representations of the temporal structure of human experience. Single-neuron recordings from intracranial electrodes inserted into human brains for clinical reasons suggest that the temporal structure of human experience is encoded in human hippocampal and entorhinal neurons.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes have crucial roles in regulating eukaryotic metabolism and cell growth by acting as signalling platforms to sense and respond to changes in nutrient and energy availability1. LYCHOS (GPR155) is a lysosomal transmembrane protein that functions as a cholesterol sensor, facilitating the cholesterol-dependent activation of the master protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)2. However, the structural basis of LYCHOS assembly and activity remains unclear. Here we determine several high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of human LYCHOS, revealing a homodimeric transmembrane assembly of a transporter-like domain fused to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) domain. The class B2-like GPCR domain is captured in the apo state and packs against the surface of the transporter-like domain, providing an unusual example of a GPCR as a domain in a larger transmembrane assembly. Cholesterol sensing is mediated by a conserved cholesterol-binding motif, positioned between the GPCR and transporter domains. We reveal that the LYCHOS transporter-like domain is an orthologue of the plant PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transporter family, and has greater structural similarity to plant auxin transporters than to known human transporters. Activity assays support a model in which the LYCHOS transporter and GPCR domains coordinate to sense cholesterol and regulate mTORC1 activation. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human lysosomal transmembrane protein LYCHOS show that it comprises a transporter-like domain fused to a G-protein-coupled receptor, and that the transporter domain is similar to the plant PIN family.",

    "abstract": "C–N bond formation is integral to modern chemical synthesis owing to the ubiquity of nitrogen heterocycles in small-molecule pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Alkene hydroamination with unactivated alkenes is an atom-economical strategy for constructing these bonds. However, these reactions are challenging to render asymmetric when preparing fully substituted carbon stereocentres. Here we report a photoenzymatic alkene hydroamination to prepare 2,2-disubstituted pyrrolidines by a Baeyer–Villiger mono-oxygenase. Five rounds of protein engineering afforded a mutant, providing excellent product yield and stereoselectivity. Unlike related photochemical hydroaminations, which rely on the oxidation of the amine or alkene for C–N bond formation, this work exploits a through-space interaction of a reductively generated benzylic radical and the nitrogen lone pair. This antibonding interaction lowers the oxidation potential of the radical, enabling electron transfer to the flavin cofactor. Experiments indicate that the enzyme microenvironment is essential in enabling a innovative C–N bond formation mechanism with no parallel in small-molecule catalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the substrate in the enzyme active site, which further support this hypothesis. This work is a rare example of an emerging mechanism in non-natural biocatalysis in which an enzyme has access to a mechanism that its individual components do not. Our study showcases the potential of enhancing emergent mechanisms using protein engineering to provide unique mechanistic solutions to unanswered challenges in chemical synthesis. This study highlights an emergent mechanism in non-natural biocatalysis, showcasing the role of protein engineering in addressing challenges in chemical synthesis.",

However, the underlying neural processes of human olfaction are still poorly understood at the fundamental—that is, the single-neuron—level. Here we report recordings of single-neuron activity in the piriform cortex and medial temporal lobe in awake humans performing an odour rating and identification task. We identified odour-modulated neurons within the piriform cortex, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In each of these regions, neuronal firing accurately encodes odour identity. Notably, repeated odour presentations reduce response firing rates, demonstrating central repetition suppression and habituation. Different medial temporal lobe regions have distinct roles in odour processing, with amygdala neurons encoding subjective odour valence, and hippocampal neurons predicting behavioural odour identification performance. Whereas piriform neurons preferably encode chemical odour identity, hippocampal activity reflects subjective odour perception. Critically, we identify that piriform cortex neurons reliably encode odour-related images, supporting a multimodal role of the human piriform cortex. We also observe marked cross-modal coding of both odours and images, especially in the amygdala and piriform cortex. Moreover, we identify neurons that respond to semantically coherent odour and image information, demonstrating conceptual coding schemes in olfaction. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between animal models and non-invasive human studies and advance our understanding of odour processing in the human brain by identifying neuronal odour-coding principles, regional functional differences and cross-modal integration. Human piriform and mediotemporal neurons encode odours, and signal how we perceive, rate and identify scents.",

    "abstract": "Softening of the transverse optical (TO) phonon, which could trigger ferroelectric phase transition, can usually be achieved by enhancing the long-range Coulomb interaction over the short-range bonding force1, for example, by increasing the Born effective charges2. However, it suffers from depolarization effects3,4 as the induced ferroelectricity is suppressed on size reduction of the host materials towards high-density nanoscale electronics. Here, we present an alternative route to drive the TO phonon softening by showing that the abnormal soft TO phonon in rocksalt-structured ultrawide-bandgap BeO (ref. 5) is mainly induced by a substantial reduction in the short-range bonding interaction due to the Be–O bond stretching caused by an electron cloud-overlap-induced Coulomb repulsion between two adjacent oxygen ions that are arranged octahedrally around an extremely small Be ion. We further demonstrate the emergence of robust ferroelectricity in strain-induced perovskite BaZrO3 and ultrathin HfO2 and ZrO2 films6,7 grown epitaxially on lattice-mismatched SiO2/Si substrate arising from the softening of the TO phonon driven by a reduction in the short-range bonding strength of biaxial strain-induced stretching bonds. These findings shed light on developing a unified theory for ferroelectricity enhancement in ultrathin films free from depolarization fields by tailoring chemical bonds using ionic radius differences, strains, doping and lattice distortions. An alternative route to drive the transverse optical phonon softening sheds light on developing a unified theory for ferroelectricity enhancement in ultrathin films free from depolarization fields using ionic radius differences and strains, among other methods.",

Plasma membrane rupture is mediated by the effector membrane protein ninjurin-1 (NINJ1)1, which polymerizes and ruptures the membrane via its hydrophilic face1–4. How NINJ1 is restrained under steady-state conditions to ensure cell survival remains unknown. Here we describe the molecular underpinnings of NINJ1 inhibition. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we determined the structure of inactive-state mouse NINJ1 bound to the newly developed nanobody Nb538. Inactive NINJ1 forms a face-to-face homodimer by adopting a three-helix conformation with unkinked transmembrane helix 1 (TM1), in contrast to the four-helix TM1-kinked active conformation2–4. Accordingly, endogenous NINJ1 from primary macrophages is a dimer under steady-state conditions. Inactive dimers sequester the membrane rupture-inducing hydrophilic face of NINJ1 and occlude the binding site for kinked TM1 from neighbouring activated NINJ1 molecules. Mutagenesis studies in cells show that destabilization of inactive face-to-face dimers leads to NINJ1-mediated cell death, whereas stabilization of face-to-face dimers inhibits NINJ1 activity. Moreover, destabilizing mutations prompt spontaneous TM1 kink formation, a hallmark of NINJ1 activation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that dimeric NINJ1 is autoinhibited in trans to prevent unprovoked plasma membrane rupture and cell death. Structure-function studies reveal that the plasma membrane rupture protein NINJ1 homodimerizes through its hydrophilic membrane-rupturing face, thereby rendering NINJ1 inactive in the resting state.",

    "abstract": "How the olfactory system detects and distinguishes odorants with diverse physicochemical properties and molecular configurations remains poorly understood. Vertebrate animals perceive odours through G protein-coupled odorant receptors (ORs)1. In humans, around 400 ORs enable the sense of smell. The OR family comprises two main classes: class I ORs are tuned to carboxylic acids whereas class II ORs, which represent most of the human repertoire, respond to a wide variety of odorants2. A fundamental challenge in understanding olfaction is the inability to visualize odorant binding to ORs. Here we uncover molecular properties of odorant–OR interactions by using engineered ORs crafted using a consensus protein design strategy3. Because such consensus ORs (consORs) are derived from the 17 major subfamilies of human ORs, they provide a template for modelling individual native ORs with high sequence and structural homology. The biochemical tractability of consORs enabled the determination of four cryogenic electron microscopy structures of distinct consORs with specific ligand recognition properties. The structure of a class I consOR, consOR51, showed high structural similarity to the native human receptor OR51E2 and generated a homology model of a related member of the human OR51 family with high predictive power. Structures of three class II consORs revealed distinct modes of odorant-binding and activation mechanisms between class I and class II ORs. Thus, the structures of consORs lay the groundwork for understanding molecular recognition of odorants by the OR superfamily. Use of the consensus protein design method facilitated the generation of stable engineered mammalian odorant receptors to gain insight into the molecular properties of odorant–receptor interactions.",

    "abstract": "Neuropeptides have important roles in neural plasticity, spiking and behaviour1. Yet, many fundamental questions remain regarding their spatiotemporal transmission, integration and functions in the awake brain. Here we examined how MC4R-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVHMC4R) integrate neuropeptide signals to modulate feeding-related fast synaptic transmission and titrate the transition to satiety2–6. We show that hunger-promoting AgRP axons release the neuropeptide NPY to decrease the second messenger cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons, while satiety-promoting POMC axons release the neuropeptide αMSH to increase cAMP. Each release event is all-or-none, stochastic and can impact multiple neurons within an approximately 100-µm-diameter region. After release, NPY and αMSH peptides compete to control cAMP—the amplitude and persistence of NPY signalling is blunted by high αMSH in the fed state, while αMSH signalling is blunted by high NPY in the fasted state. Feeding resolves this competition by simultaneously elevating αMSH release and suppressing NPY release7,8, thereby sustaining elevated cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons throughout a meal. In turn, elevated cAMP facilitates potentiation of feeding-related excitatory inputs with each bite to gradually promote satiation across many minutes. Our findings highlight biochemical modes of peptide signal integration and information accumulation to guide behavioural state transitions. Release of hunger-promoting and satiety-promoting neuropeptides drives opposing changes in the second messenger cAMP in awake mouse paraventricular hypothalamic MC4R neurons, thereby regulating synaptic plasticity and the transition to satiety with each bite of food.",

    "abstract": "Thiazoles and isothiazoles are privileged motifs in drug and agrochemical discovery1,2. The synthesis of these derivatives is generally approached, designed and developed on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes, the lack of robust synthesis methods to a given target can pose considerable difficulties or even thwart the preparation of specific derivatives for further study3,4. Here we report a conceptually different approach in which photochemical irradiation can be used to alter the structure of thiazoles and isothiazoles in a selective and predictable manner. On photoexcitation, these derivatives populate their π,π* singlet excited states that undergo a series of structural rearrangements, leading to an overall permutation of the cyclic system and its substituents. This means that once the initial heteroaromatic scaffold has been prepared, it can then function as an entry point to access other molecules by selective structural permutation. This approach operates under mild photochemical conditions that tolerate many chemically distinct functionalities. Preliminary findings also show the potential for extending this method to other azole systems, including benzo[d]isothiazole, indazole, pyrazole and isoxazole. This strategy establishes photochemical permutation as a powerful and convenient method for the preparation of complex and difficult-to-access derivatives from more available structural isomers. A photochemical method alters thiazole and isothiazole structures predictably that enables selective rearrangements and expanding accessible derivatives, thereby advancing drug and agrochemical discoveries under mild conditions.",

Mining these growing atlases could reveal cell–disease associations, identify cell states in unexpected tissue contexts and relate in vivo biology to in vitro models. These require a common measure of cell similarity across the body and an efficient way to search. Here we develop SCimilarity, a metric-learning framework to learn a unified and interpretable representation that enables rapid queries of tens of millions of cell profiles from diverse studies for cells that are transcriptionally similar to an input cell profile or state. We use SCimilarity to query a 23.4-million-cell atlas of 412 single-cell RNA-sequencing studies for macrophage and fibroblast profiles from interstitial lung disease1 and reveal similar cell profiles across other fibrotic diseases and tissues. The top scoring in vitro hit for the macrophage query was a 3D hydrogel system2, which we experimentally demonstrated reproduces this cell state. SCimilarity serves as a foundation model for single-cell profiles that enables researchers to query for similar cellular states across the human body, providing a powerful tool for generating biological insights from the Human Cell Atlas. In a 23.4-million-cell atlas of 412 single-cell RNA-sequencing studies, SCimilarity query of macrophage and fibroblast profiles from interstitial lung disease reveals similar cell profiles across other fibrotic diseases and tissues.",

    "abstract": "As an essential branched amino acid, valine is pivotal for protein synthesis, neurological behaviour, haematopoiesis and leukaemia progression1–3. However, the mechanism by which cellular valine abundancy is sensed for subsequent cellular functions remains undefined. Here we identify that human histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) serves as a valine sensor by directly binding valine through a primate-specific SE14 repeat domain. The nucleus and cytoplasm shuttling of human, but not mouse, HDAC6 is tightly controlled by the intracellular levels of valine. Valine deprivation leads to HDAC6 retention in the nucleus and induces DNA damage. Mechanistically, nuclear-localized HDAC6 binds and deacetylates ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) to initiate active DNA demethylation, which promotes DNA damage through thymine DNA glycosylase-driven excision. Dietary valine restriction inhibits tumour growth in xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models, and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PARP inhibitors. Collectively, our study identifies human HDAC6 as a valine sensor that mediates active DNA demethylation and DNA damage in response to valine deprivation, and highlights the potential of dietary valine restriction for cancer treatment. The histone deacetylase HDAC6 is a sensor of valine levels, and the abundance of valine in cells regulates DNA damage and cell homeostasis functions.",

    "abstract": "The inclusion of microexons by alternative splicing occurs frequently in neuronal proteins. The roles of these sequences are largely unknown, and changes in their degree of inclusion are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders1. We have previously shown that decreased inclusion of a 24-nucleotide neuron-specific microexon in CPEB4, a RNA-binding protein that regulates translation through cytoplasmic changes in poly(A) tail length, is linked to idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD)2. Why this microexon is required and how small changes in its degree of inclusion have a dominant-negative effect on the expression of ASD-linked genes is unclear. Here we show that neuronal CPEB4 forms condensates that dissolve after depolarization, a transition associated with a switch from translational repression to activation. Heterotypic interactions between the microexon and a cluster of histidine residues prevent the irreversible aggregation of CPEB4 by competing with homotypic interactions between histidine clusters. We conclude that the microexon is required in neuronal CPEB4 to preserve the reversible regulation of CPEB4-mediated gene expression in response to neuronal stimulation. The molecular mechanisms of how small changes in the degree of inclusion of a neuron-specific microexon in CPEB4 lead to dominant-negative effects in the expression of genes associated with autism spectrum disorder are identified.",

Mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolaemia, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by a marked increase in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease2. The structure of apoB100 on LDL and its interaction with LDLR are poorly understood. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of apoB100 on LDL bound to the LDLR and a nanobody complex, which can form a C2-symmetric, higher-order complex. Using local refinement, we determined high-resolution structures of the interfaces between apoB100 and LDLR. One binding interface is formed between several small-ligand-binding modules of LDLR and a series of basic patches that are scattered along a β-belt formed by apoB100, encircling LDL. The other binding interface is formed between the β-propeller domain of LDLR and the N-terminal domain of apoB100. Our results reveal how both interfaces are involved in LDL dimer formation, and how LDLR cycles between LDL- and self-bound conformations. In addition, known mutations in either apoB100 or LDLR, associated with high levels of LDL-C, are located at the LDL–LDLR interface. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) in complex with the LDL receptor (LDLR) provide insight into binding interfaces and explain how mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR can give rise to familial hypercholesterolaemia.",

    "abstract": "Diamond is an exceptional material with great potential across various fields owing to its interesting properties1,2. However, despite extensive efforts over the past decades3–5, producing large quantities of desired ultrathin diamond membranes for widespread use remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that edge-exposed exfoliation using sticky tape is a simple, scalable and reliable method for producing ultrathin and transferable polycrystalline diamond membranes. Our approach enables the mass production of large-area (2-inch wafer), ultrathin (sub-micrometre thickness), ultraflat (sub-nano surface roughness) and ultraflexible (360° bendable) diamond membranes. These high-quality membranes, which have a flat workable surface, support standard micromanufacturing techniques, and their ultraflexible nature allows for direct elastic strain engineering and deformation sensing applications, which is not possible with their bulky counterpart. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the quality of the exfoliated membranes depends on the peeling angle and membrane thickness, for which largely intact diamond membranes can be robustly produced within an optimal operation window. This single-step method, which opens up new avenues for the mass production of high-figure-of-merit diamond membranes, is expected to accelerate the commercialization and arrival of the diamond era in electronics, photonics and other related fields. Edge-exposed exfoliation using sticky tape is shown to be a simple and reliable method for scaling up the production of ultrathin, ultraflat and ultraflexible polycrystalline diamond membranes for diverse electrical, optical, mechanical, thermal, acoustic and quantum applications.",

    "abstract": "Today oxygenic photosynthesis is unique to cyanobacteria and their plastid relatives within eukaryotes. Although its origin before the Great Oxidation Event is still debated1–4, the accumulation of O2 profoundly modified the redox chemistry of the Earth and the evolution of the biosphere, including complex life. Understanding the diversification of cyanobacteria is thus crucial to grasping the coevolution of our planet and life, but their early fossil record remains ambiguous5. Extant cyanobacteria include the thylakoid-less Gloeobacter-like group and the remainder of cyanobacteria that acquired thylakoid membranes6,7. The timing of this divergence is indirectly estimated at between 2.7 and 2.0 billion years ago (Ga) based on molecular clocks and phylogenies8–11 and inferred from the earliest undisputed fossil record of Eoentophysalis belcherensis, a 2.018–1.854 Ga pleurocapsalean cyanobacterium preserved in silicified stromatolites12,13. Here we report the oldest direct evidence of thylakoid membranes in a parallel-to-contorted arrangement within the enigmatic cylindrical microfossils Navifusa majensis from the McDermott Formation, Tawallah Group, Australia (1.78–1.73 Ga), and in a parietal arrangement in specimens from the Grassy Bay Formation, Shaler Supergroup, Canada (1.01–0.9 Ga). This discovery extends their fossil record by at least 1.2 Ga and provides a minimum age for the divergence of thylakoid-bearing cyanobacteria at roughly 1.75 Ga. It allows the unambiguous identification of early oxygenic photosynthesizers and a new redox proxy for probing early Earth ecosystems, highlighting the importance of examining the ultrastructure of fossil cells to decipher their palaeobiology and early evolution. We report the oldest direct evidence of thylakoid membranes in a parallel-to-contorted arrangement within the enigmatic cylindrical microfossils Navifusa majensis from the McDermott Formation, Tawallah Group, Australia (1.78–1.73 Ga).",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic type III CRISPR–Cas systems provide immunity against viruses and plasmids using CRISPR-associated Rossman fold (CARF) protein effectors1–5. Recognition of transcripts of these invaders with sequences that are complementary to CRISPR RNA guides leads to the production of cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers, which bind CARF domains and trigger the activity of an effector domain6,7. Whereas most effectors degrade host and invader nucleic acids, some are predicted to contain transmembrane helices without an enzymatic function. Whether and how these CARF–transmembrane helix fusion proteins facilitate the type III CRISPR–Cas immune response remains unknown. Here we investigate the role of cyclic oligoadenylate-activated membrane protein 1 (Cam1) during type III CRISPR immunity. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that the CARF domains of a Cam1 dimer bind cyclic tetra-adenylate second messengers. In vivo, Cam1 localizes to the membrane, is predicted to form a tetrameric transmembrane pore, and provides defence against viral infection through the induction of membrane depolarization and growth arrest. These results reveal that CRISPR immunity does not always operate through the degradation of nucleic acids, but is instead mediated via a wider range of cellular responses. The prokaryotic non-enzymatic effector protein Cam1 mediates CRISPR immunity by binding tetra-adenylate second messengers and forming a pore in the membrane that induces membrane depolarization and growth arrest.",

    "abstract": "Ever since its discovery1, the notion of the Berry phase has permeated all branches of physics and plays an important part in a variety of quantum phenomena2. However, so far all its realizations have been based on a continuous evolution of the quantum state, following a cyclic path. Here we introduce and demonstrate a conceptually new manifestation of the Berry phase in light-driven crystals, in which the electronic wavefunction accumulates a geometric phase during a discrete evolution between different bands, while preserving the coherence of the process. We experimentally reveal this phase by using a strong laser field to engineer an internal interferometer, induced during less than one cycle of the driving field, which maps the phase onto the emission of higher-order harmonics. Our work provides an opportunity for the study of geometric phases, leading to a variety of observations in light-driven topological phenomena and attosecond solid-state physics. The Berry phase is resolved in light-driven crystals, via attosecond interferometry, in which the electronic wavefunction accumulates a geometric phase as it interacts with the laser field, mapping its coherence into the emission of high-order harmonics.",

    "abstract": "A number of organisms, including dolphins, bats and electric fish, possess sophisticated active sensory systems that use self-generated signals (for example, acoustic or electrical emissions) to probe the environment1,2. Studies of active sensing in social groups have typically focused on strategies for minimizing interference from conspecific emissions2–4. However, it is well known from engineering that multiple spatially distributed emitters and receivers can greatly enhance environmental sensing (for example, multistatic radar and sonar)5–8. Here we provide evidence from modelling, neural recordings and behavioural experiments that the African weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii utilizes the electrical pulses of conspecifics to extend its electrolocation range, discriminate objects and increase information transmission. These results provide evidence for a new, collective mode of active sensing in which individual perception is enhanced by the energy emissions of nearby group members. Through modelling, neural recordings and behavioural experiments, a study shows that individual electric fish use electrical pulses of conspecifics to extend their electrolocation range, discriminate objects and increase information transmission.",

    "abstract": "Scientific exploration of phototrophic bacteria over nearly 200 years has revealed large phylogenetic gaps between known phototrophic groups that limit understanding of how phototrophy evolved and diversified1,2. Here, through Boreal Shield lake water incubations, we cultivated an anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium from a previously unknown order within the Chloroflexota phylum that represents a highly novel transition form in the evolution of photosynthesis. Unlike all other known phototrophs, this bacterium uses a type I reaction centre (RCI) for light energy conversion yet belongs to the same bacterial phylum as organisms that use a type II reaction centre (RCII) for phototrophy. Using physiological, phylogenomic and environmental metatranscriptomic data, we demonstrate active RCI-utilizing metabolism by the strain alongside usage of chlorosomes3 and bacteriochlorophylls4 related to those of RCII-utilizing Chloroflexota members. Despite using different reaction centres, our phylogenomic data provide strong evidence that RCI-utilizing and RCII-utilizing Chloroflexia members inherited phototrophy from a most recent common phototrophic ancestor. The Chloroflexota phylum preserves an evolutionary record of the use of contrasting phototrophic modes among genetically related bacteria, giving new context for exploring the diversification of phototrophy on Earth. Cultivation of a new anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium from Boreal Shield lake water—representing a transition form in the evolution of photosynthesis—offers insights into how the major modes of phototrophy diversified.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are critical modulators of antiviral tolerance through the release of mitochondrial RNA and DNA (mtDNA and mtRNA) fragments into the cytoplasm after infection, activating virus sensors and type-I interferon (IFN-I) response1–4. The relevance of these mechanisms for mitochondrial diseases remains understudied. Here we investigated mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS), which is caused by a common European founder mutation in DNA polymerase gamma (POLG1)5. Patients homozygous for the MIRAS variant p.W748S show exceptionally variable ages of onset and symptoms5, indicating that unknown modifying factors contribute to disease manifestation. We report that the mtDNA replicase POLG1 has a role in antiviral defence mechanisms to double-stranded DNA and positive-strand RNA virus infections (HSV-1, TBEV and SARS-CoV-2), and its p.W748S variant dampens innate immune responses. Our patient and knock-in mouse data show that p.W748S compromises mtDNA replisome stability, causing mtDNA depletion, aggravated by virus infection. Low mtDNA and mtRNA release into the cytoplasm and a slow IFN response in MIRAS offer viruses an early replicative advantage, leading to an augmented pro-inflammatory response, a subacute loss of GABAergic neurons and liver inflammation and necrosis. A population databank of around 300,000 Finnish individuals6 demonstrates enrichment of immunodeficient traits in carriers of the POLG1 p.W748S mutation. Our evidence suggests that POLG1 defects compromise antiviral tolerance, triggering epilepsy and liver disease. The finding has important implications for the mitochondrial disease spectrum, including epilepsy, ataxia and parkinsonism. The POLG1 mutation p.W748S, which is associated with mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome, dampens innate immune responses by compromising mtDNA replisome stability, and this explains why a viral infection can trigger the development of the disease and contribute to its variable clinical manifestation.",

Although silicon-based complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) chips are manufactured using several dies on a single wafer and the multi-project wafer concept enables the aggregation of various CMOS chip designs within the same die, TFT fabrication is currently lacking a fully verified, universal design approach. This increases the cost and complexity of manufacturing TFT-based flexible electronics, slowing down their integration into more mature applications and limiting the design complexity achievable by foundries. Here we show a stable and high-yield TFT platform for the fabless manufacturing of two mainstream TFT technologies, wafer-based amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide and panel-based low-temperature polycrystalline silicon, two key TFT technologies applicable to flexible substrates. We have designed the iconic 6502 microprocessor in both technologies as a use case to demonstrate and expand the multi-project wafer approach. Enabling the foundry model for TFTs, as an analogy of silicon CMOS technologies, can accelerate the growth and development of applications and technologies based on these devices. The iconic 6502 microprocessor designed in two key thin-film transistor technologies by independent foundries is used to demonstrate and expand the multi-project wafer approach for flexible electronics.",

    "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the most complex, dynamic and abundant sources of organic carbon, but its chemical reactivity remains uncertain1–3. Greater insights into DOM structural features could facilitate understanding its synthesis, turnover and processing in the global carbon cycle4,5. Here we use complementary multiplicity-edited 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra to quantify key substructures assembling the carbon skeletons of DOM from four main Amazon rivers and two mid-size Swedish boreal lakes. We find that one type of reaction mechanism, oxidative dearomatization (ODA), widely used in organic synthetic chemistry to create natural product scaffolds6–10, is probably a key driver for generating structural diversity during processing of DOM that are rich in suitable polyphenolic precursor molecules. Our data suggest a high abundance of tetrahedral quaternary carbons bound to one oxygen and three carbon atoms (OCqC3 units). These units are rare in common biomolecules but could be readily produced by ODA of lignin-derived and tannin-derived polyphenols. Tautomerization of (poly)phenols by ODA creates non-planar cyclohexadienones, which are subject to immediate and parallel cycloadditions. This combination leads to a proliferation of structural diversity of DOM compounds from early stages of DOM processing, with an increase in oxygenated aliphatic structures. Overall, we propose that ODA is a key reaction mechanism for complexity acceleration in the processing of DOM molecules, creation of new oxygenated aliphatic molecules and that it could be prevalent in nature. Using complementary multiplicity-edited 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, oxidative dearomatization is shown to be a key driver for generating structural diversity during processing of dissolved organic matter and the data also suggest high abundance of OCqC3 units.",

    "abstract": "Choline is an essential nutrient that the human body needs in vast quantities for cell membrane synthesis, epigenetic modification and neurotransmission. The brain has a particularly high demand for choline, but how it enters the brain remains unknown1–3. The major facilitator superfamily transporter FLVCR1 (also known as MFSD7B or SLC49A1) was recently determined to be a choline transporter but is not highly expressed at the blood–brain barrier, whereas the related protein FLVCR2 (also known as MFSD7C or SLC49A2) is expressed in endothelial cells at the blood–brain barrier4–7. Previous studies have shown that mutations in human Flvcr2 cause cerebral vascular abnormalities, hydrocephalus and embryonic lethality, but the physiological role of FLVCR2 is unknown4,5. Here we demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro that FLVCR2 is a BBB choline transporter and is responsible for the majority of choline uptake into the brain. We also determine the structures of choline-bound FLVCR2 in both inward-facing and outward-facing states using cryo-electron microscopy. These results reveal how the brain obtains choline and provide molecular-level insights into how FLVCR2 binds choline in an aromatic cage and mediates its uptake. Our work could provide a novel framework for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents into the brain. FLVCR2 is expressed in the blood–brain barrier of mouse and human, and is the major mediator of choline uptake into the brain.",

    "abstract": "A new class of superfluids and superconductors with spatially periodic modulation of the superfluid density is arising1–12. It might be related to the supersolid phase of matter, in which the spontaneous breaking of gauge and translational symmetries leads to a spatially modulated macroscopic wavefunction13–16. This relation was recognized only in some cases1,2,5–9 and there is the need for a universal property quantifying the differences between supersolids and ordinary matter, such as the superfluid fraction, which measures the reduction in superfluid stiffness resulting from the spatial modulation16–18. The superfluid fraction was introduced long ago16, but it has not yet been assessed experimentally. Here we demonstrate an innovative method to measure the superfluid fraction based on the Josephson effect, a ubiquitous phenomenon associated with the presence of a physical barrier between two superfluids or superconductors19, which might also be expected for supersolids20, owing to the spatial modulation. We demonstrate that individual cells of a supersolid can sustain Josephson oscillations and we show that, from the current–phase dynamics, we can derive directly the superfluid fraction. Our study of a cold-atom dipolar supersolid7 reveals a relatively large sub-unity superfluid fraction that makes realistic the study of previously unknown phenomena such as partially quantized vortices and supercurrents16–18. Our results open a new direction of research that may unify the description of all supersolid-like systems. A new method based on the Josephson effect is described, allowing to measure the superfluid fraction of a supersolid, which captures the effect of spatially periodic modulation leading to reduction in the stiffness of superfluids.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the promise of monoclonal antibody-based prophylactic and therapeutic drugs1–3 and revealed how quickly viral escape can curtail effective options4,5. When the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant emerged in 2021, many antibody drug products lost potency, including Evusheld and its constituent, cilgavimab4–6. Cilgavimab, like its progenitor COV2-2130, is a class 3 antibody that is compatible with other antibodies in combination4 and is challenging to replace with existing approaches. Rapidly modifying such high-value antibodies to restore efficacy against emerging variants is a compelling mitigation strategy. We sought to redesign and renew the efficacy of COV2-2130 against Omicron BA.1 and BA.1.1 strains while maintaining efficacy against the dominant Delta variant. Here we show that our computationally redesigned antibody, 2130-1-0114-112, achieves this objective, simultaneously increases neutralization potency against Delta and subsequent variants of concern, and provides protection in vivo against the strains tested: WA1/2020, BA.1.1 and BA.5. Deep mutational scanning of tens of thousands of pseudovirus variants reveals that 2130-1-0114-112 improves broad potency without increasing escape liabilities. Our results suggest that computational approaches can optimize an antibody to target multiple escape variants, while simultaneously enriching potency. Our computational approach does not require experimental iterations or pre-existing binding data, thus enabling rapid response strategies to address escape variants or lessen escape vulnerabilities. By demonstrating a computational approach to restore the clinical efficacy of a COVID-19 antibody, the potential to rapidly update clinical antibodies is explored.",

    "abstract": "Early spliceosome assembly can occur through an intron-defined pathway, whereby U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) assemble across the intron1. Alternatively, it can occur through an exon-defined pathway2–5, whereby U2 binds the branch site located upstream of the defined exon and U1 snRNP interacts with the 5′ splice site located directly downstream of it. The U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP subsequently binds to produce a cross-intron (CI) or cross-exon (CE) pre-B complex, which is then converted to the spliceosomal B complex6,7. Exon definition promotes the splicing of upstream introns2,8,9 and plays a key part in alternative splicing regulation10–16. However, the three-dimensional structure of exon-defined spliceosomal complexes and the molecular mechanism of the conversion from a CE-organized to a CI-organized spliceosome, a pre-requisite for splicing catalysis, remain poorly understood. Here cryo-electron microscopy analyses of human CE pre-B complex and B-like complexes reveal extensive structural similarities with their CI counterparts. The results indicate that the CE and CI spliceosome assembly pathways converge already at the pre-B stage. Add-back experiments using purified CE pre-B complexes, coupled with cryo-electron microscopy, elucidate the order of the extensive remodelling events that accompany the formation of B complexes and B-like complexes. The molecular triggers and roles of B-specific proteins in these rearrangements are also identified. We show that CE pre-B complexes can productively bind in trans to a U1 snRNP-bound 5′ splice site. Together, our studies provide new mechanistic insights into the CE to CI switch during spliceosome assembly and its effect on pre-mRNA splice site pairing at this stage. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of cross-exon pre-B and B-like complexes contribute new insights into the molecular mechanisms that mediate the switch from a cross-exon to a cross-intron organized spliceosome.",

However, the time dimension of Palaeolithic contexts is generally inaccurately reconstructed because of the limitations of dating techniques1, the impact of disturbing agents on sedimentary deposits2 and the palimpsest effect3,4. Here we report high-resolution time differences between six Middle Palaeolithic hearths from El Salt Unit x (Spain) obtained through archaeomagnetic and archaeostratigraphic analyses. The set of hearths covers at least around 200–240 years with 99% probability, having decade- and century-long intervals between the different hearths. Our results provide a quantitative estimate of the time framework for the human occupation events included in the studied sequence. This is a step forward in Palaeolithic archaeology, a discipline in which human behaviour is usually approached from a temporal scale typical of geological processes, whereas significant change may happen at the smaller scales of human generations. Here we reach a timescale close to a human lifespan. High-resolution time differences between six Middle Palaeolithic hearths from El Salt Unit x (Spain) obtained through archaeomagnetic and archaeostratigraphic analyses show sometimes decade-long intervals between hearths.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytosis is the process by which myeloid phagocytes bind to and internalize potentially dangerous microorganisms1. During phagocytosis, innate immune receptors and associated signalling proteins are localized to the maturing phagosome compartment, forming an immune information processing hub brimming with microorganism-sensing features2–8. Here we developed proximity labelling of phagosomal contents (PhagoPL) to identify proteins localizing to phagosomes containing model yeast and bacteria. By comparing the protein composition of phagosomes containing evolutionarily and biochemically distinct microorganisms, we unexpectedly identified programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a protein that specifically enriches in phagosomes containing yeast. We found that PD-L1 directly binds to yeast upon processing in phagosomes. By surface display library screening, we identified the ribosomal protein Rpl20b as a fungal protein ligand for PD-L1. Using an auxin-inducible depletion system, we found that detection of Rpl20b by macrophages cross-regulates production of distinct cytokines including interleukin-10 (IL-10) induced by the activation of other innate immune receptors. Thus, this study establishes PhagoPL as a useful approach to quantifying the collection of proteins enriched in phagosomes during host–microorganism interactions, exemplified by identifying PD-L1 as a receptor that binds to fungi. Proximity labelling of phagosomal contents is used to identify proteins that localize to phagosomes in host–microorganism interactions.",

    "abstract": "DNA base damage is a major source of oncogenic mutations1. Such damage can produce strand-phased mutation patterns and multiallelic variation through the process of lesion segregation2. Here we exploited these properties to reveal how strand-asymmetric processes, such as replication and transcription, shape DNA damage and repair. Despite distinct mechanisms of leading and lagging strand replication3,4, we observe identical fidelity and damage tolerance for both strands. For small alkylation adducts of DNA, our results support a model in which the same translesion polymerase is recruited on-the-fly to both replication strands, starkly contrasting the strand asymmetric tolerance of bulky UV-induced adducts5. The accumulation of multiple distinct mutations at the site of persistent lesions provides the means to quantify the relative efficiency of repair processes genome wide and at single-base resolution. At multiple scales, we show DNA damage-induced mutations are largely shaped by the influence of DNA accessibility on repair efficiency, rather than gradients of DNA damage. Finally, we reveal specific genomic conditions that can actively drive oncogenic mutagenesis by corrupting the fidelity of nucleotide excision repair. These results provide insight into how strand-asymmetric mechanisms underlie the formation, tolerance and repair of DNA damage, thereby shaping cancer genome evolution. How strand-asymmetric processes such as replication and transcription interact with DNA damage to drive mechanisms of repair and mutagenesis is explored.",

    "abstract": "Many threats to biodiversity cannot be eliminated; for example, invasive pathogens may be ubiquitous. Chytridiomycosis is a fungal disease that has spread worldwide, driving at least 90 amphibian species to extinction, and severely affecting hundreds of others1–4. Once the disease spreads to a new environment, it is likely to become a permanent part of that ecosystem. To enable coexistence with chytridiomycosis in the field, we devised an intervention that exploits host defences and pathogen vulnerabilities. Here we show that sunlight-heated artificial refugia attract endangered frogs and enable body temperatures high enough to clear infections, and that having recovered in this way, frogs are subsequently resistant to chytridiomycosis even under cool conditions that are optimal for fungal growth. Our results provide a simple, inexpensive and widely applicable strategy to buffer frogs against chytridiomycosis in nature. The refugia are immediately useful for the endangered species we tested and will have broader utility for amphibian species with similar ecologies. Furthermore, our concept could be applied to other wildlife diseases in which differences in host and pathogen physiologies can be exploited. The refugia are made from cheap and readily available materials and therefore could be rapidly adopted by wildlife managers and the public. In summary, habitat protection alone cannot protect species that are affected by invasive diseases, but simple manipulations to microhabitat structure could spell the difference between the extinction and the persistence of endangered amphibians. Artificial thermal refugia—sites heated to temperatures higher than that of the surrounding environment—provide a way to protect an endangered Australian frog species from a fungal disease that has caused the extinction of many amphibians.",

    "abstract": "Transmission spectroscopy has been a workhorse technique used over the past two decades to constrain the physical and chemical properties of exoplanet atmospheres1–5. One of its classical key assumptions is that the portion of the atmosphere it probes—the terminator region—is homogeneous. Several works from the past decade, however, have put this into question for highly irradiated, hot (Teq ≳ 1,000 K) gas giant exoplanets, both empirically6–10 and through three-dimensional modelling11–17. While models have predicted clear differences between the evening (day-to-night) and morning (night-to-day) terminators, direct morning and evening transmission spectra in a wide wavelength range have not been reported for an exoplanet so far. Under the assumption of precise and accurate orbital parameters for the exoplanet WASP-39 b, here we report the detection of inhomogeneous terminators on WASP-39 b, which has allowed us to retrieve its morning and evening transmission spectra in the near-infrared (2–5 μm) using the James Webb Space Telescope. We have observed larger transit depths in the evening, which are, on average, 405 ± 88 ppm larger than the morning ones, and also have qualitatively larger features than the morning spectrum. The spectra are best explained by models in which the evening terminator is hotter than the morning terminator by \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$17{7}_{-57}^{+65}$$\n                \n               K, with both terminators having C/O ratios consistent with solar. General circulation models predict temperature differences broadly consistent with the above value and point towards a cloudy morning terminator and a clearer evening terminator. The atmospheric terminator region of WASP-39 b, a hot gas giant exoplanet, is inhomogeneous, despite past assumptions, with the evening terminator being hotter and thus probably clearer, and the morning terminator probably being cloudy and consequently cooler.",

    "abstract": "Treatment assessment and patient outcome for sepsis depend predominantly on the timely administration of appropriate antibiotics1–3. However, the clinical protocols used to stratify and select patient-specific optimal therapy are extremely slow4. In particular, the major hurdle in performing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) remains in the lengthy blood culture procedure, which has long been considered unavoidable due to the limited number of pathogens present in the patient’s blood. Here we describe an ultra-rapid AST method that bypasses the need for traditional blood culture, thereby demonstrating potential to reduce the turnaround time of reporting drug susceptibility profiles by more than 40–60 h compared with hospital AST workflows. Introducing a synthetic beta-2-glycoprotein I peptide, a broad range of microbial pathogens are selectively recovered from whole blood, subjected to species identification or instantly proliferated and phenotypically evaluated for various drug conditions using a low-inoculum AST chip. The platform was clinically evaluated by the enrolment of 190 hospitalized patients suspected of having infection, achieving 100% match in species identification. Among the eight positive cases, six clinical isolates were retrospectively tested for AST showing an overall categorical agreement of 94.90% with an average theoretical turnaround time of 13 ± 2.53 h starting from initial blood processing. An ultra-rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing method is introduced that bypasses the need for traditional blood culture, demonstrating the potential to significantly reduce the turnaround time of reporting drug susceptibility profiles.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine transporter (DAT) is crucial for regulating dopamine signalling and is the prime mediator for the rewarding and addictive effects of cocaine1. As part of the neurotransmitter sodium symporter family, DAT uses the Na+ gradient across cell membranes to transport dopamine against its chemical gradient2. The transport mechanism involves both intra- and extracellular gates that control substrate access to a central site. However, the molecular intricacies of this process and the inhibitory mechanism of cocaine have remained unclear. Here, we present the molecular structure of human DAT in complex with cocaine at a resolution of 2.66 Å. Our findings reveal that DAT adopts the expected LeuT-fold, posing in an outward-open conformation with cocaine bound at the central (S1) site. Notably, while an Na+ occupies the second Na+ site (Na2), the Na1 site seems to be vacant, with the side chain of Asn82 occupying the presumed Na+ space. This structural insight elucidates the mechanism for the cocaine inhibition of human DAT and deepens our understanding of neurotransmitter transport. By shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of how cocaine acts, our study lays a foundation for the development of targeted medications to combat addiction. A study using cryo-electron microscopy has determined the structure of the human dopamine transporter with bound cocaine, revealing molecular details about neurotransmitter transport and how it is affected by neuropsychiatric drugs.",

    "abstract": "Most proteins fold during biosynthesis on the ribosome1, and co-translational folding energetics, pathways and outcomes of many proteins have been found to differ considerably from those in refolding studies2–10. The origin of this folding modulation by the ribosome has remained unknown. Here we have determined atomistic structures of the unfolded state of a model protein on and off the ribosome, which reveal that the ribosome structurally expands the unfolded nascent chain and increases its solvation, resulting in its entropic destabilization relative to the peptide chain in isolation. Quantitative 19F NMR experiments confirm that this destabilization reduces the entropic penalty of folding by up to 30 kcal mol−1 and promotes formation of partially folded intermediates on the ribosome, an observation that extends to other protein domains and is obligate for some proteins to acquire their active conformation. The thermodynamic effects also contribute to the ribosome protecting the nascent chain from mutation-induced unfolding, which suggests a crucial role of the ribosome in supporting protein evolution. By correlating nascent chain structure and dynamics to their folding energetics and post-translational outcomes, our findings establish the physical basis of the distinct thermodynamics of co-translational protein folding. Structures of the growing peptide chain on and off the ribosome reveal that the ribosome destabilizes the unfolded nascent chain, promoting the formation of partially folded intermediate states.",

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration, bright (approximately Jy) extragalactic bursts, whose production mechanism is still unclear1. Recently, two repeating FRBs were found to have a physically associated persistent radio source of non-thermal origin2,3. These two FRBs have unusually large Faraday rotation measure values2,3, probably tracing a dense magneto-ionic medium, consistent with synchrotron radiation originating from a nebula surrounding the FRB source4–8. Recent theoretical arguments predict that, if the observed Faraday rotation measure mostly arises from the persistent radio source region, there should be a simple relation between the persistent radio source luminosity and the rotation measure itself7,9. Here we report the detection of a third, less luminous persistent radio source associated with the repeating FRB source FRB 20201124A at a distance of 413 Mpc, substantially expanding the predicted relation into the low luminosity–low Faraday rotation measure regime (<1,000 rad m−2). At lower values of the Faraday rotation measure, the expected radio luminosity falls below the limit-of-detection threshold for present-day radio telescopes. These findings support the idea that the persistent radio sources observed so far are generated by a nebula in the FRB environment and that FRBs with low Faraday rotation measure may not show a persistent radio source because of a weaker magneto-ionic medium. This is generally consistent with models invoking a young magnetar as the central engine of the FRB, in which the surrounding ionized nebula—or the interacting shock in a binary system—powers the persistent radio source. Observations of a third, less luminous persistent radio source associated with the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20201124A indicate that the burst originates from a young magnetar surrounded by a nebula of ionized gas.",

    "abstract": "Taurine is a conditionally essential micronutrient and one of the most abundant amino acids in humans1–3. In endogenous taurine metabolism, dedicated enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of taurine from cysteine and in the downstream metabolism of secondary taurine metabolites4,5. One taurine metabolite is N-acetyltaurine6. Levels of N-acetyltaurine are dynamically regulated by stimuli that alter taurine or acetate flux, including endurance exercise7, dietary taurine supplementation8 and alcohol consumption6,9. So far, the identities of the enzymes involved in N-acetyltaurine metabolism, and the potential functions of N-acetyltaurine itself, have remained unknown. Here we show that the body mass index associated orphan enzyme phosphotriesterase-related (PTER)10 is a physiological N-acetyltaurine hydrolase. In vitro, PTER catalyses the hydrolysis of N-acetyltaurine to taurine and acetate. In mice, PTER is expressed in the kidney, liver and brainstem. Genetic ablation of Pter in mice results in complete loss of tissue N-acetyltaurine hydrolysis activity and a systemic increase in N-acetyltaurine levels. After stimuli that increase taurine levels, Pter knockout mice exhibit reduced food intake, resistance to diet-induced obesity and improved glucose homeostasis. Administration of N-acetyltaurine to obese wild-type mice also reduces food intake and body weight in a GFRAL-dependent manner. These data place PTER into a central enzymatic node of secondary taurine metabolism and uncover a role for PTER and N-acetyltaurine in body weight control and energy balance. The orphan enzyme phosphotriesterase-related (PTER) is identified as a mammalian N-acetyltaurine hydrolase that has roles in regulating body weight and energy balance.",

    "abstract": "The photoelectric effect is not truly instantaneous but exhibits attosecond delays that can reveal complex molecular dynamics1–7. Sub-femtosecond-duration light pulses provide the requisite tools to resolve the dynamics of photoionization8–12. Accordingly, the past decade has produced a large volume of work on photoionization delays following single-photon absorption of an extreme ultraviolet photon. However, the measurement of time-resolved core-level photoionization remained out of reach. The required X-ray photon energies needed for core-level photoionization were not available with attosecond tabletop sources. Here we report measurements of the X-ray photoemission delay of core-level electrons, with unexpectedly large delays, ranging up to 700 as in NO near the oxygen K-shell threshold. These measurements exploit attosecond soft X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser to scan across the entire region near the K-shell threshold. Furthermore, we find that the delay spectrum is richly modulated, suggesting several contributions, including transient trapping of the photoelectron owing to shape resonances, collisions with the Auger–Meitner electron that is emitted in the rapid non-radiative relaxation of the molecule and multi-electron scattering effects. The results demonstrate how X-ray attosecond experiments, supported by comprehensive theoretical modelling, can unravel the complex correlated dynamics of core-level photoionization. Time-resolved measurements of the X-ray photoemission delay of core-level electrons using attosecond soft X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser can be used to determine the complex correlated dynamics of photoionization.",

    "abstract": "The elemental composition of the lunar surface provides insights into mechanisms of the formation and evolution of the Moon1,2. The chemical composition of lunar regolith have so far been precisely measured using the samples collected by the Apollo, Luna and Chang’e 5 missions, which are from equatorial to mid-latitude regions3,4; lunar meteorites, whose location of origin on the Moon is unknown5,6; and the in situ measurement from the Chang’e 3 and Chang’e 4 missions7–9, which are from the mid-latitude regions of the Moon. Here we report the first in situ measurements of the elemental abundances in the lunar southern high-latitude regions by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) experiment10 aboard the Pragyan rover of India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission. The 23 measurements in the vicinity of the Chandrayaan-3 landing site show that the local lunar terrain in this region is fairly uniform and primarily composed of ferroan anorthosite (FAN), a product of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization. However, observation of relatively higher magnesium abundance with respect to calcium in APXS measurements suggests the mixing of further mafic material. The compositional uniformity over a few tens of metres around the Chandrayaan-3 landing site provides an excellent ground truth for remote-sensing observations. In situ measurements of the elemental abundances in the lunar southern high-latitude regions show that the local terrain is fairly uniform and mostly composed of ferroan anorthosite, a product of lunar magma ocean crystallization.",

    "abstract": "Futuristic technologies such as morphing aircrafts and super-strong artificial muscles depend on metal alloys being as strong as ultrahigh-strength steel yet as flexible as a polymer1–3. However, achieving such ‘strong yet flexible’ alloys has proven challenging4–9 because of the inevitable trade-off between strength and flexibility5,8,10. Here we report a Ti–50.8 at.% Ni strain glass alloy showing a combination of ultrahigh yield strength of σy ≈ 1.8 GPa and polymer-like ultralow elastic modulus of E ≈ 10.5 GPa, together with super-large rubber-like elastic strain of approximately 8%. As a result, it possesses a high flexibility figure of merit of σy/E ≈ 0.17 compared with existing structural materials. In addition, it can maintain such properties over a wide temperature range of −80 °C to +80 °C and demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance at high strain. The alloy was fabricated by a simple three-step thermomechanical treatment that is scalable to industrial lines, which leads not only to ultrahigh strength because of deformation strengthening, but also to ultralow modulus by the formation of a unique ‘dual-seed strain glass’ microstructure, composed of a strain glass matrix embedded with a small number of aligned R and B19′ martensite ‘seeds’. In situ X-ray diffractometry shows that the polymer-like deformation behaviour of the alloy originates from a nucleation-free reversible transition between strain glass and R and B19′ martensite during loading and unloading. This exotic alloy with the potential for mass producibility may open a new horizon for many futuristic technologies, such as morphing aerospace vehicles, superman-type artificial muscles and artificial organs. A polymer-like ultrahigh-strength TiNi alloy was fabricated by a simple three-step process to give a combination of a polymer-like ultralow elastic modulus and a steel-like ultrahigh yield strength over a wide temperature range, and such exotic properties arise from a unique strain glass state.",

    "abstract": "The canonical theory for planet formation in circumstellar disks proposes that planets are grown from initially much smaller seeds1–5. The long-considered alternative theory proposes that giant protoplanets can be formed directly from collapsing fragments of vast spiral arms6–11 induced by gravitational instability12–14—if the disk is gravitationally unstable. For this to be possible, the disk must be massive compared with the central star: a disk-to-star mass ratio of 1:10 is widely held as the rough threshold for triggering gravitational instability, inciting substantial non-Keplerian dynamics and generating prominent spiral arms15–18. Although estimating disk masses has historically been challenging19–21, the motion of the gas can reveal the presence of gravitational instability through its effect on the disk-velocity structure22–24. Here we present kinematic evidence of gravitational instability in the disk around AB Aurigae, using deep observations of 13CO and C18O line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The observed kinematic signals strongly resemble predictions from simulations and analytic modelling. From quantitative comparisons, we infer a disk mass of up to a third of the stellar mass enclosed within 1″ to 5″ on the sky. Observations of gravitational instability in the disk around AB Aurigae using deep observations of 13CO and C18O line emission provide evidence that giant protoplanets can be formed from collapsing fragments of vast spiral arms.",

    "abstract": "The licensing step of DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination entails resection of DNA ends to generate a single-stranded DNA template for assembly of the repair machinery consisting of the RAD51 recombinase and ancillary factors1. DNA end resection is mechanistically intricate and reliant on the tumour suppressor complex BRCA1–BARD1 (ref. 2). Specifically, three distinct nuclease entities—the 5′–3′ exonuclease EXO1 and heterodimeric complexes of the DNA endonuclease DNA2, with either the BLM or WRN helicase—act in synergy to execute the end resection process3. A major question concerns whether BRCA1–BARD1 directly regulates end resection. Here, using highly purified protein factors, we provide evidence that BRCA1–BARD1 physically interacts with EXO1, BLM and WRN. Importantly, with reconstituted biochemical systems and a single-molecule analytical tool, we show that BRCA1–BARD1 upregulates the activity of all three resection pathways. We also demonstrate that BRCA1 and BARD1 harbour stand-alone modules that contribute to the overall functionality of BRCA1–BARD1. Moreover, analysis of a BARD1 mutant impaired in DNA binding shows the importance of this BARD1 attribute in end resection, both in vitro and in cells. Thus, BRCA1–BARD1 enhances the efficiency of all three long-range DNA end resection pathways during homologous recombination in human cells. Using highly purified protein factors, we provide evidence that BRCA1–BARD1 physically interacts with EXO1, BLM and WRN and upregulates the activity of all three resection pathways.",

    "abstract": "Two different hard-radiation phenomena are known to originate from thunderclouds: terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs)1 and gamma-ray glows2. Both involve an avalanche of electrons accelerated to relativistic energies but are otherwise different. Glows are known to last for one to hundreds of seconds, have moderate intensities and originate from quasi-stationary thundercloud fields2–5. TGFs exhibit high intensities and have characteristic durations of tens to hundreds of microseconds6–9. TGFs often show a close association with an emission of strong radio signals10–17 and optical pulses18–21, which indicates the involvement of lightning leaders in their generation. Here we report unique observations of a different phenomenon, which we call flickering gamma-ray flashes (FGFs). FGFs resemble the usual multi-pulse TGFs22–24 but have more pulses and each pulse has a longer duration than ordinary TGFs. FGF durations span from 20 to 250 ms, which reaches the lower boundary of the gamma-ray glow duration. FGFs are radio and optically silent, which makes them distinct from normal TGFs. An FGF starts as an ordinary gamma-ray glow, then suddenly increases exponentially in intensity and turns into an unstable, ‘flickering’ mode with a sequence of pulses. FGFs could be the missing link between the gamma-ray glows and conventional TGFs, whose absence has been puzzling the atmospheric electricity community for two decades. Flickering gamma-ray flashes associated with terrestrial thunderstorms have been observed, which may be the missing link between gamma-ray glows and TGFs.",

    "abstract": "The risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) constitutes the main challenge associated with insulin therapy for diabetes1,2. Insulin doses must be adjusted to ensure that blood glucose values are within the normal range, but matching insulin doses to fluctuating glucose levels is difficult because even a slightly higher insulin dose than needed can lead to a hypoglycaemic incidence, which can be anything from uncomfortable to life-threatening. It has therefore been a long-standing goal to engineer a glucose-sensitive insulin that can auto-adjust its bioactivity in a reversible manner according to ambient glucose levels to ultimately achieve better glycaemic control while lowering the risk of hypoglycaemia3. Here we report the design and properties of NNC2215, an insulin conjugate with bioactivity that is reversibly responsive to a glucose range relevant for diabetes, as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. NNC2215 was engineered by conjugating a glucose-binding macrocycle4 and a glucoside to insulin, thereby introducing a switch that can open and close in response to glucose and thereby equilibrate insulin between active and less-active conformations. The insulin receptor affinity for NNC2215 increased 3.2-fold when the glucose concentration was increased from 3 to 20 mM. In animal studies, the glucose-sensitive bioactivity of NNC2215 was demonstrated to lead to protection against hypoglycaemia while partially covering glucose excursions. NNC2215 is an insulin conjugate that can reversibly adjust its bioactivity in response to a diabetes-relevant glucose range in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Building a large-scale quantum computer requires effective strategies to correct errors that inevitably arise in physical quantum systems1. Quantum error-correction codes2 present a way to reach this goal by encoding logical information redundantly into many physical qubits. A key challenge in implementing such codes is accurately decoding noisy syndrome information extracted from redundancy checks to obtain the correct encoded logical information. Here we develop a recurrent, transformer-based neural network that learns to decode the surface code, the leading quantum error-correction code3. Our decoder outperforms other state-of-the-art decoders on real-world data from Google’s Sycamore quantum processor for distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes4. On distances up to 11, the decoder maintains its advantage on simulated data with realistic noise including cross-talk and leakage, utilizing soft readouts and leakage information. After training on approximate synthetic data, the decoder adapts to the more complex, but unknown, underlying error distribution by training on a limited budget of experimental samples. Our work illustrates the ability of machine learning to go beyond human-designed algorithms by learning from data directly, highlighting machine learning as a strong contender for decoding in quantum computers. A recurrent, transformer-based neural network, called AlphaQubit, learns high-accuracy error decoding to suppress the errors that occur in quantum systems, opening the prospect of using neural-network decoders for real quantum hardware.",

    "abstract": "Needle-based injections currently enable the administration of a wide range of biomacromolecule therapies across the body, including the gastrointestinal tract1–3, through recent developments in ingestible robotic devices4–7. However, needles generally require training, sharps management and disposal, and pose challenges for autonomous ingestible systems. Here, inspired by the jetting systems of cephalopods, we have developed and evaluated microjet delivery systems that can deliver jets in axial and radial directions into tissue, making them suitable for tubular and globular segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, they are implemented in both tethered and ingestible formats, facilitating endoscopic applications or patient self-dosing. Our study identified suitable pressure and nozzle dimensions for different segments of the gastrointestinal tract and applied microjets in a variety of devices that support delivery across the various anatomic segments of the gastrointestinal tract. We characterized the ability of these systems to administer macromolecules, including insulin, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) analogue and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) in large animal models, achieving exposure levels similar to those achieved with subcutaneous delivery. This research provides key insights into jetting design parameters for gastrointestinal administration, substantially broadening the possibilities for future endoscopic and ingestible drug delivery devices. Tethered or ingestible delivery systems that deliver liquid microjets in axial and radial directions can be used to deliver macromolecules to different parts of the gastrointestinal tract with good bioavailability.",

    "abstract": "Although rare neurodevelopmental conditions have a large Mendelian component1, common genetic variants also contribute to risk2,3. However, little is known about how this polygenic risk is distributed among patients with these conditions and their parents nor its interplay with rare variants. It is also unclear whether polygenic background affects risk directly through alleles transmitted from parents to children, or whether indirect genetic effects mediated through the family environment4 also play a role. Here we addressed these questions using genetic data from 11,573 patients with rare neurodevelopmental conditions, 9,128 of their parents and 26,869 controls. Common variants explained around 10% of variance in risk. Patients with a monogenic diagnosis had significantly less polygenic risk than those without, supporting a liability threshold model5. A polygenic score for neurodevelopmental conditions showed only a direct genetic effect. By contrast, polygenic scores for educational attainment and cognitive performance showed no direct genetic effect, but the non-transmitted alleles in the parents were correlated with the child’s risk, potentially due to indirect genetic effects and/or parental assortment for these traits4. Indeed, as expected under parental assortment, we show that common variant predisposition for neurodevelopmental conditions is correlated with the rare variant component of risk. These findings indicate that future studies should investigate the possible role and nature of indirect genetic effects on rare neurodevelopmental conditions, and consider the contribution of common and rare variants simultaneously when studying cognition-related phenotypes. Patients with neurodevelopmental conditions without a monogenic diagnosis have a higher polygenic burden than those with a monogenic diagnosis. Non-transmitted common alleles in the parents are associated with the child’s phenotype, and the common and rare variants conferring risk are correlated.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fundamental role of bacterial strain variation in gut microbiota function1–6, the number of unique strains of a species that can stably colonize the human intestine is still unknown for almost all species. Here we determine the strain richness (SR) of common gut species using thousands of sequenced bacterial isolates with paired metagenomes. We show that SR varies across species, is transferable by faecal microbiota transplantation, and is uniquely low in the gut compared with soil and lake environments. Active therapeutic administration of supraphysiologic numbers of strains per species increases recipient SR, which then converges back to the population average after dosing is ceased. Stratifying engraftment outcomes by high or low SR shows that SR predicts microbial addition or replacement in faecal transplants. Together, these results indicate that properties of the gut ecosystem govern the number of strains of each species colonizing the gut and thereby influence strain addition and replacement in faecal microbiota transplantation and defined live biotherapeutic products. Strain richness of gut microbiota ecosystems is a key characteristic underpinning engraftment in faecal microbiota transplantation, and could improve the design of defined live biotherapeutic products with predictable outcomes.",

    "abstract": "New particle formation (NPF) in the tropical upper troposphere is a globally important source of atmospheric aerosols1–4. It is known to occur over the Amazon basin, but the nucleation mechanism and chemical precursors have yet to be identified2. Here we present comprehensive in situ aircraft measurements showing that extremely low-volatile oxidation products of isoprene, particularly certain organonitrates, drive NPF in the Amazonian upper troposphere. The organonitrates originate from OH-initiated oxidation of isoprene from forest emissions in the presence of nitrogen oxides from lightning. Nucleation bursts start about 2 h after sunrise in the outflow of nocturnal deep convection, producing high aerosol concentrations of more than 50,000 particles cm−3. We report measurements of characteristic diurnal cycles of precursor gases and particles. Our observations show that the interplay between biogenic isoprene, deep tropical convection with associated lightning, oxidation photochemistry and the low ambient temperature uniquely promotes NPF. The particles grow over time, undergo long-range transport and descend through subsidence to the lower troposphere, in which they can serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that influence the Earth’s hydrological cycle, radiation budget and climate1,4–8. Aircraft measurements over the Amazon show that new particle formation in the upper troposphere emerges when isoprene, emitted by forests, undergoes oxidation in the presence of nitrogen oxides produced by lightning.",

    "abstract": "The complete blood count (CBC) is an important screening tool for healthy adults and a common test at periodic exams. However, results are usually interpreted relative to one-size-fits-all reference intervals1,2, undermining the precision medicine goal to tailor care for patients on the basis of their unique characteristics3,4. Here we study thousands of diverse patients at an academic medical centre and show that routine CBC indices fluctuate around stable values or setpoints5, and setpoints are patient-specific, with the typical healthy adult’s nine CBC setpoints distinguishable as a group from those of 98% of other healthy adults, and setpoint differences persist for at least 20 years. Haematological setpoints reflect a deep physiologic phenotype enabling investigation of acquired and genetic determinants of haematological regulation and its variation among healthy adults. Setpoints in apparently healthy adults were associated with significant variation in clinical risk: absolute risk of some common diseases and morbidities varied by more than 2% (heart attack and stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, osteoporosis), and absolute risk of all-cause 10 year mortality varied by more than 5%. Setpoints also define patient-specific reference intervals and personalize the interpretation of subsequent test results. In retrospective analysis, setpoints improved sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of some common conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction, iron deficiency and myeloproliferative neoplasms. This study shows CBC setpoints are sufficiently stable and patient-specific to help realize the promise of precision medicine for healthy adults. Complete blood count indices are tightly regulated around setpoints for decades in healthy adults, and represent a deep phenotype providing opportunities for investigating differential disease risks, improving clinical care and advancing precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous skin colonist Staphylococcus epidermidis elicits a CD8+ T cell response pre-emptively, in the absence of an infection1. However, the scope and purpose of this anticommensal immune programme are not well defined, limiting our ability to harness it therapeutically. Here, we show that this colonist also induces a potent, durable and specific antibody response that is conserved in humans and non-human primates. A series of S. epidermidis cell-wall mutants revealed that the cell surface protein Aap is a predominant target. By colonizing mice with a strain of S. epidermidis in which the parallel β-helix domain of Aap is replaced by tetanus toxin fragment C, we elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response that protects mice against a lethal challenge. A similar strain of S. epidermidis expressing an Aap-SpyCatcher chimera can be conjugated with recombinant immunogens; the resulting labelled commensal elicits high antibody titres under conditions of physiologic colonization, including a robust IgA response in the nasal and pulmonary mucosa. Thus, immunity to a common skin colonist involves a coordinated T and B cell response, the latter of which can be redirected against pathogens as a new form of topical vaccination. Staphylococcus epidermidis induces a potent, durable and specific antibody response that is conserved in humans and non-human primates, and which could be redirected against pathogens as a new form of topical vaccination.",

    "abstract": "The demand for the three-dimensional (3D) integration of electronic components is steadily increasing. Despite substantial processing challenges, the through-silicon-via (TSV) technique emerges as the only viable method for integrating single-crystalline device components in a 3D format1,2. Although monolithic 3D (M3D) integration schemes show promise3, the seamless connection of single-crystalline semiconductors without intervening wafers has yet to be demonstrated. This challenge arises from the inherent difficulty of growing single crystals on amorphous or polycrystalline surfaces after the back-end-of-the-line process at low temperatures to preserve the underlying circuitry. Consequently, a practical growth-based solution for M3D of single crystals remains unknown. Here we present a method for growing single-crystalline channel materials, specifically composed of transition metal dichalcogenides, on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces at temperatures low enough to preserve the underlying electronic components. Building on this developed technique, we demonstrate the seamless monolithic integration of vertical single-crystalline logic transistor arrays. This accomplishment leads to the development of unprecedented vertical complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) arrays composed of grown single-crystalline channels. Ultimately, this achievement provides opportunities for M3D integration of various electronic hardware in the form of single crystals. Single-crystalline materials can be grown on amorphous surfaces at below 400 °C, enabling monolithic three-dimensional integration of vertically stacked transistors.",

    "abstract": "The origins of treponemal diseases have long remained unknown, especially considering the sudden onset of the first syphilis epidemic in the late 15th century in Europe and its hypothesized arrival from the Americas with Columbus’ expeditions1,2. Recently, ancient DNA evidence has revealed various treponemal infections circulating in early modern Europe and colonial-era Mexico3–6. However, there has been to our knowledge no genomic evidence of treponematosis recovered from either the Americas or the Old World that can be reliably dated to the time before the first trans-Atlantic contacts. Here, we present treponemal genomes from nearly 2,000-year-old human remains from Brazil. We reconstruct four ancient genomes of a prehistoric treponemal pathogen, most closely related to the bejel-causing agent Treponema pallidum\n endemicum. Contradicting the modern day geographical niche of bejel in the arid regions of the world, the results call into question the previous palaeopathological characterization of treponeme subspecies and showcase their adaptive potential. A high-coverage genome is used to improve molecular clock date estimations, placing the divergence of modern T. pallidum subspecies firmly in pre-Columbian times. Overall, our study demonstrates the opportunities within archaeogenetics to uncover key events in pathogen evolution and emergence, paving the way to new hypotheses on the origin and spread of treponematoses. Reconstruction of four Treponema pallidum genomes associated with human remains from around 2,000 years ago suggests that T. pallidum existed in the Americas and diverged to its modern subspecies before the fifteenth century European contact with the Americas.",

    "abstract": "Airway integrity must be continuously maintained throughout life. Sensory neurons guard against airway obstruction and, on a moment-by-moment basis, enact vital reflexes to maintain respiratory function1,2. Decreased lung capacity is common and life-threatening across many respiratory diseases, and lung collapse can be acutely evoked by chest wall trauma, pneumothorax or airway compression. Here we characterize a neuronal reflex of the vagus nerve evoked by airway closure that leads to gasping. In vivo vagal ganglion imaging revealed dedicated sensory neurons that detect airway compression but not airway stretch. Vagal neurons expressing PVALB mediate airway closure responses and innervate clusters of lung epithelial cells called neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs). Stimulating NEBs or vagal PVALB neurons evoked gasping in the absence of airway threats, whereas ablating NEBs or vagal PVALB neurons eliminated gasping in response to airway closure. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that NEBs uniformly express the mechanoreceptor PIEZO2, and targeted knockout of Piezo2 in NEBs eliminated responses to airway closure. NEBs were dispensable for the Hering–Breuer inspiratory reflex, which indicated that discrete terminal structures detect airway closure and inflation. Similar to the involvement of Merkel cells in touch sensation3,4, NEBs are PIEZO2-expressing epithelial cells and, moreover, are crucial for an aspect of lung mechanosensation. These findings expand our understanding of neuronal diversity in the airways and reveal a dedicated vagal pathway that detects airway closure to help preserve respiratory function. A specific neural reflex of the vagus nerve is identified that induces gasping in response to airway closure.",

    "abstract": "Although modern humans left Africa multiple times over 100,000 years ago, those broadly ancestral to non-Africans dispersed less than 100,000 years ago1. Most models hold that these events occurred through green corridors created during humid periods because arid intervals constrained population movements2. Here we report an archaeological site—Shinfa-Metema 1, in the lowlands of northwest Ethiopia, with Youngest Toba Tuff cryptotephra dated to around 74,000 years ago—that provides early and rare evidence of intensive riverine-based foraging aided by the likely adoption of the bow and arrow. The diet included a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic animals. Stable oxygen isotopes from fossil mammal teeth and ostrich eggshell show that the site was occupied during a period of high seasonal aridity. The unusual abundance of fish suggests that capture occurred in the ever smaller and shallower waterholes of a seasonal river during a long dry season, revealing flexible adaptations to challenging climatic conditions during the Middle Stone Age. Adaptive foraging along dry-season waterholes would have transformed seasonal rivers into ‘blue highway’ corridors, potentially facilitating an out-of-Africa dispersal and suggesting that the event was not restricted to times of humid climates. The behavioural flexibility required to survive seasonally arid conditions in general, and the apparent short-term effects of the Toba supereruption in particular were probably key to the most recent dispersal and subsequent worldwide expansion of modern humans. The archaeological site Shinfa-Metema 1 in the lowlands of northwest Ethiopia provides early evidence of intensive riverine-based foraging aided by the likely adoption of the bow and arrow.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate organs require locally adapted blood vessels1,2. The gain of such organotypic vessel specializations is often deemed to be molecularly unrelated to the process of organ vascularization. Here, opposing this model, we reveal a molecular mechanism for brain-specific angiogenesis that operates under the control of Wnt7a/b ligands—well-known blood–brain barrier maturation signals3–5. The control mechanism relies on Wnt7a/b-dependent expression of Mmp25, which we find is enriched in brain endothelial cells. CRISPR–Cas9 mutagenesis in zebrafish reveals that this poorly characterized glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored matrix metalloproteinase is selectively required in endothelial tip cells to enable their initial migration across the pial basement membrane lining the brain surface. Mechanistically, Mmp25 confers brain invasive competence by cleaving meningeal fibroblast-derived collagen IV α5/6 chains within a short non-collagenous region of the central helical part of the heterotrimer. After genetic interference with the pial basement membrane composition, the Wnt–β-catenin-dependent organotypic control of brain angiogenesis is lost, resulting in properly patterned, yet blood–brain-barrier-defective cerebrovasculatures. We reveal an organ-specific angiogenesis mechanism, shed light on tip cell mechanistic angiodiversity and thereby illustrate how organs, by imposing local constraints on angiogenic tip cells, can select vessels matching their distinctive physiological requirements. A molecular mechanism for brain-specific angiogenesis operates under the control of Wnt7a/b ligands.",

    "abstract": "The baobab trees (genus Adansonia) have attracted tremendous attention because of their striking shape and distinctive relationships with fauna1. These spectacular trees have also influenced human culture, inspiring innumerable arts, folklore and traditions. Here we sequenced genomes of all eight extant baobab species and argue that Madagascar should be considered the centre of origin for the extant lineages, a key issue in their evolutionary history2,3. Integrated genomic and ecological analyses revealed the reticulate evolution of baobabs, which eventually led to the species diversity seen today. Past population dynamics of Malagasy baobabs may have been influenced by both interspecific competition and the geological history of the island, especially changes in local sea levels. We propose that further attention should be paid to the conservation status of Malagasy baobabs, especially of Adansonia suarezensis and Adansonia grandidieri, and that intensive monitoring of populations of Adansonia za is required, given its propensity for negatively impacting the critically endangered Adansonia perrieri. We carried out genomic and ecological analyses of all eight extant baobab species, providing insights into their evolutionary history and recommendations for conservation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Natural iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean by windblown dust has been suggested to enhance biological productivity and modulate the climate1–3. Yet, this process has never been quantified across the Southern Ocean and at annual timescales4,5. Here we combined 11 years of nitrate observations from autonomous biogeochemical ocean profiling floats with a Southern Hemisphere dust simulation to empirically derive the relationship between dust-iron deposition and annual net community production (ANCP) in the iron-limited Southern Ocean. Using this relationship, we determined the biological response to dust-iron in the pelagic perennially ice-free Southern Ocean at present and during the last glacial maximum (LGM). We estimate that dust-iron now supports 33% ± 15% of Southern Ocean ANCP. During the LGM, when dust deposition was 5–40-fold higher than today, the contribution of dust to Southern Ocean ANCP was much greater, estimated at 64% ± 13%. We provide quantitative evidence of basin-wide dust-iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean and the potential magnitude of its impact on glacial–interglacial timescales, supporting the idea of the important role of dust in the global carbon cycle and climate6–8. Nitrate observations over 11 years from autonomous biogeochemical ocean profiling combined with a Southern Hemisphere dust simulation find that iron supplied by dust supports about 30% of Southern Ocean productivity.",

    "abstract": "Higher plants survive terrestrial water deficiency and fluctuation by arresting cellular activities (dehydration) and resuscitating processes (rehydration). However, how plants monitor water availability during rehydration is unknown. Although increases in hypo-osmolarity-induced cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (HOSCA) have long been postulated to be the mechanism for sensing hypo-osmolarity in rehydration1,2, the molecular basis remains unknown. Because osmolarity triggers membrane tension and the osmosensing specificity of osmosensing channels can only be determined in vivo3–5, these channels have been classified as a subtype of mechanosensors. Here we identify bona fide cell surface hypo-osmosensors in Arabidopsis and find that pollen Ca2+ spiking is controlled directly by water through these hypo-osmosensors—that is, Ca2+ spiking is the second messenger for water status. We developed a functional expression screen in Escherichia coli for hypo-osmosensitive channels and identified OSCA2.1, a member of the hyperosmolarity-gated calcium-permeable channel (OSCA) family of proteins6. We screened single and high-order OSCA mutants, and observed that the osca2.1/osca2.2 double-knockout mutant was impaired in pollen germination and HOSCA. OSCA2.1 and OSCA2.2 function as hypo-osmosensitive Ca2+-permeable channels in planta and in HEK293 cells. Decreasing osmolarity of the medium enhanced pollen Ca2+ oscillations, which were mediated by OSCA2.1 and OSCA2.2 and required for germination. OSCA2.1 and OSCA2.2 convert extracellular water status into Ca2+ spiking in pollen and may serve as essential hypo-osmosensors for tracking rehydration in plants. Screening in Escherichia coli and biochemical experiments show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, OSCA2.1 and OSCA2.2 function as plant sensors of hypo-osmolarity, utilize Ca2+ oscillations as second messengers and have crucial roles in pollen germination.",

(152830) Dinkinesh is a small asteroid orbiting the Sun near the inner edge of the main asteroid belt with a heliocentric semimajor axis of 2.19 au; its S-type spectrum3,4 is typical of bodies in this part of the main belt5. Here we report observations by the Lucy spacecraft6,7 as it passed within 431 km of Dinkinesh. Lucy revealed Dinkinesh, which has an effective diameter of only 720 m, to be unexpectedly complex. Of particular note is the presence of a prominent longitudinal trough overlain by a substantial equatorial ridge and the discovery of the first confirmed contact binary satellite, now named (152830) Dinkinesh I Selam. Selam consists of two near-equal-sized lobes with diameters of 210 m and 230 m. It orbits Dinkinesh at a distance of 3.1 km with an orbital period of about 52.7 h and is tidally locked. The dynamical state, angular momentum and geomorphologic observations of the system lead us to infer that the ridge and trough of Dinkinesh are probably the result of mass failure resulting from spin-up by YORP followed by the partial reaccretion of the shed material. Selam probably accreted from material shed by this event. Observations from the Lucy spacecraft of the small main-belt asteroid (152830) Dinkinesh reveals unexpected complexity, with a longitudinal trough and equatorial ridge, as well as the discovery of the first contact binary satellite.",

    "abstract": "An ideal synthesis of alkyl amines would involve the direct use of abundant and easily accessible molecules such as dinitrogen (N2) and feedstock alkenes1–4. However, this ambition remains a great challenge as it is usually difficult to simultaneously activate both N2 and a simple alkene and combine them together through carbon–nitrogen (C–N) bond formation. Currently, the synthesis of alkyl amines relies on the use of ammonia produced through the Haber–Bosch process and prefunctionalized electrophilic carbon sources. Here we report the hydroamination of simple alkenes with N2 in a trititanium hydride framework, which activates both alkenes and N2, leading to selective C–N bond formation and providing the corresponding alkyl amines on further hydrogenation and protonation. Computational studies reveal key mechanistic details of N2 activation and selective C–N bond formation. This work demonstrates a strategy for the transformation of N2 and simple hydrocarbons into nitrogen-containing organic compounds mediated by a multinuclear hydride framework. A trititanium hydride framework is used to achieve direct hydroamination of simple feedstock hydrocarbons with inert nitrogen gas to obtain the corresponding alkyl amines.",

    "abstract": "Insect respiration has long been thought to be solely dependent on an elaborate tracheal system without assistance from the circulatory system or immune cells1,2. Here we describe that Drosophila crystal cells—myeloid-like immune cells called haemocytes—control respiration by oxygenating Prophenoloxidase 2 (PPO2) proteins. Crystal cells direct the movement of haemocytes between the trachea of the larval body wall and the circulation to collect oxygen. Aided by copper and a neutral pH, oxygen is trapped in the crystalline structures of PPO2 in crystal cells. Conversely, PPO2 crystals can be dissolved when carbonic anhydrase lowers the intracellular pH and then reassembled into crystals in cellulo by adhering to the trachea. Physiologically, larvae lacking crystal cells or PPO2, or those expressing a copper-binding mutant of PPO2, display hypoxic responses under normoxic conditions and are susceptible to hypoxia. These hypoxic phenotypes can be rescued by hyperoxia, expression of arthropod haemocyanin or prevention of larval burrowing activity to expose their respiratory organs. Thus, we propose that insect immune cells collaborate with the tracheal system to reserve and transport oxygen through the phase transition of PPO2 crystals, facilitating internal oxygen homeostasis in a process that is comparable to vertebrate respiration. Drosophila haemocytes collaborate with the tracheal system to reserve and transport oxygen through the phase transition of PPO2 crystals, facilitating internal oxygen homeostasis in a process that is comparable to vertebrate respiration.",

    "abstract": "Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) mechanisms occupy a central place in the historical development and teaching of the field of organic chemistry1. Despite the importance of SN2 pathways in synthesis, catalytic control of ionic SN2 pathways is rare and notably uncommon even in biocatalysis2,3, reflecting the fact that any electrostatic interaction between a catalyst and the reacting ion pair necessarily stabilizes its charge and, by extension, reduces polar reactivity. Nucleophilic halogenase enzymes navigate this tradeoff by desolvating and positioning the halide nucleophile precisely on the SN2 trajectory, using geometric preorganization to compensate for the attenuation of nucleophilicity4. Here we show that a small-molecule (646 Da) hydrogen-bond-donor catalyst accelerates the SN2 step of an enantioselective Michaelis–Arbuzov reaction by recapitulating the geometric preorganization principle used by enzymes. Mechanistic and computational investigations show that the hydrogen-bond donor diminishes the reactivity of the chloride nucleophile yet accelerates the rate-determining dealkylation step by reorganizing both the phosphonium cation and the chloride anion into a geometry that is primed to enter the SN2 transition state. This new enantioselective Arbuzov reaction affords highly enantioselective access to an array of H-phosphinates, which are in turn versatile P-stereogenic building blocks amenable to myriad derivatizations. This work constitutes, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of catalytic enantiocontrol of the phosphonium dealkylation step, establishing a new platform for the synthesis of P-stereogenic compounds. A small-molecule (646 Da) hydrogen-bond-donor catalyst accelerates the SN2 step of an enantioselective Michaelis–Arbuzov reaction by recapitulating the geometric preorganization principle used by enzymes.",

    "abstract": "DNA crosslinks block DNA replication and are repaired by the Fanconi anaemia pathway. The FANCD2–FANCI (D2–I) protein complex is central to this process as it initiates repair by coordinating DNA incisions around the lesion1. However, D2–I is also known to have a more general role in DNA repair and in protecting stalled replication forks from unscheduled degradation2–4. At present, it is unclear how DNA crosslinks are recognized and how D2–I functions in replication fork protection. Here, using single-molecule imaging, we show that D2–I is a sliding clamp that binds to and diffuses on double-stranded DNA. Notably, sliding D2–I stalls on encountering single-stranded–double-stranded (ss–ds) DNA junctions, structures that are generated when replication forks stall at DNA lesions5. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we determined structures of D2–I on DNA that show that stalled D2–I makes specific interactions with the ss–dsDNA junction that are distinct from those made by sliding D2–I. Thus, D2–I surveys dsDNA and, when it reaches an ssDNA gap, it specifically clamps onto ss–dsDNA junctions. Because ss–dsDNA junctions are found at stalled replication forks, D2–I can identify sites of DNA damage. Therefore, our data provide a unified molecular mechanism that reconciles the roles of D2–I in the recognition and protection of stalled replication forks in several DNA repair pathways. FANCD2–FANCI is a sliding clamp that diffuses on double-stranded DNA but stalls when it reaches a single-stranded gap, providing a unified molecular mechanism that reconciles the roles of FANCD2–FANCI in the recognition and protection of stalled replication forks.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 40% of the mammalian proteome undergoes N-terminal methionine excision and acetylation, mediated sequentially by methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) and N-acetyltransferase A (NatA), respectively1. Both modifications are strictly cotranslational and essential in higher eukaryotic organisms1. The interaction, activity and regulation of these enzymes on translating ribosomes are poorly understood. Here we perform biochemical, structural and in vivo studies to demonstrate that the nascent polypeptide-associated complex2,3 (NAC) orchestrates the action of these enzymes. NAC assembles a multienzyme complex with MetAP1 and NatA early during translation and pre-positions the active sites of both enzymes for timely sequential processing of the nascent protein. NAC further releases the inhibitory interactions from the NatA regulatory protein huntingtin yeast two-hybrid protein K4,5 (HYPK) to activate NatA on the ribosome, enforcing cotranslational N-terminal acetylation. Our results provide a mechanistic model for the cotranslational processing of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Cotranslational N-terminal methionine excision and acetylation of eukaryotic proteins on ribosomes is coordinated by the nascent polypeptide-associated complex.",

    "abstract": "Spatial learning in teleost fish requires an intact telencephalon1, a brain region that contains putative analogues to components of the mammalian limbic system (for example, hippocampus)2–4. However, cells fundamental to spatial cognition in mammals—for example, place cells (PCs)5,6—have yet to be established in any fish species. In this study, using tracking microscopy to record brain-wide calcium activity in freely swimming larval zebrafish7, we compute the spatial information content8 of each neuron across the brain. Strikingly, in every recorded animal, cells with the highest spatial specificity were enriched in the zebrafish telencephalon. These PCs form a population code of space from which we can decode the animal’s spatial location across time. By continuous recording of population-level activity, we found that the activity manifold of PCs refines and untangles over time. Through systematic manipulation of allothetic and idiothetic cues, we demonstrate that zebrafish PCs integrate multiple sources of information and can flexibly remap to form distinct spatial maps. Using analysis of neighbourhood distance between PCs across environments, we found evidence for a weakly preconfigured network in the telencephalon. The discovery of zebrafish PCs represents a step forward in our understanding of spatial cognition across species and the functional role of the early vertebrate telencephalon. Using a tracking microscope for freely moving animals, the authors discover a population of place cells in the zebrafish brain and demonstrate that a non-amniote brain is capable of integrating allothetic and idiothetic information to create a neural map of space.",

    "abstract": "Sterile inflammation after myocardial infarction is classically credited to myeloid cells interacting with dead cell debris in the infarct zone1,2. Here we show that cardiomyocytes are the dominant initiators of a previously undescribed type I interferon response in the infarct borderzone. Using spatial transcriptomics analysis in mice and humans, we find that myocardial infarction induces colonies of interferon-induced cells (IFNICs) expressing interferon-stimulated genes decorating the borderzone, where cardiomyocytes experience mechanical stress, nuclear rupture and escape of chromosomal DNA. Cardiomyocyte-selective deletion of Irf3 abrogated IFNIC colonies, whereas mice lacking Irf3 in fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils or endothelial cells, Ccr2-deficient mice or plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-depleted mice did not. Interferons blunted the protective matricellular programs and contractile function of borderzone fibroblasts, and increased vulnerability to pathological remodelling. In mice that died after myocardial infarction, IFNIC colonies were immediately adjacent to sites of ventricular rupture, while mice lacking IFNICs were protected from rupture and exhibited improved survival3. Together, these results reveal a pathological borderzone niche characterized by a cardiomyocyte-initiated innate immune response. We suggest that selective inhibition of IRF3 activation in non-immune cells could limit ischaemic cardiomyopathy while avoiding broad immunosuppression. Cardiomyocytes are the dominant initiators of a type I interferon response in the infarct borderzone.",

    "abstract": "A goal of neuroscience is to obtain a causal model of the nervous system. The recently reported whole-brain fly connectome1–3 specifies the synaptic paths by which neurons can affect each other, but not how strongly they do affect each other in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a combined experimental and statistical strategy for efficiently learning a causal model of the fly brain, which we refer to as the ‘effectome’. Specifically, we propose an estimator for a linear dynamical model of the fly brain that uses stochastic optogenetic perturbation data to estimate causal effects and the connectome as a prior to greatly improve estimation efficiency. We validate our estimator in connectome-based linear simulations and show that it recovers a linear approximation to the nonlinear dynamics of more biophysically realistic simulations. We then analyse the connectome to propose circuits that dominate the dynamics of the fly nervous system. We discover that the dominant circuits involve only relatively small populations of neurons—thus, neuron-level imaging, stimulation and identification are feasible. This approach also re-discovers known circuits and generates testable hypotheses about their dynamics. Overall, we provide evidence that fly whole-brain dynamics are generated by a large collection of small circuits that operate largely independently of each other. This implies that a causal model of a brain can be feasibly obtained in the fly. Analysis of the whole-brain fly connectome reveals high-dimensional dynamics supported by many small independent circuits, motivating a proposal for optogenetic perturbation to efficiently learn a whole-brain causal neural dynamics model.",

    "abstract": "Advanced urothelial cancer is a frequently lethal disease characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity1. In this study, we investigated the evolution of genomic signatures caused by endogenous and external mutagenic processes and their interplay with complex structural variants (SVs). We superimposed mutational signatures and phylogenetic analyses of matched serial tumours from patients with urothelial cancer to define the evolutionary dynamics of these processes. We show that APOBEC3-induced mutations are clonal and early, whereas chemotherapy induces mutational bursts of hundreds of late subclonal mutations. Using a genome graph computational tool2, we observed frequent high copy-number circular amplicons characteristic of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)-forming SVs. We characterized the distinct temporal patterns of APOBEC3-induced and chemotherapy-induced mutations within ecDNA-forming SVs, gaining new insights into the timing of these mutagenic processes relative to ecDNA biogenesis. We discovered that most CCND1 amplifications in urothelial cancer arise within circular ecDNA-forming SVs. ecDNA-forming SVs persisted and increased in complexity, incorporating additional DNA segments and contributing to the evolution of treatment resistance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read whole-genome sequencing followed by de novo assembly mapped out CCND1 ecDNA structure. Experimental modelling of CCND1 ecDNA confirmed its role as a driver of treatment resistance. Our findings define fundamental mechanisms that drive urothelial cancer evolution and have important therapeutic implications. Whole-genome sequencing of matched serial tumours from patients identifies two key mutagenic factors (APOBEC3 and chemotherapy) and extrachromosomal DNA-forming structural variants that drive treatment resistance in urothelial cancer.",

    "abstract": "Haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy (GT) may provide lifelong reconstitution of the haematopoietic system with gene-corrected cells1. However, the effects of underlying genetic diseases, replication stress and ageing on haematopoietic reconstitution and lineage specification remain unclear. In this study, we analysed haematopoietic reconstitution in 53 patients treated with lentiviral-HSC-GT for diverse conditions such as metachromatic leukodystrophy2,3 (MLD), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome4,5 (WAS) and β-thalassaemia6 (β-Thal) over a follow-up period of up to 8 years, using vector integration sites as markers of clonal identity. We found that long-term haematopoietic reconstitution was supported by 770 to 35,000 active HSCs. Whereas 50% of transplanted clones demonstrated multi-lineage potential across all conditions, the remaining clones showed a disease-specific preferential lineage output and long-term commitment: myeloid for MLD, lymphoid for WAS and erythroid for β-Thal, particularly in adult patients. Our results indicate that HSC clonogenic activity, lineage output, long-term lineage commitment and rates of somatic mutations are influenced by the underlying disease, patient age at the time of therapy, the extent of genetic defect correction and the haematopoietic stress imposed by the inherited disease. This suggests that HSCs adapt to the pathological condition during haematopoietic reconstitution. Haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clonogenic activity, lineage output, lineage commitment and somatic mutation rates are influenced by the underlying disease, patient age, extent of genetic defect correction and hematopoietic stress imposed by the inherited disease, suggesting HSC adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable increase in superconducting transition temperature (Tc) observed at the interface of one-unit-cell FeSe films on SrTiO3 substrates (1 uc FeSe/STO)1 has attracted considerable research into the interface effects2–6. Although this high Tc is thought to be associated with electron–phonon coupling (EPC)2, the microscopic coupling mechanism and its role in the superconductivity remain elusive. Here we use momentum-selective high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy to atomically resolve the phonons at the FeSe/STO interface. We uncover new optical phonon modes, coupling strongly with electrons, in the energy range of 75–99 meV. These modes are characterized by out-of-plane vibrations of oxygen atoms in the interfacial double-TiOx layer and the apical oxygens in STO. Our results also demonstrate that the EPC strength and superconducting gap of 1 uc FeSe/STO are closely related to the interlayer spacing between FeSe and the TiOx terminated STO. These findings shed light on the microscopic origin of the interfacial EPC and provide insights into achieving large and consistent Tc enhancement in FeSe/STO and potentially other superconducting systems. Phonons at the FeSe/STO interface are imaged at atomic scale, uncovering new optical phonon modes that couple strongly with electrons, shedding light on the microscopic origin of the interfacial EPC and providing insights into achieving superconducting transition temperature enhancement.",

    "abstract": "To flexibly adapt to new situations, our brains must understand the regularities in the world, as well as those in our own patterns of behaviour. A wealth of findings is beginning to reveal the algorithms that we use to map the outside world1–6. However, the biological algorithms that map the complex structured behaviours that we compose to reach our goals remain unknown. Here we reveal a neuronal implementation of an algorithm for mapping abstract behavioural structure and transferring it to new scenarios. We trained mice on many tasks that shared a common structure (organizing a sequence of goals) but differed in the specific goal locations. The mice discovered the underlying task structure, enabling zero-shot inferences on the first trial of new tasks. The activity of most neurons in the medial frontal cortex tiled progress to goal, akin to how place cells map physical space. These ‘goal-progress cells’ generalized, stretching and compressing their tiling to accommodate different goal distances. By contrast, progress along the overall sequence of goals was not encoded explicitly. Instead, a subset of goal-progress cells was further tuned such that individual neurons fired with a fixed task lag from a particular behavioural step. Together, these cells acted as task-structured memory buffers, implementing an algorithm that instantaneously encoded the entire sequence of future behavioural steps, and whose dynamics automatically computed the appropriate action at each step. These dynamics mirrored the abstract task structure both on-task and during offline sleep. Our findings suggest that schemata of complex behavioural structures can be generated by sculpting progress-to-goal tuning into task-structured buffers of individual behavioural steps. Mice generalize complex task structures by using neurons in the medial frontal cortex that encode progress to task goals and embed behavioural sequences.",

    "abstract": "A critical challenge in glioma treatment is detecting tumour infiltration during surgery to achieve safe maximal resection1–3. Unfortunately, safely resectable residual tumour is found in the majority of patients with glioma after surgery, causing early recurrence and decreased survival4–6. Here we present FastGlioma, a visual foundation model for fast (<10 s) and accurate detection of glioma infiltration in fresh, unprocessed surgical tissue. FastGlioma was pretrained using large-scale self-supervision (around 4 million images) on rapid, label-free optical microscopy, and fine-tuned to output a normalized score that indicates the degree of tumour infiltration within whole-slide optical images. In a prospective, multicentre, international testing cohort of patients with diffuse glioma (n = 220), FastGlioma was able to detect and quantify the degree of tumour infiltration with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92.1 ± 0.9%. FastGlioma outperformed image-guided and fluorescence-guided adjuncts for detecting tumour infiltration during surgery by a wide margin in a head-to-head, prospective study (n = 129). The performance of FastGlioma remained high across diverse patient demographics, medical centres and diffuse glioma molecular subtypes as defined by the World Health Organization. FastGlioma shows zero-shot generalization to other adult and paediatric brain tumour diagnoses, demonstrating the potential for our foundation model to be used as a general-purpose adjunct for guiding brain tumour surgeries. These findings represent the transformative potential of medical foundation models to unlock the role of artificial intelligence in the care of patients with cancer. FastGlioma is a visual foundation model for fast and accurate detection of glioma infiltration in fresh, unprocessed surgical tissue.",

    "abstract": "Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials constructed by corner-sharing tetrahedra (SiO4 and AlO4), with many industrial applications as ion exchangers, adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts1–4. However, the presence of micropores impedes the use of zeolites in areas dealing with bulky substrates. Introducing extrinsic mesopores, that is, intercrystal/intracrystal mesopores, in zeolites is a solution to overcome the diffusion barrier5–8. Still, those extrinsic mesopores are generally disordered and non-uniform; moreover, acidity and crystallinity are always, to some extent, impaired9. Thus, synthesizing thermally stable zeolites with intrinsic mesopores that are of uniform size and crystallographically connected with micropores, denoted here as intrinsic mesoporous zeolite, is highly desired but still not achieved. Here we report ZMQ-1 (Zeolitic Materials, Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, no. 1), an aluminosilicate zeolite with an intersecting intrinsic meso-microporous channel system delimited by 28 × 10 × 10-rings, in which the 28-ring has a free diameter of 22.76 Å × 11.83 Å, which reaches the mesopore domain. ZMQ-1 has high thermal and hydrothermal stability with tunable framework Si/Al molar ratios. ZMQ-1 is the first aluminosilicate zeolite with an intrinsic meso-microporous channel system. The Brønsted acidity of ZMQ-1 imparts high activity and unique selectivity in the catalytic cracking of heavy oil. The position of the organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) used for ZMQ-1 synthesis was determined from three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) data, which shows the unique structure-directing role of the OSDA in the formation of the intrinsic meso-microporous zeolite. This provides an incentive for preparing other stable mesopore-containing zeolites. A new aluminosilicate zeolite called ZMQ-1 is introduced that has an intrinsic meso-microporous channel system and shows high thermal and hydrothermal stability and tunable framework Si/Al molar ratios.",

    "abstract": "Old age is associated with a decline in cognitive function and an increase in neurodegenerative disease risk1. Brain ageing is complex and is accompanied by many cellular changes2. Furthermore, the influence that aged cells have on neighbouring cells and how this contributes to tissue decline is unknown. More generally, the tools to systematically address this question in ageing tissues have not yet been developed. Here we generate a spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics brain atlas of 4.2 million cells from 20 distinct ages across the adult lifespan and across two rejuvenating interventions—exercise and partial reprogramming. We build spatial ageing clocks, machine learning models trained on this spatial transcriptomics atlas, to identify spatial and cell-type-specific transcriptomic fingerprints of ageing, rejuvenation and disease, including for rare cell types. Using spatial ageing clocks and deep learning, we find that T cells, which increasingly infiltrate the brain with age, have a marked pro-ageing proximity effect on neighbouring cells. Surprisingly, neural stem cells have a strong pro-rejuvenating proximity effect on neighbouring cells. We also identify potential mediators of the pro-ageing effect of T cells and the pro-rejuvenating effect of neural stem cells on their neighbours. These results suggest that rare cell types can have a potent influence on their neighbours and could be targeted to counter tissue ageing. Spatial ageing clocks represent a useful tool for studying cell–cell interactions in spatial contexts and should allow scalable assessment of the efficacy of interventions for ageing and disease. A spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics map of the mouse brain at different ages reveals signatures of ageing, rejuvenation and disease, including ageing effects associated with T cells and rejuvenation associated with neural stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Predicting practical rates of transport in condensed phases enables the rational design of materials, devices and processes. This is especially critical to developing low-carbon energy technologies such as rechargeable batteries1–3. For ionic conduction, the collective mechanisms4,5, variation of conductivity with timescales6–8 and confinement9,10, and ambiguity in the phononic origin of translation11,12, call for a direct probe of the fundamental steps of ionic diffusion: ion hops. However, such hops are rare-event large-amplitude translations, and are challenging to excite and detect. Here we use single-cycle terahertz pumps to impulsively trigger ionic hopping in battery solid electrolytes. This is visualized by an induced transient birefringence, enabling direct probing of anisotropy in ionic hopping on the picosecond timescale. The relaxation of the transient signal measures the decay of orientational memory, and the production of entropy in diffusion. We extend experimental results using in silico transient birefringence to identify vibrational attempt frequencies for ion hopping. Using nonlinear optical methods, we probe ion transport at its fastest limit, distinguish correlated conduction mechanisms from a true random walk at the atomic scale, and demonstrate the connection between activated transport and the thermodynamics of information. Single-cycle terahertz pumps are used to impulsively trigger ionic hopping in battery solid electrolytes, probing ion transport at its fastest limit and demonstrating the connection between activated transport and the thermodynamics of information.",

    "abstract": "The largest ever primate and one of the largest of the southeast Asian megafauna, Gigantopithecus blacki1, persisted in China from about 2.0 million years until the late middle Pleistocene when it became extinct2–4. Its demise is enigmatic considering that it was one of the few Asian great apes to go extinct in the last 2.6 million years, whereas others, including orangutan, survived until the present5. The cause of the disappearance of G. blacki remains unresolved but could shed light on primate resilience and the fate of megafauna in this region6. Here we applied three multidisciplinary analyses—timing, past environments and behaviour—to 22 caves in southern China. We used 157 radiometric ages from six dating techniques to establish a timeline for the demise of G. blacki. We show that from 2.3 million years ago the environment was a mosaic of forests and grasses, providing ideal conditions for thriving G. blacki populations. However, just before and during the extinction window between 295,000 and 215,000  years ago there was enhanced environmental variability from increased seasonality, which caused changes in plant communities and an increase in open forest environments. Although its close relative Pongo weidenreichi managed to adapt its dietary preferences and behaviour to this variability, G. blacki showed signs of chronic stress and dwindling populations. Ultimately its struggle to adapt led to the extinction of the greatest primate to ever inhabit the Earth. A multiproxy record of Gigantopithecus blacki provides insights into the ecological context of this species, which became extinct around 250,000 years ago, when increased seasonality led to a change in forest cover.",

    "abstract": "Empirical evidence suggests that heat exposure reduces food intake. However, the neurocircuit architecture and the signalling mechanisms that form an associative interface between sensory and metabolic modalities remain unknown, despite primary thermoceptive neurons in the pontine parabrachial nucleus becoming well characterized1. Tanycytes are a specialized cell type along the wall of the third ventricle2 that bidirectionally transport hormones and signalling molecules between the brain’s parenchyma and ventricular system3–8. Here we show that tanycytes are activated upon acute thermal challenge and are necessary to reduce food intake afterwards. Virus-mediated gene manipulation and circuit mapping showed that thermosensing glutamatergic neurons of the parabrachial nucleus innervate tanycytes either directly or through second-order hypothalamic neurons. Heat-dependent Fos expression in tanycytes suggested their ability to produce signalling molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). Instead of discharging VEGFA into the cerebrospinal fluid for a systemic effect, VEGFA was released along the parenchymal processes of tanycytes in the arcuate nucleus. VEGFA then increased the spike threshold of Flt1-expressing dopamine and agouti-related peptide (Agrp)-containing neurons, thus priming net anorexigenic output. Indeed, both acute heat and the chemogenetic activation of glutamatergic parabrachial neurons at thermoneutrality reduced food intake for hours, in a manner that is sensitive to both Vegfa loss-of-function and blockage of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2)-dependent exocytosis from tanycytes. Overall, we define a multimodal neurocircuit in which tanycytes link parabrachial sensory relay to the long-term enforcement of a metabolic code. In response to acute thermal challenge, thermosensing glutamatergic neurons of the parabrachial nucleus in mouse brain activate tanycytes, which reduce the excitability of Flt1-expressing dopamine and agouti-related peptide-containing neurons, thus suppressing appetite.",

T cells, but not innate lymphoid cells, have an indispensable role in sustaining the IL-22 signalling that is required for the protection of colonic crypts against invasion during infection by the enteropathogen Citrobacter rodentium4 (Cr). However, the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) subsets targeted by T cell-derived IL-22, and how T cell-derived IL-22 sustains activation in IECs, remain undefined. Here we identify a subset of absorptive IECs in the mid–distal colon that are specifically targeted by Cr and are differentially responsive to IL-22 signalling. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) expression by these colonocytes was required to elicit sustained IL-22 signalling from Cr-specific T cells, which was required to restrain Cr invasion. Our findings explain the basis for the regionalization of the host response to Cr and demonstrate that epithelial cells must elicit MHCII-dependent help from IL-22–producing T cells to orchestrate immune protection in the intestine. The murine enteropathogen Citrobacter rodentium targets a specific subset of absorptive intestinal epithelial cells in the mid–distal colon, which stimulate T cells to produce sustained IL-22 signals to mitigate further spread of the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositide-3-kinase-γ (PI3Kγ) is implicated as a target to repolarize tumour-associated macrophages and promote antitumour immune responses in solid cancers1–4. However, cancer cell-intrinsic roles of PI3Kγ are unclear. Here, by integrating unbiased genome-wide CRISPR interference screening with functional analyses across acute leukaemias, we define a selective dependency on the PI3Kγ complex in a high-risk subset that includes myeloid, lymphoid and dendritic lineages. This dependency is characterized by innate inflammatory signalling and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulatory subunit 5 (PIK3R5), which encodes a regulatory subunit of PI3Kγ5 and stabilizes the active enzymatic complex. We identify p21 (RAC1)-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) as a noncanonical substrate of PI3Kγ that mediates this cell-intrinsic dependency and find that dephosphorylation of PAK1 by PI3Kγ inhibition impairs mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Treatment with the selective PI3Kγ inhibitor eganelisib is effective in leukaemias with activated PIK3R5. In addition, the combination of eganelisib and cytarabine prolongs survival over either agent alone, even in patient-derived leukaemia xenografts with low baseline PIK3R5 expression, as residual leukaemia cells after cytarabine treatment have elevated G protein-coupled purinergic receptor activity and PAK1 phosphorylation. Together, our study reveals a targetable dependency on PI3Kγ–PAK1 signalling that is amenable to near-term evaluation in patients with acute leukaemia. Using a multimodal approach across acute leukaemias, a targetable PI3Kγ dependency in leukaemias is explored.",

    "abstract": "Earth’s silica-rich continental crust is unique among the terrestrial planets and is critical for planetary habitability. Cratons represent the most imperishable continental fragments and form about 50% of the continental crust of the Earth, yet the mechanisms responsible for craton stabilization remain enigmatic1. Large tracts of strongly differentiated crust formed between 3 and 2.5 billion years ago, during the late Mesoarchaean and Neoarchaean time periods2. This crust contains abundant granitoid rocks with elevated concentrations of U, Th and K; the formation of these igneous rocks represents the final stage of stabilization of the continental crust2,3. Here, we show that subaerial weathering, triggered by the emergence of continental landmasses above sea level, facilitated intracrustal melting and the generation of peraluminous granitoid magmas. This resulted in reorganization of the compositional architecture of continental crust in the Neoarchaean period. Subaerial weathering concentrated heat-producing elements into terrigenous sediments that were incorporated into the deep crust, where they drove crustal melting and the chemical stratification required to stabilize the cratonic lithosphere. The chain of causality between subaerial weathering and the final differentiation of Earth’s crust implies that craton stabilization was an inevitable consequence of continental emergence. Generation of sedimentary rocks enriched in heat-producing elements, at a time in the history of the Earth when the rate of radiogenic heat production was on average twice the present-day rate, resolves a long-standing question of why many cratons were stabilized in the Neoarchaean period. The geological histories of Archaean regions indicate that stabilization of the Earth’s continents and the formation of cratons was driven by continental emergence and subaerial weathering.",

    "abstract": "Human feline leukaemia virus subgroup C receptor-related proteins 1 and 2 (FLVCR1 and FLVCR2) are members of the major facilitator superfamily1. Their dysfunction is linked to several clinical disorders, including PCARP, HSAN and Fowler syndrome2–7. Earlier studies concluded that FLVCR1 may function as a haem exporter8–12, whereas FLVCR2 was suggested to act as a haem importer13, yet conclusive biochemical and detailed molecular evidence remained elusive for the function of both transporters14–16. Here, we show that FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 facilitate the transport of choline and ethanolamine across the plasma membrane, using a concentration-driven substrate translocation process. Through structural and computational analyses, we have identified distinct conformational states of FLVCRs and unravelled the coordination chemistry underlying their substrate interactions. Fully conserved tryptophan and tyrosine residues form the binding pocket of both transporters and confer selectivity for choline and ethanolamine through cation–π interactions. Our findings clarify the mechanisms of choline and ethanolamine transport by FLVCR1 and FLVCR2, enhance our comprehension of disease-associated mutations that interfere with these vital processes and shed light on the conformational dynamics of these major facilitator superfamily proteins during the transport cycle. Structural analysis of the human choline and ethanolamine transporters FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 clarifies the mechanisms of transport, the conformational dynamics of these proteins and the disease-associated mutations that interfere with these processes.",

    "abstract": "Lanthanide rare-earth metals are ubiquitous in modern technologies1–5, but we know little about chemistry of the 61st element, promethium (Pm)6, a lanthanide that is highly radioactive and inaccessible. Despite its importance7,8, Pm has been conspicuously absent from the experimental studies of lanthanides, impeding our full comprehension of the so-called lanthanide contraction phenomenon: a fundamental aspect of the periodic table that is quoted in general chemistry textbooks. Here we demonstrate a stable chelation of the 147Pm radionuclide (half-life of 2.62 years) in aqueous solution by the newly synthesized organic diglycolamide ligand. The resulting homoleptic PmIII complex is studied using synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations to establish the coordination structure and a bond distance of promethium. These fundamental insights allow a complete structural investigation of a full set of isostructural lanthanide complexes, ultimately capturing the lanthanide contraction in solution solely on the basis of experimental observations. Our results show accelerated shortening of bonds at the beginning of the lanthanide series, which can be correlated to the separation trends shown by diglycolamides9–11. The characterization of the radioactive PmIII complex in an aqueous environment deepens our understanding of intra-lanthanide behaviour12–15 and the chemistry and separation of the f-block elements16. Stable chelation of the 147Pm radionuclide in aqueous solution by the newly synthesized organic diglycolamide ligand is demonstrated and the resulting complex studied, showing accelerated shortening of bonds at the beginning of the lanthanide series.",

Blueprint studies3–5 indicate that general-purpose quantum computing using local quantum communication networks will require millions of physical qubits to encode thousands of logical qubits, presenting an open scalability challenge. Here we introduce a modular quantum system-on-chip (QSoC) architecture that integrates thousands of individually addressable tin-vacancy spin qubits in two-dimensional arrays of quantum microchiplets into an application-specific integrated circuit designed for cryogenic control. We demonstrate crucial fabrication steps and architectural subcomponents, including QSoC transfer by means of a ‘lock-and-release’ method for large-scale heterogeneous integration, high-throughput spin-qubit calibration and spectral tuning, and efficient spin state preparation and measurement. This QSoC architecture supports full connectivity for quantum memory arrays by spectral tuning across spin–photon frequency channels. Design studies building on these measurements indicate further scaling potential by means of increased qubit density, larger QSoC active regions and optical networking across QSoC modules.

    "abstract": "Membranes are widely used for separation processes in applications such as water desalination, batteries and dialysis, and are crucial in key sectors of our economy and society1. The majority of technologically exploited membranes are based on solid polymers and function as passive barriers, whose transport characteristics are governed by their chemical composition and nanostructure. Although such membranes are ubiquitous, it has proved challenging to maximize selectivity and permeability independently, leading to trade-offs between these pertinent characteristics2. Self-assembled biological membranes, in which barrier and transport functions are decoupled3,4, provide the inspiration to address this problem5,6. Here we introduce a self-assembly strategy that uses the interface of an aqueous two-phase system to template and stabilize molecularly thin (approximately 35 nm) biomimetic block copolymer bilayers of scalable area that can exceed 10 cm2 without defects. These membranes are self-healing, and their barrier function against the passage of ions (specific resistance of approximately 1 MΩ cm2) approaches that of phospholipid membranes. The fluidity of these membranes enables straightforward functionalization with molecular carriers that shuttle potassium ions down a concentration gradient with exquisite selectivity over sodium ions. This ion selectivity enables the generation of electric power from equimolar solutions of NaCl and KCl in devices that mimic the electric organ of electric rays. We introduce a self-assembly strategy that uses the interface of an aqueous two-phase system to template and stabilize molecularly thin biomimetic block copolymer bilayers of scalable area that can exceed 10 cm2 without defects.",

    "abstract": "Malaria-causing protozoa of the genus Plasmodium have exerted one of the strongest selective pressures on the human genome, and resistance alleles provide biomolecular footprints that outline the historical reach of these species1. Nevertheless, debate persists over when and how malaria parasites emerged as human pathogens and spread around the globe1,2. To address these questions, we generated high-coverage ancient mitochondrial and nuclear genome-wide data from P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae from 16 countries spanning around 5,500 years of human history. We identified P. vivax and P. falciparum across geographically disparate regions of Eurasia from as early as the fourth and first millennia bce, respectively; for P. vivax, this evidence pre-dates textual references by several millennia3. Genomic analysis supports distinct disease histories for P. falciparum and P. vivax in the Americas: similarities between now-eliminated European and peri-contact South American strains indicate that European colonizers were the source of American P. vivax, whereas the trans-Atlantic slave trade probably introduced P. falciparum into the Americas. Our data underscore the role of cross-cultural contacts in the dissemination of malaria, laying the biomolecular foundation for future palaeo-epidemiological research into the impact of Plasmodium parasites on human history. Finally, our unexpected discovery of P. falciparum in the high-altitude Himalayas provides a rare case study in which individual mobility can be inferred from infection status, adding to our knowledge of cross-cultural connectivity in the region nearly three millennia ago. Genomic analysis of Plasmodium DNA from 36 ancient individuals provides insight into the global distribution and spread of malaria-causing species during around 5,500 years of human history.",

    "abstract": "The solid inner core, suspended within the liquid outer core and anchored by gravity, has been inferred to rotate relative to the surface of Earth or change over years to decades based on changes in seismograms from repeating earthquakes and explosions1,2. It has a rich inner structure3–6 and influences the pattern of outer core convection and therefore Earth’s magnetic field. Here we compile 143 distinct pairs of repeating earthquakes, many within 16 multiplets, built from 121 earthquakes between 1991 and 2023 in the South Sandwich Islands. We analyse their inner-core-penetrating PKIKP waves recorded on the medium-aperture arrays in northern North America. We document that many multiplets exhibit waveforms that change and then revert at later times to match earlier events. The matching waveforms reveal times at which the inner core re-occupies the same position, relative to the mantle, as it did at some time in the past. The pattern of matches, together with previous studies, demonstrates that the inner core gradually super-rotated from 2003 to 2008, and then from 2008 to 2023 sub-rotated two to three times more slowly back through the same path. These matches enable precise and unambiguous tracking of inner core progression and regression. The resolved different rates of forward and backward motion suggest that new models will be necessary for the dynamics between the inner core, outer core and mantle. Matching seismic waveforms show that the inner core of Earth gradually super-rotated from 2003 to 2008, and then more slowly sub-rotated from 2008 to 2023 back through the same path.",

    "abstract": "Directed cell migration is driven by the front–back polarization of intracellular signalling1–3. Receptor tyrosine kinases and other inputs activate local signals that trigger membrane protrusions at the front2,4–6. Equally important is a long-range inhibitory mechanism that suppresses signalling at the back to prevent the formation of multiple fronts7–9. However, the identity of this mechanism is unknown. Here we report that endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane (ER–PM) contact sites are polarized in single and collectively migrating cells. The increased density of these ER–PM contacts at the back provides the ER-resident PTP1B phosphatase more access to PM substrates, which confines receptor signalling to the front and directs cell migration. Polarization of the ER–PM contacts is due to microtubule-regulated polarization of the ER, with more RTN4-rich curved ER at the front and more CLIMP63-rich flattened ER at the back. The resulting ER curvature gradient leads to small and unstable ER–PM contacts only at the front. These contacts flow backwards and grow to large and stable contacts at the back to form the front–back ER–PM contact gradient. Together, our study suggests that the structural polarity mediated by ER–PM contact gradients polarizes cell signalling, directs cell migration and prolongs cell migration. The density and size of contact gradients between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane control the speed and direction of cell migration by restricting receptor signalling to the front.",

    "abstract": "The subpectoral diverticulum (SPD) is an extension of the respiratory system in birds that is located between the primary muscles responsible for flapping the wing1,2. Here we survey the pulmonary apparatus in 68 avian species, and show that the SPD was present in virtually all of the soaring taxa investigated but absent in non-soarers. We find that this structure evolved independently with soaring flight at least seven times, which indicates that the diverticulum might have a functional and adaptive relationship with this flight style. Using the soaring hawks Buteo jamaicensis and Buteo swainsoni as models, we show that the SPD is not integral for ventilation, that an inflated SPD can increase the moment arm of cranial parts of the pectoralis, and that pectoralis muscle fascicles are significantly shorter in soaring hawks than in non-soaring birds. This coupling of an SPD-mediated increase in pectoralis leverage with force-specialized muscle architecture produces a pneumatic system that is adapted for the isometric contractile conditions expected in soaring flight. The discovery of a mechanical role for the respiratory system in avian locomotion underscores the functional complexity and heterogeneity of this organ system, and suggests that pulmonary diverticula are likely to have other undiscovered secondary functions. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the repeated appearance of the SPD in soaring lineages and show that the respiratory system can be co-opted to provide biomechanical solutions to the challenges of flight and thereby influence the evolution of avian volancy. An investigation of the subpectoral diverticulum—an inflatable air sac structure between the major flight muscles—in 68 avian species reveals that the respiratory system has a role in the mechanics of flight in soaring birds.",

Recent studies have shed light on spliceosome assembly and remodelling for catalysis2–6, but the mechanism of disassembly remains unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of nematode and human terminal intron lariat spliceosomes along with biochemical and genetic data. Our results uncover how four disassembly factors and the conserved RNA helicase DHX15 initiate spliceosome disassembly. The disassembly factors probe large inner and outer spliceosome surfaces to detect the release of ligated mRNA. Two of these factors, TFIP11 and C19L1, and three general spliceosome subunits, SYF1, SYF2 and SDE2, then dock and activate DHX15 on the catalytic U6 snRNA to initiate disassembly. U6 therefore controls both the start5 and end of pre-mRNA splicing. Taken together, our results explain the molecular basis of the initiation of canonical spliceosome disassembly and provide a framework to understand general spliceosomal RNA helicase control and the discard of aberrant spliceosomes. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of human and nematode spliceosomes show that the disassembly of this complex is initiated by the licensing of the disassembly helicase to act on the catalytic U6 small nuclear RNA.",

    "abstract": "Encouraging routine COVID-19 vaccinations is likely to be a crucial policy challenge for decades to come. To avert hundreds of thousands of unnecessary hospitalizations and deaths, adoption will need to be higher than it was in the autumn of 2022 or 2023, when less than one-fifth of Americans received booster vaccines1,2. One approach to encouraging vaccination is to eliminate the friction of transportation hurdles. Previous research has shown that friction can hinder follow-through3 and that individuals who live farther from COVID-19 vaccination sites are less likely to get vaccinated4. However, the value of providing free round-trip transportation to vaccination sites is unknown. Here we show that offering people free round-trip Lyft rides to pharmacies has no benefit over and above sending them behaviourally informed text messages reminding them to get vaccinated. We determined this by running a megastudy with millions of CVS Pharmacy patients in the United States testing the effects of (1) free round-trip Lyft rides to CVS Pharmacies for vaccination appointments and (2) seven different sets of behaviourally informed vaccine reminder messages. Our results suggest that offering previously vaccinated individuals free rides to vaccination sites is not a good investment in the United States, contrary to the high expectations of both expert and lay forecasters. Instead, people in the United States should be sent behaviourally informed COVID-19 vaccination reminders, which increased the 30-day COVID-19 booster uptake by 21% (1.05 percentage points) and spilled over to increase 30-day influenza vaccinations by 8% (0.34 percentage points) in our megastudy. More rigorous testing of interventions to promote vaccination is needed to ensure that evidence-based solutions are deployed widely and that ineffective but intuitively appealing tools are discontinued. Contrary to expectations, offers of free transportation to vaccine sites did not increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake more than text message reminders, a finding that has implications for future policy decision-making to promote vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Despite being the dominant force of nature on large scales, gravity remains relatively elusive to precision laboratory experiments. Atom interferometers are powerful tools for investigating, for example, Earth’s gravity1, the gravitational constant2, deviations from Newtonian gravity3–6 and general relativity7. However, using atoms in free fall limits measurement time to a few seconds8, and much less when measuring interactions with a small source mass2,5,6,9. Recently, interferometers with atoms suspended for 70 s in an optical-lattice mode filtered by an optical cavity have been demonstrated10–14. However, the optical lattice must balance Earth’s gravity by applying forces that are a billionfold stronger than the putative signals, so even tiny imperfections may generate complex systematic effects. Thus, lattice interferometers have yet to be used for precision tests of gravity. Here we optimize the gravitational sensitivity of a lattice interferometer and use a system of signal inversions to suppress and quantify systematic effects. We measure the attraction of a miniature source mass to be amass = 33.3 ± 5.6stat ± 2.7syst nm s−2, consistent with Newtonian gravity, ruling out ‘screened fifth force’ theories3,15,16 over their natural parameter space. The overall accuracy of 6.2 nm s−2 surpasses by more than a factor of four the best similar measurements with atoms in free fall5,6. Improved atom cooling and tilt-noise suppression may further increase sensitivity for investigating forces at sub-millimetre ranges17,18, compact gravimetry19–22, measuring the gravitational Aharonov–Bohm effect9,23 and the gravitational constant2, and testing whether the gravitational field has quantum properties24. Using an optical lattice to suspend atoms, the gravitational attraction of a miniature source mass can be determined by an atom interferometer with much greater accuracy compared with atoms in free fall.",

    "abstract": "Bedaquiline (BDQ), a first-in-class diarylquinoline anti-tuberculosis drug, and its analogue, TBAJ-587, prevent the growth and proliferation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by inhibiting ATP synthase1,2. However, BDQ also inhibits human ATP synthase3. At present, how these compounds interact with either M. tuberculosis ATP synthase or human ATP synthase is unclear. Here we present cryogenic electron microscopy structures of M. tuberculosis ATP synthase with and without BDQ and TBAJ-587 bound, and human ATP synthase bound to BDQ. The two inhibitors interact with subunit a and the c-ring at the leading site, c-only sites and lagging site in M. tuberculosis ATP synthase, showing that BDQ and TBAJ-587 have similar modes of action. The quinolinyl and dimethylamino units of the compounds make extensive contacts with the protein. The structure of human ATP synthase in complex with BDQ reveals that the BDQ-binding site is similar to that observed for the leading site in M. tuberculosis ATP synthase, and that the quinolinyl unit also interacts extensively with the human enzyme. This study will improve researchers’ understanding of the similarities and differences between human ATP synthase and M. tuberculosis ATP synthase in terms of the mode of BDQ binding, and will allow the rational design of novel diarylquinolines as anti-tuberculosis drugs. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATP synthase and human ATP synthase bound to the anti-tuberculosis drug bedaquiline or its analogue TBAJ-587 shed light on drug binding and could lead to new treatments for tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "The tumour evolution model posits that malignant transformation is preceded by randomly distributed driver mutations in cancer genes, which cause clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues. Although clonal expansions can remodel entire tissues1–3, the mechanisms that result in only a small number of clones transforming into malignant tumours remain unknown. Here we develop an in vivo single-cell CRISPR strategy to systematically investigate tissue-wide clonal dynamics of the 150 most frequently mutated squamous cell carcinoma genes. We couple ultrasound-guided in utero lentiviral microinjections, single-cell RNA sequencing and guide capture to longitudinally monitor clonal expansions and document their underlying gene programmes at single-cell transcriptomic resolution. We uncover a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) signalling module, which is dependent on TNF receptor 1 and involving macrophages, that acts as a generalizable driver of clonal expansions in epithelial tissues. Conversely, during tumorigenesis, the TNF signalling module is downregulated. Instead, we identify a subpopulation of invasive cancer cells that switch to an autocrine TNF gene programme associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that the autocrine TNF gene programme is sufficient to mediate invasive properties and show that the TNF signature correlates with shorter overall survival of patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, our study demonstrates the power of applying in vivo single-cell CRISPR screening to mammalian tissues, unveils distinct TNF programmes in tumour evolution and highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between clonal expansions in epithelia and tumorigenesis. A CRISPR-based strategy for screening genes that affect clonal expansion finds that genes that are frequently mutated in squamous cell carcinoma converge on a TNF signalling module involving macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Females exhibit complex, dynamic behaviours during mating with variable sexual receptivity depending on hormonal status1–4. However, how their brains encode the dynamics of mating and receptivity remains largely unknown. The ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral subdivision contains oestrogen receptor type 1-positive neurons that control mating receptivity in female mice5,6. Here, unsupervised dynamical system analysis of calcium imaging data from these neurons during mating uncovered a dimension with slow ramping activity, generating a line attractor in neural state space. Neural perturbations in behaving females demonstrated relaxation of population activity back into the attractor. During mating, population activity integrated male cues to ramp up along this attractor, peaking just before ejaculation. Activity in the attractor dimension was positively correlated with the degree of receptivity. Longitudinal imaging revealed that attractor dynamics appear and disappear across the oestrus cycle and are hormone dependent. These observations suggest that a hypothalamic line attractor encodes a persistent, escalating state of female sexual arousal or drive during mating. They also demonstrate that attractors can be reversibly modulated by hormonal status, on a timescale of days. An oestrus cycle-dependent hypothalamic line attractor is discovered to encode the dynamics of female mating behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The selective cross-coupling of two alkyl electrophiles to construct complex molecules remains a challenge in organic synthesis1,2. Known reactions are optimized for specific electrophiles and are not amenable to interchangeably varying electrophilic substrates that are sourced from common alkyl building blocks, such as amines, carboxylic acids and halides3–5. These limitations restrict the types of alkyl substrate that can be modified and, ultimately, the chemical space that can be explored6. Here we report a general solution to these limitations that enables a combinatorial approach to alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling reactions. This methodology relies on the discovery of unusually persistent Ni(alkyl) complexes that can be formed directly by oxidative addition of alkyl halides, redox-active esters or pyridinium salts. The resulting alkyl complexes can be isolated or directly telescoped to couple with a second alkyl electrophile, which represent cross-selective reactions that were previously unknown. The utility of this synthetic capability is showcased in the rapid diversification of amino acids, natural products, pharmaceuticals and drug-like building blocks by various combinations of dehalogenative, decarboxylative or deaminative coupling. In addition to a robust scope, this work provides insights into the organometallic chemistry of synthetically relevant Ni(alkyl) complexes through crystallographic analysis, stereochemical probes and spectroscopic studies. Alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling reactions are achieved by forming nickel–alkyl complexes directly by oxidative addition of alkyl halides, redox-active esters or pyridinium salts, and then combining them with a second alkyl electrophile.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the mammalian brain and provide structural and metabolic support to neurons, regulate synapses and become reactive after injury and disease. However, a small subset of astrocytes settles in specialized areas of the adult brain where these astrocytes instead actively generate differentiated neuronal and glial progeny and are therefore referred to as neural stem cells1–3. Common parenchymal astrocytes and quiescent neural stem cells share similar transcriptomes despite their very distinct functions4–6. Thus, how stem cell activity is molecularly encoded remains unknown. Here we examine the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and methylome of neural stem cells and their progeny, and of astrocytes from the striatum and cortex in the healthy and ischaemic adult mouse brain. We identify distinct methylation profiles associated with either astrocyte or stem cell function. Stem cell function is mediated by methylation of astrocyte genes and demethylation of stem cell genes that are expressed later. Ischaemic injury to the brain induces gain of stemness in striatal astrocytes7. We show that this response involves reprogramming the astrocyte methylome to a stem cell methylome and is absent if the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3A is missing. Overall, we unveil DNA methylation as a promising target for regenerative medicine. Single-cell analysis of the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and methylome of adult neural stem cells and astrocytes demonstrates that stemness is driven by methylation profiles distinct from those of astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Subcellular protein localization regulates protein function and can be corrupted in cancers1 and neurodegenerative diseases2,3. The rewiring of localization to address disease-driving phenotypes would be an attractive targeted therapeutic approach. Molecules that harness the trafficking of a shuttle protein to control the subcellular localization of a target protein could enforce targeted protein relocalization and rewire the interactome. Here we identify a collection of shuttle proteins with potent ligands amenable to incorporation into targeted relocalization-activating molecules (TRAMs), and use these to relocalize endogenous proteins. Using a custom imaging analysis pipeline, we show that protein steady-state localization can be modulated through molecular coupling to shuttle proteins containing sufficiently strong localization sequences and expressed in the necessary abundance. We analyse the TRAM-induced relocalization of different proteins and then use nuclear hormone receptors as shuttles to redistribute disease-driving mutant proteins such as SMARCB1Q318X, TDP43ΔNLS and FUSR495X. TRAM-mediated relocalization of FUSR495X to the nucleus from the cytoplasm correlated with a reduction in the number of stress granules in a model of cellular stress. With methionyl aminopeptidase 2 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 as endogenous cytoplasmic and nuclear shuttles, respectively, we demonstrate relocalization of endogenous PRMT9, SOS1 and FKBP12. Small-molecule-mediated redistribution of nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 from nuclei to axons in primary neurons was able to slow axonal degeneration and pharmacologically mimic the genetic WldS gain-of-function phenotype in mice resistant to certain types of neurodegeneration4. The concept of targeted protein relocalization could therefore inspire approaches for treating disease through interactome rewiring. Targeted protein relocalization using shuttle proteins with potent ligands amenable to incorporation into targeted relocalization activating molecules could be used to regulate cellular physiology and correct disease states in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are marked by insulin resistance1,2. Cells within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), which are crucial for regulating metabolism, become insulin resistant during the progression of metabolic disease3–8, but these mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we investigated the role of a specialized chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan extracellular matrix, termed a perineuronal net, which surrounds ARC neurons. In metabolic disease, the perineuronal net of the ARC becomes augmented and remodelled, driving insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Disruption of the perineuronal net in obese mice, either enzymatically or with small molecules, improves insulin access to the brain, reversing neuronal insulin resistance and enhancing metabolic health. Our findings identify ARC extracellular matrix remodelling as a fundamental mechanism driving metabolic diseases. Experiments in mice show that the perineural net has a key role in metabolic disease by controlling insulin access to neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.",

    "abstract": "El Niño events, the warm phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, amplify climate variability throughout the world1. Uncertain climate model predictions limit our ability to assess whether these climatic events could become more extreme under anthropogenic greenhouse warming2. Palaeoclimate records provide estimates of past changes, but it is unclear if they can constrain mechanisms underlying future predictions3–5. Here we uncover a mechanism using numerical simulations that drives consistent changes in response to past and future forcings, allowing model validation against palaeoclimate data. The simulated mechanism is consistent with the dynamics of observed extreme El Niño events, which develop when western Pacific warm pool waters expand rapidly eastwards because of strongly coupled ocean currents and winds6,7. These coupled interactions weaken under glacial conditions because of a deeper mixed layer driven by a stronger Walker circulation. The resulting decrease in ENSO variability and extreme El Niño occurrence is supported by a series of tropical Pacific palaeoceanographic records showing reduced glacial temperature variability within key ENSO-sensitive oceanic regions, including new data from the central equatorial Pacific. The model–data agreement on past variability, together with the consistent mechanism across climatic states, supports the prediction of a shallower mixed layer and weaker Walker circulation driving more frequent extreme El Niño genesis under greenhouse warming. A combination of palaeoclimate proxies and simulations shows that a common mechanism controls El Niño variation in cold and warm states, which supports expectations of more extreme El Niño occurrence in the future.",

    "abstract": "Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) replaces the stem cells responsible for blood production with those from a donor1,2. Here, to quantify dynamics of long-term stem cell engraftment, we sequenced genomes from 2,824 single-cell-derived haematopoietic colonies of ten donor–recipient pairs taken 9–31 years after HLA-matched sibling HCT3. With younger donors (18–47 years at transplant), 5,000–30,000 stem cells had engrafted and were still contributing to haematopoiesis at the time of sampling; estimates were tenfold lower with older donors (50–66 years). Engrafted cells made multilineage contributions to myeloid, B lymphoid and T lymphoid populations, although individual clones often showed biases towards one or other mature cell type. Recipients had lower clonal diversity than matched donors, equivalent to around 10–15 years of additional ageing, arising from up to 25-fold greater expansion of stem cell clones. A transplant-related population bottleneck could not explain these differences; instead, phylogenetic trees evinced two distinct modes of HCT-specific selection. In pruning selection, cell divisions underpinning recipient-enriched clonal expansions had occurred in the donor, preceding transplant—their selective advantage derived from preferential mobilization, collection, survival ex vivo or initial homing. In growth selection, cell divisions underpinning clonal expansion occurred in the recipient’s marrow after engraftment, most pronounced in clones with multiple driver mutations. Uprooting stem cells from their native environment and transplanting them to foreign soil exaggerates selective pressures, distorting and accelerating the loss of clonal diversity compared to the unperturbed haematopoiesis of donors. Uprooting stem cells from their native environment and transplanting them to other individuals exaggerates selective pressures, distorting and accelerating the loss of clonal diversity in contrast to the unperturbed haematopoiesis of donors.",

    "abstract": "Supersolids are states of matter that spontaneously break two continuous symmetries: translational invariance owing to the appearance of a crystal structure and phase invariance owing to phase locking of single-particle wavefunctions, responsible for superfluid phenomena. Although originally predicted to be present in solid helium1–5, ultracold quantum gases provided a first platform to observe supersolids6–10, with particular success coming from dipolar atoms8–12. Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been investigated through, for example, measurements of the phase coherence8–10 and gapless Goldstone modes13, but quantized vortices, a hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here, with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate vortices in dipolar gases14,15 and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline order11,16,17, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation of vortices in the supersolid phase (SSP). Our work reveals a fundamental difference in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids. This opens the door to study the hydrodynamic properties of exotic quantum systems with numerous spontaneously broken symmetries, in disparate domains such as quantum crystals and neutron stars18. Magnetostirring is used to rotate the magnetic field and set a dipolar supersolid composed of ultracold atoms spinning, revealing fundamental differences in vortex seeding dynamics between modulated and unmodulated quantum fluids.",

    "abstract": "The bone marrow microenvironment is a critical regulator of haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and fate1. Although it is appreciated that ageing, chronic inflammation and other insults compromise bone marrow function and thereby negatively affect haematopoiesis2, it is not known whether different bone compartments exhibit distinct microenvironmental properties and functional resilience. Here we use imaging, pharmacological approaches and mouse genetics to uncover specialized properties of bone marrow in adult and ageing skull. Specifically, we show that the skull bone marrow undergoes lifelong expansion involving vascular growth, which results in an increasing contribution to total haematopoietic output. Furthermore, skull is largely protected against major hallmarks of ageing, including upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, adipogenesis and loss of vascular integrity. Conspicuous rapid and dynamic changes to the skull vasculature and bone marrow are induced by physiological alterations, namely pregnancy, but also pathological challenges, such as stroke and experimental chronic myeloid leukaemia. These responses are highly distinct from femur, the most extensively studied bone marrow compartment. We propose that skull harbours a protected and dynamically expanding bone marrow microenvironment, which is relevant for experimental studies and, potentially, for clinical treatments in humans. Skull bone marrow expands during adult life, exhibits lifelong vascular growth and increases its haematopoietic potential during ageing.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has an atypical, highly stromal tumour microenvironment (TME) that profoundly contributes to its poor prognosis1. Here, to better understand the intercellular signalling between cancer and stromal cells directly in PDAC tumours, we developed a multidimensional proteomic strategy called TMEPro. We applied TMEPro to profile the glycosylated secreted and plasma membrane proteome of 100 human pancreatic tissue samples to a great depth, define cell type origins and identify potential paracrine cross-talk, especially that mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation. Temporal dynamics during pancreatic tumour progression were investigated in a genetically engineered PDAC mouse model. Functionally, we revealed reciprocal signalling between stromal cells and cancer cells mediated by the stromal PDGFR–PTPN11–FOS signalling axis. Furthermore, we examined the generic shedding mechanism of plasma membrane proteins in PDAC tumours and revealed that matrix-metalloprotease-mediated shedding of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase ectodomain provides an additional dimension of intercellular signalling regulation in the PDAC TME. Importantly, the level of shed AXL has a potential correlation with lymph node metastasis, and inhibition of AXL shedding and its kinase activity showed a substantial synergistic effect in inhibiting cancer cell growth. In summary, we provide TMEPro, a generically applicable clinical functional proteomic strategy, and a comprehensive resource for better understanding the PDAC TME and facilitating the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic targets. TMEPro profiles the glycosylated secreted and plasma membrane proteome of 100 human pancreatic tissue samples, defines cell type origins and identifies potential paracrine cross-talk mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation.",

Advances in genomics and a surge in gastrointestinal diseases1,2 has fuelled efforts to catalogue cells constituting gastrointestinal tissues in health and disease3. Here we present systematic integration of 25 single-cell RNA sequencing datasets spanning the entire healthy gastrointestinal tract in development and in adulthood. We uniformly processed 385 samples from 189 healthy controls using a newly developed automated quality control approach (scAutoQC), leading to a healthy reference atlas with approximately 1.1 million cells and 136 fine-grained cell states. We anchor 12 gastrointestinal disease datasets spanning gastrointestinal cancers, coeliac disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease to this reference. Utilizing this 1.6 million cell resource (gutcellatlas.org), we discover epithelial cell metaplasia originating from stem cells in intestinal inflammatory diseases with transcriptional similarity to cells found in pyloric and Brunner’s glands. Although previously linked to mucosal healing4, we now implicate pyloric gland metaplastic cells in inflammation through recruitment of immune cells including T cells and neutrophils. Overall, we describe inflammation-induced changes in stem cells that alter mucosal tissue architecture and promote further inflammation, a concept applicable to other tissues and diseases. The study provides a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of the human gastrointestinal tract across the lifespan, highlighting inflammation-induced changes in epithelial stem cells that alter mucosal architecture and promote further inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The unusual properties of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have sparked considerable research interest1–13. However, despite the dedication of intensive experimental efforts and the proposal of several possible pairing mechanisms14–24, the origin of its superconductivity remains elusive. Here, by utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometre spatial resolution, we reveal flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG, where MATBG is unaligned with its hexagonal boron nitride substrate11. These replicas show uniform energy spacing, approximately 150 ± 15 meV apart, indicative of strong electron–boson coupling. Strikingly, these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems, either when MATBG is aligned to hexagonal boron nitride or when TBG deviates from the magic angle. Calculations suggest that the formation of these flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG are attributed to the strong coupling between flat-band electrons and an optical phonon mode at the graphene K point, facilitated by intervalley scattering. These findings, although they do not necessarily put electron–phonon coupling as the main driving force for the superconductivity in MATBG, unravel the electronic structure inherent in superconducting MATBG, thereby providing crucial information for understanding the unusual electronic landscape from which its superconductivity is derived. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of superconducting magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene reveals flat-band replicas that are indicative of strong electron–phonon coupling; these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene.",

    "abstract": "Less than 30% of people in Africa received a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine even 18 months after vaccine development1. Here, motivated by the observation that residents of remote, rural areas of Sierra Leone faced severe access difficulties2, we conducted an intervention with last-mile delivery of doses and health professionals to the most inaccessible areas, along with community mobilization. A cluster randomized controlled trial in 150 communities showed that this intervention with mobile vaccination teams increased the immunization rate by about 26 percentage points within 48–72 h. Moreover, auxiliary populations visited our community vaccination points, which more than doubled the number of inoculations administered. The additional people vaccinated per intervention site translated to an implementation cost of US $33 per person vaccinated. Transportation to reach remote villages accounted for a large share of total intervention costs. Therefore, bundling multiple maternal and child health interventions in the same visit would further reduce costs per person treated. Current research on vaccine delivery maintains a large focus on individual behavioural issues such as hesitancy. Our study demonstrates that prioritizing mobile services to overcome access difficulties faced by remote populations in developing countries can generate increased returns in terms of uptake of health services3. A cluster randomized controlled trial in Sierra Leone shows that targeting access to vaccines in remote areas increases uptake, an approach that can be used to improve vaccine equity in developing countries.",

    "abstract": "Trapped ions in radio-frequency traps are among the leading approaches for realizing quantum computers, because of high-fidelity quantum gates and long coherence times1–3. However, the use of radio-frequencies presents several challenges to scaling, including requiring compatibility of chips with high voltages4, managing power dissipation5 and restricting transport and placement of ions6. Here we realize a micro-fabricated Penning ion trap that removes these restrictions by replacing the radio-frequency field with a 3 T magnetic field. We demonstrate full quantum control of an ion in this setting, as well as the ability to transport the ion arbitrarily in the trapping plane above the chip. This unique feature of the Penning micro-trap approach opens up a modification of the quantum charge-coupled device architecture with improved connectivity and flexibility, facilitating the realization of large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing, quantum simulation and quantum sensing. A micro-fabricated Penning trap that operates at a 3 T magnetic field demonstrates full quantum control of an ion and the ability to transport the ion arbitrarily in the trapping plane above the chip.",

    "abstract": "Vocal learning in songbirds is thought to have evolved through sexual selection, with female preference driving males to develop large and varied song repertoires1–3. However, many songbird species learn only a single song in their lifetime4. How sexual selection drives the evolution of single-song repertoires is not known. Here, by applying dimensionality-reduction techniques to the singing behaviour of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), we show that syllable spread in low-dimensional feature space explains how single songs function as honest indicators of fitness. We find that this Gestalt measure of behaviour captures the spectrotemporal distinctiveness of song syllables in zebra finches; that females strongly prefer songs that occupy more latent space; and that matching path lengths in low-dimensional space is difficult for young males. Our findings clarify how simple vocal repertoires may have evolved in songbirds and indicate divergent strategies for how sexual selection can shape vocal learning. A detailed analysis of male song structure in zebra finches shows how females use particular features of songs as indicators of male quality in species that learn only one song.",

    "abstract": "The human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) detects fluctuations in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration and maintains Ca2+ homeostasis1,2. It also mediates diverse cellular processes not associated with Ca2+ balance3–5. The functional pleiotropy of CaSR arises in part from its ability to signal through several G-protein subtypes6. We determined structures of CaSR in complex with G proteins from three different subfamilies: Gq, Gi and Gs. We found that the homodimeric CaSR of each complex couples to a single G protein through a common mode. This involves the C-terminal helix of each Gα subunit binding to a shallow pocket that is formed in one CaSR subunit by all three intracellular loops (ICL1–ICL3), an extended transmembrane helix 3 and an ordered C-terminal region. G-protein binding expands the transmembrane dimer interface, which is further stabilized by phospholipid. The restraint imposed by the receptor dimer, in combination with ICL2, enables G-protein activation by facilitating conformational transition of Gα. We identified a single Gα residue that determines Gq and Gs versus Gi selectivity. The length and flexibility of ICL2 allows CaSR to bind all three Gα subtypes, thereby conferring capacity for promiscuous G-protein coupling. Structures of the human calcium-sensing receptor can be bound into complex with G proteins from three different Gα subtypes while maintaining G-protein-binding specificity.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria have adapted to phage predation by evolving a vast assortment of defence systems1. Although anti-phage immunity genes can be identified using bioinformatic tools, the discovery of novel systems is restricted to the available prokaryotic sequence data2. Here, to overcome this limitation, we infected Escherichia coli carrying a soil metagenomic DNA library3 with the lytic coliphage T4 to isolate clones carrying protective genes. Following this approach, we identified Brig1, a DNA glycosylase that excises α-glucosyl-hydroxymethylcytosine nucleobases from the bacteriophage T4 genome to generate abasic sites and inhibit viral replication. Brig1 homologues that provide immunity against T-even phages are present in multiple phage defence loci across distinct clades of bacteria. Our study highlights the benefits of screening unsequenced DNA and reveals prokaryotic DNA glycosylases as important players in the bacteria–phage arms race. A screen utilizing an environmental DNA library in Escherichia coli is used to identify Brig1, a previously unknown anti-phage defence system with homologues across distinct clades of bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The magnetic dynamo cycle of the Sun features a distinct pattern: a propagating region of sunspot emergence appears around 30° latitude and vanishes near the equator every 11 years (ref. 1). Moreover, longitudinal flows called torsional oscillations closely shadow sunspot migration, undoubtedly sharing a common cause2. Contrary to theories suggesting deep origins of these phenomena, helioseismology pinpoints low-latitude torsional oscillations to the outer 5–10% of the Sun, the near-surface shear layer3,4. Within this zone, inwardly increasing differential rotation coupled with a poloidal magnetic field strongly implicates the magneto-rotational instability5,6, prominent in accretion-disk theory and observed in laboratory experiments7. Together, these two facts prompt the general question: whether the solar dynamo is possibly a near-surface instability. Here we report strong affirmative evidence in stark contrast to traditional models8 focusing on the deeper tachocline. Simple analytic estimates show that the near-surface magneto-rotational instability better explains the spatiotemporal scales of the torsional oscillations and inferred subsurface magnetic field amplitudes9. State-of-the-art numerical simulations corroborate these estimates and reproduce hemispherical magnetic current helicity laws10. The dynamo resulting from a well-understood near-surface phenomenon improves prospects for accurate predictions of full magnetic cycles and space weather, affecting the electromagnetic infrastructure of Earth. Simple analytic estimates and detailed numerical calculations show that the solar dynamo begins near the surface, rather than at the much-deeper tachocline.",

    "abstract": "Haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for a broad range of haematological malignancies, but the standard of care relies on untargeted chemotherapies and limited possibilities to treat malignant cells after HSCT without affecting the transplanted healthy cells1. Antigen-specific cell-depleting therapies hold the promise of much more targeted elimination of diseased cells, as witnessed in the past decade by the revolution of clinical practice for B cell malignancies2. However, target selection is complex and limited to antigens expressed on subsets of haematopoietic cells, resulting in a fragmented therapy landscape with high development costs2–5. Here we demonstrate that an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) targeting the pan-haematopoietic marker CD45 enables the antigen-specific depletion of the entire haematopoietic system, including HSCs. Pairing this ADC with the transplantation of human HSCs engineered to be shielded from the CD45-targeting ADC enables the selective eradication of leukaemic cells with preserved haematopoiesis. The combination of CD45-targeting ADCs and engineered HSCs creates an almost universal strategy to replace a diseased haematopoietic system, irrespective of disease aetiology or originating cell type. We propose that this approach could have broad implications beyond haematological malignancies. An antibody–drug conjugate that targets the pan-haematopoietic marker CD45 combined with transplanted stem cells engineered to be shielded from it can eradicate leukaemic cells while preserving haematopoiesis.",

    "abstract": "The prime editor system composed of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 nickase (nSpCas9) and engineered Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT) collaborates with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) to facilitate a wide variety of precise genome edits in living cells1. However, owing to a lack of structural information, the molecular mechanism of pegRNA-guided reverse transcription by the prime editor remains poorly understood. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SpCas9–M-MLV RTΔRNaseH–pegRNA–target DNA complex in multiple states. The termination structure, along with our functional analysis, reveals that M-MLV RT extends reverse transcription beyond the expected site, resulting in scaffold-derived incorporations that cause undesired edits at the target loci. Furthermore, structural comparisons among the pre-initiation, initiation and elongation states show that M-MLV RT remains in a consistent position relative to SpCas9 during reverse transcription, whereas the pegRNA–synthesized DNA heteroduplex builds up along the surface of SpCas9. On the basis of our structural insights, we rationally engineered pegRNA variants and prime-editor variants in which M-MLV RT is fused within SpCas9. Collectively, our findings provide structural insights into the stepwise mechanism of prime editing, and will pave the way for the development of a versatile prime editing toolbox. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the prime editor bound to a prime editing guide RNA and target DNA, in the pre-initiation, initiation and elongation and termination states, provide insights into the mechanism by which prime editing occurs.",

    "abstract": "Mosaic loss of the X chromosome (mLOX) is the most common clonal somatic alteration in leukocytes of female individuals1,2, but little is known about its genetic determinants or phenotypic consequences. Here, to address this, we used data from 883,574 female participants across 8 biobanks; 12% of participants exhibited detectable mLOX in approximately 2% of leukocytes. Female participants with mLOX had an increased risk of myeloid and lymphoid leukaemias. Genetic analyses identified 56 common variants associated with mLOX, implicating genes with roles in chromosomal missegregation, cancer predisposition and autoimmune diseases. Exome-sequence analyses identified rare missense variants in FBXO10 that confer a twofold increased risk of mLOX. Only a small fraction of associations was shared with mosaic Y chromosome loss, suggesting that distinct biological processes drive formation and clonal expansion of sex chromosome missegregation. Allelic shift analyses identified X chromosome alleles that are preferentially retained in mLOX, demonstrating variation at many loci under cellular selection. A polygenic score including 44 allelic shift loci correctly inferred the retained X chromosomes in 80.7% of mLOX cases in the top decile. Our results support a model in which germline variants predispose female individuals to acquiring mLOX, with the allelic content of the X chromosome possibly shaping the magnitude of clonal expansion. A large-scale meta-analysis across eight biobank datasets identifies common genetic variants associated with mosaic loss of the X chromosome in female participants.",

    "abstract": "The ever increasing demands for greater sustainability and lower energy usage in chemical processes call for fundamentally new approaches and reactivity principles. In this context, the pronounced prevalence of odd-oxidation states in less precious metals bears untapped potential for fundamentally distinct reactivity modes via metalloradical catalysis1–3. Contrary to the well-established reactivity paradigm that organic free radicals, upon addition to a vinylcyclopropane, lead to rapid ring opening under strain release—a transformation that serves widely as a mechanistic probe (radical clock)4 for the intermediacy of radicals5—we herein show that a metal-based radical, that is, a Ni(I) metalloradical, triggers reversible cis/trans isomerization instead of opening. The isomerization proceeds under chiral inversion and, depending on the substitution pattern, occurs at room temperature in less than 5 min, requiring solely the addition of the non-precious catalyst. Our combined computational and experimental mechanistic studies support metalloradical catalysis as origin of this profound reactivity, rationalize the observed stereoinversion and reveal key reactivity features of the process, including its reversibility. These insights enabled the iterative thermodynamic enrichment of enantiopure cis/trans mixtures towards a single diastereomer through multiple Ni(I) catalysis rounds and also extensions to divinylcyclopropanes, which constitute strategic motifs in natural product- and total syntheses6. While the trans-isomer usually requires heating at approximately 200 °C to trigger thermal isomerization under racemization to cis-divinylcyclopropane, which then undergoes facile Cope-type rearrangement, the analogous contra-thermodynamic process is herein shown to proceed under Ni(I) metalloradical catalysis under mild conditions without any loss of stereochemical integrity, enabling a mild and stereochemically pure access to seven-membered rings, fused ring systems and spirocycles. A Ni(I) metalloradical catalyst enables reversible cis/trans-isomerization of vinylcyclopropanes under chiral inversion.",

    "abstract": "Tissue repair, immune defence and cancer progression rely on a vital cellular decision between quiescence and proliferation1,2. Mammalian cells proliferate by triggering a positive feedback mechanism3,4. The transcription factor E2F activates cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the E2F inhibitor protein retinoblastoma (Rb). This action further increases E2F activity to express genes needed for proliferation. Given that positive feedback can inadvertently amplify small signals, understanding how cells keep this positive feedback in check remains a puzzle. Here we measured E2F and CDK2 signal changes in single cells and found that the positive feedback mechanism engages only late in G1 phase. Cells spend variable and often extended times in a reversible state of intermediate E2F activity before committing to proliferate. This intermediate E2F activity is proportional to the amount of phosphorylation of a conserved T373 residue in Rb that is mediated by CDK2 or CDK4/CDK6. Such T373-phosphorylated Rb remains bound on chromatin but dissociates from it once Rb is hyperphosphorylated at many sites, which fully activates E2F. The preferential initial phosphorylation of T373 can be explained by its relatively slower rate of dephosphorylation. Together, our study identifies a primed state of intermediate E2F activation whereby cells sense external and internal signals and decide whether to reverse and exit to quiescence or trigger the positive feedback mechanism that initiates cell proliferation. Cells actively sense external and internal signals to stay quiescent or proliferate, and this trigger relies on being in a reversible primed G1 state of partial retinoblastoma inactivation and E2F activation.",

    "abstract": "One-dimensional (1D) interacting electrons are often described as a Luttinger liquid1–4 having properties that are intrinsically different from those of Fermi liquids in higher dimensions5,6. In materials systems, 1D electrons exhibit exotic quantum phenomena that can be tuned by both intra- and inter-1D-chain electronic interactions, but their experimental characterization can be challenging. Here we demonstrate that layer-stacking domain walls (DWs) in van der Waals heterostructures form a broadly tunable Luttinger liquid system, including both isolated and coupled arrays. We have imaged the evolution of DW Luttinger liquids under different interaction regimes tuned by electron density using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Single DWs at low carrier density are highly susceptible to Wigner crystallization consistent with a spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid, whereas at intermediate densities dimerized Wigner crystals form because of an enhanced magneto-elastic coupling. Periodic arrays of DWs exhibit an interplay between intra- and inter-chain interactions that gives rise to new quantum phases. At low electron densities, inter-chain interactions are dominant and induce a 2D electron crystal composed of phased-locked 1D Wigner crystal in a staggered configuration. Increased electron density causes intra-chain fluctuation potentials to dominate, leading to an electronic smectic liquid crystal phase in which electrons are ordered with algebraical correlation decay along the chain direction but disordered between chains. Our work shows that layer-stacking DWs in 2D heterostructures provides opportunities to explore Luttinger liquid physics. Layer-stacking domain walls in van der Waals heterostructures form a broadly tunable Luttinger liquid system, including both isolated and coupled arrays.",

    "abstract": "The execution of goal-oriented behaviours requires a spatially coherent alignment between sensory and motor maps. The current model for sensorimotor transformation in the superior colliculus relies on the topographic mapping of static spatial receptive fields onto movement endpoints1–6. Here, to experimentally assess the validity of this canonical static model of alignment, we dissected the visuo-motor network in the superior colliculus and performed in vivo intracellular and extracellular recordings across layers, in restrained and unrestrained conditions, to assess both the motor and the visual tuning of individual motor and premotor neurons. We found that collicular motor units have poorly defined visual static spatial receptive fields and respond instead to kinetic visual features, revealing the existence of a direct alignment in vectorial space between sensory and movement vectors, rather than between spatial receptive fields and movement endpoints as canonically hypothesized. We show that a neural network built according to these kinetic alignment principles is ideally placed to sustain ethological behaviours such as the rapid interception of moving and static targets. These findings reveal a novel dimension of the sensorimotor alignment process. By extending the alignment from the static to the kinetic domain this work provides a novel conceptual framework for understanding the nature of sensorimotor convergence and its relevance in guiding goal-directed behaviours. Motor units in the superior colliculus of mice exhibit poorly defined representation of static visual fields and instead rely largely on kinetic visual features to link visual inputs to behavioural outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the gut microbiome have pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after allogenic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT)1–6. However, effective methods for safely resolving gut dysbiosis have not yet been established. An expansion of the pathogen Enterococcus faecalis in the intestine, associated with dysbiosis, has been shown to be a risk factor for aGVHD7–10. Here we analyse the intestinal microbiome of patients with allo-HCT, and find that E. faecalis escapes elimination and proliferates in the intestine by forming biofilms, rather than by acquiring drug-resistance genes. We isolated cytolysin-positive highly pathogenic E. faecalis from faecal samples and identified an anti-E. faecalis enzyme derived from E. faecalis-specific bacteriophages by analysing bacterial whole-genome sequencing data. The antibacterial enzyme had lytic activity against the biofilm of E. faecalis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, in aGVHD-induced gnotobiotic mice that were colonized with E. faecalis or with patient faecal samples characterized by the domination of Enterococcus, levels of intestinal cytolysin-positive E. faecalis were decreased and survival was significantly increased in the group that was treated with the E. faecalis-specific enzyme, compared with controls. Thus, administration of a phage-derived antibacterial enzyme that is specific to biofilm-forming pathogenic E. faecalis—which is difficult to eliminate with existing antibiotics—might provide an approach to protect against aGVHD. An analysis of the intestinal microbiome of people who have undergone allogenic haematopoietic cell transplantation shows that an enzyme derived from a bacteriophage has specific antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, and suppresses E. faecalis-associated graft-versus-host disease.",

    "abstract": "Logged and disturbed forests are often viewed as degraded and depauperate environments compared with primary forest. However, they are dynamic ecosystems1 that provide refugia for large amounts of biodiversity2,3, so we cannot afford to underestimate their conservation value4. Here we present empirically defined thresholds for categorizing the conservation value of logged forests, using one of the most comprehensive assessments of taxon responses to habitat degradation in any tropical forest environment. We analysed the impact of logging intensity on the individual occurrence patterns of 1,681 taxa belonging to 86 taxonomic orders and 126 functional groups in Sabah, Malaysia. Our results demonstrate the existence of two conservation-relevant thresholds. First, lightly logged forests (<29% biomass removal) retain high conservation value and a largely intact functional composition, and are therefore likely to recover their pre-logging values if allowed to undergo natural regeneration. Second, the most extreme impacts occur in heavily degraded forests with more than two-thirds (>68%) of their biomass removed, and these are likely to require more expensive measures to recover their biodiversity value. Overall, our data confirm that primary forests are irreplaceable5, but they also reinforce the message that logged forests retain considerable conservation value that should not be overlooked. An analysis of the impact of logging intensity on biodiversity in tropical forests in Sabah, Malaysia, identifies a threshold of tree biomass removal below which logged forests still have conservation value.",

    "abstract": "In dynamic environments, animals make behavioural decisions on the basis of the innate valences of sensory cues and information learnt about these cues across multiple timescales1–3. However, it remains unclear how the innate valence of a sensory stimulus affects the acquisition of learnt valence information and subsequent memory dynamics. Here we show that in the Drosophila brain, interconnected short- and long-term memory units of the mushroom body jointly regulate memory through dopamine signals that encode innate and learnt sensory valences. By performing time-lapse in vivo voltage-imaging studies of neural spiking in more than 500 flies undergoing olfactory associative conditioning, we found that protocerebral posterior lateral 1 dopamine neurons (PPL1-DANs)4 heterogeneously and bidirectionally encode innate and learnt valences of punishment, reward and odour cues. During learning, these valence signals regulate memory storage and extinction in mushroom body output neurons (MBONs)5. During initial conditioning bouts, PPL1-γ1pedc and PPL1-γ2α′1 neurons control short-term memory formation, which weakens inhibitory feedback from MBON-γ1pedc>α/β to PPL1-α′2α2 and PPL1-α3. During further conditioning, this diminished feedback allows these two PPL1-DANs to encode the net innate plus learnt valence of the conditioned odour cue, which gates long-term memory formation. A computational model constrained by the fly connectome6,7 and our spiking data explains how dopamine signals mediate the circuit interactions between short- and long-term memory traces, yielding predictions that our experiments confirmed. Overall, the mushroom body achieves flexible learning through the integration of innate and learnt valences in parallel learning units sharing feedback interconnections. This hybrid physiological–anatomical mechanism may be a general means by which dopamine regulates memory dynamics in other species and brain structures, including the vertebrate basal ganglia. In the brain of fruit flies, the mushroom body achieves flexible learning by using interconnected short- and long-term memory units for dopamine-mediated integration of innate valences with learnt valences obtained through experience.",

Its reuptake from the synaptic cleft heavily relies on the noradrenaline transporter (NET) located in the presynaptic membrane2. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human NET in both its apo state and when bound to substrates or antidepressant drugs, with resolutions ranging from 2.5 Å to 3.5 Å. The two substrates, noradrenaline and dopamine, display a similar binding mode within the central substrate binding site (S1) and within a newly identified extracellular allosteric site (S2). Four distinct antidepressants, namely, atomoxetine, desipramine, bupropion and escitalopram, occupy the S1 site to obstruct substrate transport in distinct conformations. Moreover, a potassium ion was observed within sodium-binding site 1 in the structure of the NET bound to desipramine under the KCl condition. Complemented by structural-guided biochemical analyses, our studies reveal the mechanism of substrate recognition, the alternating access of NET, and elucidate the mode of action of the four antidepressants. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human noradrenaline transporter in both the apo state and bound to substrates or antidepressant drugs are resolved.",

However, the mechanisms underpinning XPR1-mediated Pi efflux and regulation by the intracellular inositol polyphosphate (InsPP) sensor SPX domain remain poorly understood. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human XPR1 in Pi-bound closed, open and InsP6-bound forms, revealing the structural basis for XPR1 gating and regulation by InsPPs. XPR1 consists of an N-terminal SPX domain, a dimer-formation core domain and a Pi transport domain. Within the transport domain, three basic clusters are responsible for Pi binding and transport, and a conserved W573 acts as a molecular switch for gating. In addition, the SPX domain binds to InsP6 and facilitates Pi efflux by liberating the C-terminal loop that limits Pi entry. This study provides a conceptual framework for the mechanistic understanding of Pi homeostasis by XPR1 homologues in fungi, plants and animals. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of human XPR1 in different bound forms reveal the structural basis for XPR1 gating and regulation by inositol polyphosphates.",

    "abstract": "Photoenzymes are light-powered biocatalysts that typically rely on the excitation of cofactors or unnatural amino acids for their catalytic activities1,2. A notable natural example is the fatty acid photodecarboxylase, which uses light energy to convert aliphatic carboxylic acids to achiral hydrocarbons3. Here we report a method for the design of a non-natural photodecarboxylase based on the excitation of enzyme-bound catalytic intermediates, rather than reliance on cofactor excitation4. Iminium ions5, transiently generated from enals within the active site of an engineered class I aldolase6, can absorb violet light and function as single-electron oxidants. Activation of chiral carboxylic acids, followed by decarboxylation, generates two radicals that undergo stereospecific cross-coupling, yielding products with two stereocentres. Using the appropriate enantiopure chiral substrate, the desired diastereoisomeric product is selectively obtained with complete enantiocontrol. This finding underscores the ability of the active site to transfer stereochemical information from the chiral radical precursor into the product, effectively addressing the long-standing problem of rapid racemization of chiral radicals. The resulting ‘memory of chirality’ scenario7 is a rarity in enantioselective radical chemistry. We report a method for the design of a non-natural photodecarboxylase based on the excitation of enzyme-bound catalytic intermediates, rather than reliance on cofactor excitation.",

    "abstract": "Materials with hierarchical architectures that combine soft and hard material domains with coalesced interfaces possess superior properties compared with their homogeneous counterparts1–4. These architectures in synthetic materials have been achieved through deterministic manufacturing strategies such as 3D printing, which require an a priori design and active intervention throughout the process to achieve architectures spanning multiple length scales5–9. Here we harness frontal polymerization spin mode dynamics to autonomously fabricate patterned crystalline domains in poly(cyclooctadiene) with multiscale organization. This rapid, dissipative processing method leads to the formation of amorphous and semi-crystalline domains emerging from the internal interfaces generated between the solid polymer and the propagating cure front. The size, spacing and arrangement of the domains are controlled by the interplay between the reaction kinetics, thermochemistry and boundary conditions. Small perturbations in the fabrication conditions reproducibly lead to remarkable changes in the patterned microstructure and the resulting strength, elastic modulus and toughness of the polymer. This ability to control mechanical properties and performance solely through the initial conditions and the mode of front propagation represents a marked advancement in the design and manufacturing of advanced multiscale materials. Frontal polymerization spin mode dynamics is used to autonomously fabricate patterned crystalline domains in poly(cyclooctadiene) with multiscale organization.",

    "abstract": "Metallurgical production traditionally involves three steps: extracting metals from ores, mixing them into alloys by liquid processing and thermomechanical processing to achieve the desired microstructures1,2. This sequential approach, practised since the Bronze Age, reaches its limit today because of the urgent demand for a sustainable economy2–5: almost 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are because of the use of fossil reductants and high-temperature metallurgical processing. Here we present a H2-based redox synthesis and compaction approach that reforms traditional alloy-making by merging metal extraction, alloying and thermomechanical processing into one single solid-state operation. We propose a thermodynamically informed guideline and a general kinetic conception to dissolve the classical boundaries between extractive and physical metallurgy, unlocking tremendous sustainable bulk alloy design opportunities. We exemplify this approach for the case of Fe–Ni invar bulk alloys6,7, one of the most appealing ferrous materials but the dirtiest to produce: invar shows uniquely low thermal expansion6,8,9, enabling key applications spanning from precision instruments to cryogenic components10–13. Yet, it is notoriously eco-unfriendly, with Ni causing more than 10 times higher CO2 emission than Fe per kilogram production2,14, qualifying this alloy class as a perfect demonstrator case. Our sustainable method turns oxides directly into green alloys in bulk forms, with application-worthy properties, all obtained at temperatures far below the bulk melting point, while maintaining a zero CO2 footprint. A one-step hydrogen-based redox process turns oxides directly into green alloys in bulk forms, with application-worthy properties.",

    "abstract": "Climate models indicate that dry extremes will be exacerbated in many regions of the world1,2. However, confidence in the magnitude and timing of these projected changes remains low3,4, leaving societies largely unprepared5,6. Here we show that constraining model projections with observations using a newly proposed emergent constraint (EC) reduces the uncertainty in predictions of a core drought indicator, the longest annual dry spell (LAD), by 10–26% globally. Our EC-corrected projections reveal that the increase in LAD will be 42–44% greater, on average, than ‘mid-range’ or ‘high-end’ future forcing scenarios currently indicate. These results imply that by the end of this century, the global mean land-only LAD could be 10 days longer than currently expected. Using two generations of climate models, we further uncover global regions for which historical LAD biases affect the magnitude of projected LAD increases, and we explore the role of land–atmosphere feedbacks therein. Our findings reveal regions with potentially higher- and earlier-than-expected drought risks for societies and ecosystems, and they point to possible mechanisms underlying the biases in the current generation of climate models. A newly identified emergent constraint applied to a key drought metric reduces uncertainty in future predictions of the longest annual dry spells, revealing that their increase due to climate change will be 40–50% greater than climate models project at present.",

    "abstract": "Covalent bonds share electron pairs between two atoms and make up the skeletons of most organic compounds in single, double and triple bonds. In contrast, examples of one-electron bonds remain scarce, most probably due to their intrinsic weakness1–4. Although several pioneering studies have reported one-electron bonds between heteroatoms, direct evidence for one-electron bonds between carbon atoms remains elusive. Here we report the isolation of a compound with a one-electron σ-bond between carbon atoms by means of the one-electron oxidation of a hydrocarbon with an elongated C–C single bond5,6. The presence of the C•C one-electron σ-bond (2.921(3) Å at 100 K) was confirmed experimentally by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy, and theoretically by density functional theory calculations. The results of this paper unequivocally demonstrate the existence of a C•C one-electron σ-bond, which was postulated nearly a century ago7, and can thus be expected to pave the way for further development in different areas of chemistry by probing the boundary between bonded and non-bonded states. The one-electron oxidation of a hydrocarbon with an elongated C–C single bond provides direct evidence for a one-electron σ-bond between carbon atoms.",

    "abstract": "Unlike non-polar semiconductors such as silicon, the broken inversion symmetry of the wide-bandgap semiconductor gallium nitride (GaN) leads to a large electronic polarization along a unique crystal axis1. This makes the two surfaces of the semiconductor wafer perpendicular to the polar axis substantially different in their physical and chemical properties2. In the past three decades, the cation (gallium) face of GaN has been used for photonic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers3–5. Although the cation face has also been predominantly used for electronic devices, the anion (nitrogen) face has recently shown promise for high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) owing to favourable polarization discontinuities6. In this work, we introduce dualtronics, showing that it is possible to make photonic devices on the cation face and electronic devices on the anion face of the same semiconductor wafer. This opens the possibility for making use of both faces of polar semiconductors in a single structure, in which electronic, photonic and acoustic properties can be implemented on opposite faces of the same wafer, markedly enhancing the functional capabilities of this revolutionary semiconductor family. A new approach is described for fabricating devices on each of the faces of the same gallium nitride semiconductor wafer, using the cation face for photonic devices and the anion face for electronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Allergic diseases affect more than a quarter of individuals in industrialized countries, and are a major public health concern1,2. The high-affinity Fc receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcεRI), which is mainly present on mast cells and basophils, has a crucial role in allergic diseases3–5. Monomeric immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding to FcεRI regulates mast cell survival, differentiation and maturation6–8. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that prior to IgE binding, FcεRI exists mostly as a homodimer on human mast cell membranes. The structure of human FcεRI confirms the dimeric organization, with each promoter comprising one α subunit, one β subunit and two γ subunits. The transmembrane helices of the α subunits form a layered arrangement with those of the γ and β subunits. The dimeric interface is mediated by a four-helix bundle of the α and γ subunits at the intracellular juxtamembrane region. Cholesterol-like molecules embedded within the transmembrane domain may stabilize the dimeric assembly. Upon IgE binding, the dimeric FcεRI dissociates into two protomers, each of which binds to an IgE molecule. This process elicits transcriptional activation of Egr1, Egr3 and Ccl2 in rat basophils, which can be attenuated by inhibiting the FcεRI dimer-to-monomer transition. Collectively, our study reveals the mechanism of antigen-independent, IgE-mediated FcεRI activation. Biochemical and structural studies of the Fc immunoglobulin E receptor show that it exists as a homodimer on mast cell membranes, but dissociates upon IgE binding, exposing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs that enable downstream effector activation.",

    "abstract": "The ionosphere is a layer of weakly ionized plasma bathed in Earth’s geomagnetic field extending about 50–1,500 kilometres above Earth1. The ionospheric total electron content varies in response to Earth’s space environment, interfering with Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) signals, resulting in one of the largest sources of error for position, navigation and timing services2. Networks of high-quality ground-based GNSS stations provide maps of ionospheric total electron content to correct these errors, but large spatiotemporal gaps in data from these stations mean that these maps may contain errors3. Here we demonstrate that a distributed network of noisy sensors—in the form of millions of Android phones—can fill in many of these gaps and double the measurement coverage, providing an accurate picture of the ionosphere in areas of the world underserved by conventional infrastructure. Using smartphone measurements, we resolve features such as plasma bubbles over India and South America, solar-storm-enhanced density over North America and a mid-latitude ionospheric trough over Europe. We also show that the resulting ionosphere maps can improve location accuracy, which is our primary aim. This work demonstrates the potential of using a large distributed network of smartphones as a powerful scientific instrument for monitoring Earth. Data from millions of smartphones are used to map the ionosphere in greater detail, leading to improved smartphone location accuracy, particularly in parts of the world with few monitoring stations.",

    "abstract": "The combination of decreasing food intake and increasing energy expenditure represents a powerful strategy for counteracting cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes1. Yet current pharmacological approaches require conjugation of multiple receptor agonists to achieve both effects2–4, and so far, no safe energy-expending option has reached the clinic. Here we show that activation of neurokinin 2 receptor (NK2R) is sufficient to suppress appetite centrally and increase energy expenditure peripherally. We focused on NK2R after revealing its genetic links to obesity and glucose control. However, therapeutically exploiting NK2R signalling has previously been unattainable because its endogenous ligand, neurokinin A, is short-lived and lacks receptor specificity5,6. Therefore, we developed selective, long-acting NK2R agonists with potential for once-weekly administration in humans. In mice, these agonists elicit weight loss by inducing energy expenditure and non-aversive appetite suppression that circumvents canonical leptin signalling. Additionally, a hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp reveals that NK2R agonism acutely enhances insulin sensitization. In diabetic, obese macaques, NK2R activation significantly decreases body weight, blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol, and ameliorates insulin resistance. These findings identify a single receptor target that leverages both energy-expending and appetite-suppressing programmes to improve energy homeostasis and reverse cardiometabolic dysfunction across species. In mouse and nonhuman primate models, treatment with selective, long-acting neurokinin 2 receptor agonists aids weight loss by suppressing appetite and increasing energy expenditure, as well as by increasing insulin sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins can bind via the formation of highly disordered protein complexes without the formation of three-dimensional structure1. Most naturally occurring proteins are levorotatory (l)—that is, made up only of l-amino acids—imprinting molecular structure and communication with stereochemistry2. By contrast, their mirror-image dextrorotatory (d)-amino acids are rare in nature. Whether disordered protein complexes are truly independent of chiral constraints is not clear. Here, to investigate the chiral constraints of disordered protein–protein interactions, we chose as representative examples a set of five interacting protein pairs covering the disorder–order continuum. By observing the natural ligands and their stereochemical mirror images in free and bound states, we found that chirality was inconsequential in a fully disordered complex. However, if the interaction relied on the ligand undergoing extensive coupled folding and binding, correct stereochemistry was essential. Between these extremes, binding could be observed for the d-ligand with a strength that correlated with disorder in the final complex. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the molecular processes that lead to complex formation, the use of d-peptides in drug discovery and the chemistry of protein evolution of the first living entities on Earth. Studies on protein–protein interactions using proteins containing d- or l-amino acids show that stereoselectivity of binding varies with the degree of disorder within the complex.",

    "abstract": "Brain-wide association studies (BWAS) are a fundamental tool in discovering brain–behaviour associations1,2. Several recent studies have shown that thousands of study participants are required for good replicability of BWAS1–3. Here we performed analyses and meta-analyses of a robust effect size index using 63 longitudinal and cross-sectional MRI studies from the Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium4 (77,695 total scans) to demonstrate that optimizing study design is critical for increasing standardized effect sizes and replicability in BWAS. A meta-analysis of brain volume associations with age indicates that BWAS with larger variability of the covariate and longitudinal studies have larger reported standardized effect size. Analysing age effects on global and regional brain measures from the UK Biobank and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we showed that modifying study design through sampling schemes improves standardized effect sizes and replicability. To ensure that our results are generalizable, we further evaluated the longitudinal sampling schemes on cognitive, psychopathology and demographic associations with structural and functional brain outcome measures in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development dataset. We demonstrated that commonly used longitudinal models, which assume equal between-subject and within-subject changes can, counterintuitively, reduce standardized effect sizes and replicability. Explicitly modelling the between-subject and within-subject effects avoids conflating them and enables optimizing the standardized effect sizes for each separately. Together, these results provide guidance for study designs that improve the replicability of BWAS. Optimizing study design is critical for increasing standardized effect sizes and replicability, and the features that increase replicability in cross-sectional and longitudinal brain-wide association studies are explored.",

    "abstract": "Fructose consumption has increased considerably over the past five decades, largely due to the widespread use of high-fructose corn syrup as a sweetener1. It has been proposed that fructose promotes the growth of some tumours directly by serving as a fuel2,3. Here we show that fructose supplementation enhances tumour growth in animal models of melanoma, breast cancer and cervical cancer without causing weight gain or insulin resistance. The cancer cells themselves were unable to use fructose readily as a nutrient because they did not express ketohexokinase-C (KHK-C). Primary hepatocytes did express KHK-C, resulting in fructolysis and the excretion of a variety of lipid species, including lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). In co-culture experiments, hepatocyte-derived LPCs were consumed by cancer cells and used to generate phosphatidylcholines, the major phospholipid of cell membranes. In vivo, supplementation with high-fructose corn syrup increased several LPC species by more than sevenfold in the serum. Administration of LPCs to mice was sufficient to increase tumour growth. Pharmacological inhibition of ketohexokinase had no direct effect on cancer cells, but it decreased circulating LPC levels and prevented fructose-mediated tumour growth in vivo. These findings reveal that fructose supplementation increases circulating nutrients such as LPCs, which can enhance tumour growth through a cell non-autonomous mechanism. Dietary fructose enhances tumour growth in animal models of melanoma, breast cancer and cervical cancer indirectly via metabolite transfer.",

    "abstract": "The most distant galaxies detected were seen when the Universe was a scant 5% of its current age. At these times, progenitors of galaxies such as the Milky Way were about 10,000 times less massive. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) combined with magnification from gravitational lensing, these low-mass galaxies can not only be detected but also be studied in detail. Here we present JWST observations of a strongly lensed galaxy at zspec = 8.296 ± 0.001, showing massive star clusters (the Firefly Sparkle) cocooned in a diffuse arc in the Canadian Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS)1. The Firefly Sparkle exhibits traits of a young, gas-rich galaxy in its early formation stage. The mass of the galaxy is concentrated in 10 star clusters (49–57% of total mass), with individual masses ranging from 105M⊙ to 106M⊙. These unresolved clusters have high surface densities (>103M⊙ pc−2), exceeding those of Milky Way globular clusters and young star clusters in nearby galaxies. The central cluster shows a nebular-dominated spectrum, low metallicity, high gas density and high electron temperature, hinting at a top-heavy initial mass function. These observations provide our first spectrophotometric view of a typical galaxy in its early stages, in a 600-million-year-old Universe.

    "abstract": "Io experiences tidal deformation as a result of its eccentric orbit around Jupiter, which provides a primary energy source for Io’s continuing volcanic activity and infrared emission1. The amount of tidal energy dissipated within Io is enormous and has been suggested to support the large-scale melting of its interior and the formation of a global subsurface magma ocean. If Io has a shallow global magma ocean, its tidal deformation would be much larger than in the case of a more rigid, mostly solid interior2. Here we report the measurement of Io’s tidal deformation, quantified by the gravitational tidal Love number k2, enabled by two recent flybys of the Juno spacecraft. By combining Juno3,4 and Galileo5–7 Doppler data from the NASA Deep Space Network and astrometric observations, we recover Re(k2) of 0.125 ± 0.047 (1σ) and the tidal dissipation parameter Q of 11.4 ± 3.6 (1σ). These measurements confirm that a shallow global magma ocean in Io does not exist and are consistent with Io having a mostly solid mantle2. Our results indicate that tidal forces do not universally create global magma oceans, which may be prevented from forming owing to rapid melt ascent, intrusion and eruption8,9, so even strong tidal heating—such as that expected on several known exoplanets and super-Earths10—may not guarantee the formation of magma oceans on moons or planetary bodies. By measuring the tidal deformation of Io as it orbits Jupiter using Juno Doppler and historically available data, the hypothesis of a shallow global magma ocean in Io is shown to be false.",

    "abstract": "Ultracold polyatomic molecules offer opportunities1 in cold chemistry2,3, precision measurements4 and quantum information processing5,6, because of their rich internal structure. However, their increased complexity compared with diatomic molecules presents a challenge in using conventional cooling techniques. Here we demonstrate an approach to create weakly bound ultracold polyatomic molecules by electroassociation7 (F.D. et al., manuscript in preparation) in a degenerate Fermi gas of microwave-dressed polar molecules through a field-linked resonance8–11. Starting from ground-state NaK molecules, we create around 1.1 × 103 weakly bound tetratomic (NaK)2 molecules, with a phase space density of 0.040(3) at a temperature of 134(3) nK, more than 3,000 times colder than previously realized tetratomic molecules12. We observe a maximum tetramer lifetime of 8(2) ms in free space without a notable change in the presence of an optical dipole trap, indicating that these tetramers are collisionally stable. Moreover, we directly image the dissociated tetramers through microwave-field modulation to probe the anisotropy of their wavefunction in momentum space. Our result demonstrates a universal tool for assembling weakly bound ultracold polyatomic molecules from smaller polar molecules, which is a crucial step towards Bose–Einstein condensation of polyatomic molecules and towards a new crossover from a dipolar Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer superfluid13–15 to a Bose–Einstein condensation of tetramers. Moreover, the long-lived field-linked state provides an ideal starting point for deterministic optical transfer to deeply bound tetramer states16–18. Ultracold polyatomic molecules can be created by electroassociation in a degenerate Fermi gas of microwave-dressed polar molecules through a field-linked resonance.",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis is a major energy-consuming process of the cell that requires the controlled production1–3 and turnover4,5 of ribosomes. Although the past few years have seen major advances in our understanding of ribosome biogenesis, structural insight into the degradation of ribosomes has been lacking. Here we present native structures of two distinct small ribosomal 30S subunit degradation intermediates associated with the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease ribonuclease R (RNase R). The structures reveal that RNase R binds at first to the 30S platform to facilitate the degradation of the functionally important anti-Shine–Dalgarno sequence and the decoding-site helix 44. RNase R then encounters a roadblock when it reaches the neck region of the 30S subunit, and this is overcome by a major structural rearrangement of the 30S head, involving the loss of ribosomal proteins. RNase R parallels this movement and relocates to the decoding site by using its N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain as an anchor. In vitro degradation assays suggest that head rearrangement poses a major kinetic barrier for RNase R, but also indicate that the enzyme alone is sufficient for complete degradation of 30S subunits. Collectively, our results provide a mechanistic basis for the degradation of 30S mediated by RNase R, and reveal that RNase R targets orphaned 30S subunits using a dynamic mechanism involving an anchored switching of binding sites. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of intermediates formed during the degradation of the 30S ribosomal unit shed light on how the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease ribonuclease R controls the ribosomal degradation process.",

    "abstract": "Our Sun lies within 300 parsecs of the 2.7-kiloparsecs-long sinusoidal chain of dense gas clouds known as the Radcliffe Wave1. The structure’s wave-like shape was discovered using three-dimensional dust mapping, but initial kinematic searches for oscillatory motion were inconclusive2–7. Here we present evidence that the Radcliffe Wave is oscillating through the Galactic plane while also drifting radially away from the Galactic Centre. We use measurements of line-of-sight velocity8 for 12CO and three-dimensional velocities of young stellar clusters to show that the most massive star-forming regions spatially associated with the Radcliffe Wave (including Orion, Cepheus, North America and Cygnus X) move as though they are part of an oscillating wave driven by the gravitational acceleration of the Galactic potential. By treating the Radcliffe Wave as a coherently oscillating structure, we can derive its motion independently of the local Galactic mass distribution, and directly measure local properties of the Galactic potential as well as the Sun’s vertical oscillation period. In addition, the measured drift of the Radcliffe Wave radially outwards from the Galactic Centre suggests that the cluster whose supernovae ultimately created today’s expanding Local Bubble9 may have been born in the Radcliffe Wave. Spatial and kinematic analysis of the solar neighbourhood shows that the Radcliffe Wave, a wave-shaped chain of star-forming gas clouds, is oscillating through the Galactic plane while also drifting radially away from the Galactic Centre.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive transcriptional activity is observed across diverse species. The genomes of extant organisms have undergone billions of years of evolution, making it unclear whether these genomic activities represent effects of selection or ‘noise’1–4. Characterizing default genome states could help understand whether pervasive transcriptional activity has biological meaning. Here we addressed this question by introducing a synthetic 101-kb locus into the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Mus musculus and characterizing genomic activity. The locus was designed by reversing but not complementing human HPRT1, including its flanking regions, thus retaining basic features of the natural sequence but ablating evolved coding or regulatory information. We observed widespread activity of both reversed and native HPRT1 loci in yeast, despite the lack of evolved yeast promoters. By contrast, the reversed locus displayed no activity at all in mouse embryonic stem cells, and instead exhibited repressive chromatin signatures. The repressive signature was alleviated in a locus variant lacking CpG dinucleotides; nevertheless, this variant was also transcriptionally inactive. These results show that synthetic genomic sequences that lack coding information are active in yeast, but inactive in mouse embryonic stem cells, consistent with a major difference in ‘default genomic states’ between these two divergent eukaryotic cell types, with implications for understanding pervasive transcription, horizontal transfer of genetic information and the birth of new genes. Introduction of a long synthetic DNA into yeast genomic loci results in high default transcriptional activity in yeast but low activity in mouse, suggesting distinct default levels of genomic activity in these organisms.",

Although Korolevo’s importance to the European Palaeolithic is widely acknowledged, age constraints on the lowermost lithic artefacts have yet to be determined conclusively. Here, using two methods of burial dating with cosmogenic nuclides4,5, we report ages of 1.42 ± 0.10 million years and 1.42 ± 0.28 million years for the sedimentary unit that contains Mode-1-type lithic artefacts. Korolevo represents, to our knowledge, the earliest securely dated hominin presence in Europe, and bridges the spatial and temporal gap between the Caucasus (around 1.85–1.78 million years ago)6 and southwestern Europe (around 1.2–1.1 million years ago)7,8. Our findings advance the hypothesis that Europe was colonized from the east, and our analysis of habitat suitability9 suggests that early hominins exploited warm interglacial periods to disperse into higher latitudes and relatively continental sites—such as Korolevo—well before the Middle Pleistocene Transition. Burial-dating methods using cosmogenic nuclides indicate that the oldest stone tools at Korolevo archaeological site in western Ukraine date to around 1.4 million years ago, providing evidence of early human dispersal into Europe from the east.",

    "abstract": "Animals in the natural world constantly encounter geometrically complex landscapes. Successful navigation requires that they understand geometric features of these landscapes, including boundaries, landmarks, corners and curved areas, all of which collectively define the geometry of the environment1–12. Crucial to the reconstruction of the geometric layout of natural environments are concave and convex features, such as corners and protrusions. However, the neural substrates that could underlie the perception of concavity and convexity in the environment remain elusive. Here we show that the dorsal subiculum contains neurons that encode corners across environmental geometries in an allocentric reference frame. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in freely behaving mice, we find that corner cells tune their activity to reflect the geometric properties of corners, including corner angles, wall height and the degree of wall intersection. A separate population of subicular neurons encode convex corners of both larger environments and discrete objects. Both corner cells are non-overlapping with the population of subicular neurons that encode environmental boundaries. Furthermore, corner cells that encode concave or convex corners generalize their activity such that they respond, respectively, to concave or convex curvatures within an environment. Together, our findings suggest that the subiculum contains the geometric information needed to reconstruct the shape and layout of naturalistic spatial environments. Longitudinal calcium imaging reveals the ability of corner cells to synchronize their activity with the environment, with the results implying the potential of the subiculum to contain the information required to reconstruct spatial environments.",

    "abstract": "During development, inflammation or tissue injury, macrophages may successively engulf and process multiple apoptotic corpses via efferocytosis to achieve tissue homeostasis1. How macrophages may rapidly adapt their transcription to achieve continuous corpse uptake is incompletely understood. Transcriptional pause/release is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, in which RNA polymerase (Pol) II initiates transcription for 20–60 nucleotides, is paused for minutes to hours and is then released to make full-length mRNA2. Here we show that macrophages, within minutes of corpse encounter, use transcriptional pause/release to unleash a rapid transcriptional response. For human and mouse macrophages, the Pol II pause/release was required for continuous efferocytosis in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, blocking Pol II pause/release did not impede Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, yeast uptake or bacterial phagocytosis. Integration of data from three genomic approaches—precision nuclear run-on sequencing, RNA sequencing, and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)—on efferocytic macrophages at different time points revealed that Pol II pause/release controls expression of select transcription factors and downstream target genes. Mechanistic studies on transcription factor EGR3, prominently regulated by pause/release, uncovered EGR3-related reprogramming of other macrophage genes involved in cytoskeleton and corpse processing. Using lysosomal probes and a new genetic fluorescent reporter, we identify a role for pause/release in phagosome acidification during efferocytosis. Furthermore, microglia from egr3-deficient zebrafish embryos displayed reduced phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons and fewer maturing phagosomes, supporting defective corpse processing. Collectively, these data indicate that macrophages use Pol II pause/release as a mechanism to rapidly alter their transcriptional programs for efficient processing of the ingested apoptotic corpses and for successive efferocytosis. Macrophages are revealed to adopt a polymerase II pause/release process to effectively deal with ingested apoptotic corpses and for continuous efferocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Stellar chemical compositions can be altered by ingestion of planetary material1,2 and/or planet formation, which removes refractory material from the protostellar disk3,4. These ‘planet signatures’ appear as correlations between elemental abundance differences and the dust condensation temperature3,5,6. Detecting these planet signatures, however, is challenging owing to unknown occurrence rates, small amplitudes and heterogeneous star samples with large differences in stellar ages7,8. Therefore, stars born together (that is, co-natal) with identical compositions can facilitate the detection of planet signatures. Although previous spectroscopic studies have been limited to a small number of binary stars9–13, the Gaia satellite14 provides opportunities for detecting stellar chemical signatures of planets among co-moving pairs of stars confirmed to be co-natal15,16. Here we report high-precision chemical abundances for a homogeneous sample of ninety-one co-natal pairs of stars with a well defined selection function and identify at least seven instances of planetary ingestion, corresponding to an occurrence rate of eight per cent. An independent Bayesian indicator is deployed, which can effectively disentangle the planet signatures from other factors, such as random abundance variation and atomic diffusion17. Our study provides evidence of planet signatures and facilitates a deeper understanding of the star–planet–chemistry connection by providing observational constraints on the mechanisms of planet engulfment, formation and evolution. By analysing the chemical abundance differences of pairs of co-moving stars born together, it is found that about 8% show chemical signatures that indicate ingestion of planetary material.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are degradation and signalling centres crucial for homeostasis, development and ageing1. To meet diverse cellular demands, lysosomes remodel their morphology and function through constant fusion and fission2,3. Little is known about the molecular basis of fission. Here we identify HPO-27, a conserved HEAT repeat protein, as a lysosome scission factor in Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of HPO-27 impairs lysosome fission and leads to an excessive tubular network that ultimately collapses. HPO-27 and its human homologue MROH1 are recruited to lysosomes by RAB-7 and enriched at scission sites. Super-resolution imaging, negative-staining electron microscopy and in vitro reconstitution assays reveal that HPO-27 and MROH1 self-assemble to mediate the constriction and scission of lysosomal tubules in worms and mammalian cells, respectively, and assemble to sever supported membrane tubes in vitro. Loss of HPO-27 affects lysosomal morphology, integrity and degradation activity, which impairs animal development and longevity. Thus, HPO-27 and MROH1 act as self-assembling scission factors to maintain lysosomal homeostasis and function. The conserved HEAT repeat protein HPO-27 is identified as a lysosome scission factor in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the human homologue MROH1 also serves the same function to maintain lysosomal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) fortify the cell boundaries of many commensal and pathogenic bacteria1. Through the ABC-transporter-dependent biosynthesis pathway, CPSs are synthesized intracellularly on a lipid anchor and secreted across the cell envelope by the KpsMT ABC transporter associated with the KpsE and KpsD subunits1,2. Here we use structural and functional studies to uncover crucial steps of CPS secretion in Gram-negative bacteria. We show that KpsMT has broad substrate specificity and is sufficient for the translocation of CPSs across the inner bacterial membrane, and we determine the cell surface organization and localization of CPSs using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Cryo-electron microscopy analyses of the KpsMT–KpsE complex in six different states reveal a KpsE-encaged ABC transporter, rigid-body conformational rearrangements of KpsMT during ATP hydrolysis and recognition of a glycolipid inside a membrane-exposed electropositive canyon. In vivo CPS secretion assays underscore the functional importance of canyon-lining basic residues. Combined, our analyses suggest a molecular model of CPS secretion by ABC transporters. An ensemble of cryo-electron microscopy structures of the KpsMT ABC transporter in complex with the KpsE co-polymerase and a glycolipid substrate reveal how capsular polysaccharides are recognized and translocated across bacterial cell membranes.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can exceed Planck’s blackbody limit1 by orders of magnitude owing to the tunnelling of evanescent electromagnetic frustrated and surface modes2–4, as has been demonstrated experimentally for NFRHT between two large parallel surfaces5–7 and between two subwavelength membranes8,9. However, although nanostructures can also sustain a much richer variety of localized electromagnetic modes at their corners and edges10,11, the contributions of such additional modes to further enhancing NFRHT remain unexplored. Here we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally a physical mechanism of NFRHT mediated by the corner and edge modes, and show that it can dominate the NFRHT in the ‘dual nanoscale regime’ in which both the thickness of the emitter and receiver, and their gap spacing, are much smaller than the thermal photon wavelengths. For two coplanar 20-nm-thick silicon carbide membranes separated by a 100-nm vacuum gap, the NFRHT coefficient at room temperature is both predicted and measured to be 830 W m−2 K−1, which is 5.5 times larger than that for two infinite silicon carbide surfaces separated by the same gap, and 1,400 times larger than the corresponding blackbody limit accounting for the geometric view factor between two coplanar membranes. This enhancement is dominated by the electromagnetic corner and edge modes, which account for 81% of the NFRHT between the silicon carbide membranes. These findings are important for future NFRHT applications in thermal management and energy conversion. Near-field radiative heat transfer between two coplanar silicon carbide membranes in close proximity is enhanced by the electromagnetic corner and edge modes.",

    "abstract": "Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), an independent, causal cardiovascular risk factor, is a lipoprotein particle that is formed by the interaction of a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle and apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a))1,2. Apo(a) first binds to lysine residues of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) on LDL through the Kringle IV (KIV) 7 and 8 domains, before a disulfide bond forms between apo(a) and apoB-100 to create Lp(a) (refs. 3–7). Here we show that the first step of Lp(a) formation can be inhibited through small-molecule interactions with apo(a) KIV7–8. We identify compounds that bind to apo(a) KIV7–8, and, through chemical optimization and further application of multivalency, we create compounds with subnanomolar potency that inhibit the formation of Lp(a). Oral doses of prototype compounds and a potent, multivalent disruptor, LY3473329 (muvalaplin), reduced the levels of Lp(a) in transgenic mice and in cynomolgus monkeys. Although multivalent molecules bind to the Kringle domains of rat plasminogen and reduce plasmin activity, species-selective differences in plasminogen sequences suggest that inhibitor molecules will reduce the levels of Lp(a), but not those of plasminogen, in humans. These data support the clinical development of LY3473329—which is already in phase 2 studies—as a potent and specific orally administered agent for reducing the levels of Lp(a). Biochemical screening and optimization identify small molecules that inhibit the formation of lipoprotein(a), and these inhibitors reduce the levels of Lp(a) in several animal models, suggesting that they could provide a therapeutic option in humans.",

    "abstract": "A boson sampler implements a restricted model of quantum computing. It is defined by the ability to sample from the distribution resulting from the interference of identical bosons propagating according to programmable, non-interacting dynamics1. An efficient exact classical simulation of boson sampling is not believed to exist, which has motivated ground-breaking boson sampling experiments in photonics with increasingly many photons2–12. However, it is difficult to generate and reliably evolve specific numbers of photons with low loss, and thus probabilistic techniques for postselection7 or marked changes to standard boson sampling10–12 are generally used. Here, we address the above challenges by implementing boson sampling using ultracold atoms13,14 in a two-dimensional, tunnel-coupled optical lattice. This demonstration is enabled by a previously unrealized combination of tools involving high-fidelity optical cooling and imaging of atoms in a lattice, as well as programmable control of those atoms using optical tweezers. When extended to interacting systems, our work demonstrates the core abilities required to directly assemble ground and excited states in simulations of various Hubbard models15,16. Boson sampling using ultracold atoms in a two-dimensional, tunnel-coupled optical lattice is enabled by high-fidelity programmable control with optical tweezers of a large number of atoms trapped in an optical lattice.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal representations that underlie spatial memory undergo continuous refinement following formation1. Here, to track the spatial tuning of neurons dynamically during offline states, we used a new Bayesian learning approach based on the spike-triggered average decoded position in ensemble recordings from freely moving rats. Measuring these tunings, we found spatial representations within hippocampal sharp-wave ripples that were stable for hours during sleep and were strongly aligned with place fields initially observed during maze exploration. These representations were explained by a combination of factors that included preconfigured structure before maze exposure and representations that emerged during θ-oscillations and awake sharp-wave ripples while on the maze, revealing the contribution of these events in forming ensembles. Strikingly, the ripple representations during sleep predicted the future place fields of neurons during re-exposure to the maze, even when those fields deviated from previous place preferences. By contrast, we observed tunings with poor alignment to maze place fields during sleep and rest before maze exposure and in the later stages of sleep. In sum, the new decoding approach allowed us to infer and characterize the stability and retuning of place fields during offline periods, revealing the rapid emergence of representations following new exploration and the role of sleep in the representational dynamics of the hippocampus. Using a Bayesian learning approach, a study tracks the spatial representations by individual hippocampal cells over time in freely moving rats, and provides insights into how ensemble patterns form and reconfigure during sleep.",

    "abstract": "Kainate receptors, a subclass of ionotropic glutamate receptors, are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory neurotransmission1–4. Kainate receptors modulate neuronal circuits and synaptic plasticity during the development and function of the central nervous system and are implicated in various neurological and psychiatric diseases, including epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety and autism5–11. Although structures of kainate receptor domains and subunit assemblies are available12–18, the mechanism of kainate receptor gating remains poorly understood. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the kainate receptor GluK2 in the presence of the agonist glutamate and the positive allosteric modulators lectin concanavalin A and BPAM344. Concanavalin A and BPAM344 inhibit kainate receptor desensitization and prolong activation by acting as a spacer between the amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains and a stabilizer of the ligand-binding domain dimer interface, respectively. Channel opening involves the kinking of all four pore-forming M3 helices. Our structures reveal the molecular basis of kainate receptor gating, which could guide the development of drugs for treatment of neurological disorders. Structures of the kainate receptor GluK2 with and without concanavilin A and BPAM344 show how these ligands modulate channel activity and reveal the molecular basis of kainate receptor gating.",

    "abstract": "AMPylation is a post-translational modification in which AMP is added to the amino acid side chains of proteins1,2. Here we show that, with ATP as the ligand and actin as the host activator, the effector protein LnaB of Legionella pneumophila exhibits AMPylase activity towards the phosphoryl group of phosphoribose on PRR42-Ub that is generated by the SidE family of effectors, and deubiquitinases DupA and DupB in an E1- and E2-independent ubiquitination process3–7. The product of LnaB is further hydrolysed by an ADP-ribosylhydrolase, MavL, to Ub, thereby preventing the accumulation of PRR42-Ub and ADPRR42-Ub and protecting canonical ubiquitination in host cells. LnaB represents a large family of AMPylases that adopt a common structural fold, distinct from those of the previously known AMPylases, and LnaB homologues are found in more than 20 species of bacterial pathogens. Moreover, LnaB also exhibits robust phosphoryl-AMPylase activity towards phosphorylated residues and produces unique ADPylation modifications in proteins. During infection, LnaB AMPylates the conserved phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the Src family of kinases8,9, which dampens downstream phosphorylation signalling in the host. Structural studies reveal the actin-dependent activation and catalytic mechanisms of the LnaB family of AMPylases. This study identifies, to our knowledge, an unprecedented molecular regulation mechanism in bacterial pathogenesis and protein phosphorylation. An effector protein called LnaB from Legionella pneumophila catalyses a unique type of AMPylation, and LnaB and its homologues represent a distinct family of AMPylases with specific structural features.",

    "abstract": "A cognitive map is a suitably structured representation that enables novel computations using previous experience; for example, planning a new route in a familiar space1. Work in mammals has found direct evidence for such representations in the presence of exogenous sensory inputs in both spatial2,3 and non-spatial domains4–10. Here we tested a foundational postulate of the original cognitive map theory1,11: that cognitive maps support endogenous computations without external input. We recorded from the entorhinal cortex of monkeys in a mental navigation task that required the monkeys to use a joystick to produce one-dimensional vectors between pairs of visual landmarks without seeing the intermediate landmarks. The ability of the monkeys to perform the task and generalize to new pairs indicated that they relied on a structured representation of the landmarks. Task-modulated neurons exhibited periodicity and ramping that matched the temporal structure of the landmarks and showed signatures of continuous attractor networks12,13. A continuous attractor network model of path integration14 augmented with a Hebbian-like learning mechanism provided an explanation of how the system could endogenously recall landmarks. The model also made an unexpected prediction that endogenous landmarks transiently slow path integration, reset the dynamics and thereby reduce variability. This prediction was borne out in a reanalysis of firing rate variability and behaviour. Our findings link the structured patterns of activity in the entorhinal cortex to the endogenous recruitment of a cognitive map during mental navigation. Measurements of activity in the entorhinal cortex of monkeys indicate that the recruitment of a cognitive map is a key part of mental navigation, and that cognitive maps can support behavior in the absence of external sensory input.",

    "abstract": "The region with the highest marine biodiversity on our planet is known as the Coral Triangle or Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA)1,2. Its enormous biodiversity has long attracted the interest of biologists; however, the detailed evolutionary history of the IAA biodiversity hotspot remains poorly understood3. Here we present a high-resolution reconstruction of the Cenozoic diversity history of the IAA by inferring speciation–extinction dynamics using a comprehensive fossil dataset. We found that the IAA has exhibited a unidirectional diversification trend since about 25 million years ago, following a roughly logistic increase until a diversity plateau beginning about 2.6 million years ago. The growth of diversity was primarily controlled by diversity dependency and habitat size, and also facilitated by the alleviation of thermal stress after 13.9 million years ago. Distinct net diversification peaks were recorded at about 25, 20, 16, 12 and 5 million years ago, which were probably related to major tectonic events in addition to climate transitions. Key biogeographic processes had far-reaching effects on the IAA diversity as shown by the long-term waning of the Tethyan descendants versus the waxing of cosmopolitan and IAA taxa. Finally, it seems that the absence of major extinctions and the Cenozoic cooling have been essential in making the IAA the richest marine biodiversity hotspot on Earth. A reconstruction of Cenozoic marine biodiversity in the Indo-Australian Archipelago reveals decreasing rates of net diversification and identifies the factors that have established it as the richest marine biodiversity hotspot.",

    "abstract": "Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) that frequently caused major outbreaks of encephalitis in humans and horses in the early twentieth century, but the frequency of outbreaks has since decreased markedly, and strains of this alphavirus isolated in the past two decades are less virulent in mammals than strains isolated in the 1930s and 1940s1–3. The basis for this phenotypic change in WEEV strains and coincident decrease in epizootic activity (known as viral submergence3) is unclear, as is the possibility of re-emergence of highly virulent strains. Here we identify protocadherin 10 (PCDH10) as a cellular receptor for WEEV. We show that multiple highly virulent ancestral WEEV strains isolated in the 1930s and 1940s, in addition to binding human PCDH10, could also bind very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), which are recognized by another encephalitic alphavirus as receptors4. However, whereas most of the WEEV strains that we examined bind to PCDH10, a contemporary strain has lost the ability to recognize mammalian PCDH10 while retaining the ability to bind avian receptors, suggesting WEEV adaptation to a main reservoir host during enzootic circulation. PCDH10 supports WEEV E2–E1 glycoprotein-mediated infection of primary mouse cortical neurons, and administration of a soluble form of PCDH10 protects mice from lethal WEEV challenge. Our results have implications for the development of medical countermeasures and for risk assessment for re-emerging WEEV strains. Knockout studies using CRISPR–Cas9 identify PCDH10 as a selective host cellular receptor for western equine encephalitis virus.",

Recently, genes encoding diverse methanogenesis pathways have been discovered in metagenome-assembled genomes affiliated with several archaeal phyla1–7. However, all experimental studies on methanogens are at present restricted to cultured representatives of the Euryarchaeota. Here we show methanogenic growth by a member of the lineage Korarchaeia within the phylum Thermoproteota (TACK superphylum)5–7. Following enrichment cultivation of ‘Candidatus Methanodesulfokora washburnenis’ strain LCB3, we used measurements of metabolic activity and isotope tracer conversion to demonstrate methanol reduction to methane using hydrogen as an electron donor. Analysis of the archaeon’s circular genome and transcriptome revealed unique modifications in the energy conservation pathways linked to methanogenesis, including enzyme complexes involved in hydrogen and sulfur metabolism. The cultivation and characterization of this new group of archaea is critical for a deeper evaluation of the diversity, physiology and biochemistry of methanogens. We show methanogenic growth by a member of the lineage Korarchaeia and, following cultivation, methanol reduction to methane using hydrogen as an electron donor, which could be critical for a thorough evaluation of methanogens.",

    "abstract": "Bidirectional communication between tumours and neurons has emerged as a key facet of the tumour microenvironment that drives malignancy1,2. Another hallmark feature of cancer is epigenomic dysregulation, in which alterations in gene expression influence cell states and interactions with the tumour microenvironment3. Ependymoma (EPN) is a paediatric brain tumour that relies on epigenomic remodelling to engender malignancy4,5; however, how these epigenetic mechanisms intersect with extrinsic neuronal signalling during EPN tumour progression is unknown. Here we show that the activity of serotonergic neurons regulates EPN tumorigenesis, and that serotonin itself also serves as an activating modification on histones. We found that inhibiting histone serotonylation blocks EPN tumorigenesis and regulates the expression of a core set of developmental transcription factors. High-throughput, in vivo screening of these transcription factors revealed that ETV5 promotes EPN tumorigenesis and functions by enhancing repressive chromatin states. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the genes repressed by ETV5, and its overexpression suppresses EPN tumour progression and tumour-associated network hyperactivity through synaptic remodelling. Collectively, this study identifies histone serotonylation as a key driver of EPN tumorigenesis, and also reveals how neuronal signalling, neuro-epigenomics and developmental programs are intertwined to drive malignancy in brain cancer. Serotonin has a role in ependymoma tumorigenesis through modifying histones and thereby regulating key transcription factors and activating specific oncogenic transcriptional networks in brain cells.",

    "abstract": "Romantic engagement can bias sensory perception. This ‘love blindness’ reflects a common behavioural principle across organisms: favouring pursuit of a coveted reward over potential risks1. In the case of animal courtship, such sensory biases may support reproductive success but can also expose individuals to danger, such as predation2,3. However, how neural networks balance the trade-off between risk and reward is unknown. Here we discover a dopamine-governed filter mechanism in male Drosophila that reduces threat perception as courtship progresses. We show that during early courtship stages, threat-activated visual neurons inhibit central courtship nodes via specific serotonergic neurons. This serotonergic inhibition prompts flies to abort courtship when they see imminent danger. However, as flies advance in the courtship process, the dopaminergic filter system reduces visual threat responses, shifting the balance from survival to mating. By recording neural activity from males as they approach mating, we demonstrate that progress in courtship is registered as dopaminergic activity levels ramping up. This dopamine signalling inhibits the visual threat detection pathway via Dop2R receptors, allowing male flies to focus on courtship when they are close to copulation. Thus, dopamine signalling biases sensory perception based on perceived goal proximity, to prioritize between competing behaviours. A state-dependent dopamine filter system in the male Drosophila brain balances threat perception against the drive to mate.",

    "abstract": "In naive individuals, sensory neurons directly detect and respond to allergens, leading to both the sensation of itch and the activation of local innate immune cells, which initiate the allergic immune response1,2. In the setting of chronic allergic inflammation, immune factors prime sensory neurons, causing pathologic itch3–7. Although these bidirectional neuroimmune circuits drive responses to allergens, whether immune cells regulate the set-point for neuronal activation by allergens in the naive state is unknown. Here we describe a γδ T cell–IL-3 signalling axis that controls the allergen responsiveness of cutaneous sensory neurons. We define a poorly characterized epidermal γδ T cell subset8, termed GD3 cells, that produces its hallmark cytokine IL-3 to promote allergic itch and the initiation of the allergic immune response. Mechanistically, IL-3 acts on Il3ra-expressing sensory neurons in a JAK2-dependent manner to lower their threshold for allergen activation without independently eliciting itch. This γδ T cell–IL-3 signalling axis further acts by means of STAT5 to promote neuropeptide production and the initiation of allergic immunity. These results reveal an endogenous immune rheostat that sits upstream of and governs sensory neuronal responses to allergens on first exposure. This pathway may explain individual differences in allergic susceptibility and opens new therapeutic avenues for treating allergic diseases. A γδ T cell–IL-3 signalling axis is defined that controls the allergen responsiveness of cutaneous sensory neurons, leading to evidence for an immune rheostat that governs sensory neuronal responses to allergens on first exposure.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality1,2. Elevated intracardiac pressures and myocyte stretch in heart failure trigger the release of counter-regulatory natriuretic peptides, which act through their receptor (NPR1) to affect vasodilation, diuresis and natriuresis, lowering venous pressures and relieving venous congestion3–8. Recombinant natriuretic peptide infusions were developed to treat heart failure but have been limited by a short duration of effect9,10. Here we report that in a human genetic analysis of over 700,000 individuals, lifelong exposure to coding variants of the NPR1 gene is associated with changes in blood pressure and risk of heart failure. We describe the development of REGN5381, an investigational monoclonal agonist antibody that targets the membrane-bound guanylate cyclase receptor NPR1. REGN5381, an allosteric agonist of NPR1, induces an active-like receptor conformation that results in haemodynamic effects preferentially on venous vasculature, including reductions in systolic blood pressure and venous pressure in animal models. In healthy human volunteers, REGN5381 produced the expected haemodynamic effects, reflecting reductions in venous pressures, without obvious changes in diuresis and natriuresis. These data support the development of REGN5381 for long-lasting and selective lowering of venous pressures that drive symptomatology in patients with heart failure. Durable agonism of NPR1 achieved with a novel investigational monoclonal antibody could mirror the positive hemodynamic changes in blood pressure and heart failure identified in humans with lifelong exposure to NPR1 coding variants.",

    "abstract": "Endosymbioses have profoundly impacted the evolution of life and continue to shape the ecology of a wide range of species. They give rise to new combinations of biochemical capabilities that promote innovation and diversification1,2. Despite the many examples of known endosymbioses across the tree of life, their de novo emergence is rare and challenging to uncover in retrospect3–5. Here we implant bacteria into the filamentous fungus Rhizopus microsporus to follow the fate of artificially induced endosymbioses. Whereas Escherichia coli implanted into the cytosol induced septum formation, effectively halting endosymbiogenesis, Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica was transmitted vertically to the progeny at a low frequency. Continuous positive selection on endosymbiosis mitigated initial fitness constraints by several orders of magnitude upon adaptive evolution. Phenotypic changes were underscored by the accumulation of mutations in the host as the system stabilized. The bacterium produced rhizoxin congeners in its new host, demonstrating the transfer of a metabolic function through induced endosymbiosis. Single-cell implantation thus provides a powerful experimental approach to study critical events at the onset of endosymbiogenesis and opens opportunities for synthetic approaches towards designing endosymbioses with desired traits. A study presents an approach to establish and track a new endosymbiotic partnership by implanting bacteria in a non-host fungus and shows that stable inheritance of the implanted bacteria is possible with positive selection.",

    "abstract": "Thunderstorms emit fluxes of gamma rays known as gamma-ray glows1,2, sporadically observed by aircraft1,3–7, balloons8–11 and from the ground12–18. Observations report increased gamma-ray emissions by tens of percent up to two orders of magnitude above the background, sometimes abruptly terminated by lightning discharges1,3–5. Glows are produced by the acceleration of energetic electrons in high-electric-field regions within thunderclouds8 and contribute to charge dissipation3. Glows had been considered as quasi-stationary phenomena3,5,12, with durations up to a few tens of seconds and spatial scales up to 10–20 km. However, no measurements of the full extension in space and time of a gamma-ray-glow region and their occurring frequency have been reported so far. Here we show that tropical thunderclouds over ocean and coastal regions commonly emit gamma rays for hours over areas up to a few thousand square kilometres. Emission is associated with deep convective cores; it is not uniform and continuous but shows characteristic timescales of 1–10 s and even subsecond for individual glows. The dynamics of gamma-glowing thunderclouds strongly contradicts the quasi-stationary picture of glows and instead resembles that of a huge gamma-glowing ‘boiling pot’ in both pattern and behaviour. Tropical thunderclouds over ocean and coastal regions are shown to emit gamma rays for several hours over areas of up to a few thousand square kilometres, contradicting the quasi-stationary picture of glows.",

    "abstract": "Ferroelectric structures have spontaneous macroscopic polarization that can be inverted using external electric fields and have potential applications including information storage, energy transduction, ultralow-power nanoelectronics1,2 and biomedical devices3. These functions would benefit from nanoscale control of ferroelectric structure, the ability to switch polarization with lower applied fields (low coercive field) and biocompatibility. Soft ferroelectrics based on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)4–6 have a thermodynamically unstable ferroelectric phase in the homopolymer, complex semi-crystalline structures, and high coercive fields. Here we report on ferroelectric materials formed by water-soluble molecules containing only six VDF repeating units covalently conjugated to a tetrapeptide, with the propensity to assemble into the β-sheet structures that are ubiquitous in proteins. This led to the discovery of ribbon-shaped ferroelectric supramolecular assemblies that are thermodynamically stable with their long axes parallel to both the preferred hydrogen-bonding direction of β-sheets and the bistable polar axes of VDF hexamers. Relative to a commonly used ferroelectric copolymer, the biomolecular assemblies exhibit a coercive field that is two orders of magnitude lower, as the result of supramolecular dynamics, and a similar level of remnant polarization, despite having a peptide content of 49 wt%. Furthermore, the Curie temperature of the assemblies is about 40 °C higher than that of a copolymer containing a similar amount of VDF. This supramolecular system was created using a biologically inspired strategy that is attractive in terms of sustainability and that could lead to new functions for soft ferroelectrics. A bio-inspired supramolecular material combines tiny amino acid sequences present in proteins with equally small segments of the plastic poly(vinylidene fluoride), yielding high-performance sustainable ferroelectric nanostructures with potential for future resorbable bioelectronics, ultra-low power devices, and large-scale information storage.",

    "abstract": "The human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex play critical roles in learning and cognition1,2, yet the dynamic molecular characteristics of their development remain enigmatic. Here we investigated the epigenomic and three-dimensional chromatin conformational reorganization during the development of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, using more than 53,000 joint single-nucleus profiles of chromatin conformation and DNA methylation generated by single-nucleus methyl-3C sequencing (snm3C-seq3)3. The remodelling of DNA methylation is temporally separated from chromatin conformation dynamics. Using single-cell profiling and multimodal single-molecule imaging approaches, we have found that short-range chromatin interactions are enriched in neurons, whereas long-range interactions are enriched in glial cells and non-brain tissues. We reconstructed the regulatory programs of cell-type development and differentiation, finding putatively causal common variants for schizophrenia strongly overlapping with chromatin loop-connected, cell-type-specific regulatory regions. Our data provide multimodal resources for studying gene regulatory dynamics in brain development and demonstrate that single-cell three-dimensional multi-omics is a powerful approach for dissecting neuropsychiatric risk loci. Using a single-nucleus multi-omics approach, a study jointly profiles the reorganization of the epigenome and the three-dimensional chromatin conformation during the development of the human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Studies of micrometeorites in mid-Ordovician limestones and impact craters on Earth indicate that our planet witnessed a massive infall of ordinary L chondrite material about 466 million years ago1–3 that may have been at the origin of an Ordovician ice age and major turnover in biodiversity4. The breakup of a large asteroid in the main belt is the likely cause of this massive infall. Currently, material originating from this breakup still dominates meteorite falls (>20% of all falls)5. Here we provide spectroscopic observations and dynamical evidence that the Massalia collisional family is the only plausible source of this catastrophic event and the most abundant class of meteorites falling on Earth today. This family of asteroids is suitably located in the inner belt, at low-inclination orbits, which corresponds to the observed distribution of L-chondrite-like near-Earth objects and interplanetary dust concentrated at 1.4° (refs. 6,7). The Massalia asteroid family is identified as the remnant of the collisional event that gave rise to ordinary L chondrites, the most abundant class of meteorites in our collections.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the origin of bright shooting stars and their meteorite samples is among the most ancient of astronomy-related questions, which at larger scales has human consequences1–3. As of today, only approximately 6% of meteorite falls have been firmly linked to their sources (Moon, Mars or asteroid (4) Vesta4–6). Here we show that approximately 70% of meteorites originate from three recent break-ups of D > 30 km asteroids that occurred 5.8, 7.6 and less than about 40 Myr ago. These break-ups, including the well-known Karin family7, took place in the prominent yet old Koronis and Massalia families and are at the origin of the dominance of H and L ordinary chondrites among meteorite falls. These young families are distinguished among all main belt asteroids by having a uniquely high abundance of small fragments. Their size–frequency distribution remained steep for a few tens of millions of years, exceeding temporarily the production of metre-sized fragments by the largest old asteroid families (for example, Flora and Vesta). Supporting evidence includes the existence of associated dust bands8–10, the cosmic-ray exposure ages of H-chondrite meteorites11,12 and the distribution of the pre-atmospheric orbits of meteorites13–15. Three relatively recent break-up events relating to young asteroid families are probably the dominant sources of the current influx of meteoritic material to the Earth.",

    "abstract": "Microquasars are laboratories for the study of jets of relativistic particles produced by accretion onto a spinning black hole. Microquasars are near enough to allow detailed imaging of spatial features across the multiwavelength spectrum. The recent extension measurement of the spatial morphology of a microquasar, SS 433, to TeV gamma rays1 localizes the acceleration of electrons at shocks in the jet far from the black hole2. V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) is a similar binary system with a black hole and B-type main-sequence companion star and has an orbit period of 2.8 days (refs. 3,4). It stands out for its super-Eddington accretion5 and for its radio jet, which is one of the fastest superluminal jets in the Milky Way. Previous observations of V4641 Sgr did not report gamma-ray emission6. Here we report TeV gamma-ray emission from V4641 Sgr that reveals particle acceleration at similar distances from the black hole as SS 433. Furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum of V4641 Sgr is among the hardest TeV spectra observed from any known gamma-ray source and is detected above 200 TeV. Gamma rays are produced by particles, either electrons or protons, of higher energies. Because energetic electrons lose energy more quickly the higher their energy, such a spectrum either very strongly constrains the electron-production mechanism or points to the acceleration of high-energy protons. This suggests that large-scale jets from microquasars could be more common than previously expected and that they could be a notable source of galactic cosmic rays7–9. Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the microquasar V4641 Sagittarii is reported, suggesting that large-scale jets from microquasars could be more common than previously thought and also could be a notable source of galactic cosmic rays.",

    "abstract": "The T cell response to cancer controls disease progression and response to immunotherapy1–3. Despite extensive knowledge regarding CD8 T cells, how CD4 T cells contribute to this process is less well understood. Here we identified a population of PD1+TCF1+ CD4 T cells with stem-like properties that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into canonical CD4 effector cells. Primarily residing in tumour-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), these tumour-specific CD4 T cells are restricted by T regulatory (Treg) cells to a stem-like fate that predominantly generated induced Treg (iTreg) cells, limiting effector CD8 T cell responses to the tumour. By contrast, upon Treg depletion, stem-like CD4 T cells differentiated into T helper 1 (TH1) cells, and via IFNγ production induced robust effector differentiation from TCF1+ CD8 T cells in TDLNs, a state we defined as ‘active’. Notably, enforcing TBET expression in transferred stem-like CD4 T cells was sufficient to overcome the established restricted T cell state. Despite the presence of Treg cells, endogenous stem-like CD4 T cells actively generated TH1 cells, which were required to restore TDLN effector CD8 T cell differentiation, enhance tumour control and rescue response to immunotherapy. In agreement, TH1 differentiation in patients with kidney cancer predicted successful immunotherapy responses and improved progression-free survival. Together, these findings identify a stem-like CD4 T cell population that through alternative differentiation fates controls the switch between restricted and active T cell states with implications for cancer immunotherapies. A population of tumour-specific PD1+TCF1+ CD4 T cells in tumour-draining lymph nodes is capable of self-renewal and differentiation into CD4 effector cells, thereby controlling CD8 T cell activity.",

    "abstract": "Unravelling the origin and evolution of precancerous lesions is crucial for effectively preventing malignant transformation, yet our current knowledge remains limited1–3. Here we used a base editor-enabled DNA barcoding system4 to comprehensively map single-cell phylogenies in mouse models of intestinal tumorigenesis induced by inflammation or loss of the Apc gene. Through quantitative analysis of high-resolution phylogenies including 260,922 single cells from normal, inflamed and neoplastic intestinal tissues, we identified tens of independent cell lineages undergoing parallel clonal expansions within each lesion. We also found polyclonal origins of human sporadic colorectal polyps through bulk whole-exome sequencing and single-gland whole-genome sequencing. Genomic and clinical data support a model of polyclonal-to-monoclonal transition, with monoclonal lesions representing a more advanced stage. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed extensive intercellular interactions in early polyclonal lesions, but there was significant loss of interactions during monoclonal transition. Therefore, our data suggest that colorectal precancer is often founded by many different lineages and highlight their cooperative interactions in the earliest stages of cancer formation. These findings provide insights into opportunities for earlier intervention in colorectal cancer. Experiments using DNA barcoding for lineage tracing in mouse models of colorectal cancer reveal polyclonal origins of premalignant lesions, with a transition to monoclonality as they progress to the advanced tumour.",

    "abstract": "The relaxation behaviour of isolated quantum systems taken out of equilibrium is among the most intriguing questions in many-body physics1. Quantum systems out of equilibrium typically relax to thermal equilibrium states by scrambling local information and building up entanglement entropy. However, kinetic constraints in the Hamiltonian can lead to a breakdown of this fundamental paradigm owing to a fragmentation of the underlying Hilbert space into dynamically decoupled subsectors in which thermalization can be strongly suppressed2–5. Here we experimentally observe Hilbert space fragmentation in a two-dimensional tilted Bose–Hubbard model. Using quantum gas microscopy, we engineer a wide variety of initial states and find a rich set of manifestations of Hilbert space fragmentation involving bulk states, interfaces and defects, that is, two-, one- and zero-dimensional objects. Specifically, uniform initial states with equal particle number and energy differ strikingly in their relaxation dynamics. Inserting controlled defects on top of a global, non-thermalizing chequerboard state, we observe highly anisotropic, subdimensional dynamics, an immediate signature of their fractonic nature6–9. An interface between localized and thermalizing states in turn shows dynamics depending on its orientation. Our results mark the observation of Hilbert space fragmentation beyond one dimension, as well as the concomitant direct observation of fractons, and pave the way for in-depth studies of microscopic transport phenomena in constrained systems. Using quantum gas microscopy, Hilbert space fragmentation and fractonic excitations are observed in a two-dimensional tilted Bose–Hubbard model.",

    "abstract": "The fractional quantum Hall effect is a key example of topological quantum many-body phenomena, arising from the interplay between strong electron correlation, topological order and time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, a lattice analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect at zero magnetic field has been observed, confirming the existence of a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI). Despite this, the bulk–edge correspondence—a hallmark of a FCI featuring an insulating bulk with conductive edges—has not been directly observed. In fact, this correspondence has not been visualized in any system for fractional states owing to experimental challenges. Here we report the imaging of FCI edge states in twisted MoTe2 (t-MoTe2) using microwave impedance microscopy1. By tuning the carrier density, we observe the system evolving between metallic and FCI states, the latter of which exhibits insulating bulk and conductive edges, as expected from the bulk–boundary correspondence. Further analysis suggests the composite nature of the FCI edge states. We also observe the evolution of edge states across the topological phase transition as a function of interlayer electric field and reveal exciting prospects of neighbouring domains with different fractional orders. These findings pave the way for research into topologically protected one-dimensional interfaces between various anyonic states at zero magnetic field, such as gapped one-dimensional symmetry-protected phases with non-zero topological entanglement entropy, Halperin–Laughlin interfaces and the creation of non-abelian anyons. The bulk–edge correspondence is directly imaged in a fractional Chern insulator at zero magnetic field with exciton-resonant microwave impedance microscopy, revealing spatially resolved bulk and edge characteristics, and the evolution of topological states in twisted MoTe2.",

    "abstract": "The gut mycobiota is crucial for intestinal homeostasis and immune function1. Yet its variability and inconsistent fungal colonization of laboratory mice hinders the study of the evolutionary and immune processes that underpin commensalism2,3. Here, we show that Kazachstania pintolopesii is a fungal commensal in wild urban and rural mice, with an exceptional ability to colonize the mouse gastrointestinal tract and dominate the gut mycobiome. Kazachstania pintolopesii colonization occurs in a bacteria-independent manner, results in enhanced colonization resistance to other fungi and is shielded from host immune surveillance, allowing commensal presence. Following changes in the mucosal environment, K. pintolopesii colonization triggers a type 2 immune response in mice and induces gastrointestinal eosinophilia. Mechanistically, we determined that K. pintolopesii activates type 2 immunity via the induction of epithelial IL-33 and downstream IL-33–ST2 signalling during mucus fluctuations. Kazachstania pintolopesii-induced type 2 immunity enhanced resistance to helminth infections or aggravated gastrointestinal allergy in a context-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that K. pintolopesii is a mouse commensal and serves as a valuable model organism for studying gut fungal commensalism and immunity in its native host. Its unnoticed presence in mouse facilities highlights the need to evaluate its influence on experimental outcomes and phenotypes. Kazachstania pintolopesii is a highly prevalent fungal symbiont that can trigger type 2 immunity and influence the composition of the gut mycobiome, as well as immune and disease phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system orchestrates the functions of the brain and body through the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways1. However, our understanding of the autonomic system, especially the sympathetic system, at the cellular and molecular levels is severely limited. Here we show topological representations of individual visceral organs in the major abdominal sympathetic ganglion complex. Using multi-modal transcriptomic analyses, we identified molecularly distinct sympathetic populations in the coeliac–superior mesenteric ganglia (CG–SMG). Of note, individual CG–SMG populations exhibit selective and mutually exclusive axonal projections to visceral organs, targeting either the gastrointestinal tract or secretory areas including the pancreas and bile tract. This combinatorial innervation pattern suggests functional segregation between different CG–SMG populations. Indeed, our neural perturbation experiments demonstrated that one class of neurons regulates gastrointestinal transit, and another class of neurons controls digestion and glucagon secretion independent of gut motility. These results reveal the molecularly diverse sympathetic system and suggest modular regulation of visceral organ functions by sympathetic populations. Multi-modal transcriptomic analyses of the sympathetic nervous system reveal organ-specific neural innervation and modular regulation of visceral functions.",

    "abstract": "Rainfall events are globally becoming less frequent but more intense under a changing climate, thereby shifting climatic conditions for terrestrial vegetation independent of annual rainfall totals1–3. However, it remains uncertain how changes in daily rainfall variability are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis and growth3–17. Here we use several satellite-based vegetation indices and field observations indicative of photosynthesis and growth, and find that global annual-scale vegetation indices are sensitive to the daily frequency and intensity of rainfall, independent of the total amount of rainfall per year. Specifically, we find that satellite-based vegetation indices are sensitive to daily rainfall variability across 42 per cent of the vegetated land surfaces. On average, the sensitivity of vegetation to daily rainfall variability is almost as large (95 per cent) as the sensitivity of vegetation to annual rainfall totals. Moreover, we find that wet-day frequency and intensity are projected to change with similar magnitudes and spatial extents as annual rainfall changes. Overall, our findings suggest that daily rainfall variability and its trends are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis, with potential implications for the carbon cycle and food security. Satellite data and field observations show that global annual-scale vegetation indices are sensitive to the daily frequency and intensity of rainfall, independent of the total amount of rainfall per year.",

    "abstract": "After nearly 50 years of searching, the vacuum ultraviolet 229Th nuclear isomeric transition has recently been directly laser excited1,2 and measured with high spectroscopic precision3. Nuclear clocks based on this transition are expected to be more robust4,5 than and may outperform6,7 current optical atomic clocks. These clocks also promise sensitive tests for new physics beyond the standard model5,8–12. In light of these important advances and applications, a substantial increase in the need for 229Th spectroscopy targets in several platforms is anticipated. However, the growth and handling of high-concentration 229Th-doped crystals5 used in previous measurements1–3,13,14 are challenging because of the scarcity and radioactivity of the 229Th material. Here we demonstrate a potentially scalable solution to these problems by performing laser excitation of the nuclear transition in 229ThF4 thin films grown using a physical vapour deposition process, consuming only micrograms of 229Th material. The 229ThF4 thin films are intrinsically compatible with photonics platforms and nanofabrication tools for integration with laser sources and detectors, paving the way for an integrated and field-deployable solid-state nuclear clock with radioactivity up to three orders of magnitude smaller than typical 229Th-doped crystals1–3,13. The high nuclear emitter density in 229ThF4 also potentially enables quantum optics studies in a new regime. Finally, we present the estimation of the performance of a nuclear clock based on a defect-free ThF4 crystal. Laser excitation of the 229Th isomer, potentially relevant for nuclear clocks, is reported in thorium fluoride thin films, which are less radioactive and amenable to integration compared with existing thorium-doped crystals.",

Viruses access more complex higher triangulation number icosahedral architectures by breaking perfect point group symmetry3–9, but nature appears not to have explored similar symmetry breaking for tetrahedral or octahedral symmetries. Here we describe a general design strategy for building higher triangulation number architectures starting from regular polyhedra through pseudosymmetrization of trimeric building blocks. Electron microscopy confirms the structures of T = 4 cages with 48 (tetrahedral), 96 (octahedral) and 240 (icosahedral) subunits, each with 4 distinct chains and 6 different protein–protein interfaces, and diameters of 33 nm, 43 nm and 75 nm, respectively. Higher triangulation number viruses possess very sophisticated functionalities; our general route to higher triangulation number nanocages should similarly enable a next generation of multiple antigen-displaying vaccine candidates10,11 and targeted delivery vehicles12,13. Using viral capsid architectures as template for design, higher triangulation number nanocages that require symmetry breaking offer potential advances in targeted delivery and antigen-displaying vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the quantum field theory that describes the interaction between light and matter, is commonly regarded as the best-tested quantum theory in modern physics. However, this claim is mostly based on extremely precise studies performed in the domain of relatively low field strengths and light atoms and ions1–6. In the realm of very strong electromagnetic fields such as in the heaviest highly charged ions (with nuclear charge Z ≫ 1), QED calculations enter a qualitatively different, non-perturbative regime. Yet, the corresponding experimental studies are very challenging, and theoretical predictions are only partially tested. Here we present an experiment sensitive to higher-order QED effects and electron–electron interactions in the high-Z regime. This is achieved by using a multi-reference method based on Doppler-tuned X-ray emission from stored relativistic uranium ions with different charge states. The energy of the 1s1/22p3/2 J = 2 → 1s1/22s1/2 J = 1 intrashell transition in the heaviest two-electron ion (U90+) is obtained with an accuracy of 37 ppm. Furthermore, a comparison of uranium ions with different numbers of bound electrons enables us to disentangle and to test separately the one-electron higher-order QED effects and the bound electron–electron interaction terms without the uncertainty related to the nuclear radius. Moreover, our experimental result can discriminate between several state-of-the-art theoretical approaches and provides an important benchmark for calculations in the strong-field domain. An experiment sensitive to higher-order quantum electrodynamics effects and electron–electron interactions in the high-Z regime was performed using a multi-reference method based on Doppler-tuned X-ray emission from stored relativistic uranium ions with different charge states.",

    "abstract": "During development, motor neurons originating in the brainstem and spinal cord form elaborate synapses with skeletal muscle fibres1. These neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), which binds to nicotinic ACh receptors (AChRs) on the muscle, initiating contraction. Two types of AChR are present in developing muscle cells, and their differential expression serves as a hallmark of neuromuscular synapse maturation2–4. The structural principles underlying the switch from fetal to adult muscle receptors are unknown. Here, we present high-resolution structures of both fetal and adult muscle nicotinic AChRs, isolated from bovine skeletal muscle in developmental transition. These structures, obtained in the absence and presence of ACh, provide a structural context for understanding how fetal versus adult receptor isoforms are tuned for synapse development versus the all-or-none signalling required for high-fidelity skeletal muscle contraction. We find that ACh affinity differences are driven by binding site access, channel conductance is tuned by widespread surface electrostatics and open duration changes result from intrasubunit interactions and structural flexibility. The structures further reveal pathogenic mechanisms underlying congenital myasthenic syndromes. Structures of fetal and adult muscle acetylcholine receptors reveal a developmental switch that alters channel biophysics and pharmacology to enable neuromuscular junction maturation, uncovering pathogenic mechanisms underlying congenital myasthenic syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Migration and homing of immune cells are critical for immune surveillance. Trafficking is mediated by combinations of adhesion and chemokine receptors that guide immune cells, in response to chemokine signals, to specific locations within tissues and the lymphatic system to support tissue-localized immune reactions and systemic immunity1,2. Here we show that disruption of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) production from group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) prevents immune cells leaving the lungs to migrate to the lymph nodes (LNs). In the absence of LIF, viral infection leads to plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) becoming retained in the lungs where they improve tissue-localized, antiviral immunity, whereas chronic pulmonary allergen challenge leads to marked immune cell accumulation and the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures in the lung. In both cases immune cells fail to migrate to the lymphatics, leading to highly compromised LN reactions. Mechanistically, ILC2-derived LIF induces the production of the chemokine CCL21 from lymphatic endothelial cells lining the pulmonary lymphatic vessels, thus licensing the homing of CCR7+ immune cells (including dendritic cells) to LNs. Consequently, ILC2-derived LIF dictates the egress of immune cells from the lungs to regulate tissue-localized versus systemic immunity and the balance between allergen and viral responsiveness in the lungs. Disruption of leukaemia inhibitory factor production from group 2 innate lymphoid cells prevents immune cells leaving the lungs to migrate to lymph nodes, leading to plasmacytoid dendritic cells becoming retained in the lungs following viral infection.",

For the Ub pathway, E1 enzymes catalyse transthiolation from an E1~Ub thioester to an E2~Ub thioester. Transthiolation is also required for transfer of Ub from an E2~Ub thioester to HECT (homologous to E6AP C terminus) and RBR (ring-between-ring) E3 ligases to form E3~Ub thioesters4–6. How isoenergetic transfer of thioester bonds is driven forward by enzymes in the Ub pathway remains unclear. Here we isolate mimics of transient transthiolation intermediates for E1–Ub(T)–E2 and E2–Ub(T)–E3HECT complexes (where T denotes Ub in a thioester or Ub undergoing transthiolation) using a chemical strategy with native enzymes and near-native Ub to capture and visualize a continuum of structures determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. These structures and accompanying biochemical experiments illuminate conformational changes in Ub, E1, E2 and E3 that are coordinated with the chemical reactions to facilitate directional transfer of Ub from each enzyme to the next. Structural analyses of analogues of stable ubiquitin transthiolation intermediates with E1, E2 and E3 enzymes reveal a population of intermediate states that provide insights into the directional transfer of ubiquitin between E1, E2 and E3.",

    "abstract": "Intermolecular distance largely determines the optoelectronic properties of organic matter. Conventional organic luminescent molecules are commonly used either as aggregates or as single molecules that are diluted in a foreigner matrix. They have garnered great research interest in recent decades for a variety of applications, including light-emitting diodes1,2, lasers3–5 and quantum technologies6,7, among others8–10. However, there is still a knowledge gap on how these molecules behave between the aggregation and dilution states. Here we report an unprecedented phase of molecular aggregate that forms in a two-dimensional hybrid perovskite superlattice with a near-equilibrium distance, which we refer to as a single-molecule-like aggregate (SMA). By implementing two-dimensional superlattices, the organic emitters are held in proximity, but, surprisingly, remain electronically isolated, thereby resulting in a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield, akin to that of single molecules. Moreover, the emitters within the perovskite superlattices demonstrate strong alignment and dense packing resembling aggregates, allowing for the observation of robust directional emission, substantially enhanced radiative recombination and efficient lasing. Molecular dynamics simulations together with single-crystal structure analysis emphasize the critical role of the internal rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecules in the two-dimensional lattice for creating the exclusive SMA phase. This two-dimensional superlattice unifies the paradoxical properties of single molecules and aggregates, thus offering exciting possibilities for advanced spectroscopic and photonic applications. A molecular aggregate formed in a two-dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite superlattice with a near-equilibrium distance is shown to have a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield like that of single molecules, despite being in an aggregated state.",

    "abstract": "Although a ubiquitous natural phenomenon, the onset and subsequent process of surface wave breaking are not fully understood. Breaking affects how steep waves become and drives air–sea exchanges1. Most seminal and state-of-the-art research on breaking is underpinned by the assumption of two-dimensionality, although ocean waves are three dimensional. We present experimental results that assess how three-dimensionality affects breaking, without putting limits on the direction of travel of the waves. We show that the breaking-onset steepness of the most directionally spread case is double that of its unidirectional counterpart. We identify three breaking regimes. As directional spreading increases, horizontally overturning ‘travelling-wave breaking’ (I), which forms the basis of two-dimensional breaking, is replaced by vertically jetting ‘standing-wave breaking’ (II). In between, ‘travelling-standing-wave breaking’ (III) is characterized by the formation of vertical jets along a fast-moving crest. The mechanisms in each regime determine how breaking limits steepness and affects subsequent air–sea exchanges. Unlike in two dimensions, three-dimensional wave-breaking onset does not limit how steep waves may become, and we produce directionally spread waves 80% steeper than at breaking onset and four times steeper than equivalent two-dimensional waves at their breaking onset. Our observations challenge the validity of state-of-the-art methods used to calculate energy dissipation and to design offshore structures in highly directionally spread seas. We conduct experiments in a wave tank and show that waves with realistic three-dimensional spreading can become two times steeper than two-dimensional waves before breaking, with three breaking regimes identified.",

    "abstract": "Mate recognition systems evolve rapidly to reinforce the reproductive boundaries between species, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we leveraged the rapid coevolution of female pheromone production and male pheromone perception in Drosophila1,2 to gain insight into how the architecture of mate recognition circuits facilitates their diversification. While in some Drosophila species females produce unique pheromones that act to arouse their conspecific males, the pheromones of most species are sexually monomorphic such that females possess no distinguishing chemosensory signatures that males can use for mate recognition3. We show that Drosophila yakuba males evolved the ability to use a sexually monomorphic pheromone, 7-tricosene, as an excitatory cue to promote courtship. By comparing key nodes in the pheromone circuits across multiple Drosophila species, we reveal that this sensory innovation arises from coordinated peripheral and central circuit adaptations: a distinct subpopulation of sensory neurons has acquired sensitivity to 7-tricosene and, in turn, selectively signals to a distinct subset of P1 neurons in the central brain to trigger courtship. Such a modular circuit organization, in which different sensory inputs can independently couple to parallel courtship control nodes, may facilitate the evolution of mate recognition systems by allowing novel sensory modalities to become linked to male arousal. Together, our findings suggest how peripheral and central circuit adaptations can be flexibly coordinated to underlie the rapid evolution of mate recognition strategies across species. Peripheral and central circuit adaptations can be flexibly coordinated in Drosophila, and such a modular circuit organization may facilitate the evolution of mate recognition systems by allowing novel sensory modalities to become linked to male arousal.",

Although this is traditionally achieved through continuous direct observations1,2, an alternative solution leverages irreversible genetic changes, such as naturally occurring mutations, to create indelible marks that enables retrospective temporal ordering3–5. Using a multipurpose, single-cell CRISPR platform, we developed a molecular clock approach to record the timing of cellular events and clonality in vivo, with incorporation of cell state and lineage information. Using this approach, we uncovered precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during mouse embryonic development, unconventional developmental relationships between cell types and new epithelial progenitor states by their unique genetic histories. Analysis of mouse adenomas, coupled to multiomic and single-cell profiling of human precancers, with clonal analysis of 418 human polyps, demonstrated the occurrence of polyclonal initiation in 15–30% of colonic precancers, showing their origins from multiple normal founders. Our study presents a multimodal framework that lays the foundation for in vivo recording, integrating synthetic or natural indelible genetic changes with single-cell analyses, to explore the origins and timing of development and tumorigenesis in mammalian systems. Using a multipurpose, single-cell CRISPR platform, we demonstrate precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during mouse embryonic development, unconventional developmental relationships between cell types, new epithelial progenitor states and insights into precancer initiation by leveraging genetic histories.",

    "abstract": "Modern humans arrived in Europe more than 45,000 years ago, overlapping at least 5,000 years with Neanderthals1–4. Limited genomic data from these early modern humans have shown that at least two genetically distinct groups inhabited Europe, represented by Zlatý kůň, Czechia3 and Bacho Kiro, Bulgaria2. Here we deepen our understanding of early modern humans by analysing one high-coverage genome and five low-coverage genomes from approximately 45,000-year-old remains from Ilsenhöhle in Ranis, Germany4, and a further high-coverage genome from Zlatý kůň. We show that distant familial relationships link the Ranis and Zlatý kůň individuals and that they were part of the same small, isolated population that represents the deepest known split from the Out-of-Africa lineage. Ranis genomes harbour Neanderthal segments that originate from a single admixture event shared with all non-Africans that we date to approximately 45,000–49,000 years ago. This implies that ancestors of all non-Africans sequenced so far resided in a common population at this time, and further suggests that modern human remains older than 50,000 years from outside Africa represent different non-African populations. High-coverage and low-coverage genomic data for some of the earliest modern humans in Europe provide insights into recent admixture with Neanderthals and familial relationship links with distant communities approximately 45,000 years ago.",

    "abstract": "Entanglement and its propagation are central to understanding many physical properties of quantum systems1–3. Notably, within closed quantum many-body systems, entanglement is believed to yield emergent thermodynamic behaviour4–7. However, a universal understanding remains challenging owing to the non-integrability and computational intractability of most large-scale quantum systems. Quantum hardware platforms provide a means to study the formation and scaling of entanglement in interacting many-body systems8–14. Here we use a controllable 4 × 4 array of superconducting qubits to emulate a 2D hard-core Bose–Hubbard (HCBH) lattice. We generate superposition states by simultaneously driving all lattice sites and extract correlation lengths and entanglement entropy across its many-body energy spectrum. We observe volume-law entanglement scaling for states at the centre of the spectrum and a crossover to the onset of area-law scaling near its edges. By emulating a 2D hard-core Bose–Hubbard lattice using a controllable 4 × 4 array of superconducting qubits, volume-law entanglement scaling as well as area-law scaling at different locations in the energy spectrum are observed.",

    "abstract": "Cell types with specialized functions fundamentally regulate animal behaviour, and yet the genetic mechanisms that underlie the emergence of novel cell types and their consequences for behaviour are not well understood1. Here we show that the monogamous oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) has recently evolved a novel cell type in the adrenal gland that expresses the enzyme AKR1C18, which converts progesterone into 20α-hydroxyprogesterone. We then demonstrate that 20α-hydroxyprogesterone is more abundant in oldfield mice, where it induces monogamous-typical parental behaviours, than in the closely related promiscuous deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using quantitative trait locus mapping in a cross between these species, we ultimately find interspecific genetic variation that drives expression of the nuclear protein GADD45A and the glycoprotein tenascin N, which contribute to the emergence and function of this cell type in oldfield mice. Our results provide an example by which the recent evolution of a new cell type in a gland outside the brain contributes to the evolution of social behaviour. The adrenal gland of the oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) has a recently evolved cell type that promotes monogamous-typical parenting behaviour and is not present in closely related species.",

    "abstract": "An accretion disk formed around a supermassive black hole after it disrupts a star is expected to be initially misaligned with respect to the equatorial plane of the black hole. This misalignment induces relativistic torques (the Lense–Thirring effect) on the disk, causing the disk to precess at early times, whereas at late times the disk aligns with the black hole and precession terminates1,2. Here we report, using high-cadence X-ray monitoring observations of a tidal disruption event (TDE), the discovery of strong, quasi-periodic X-ray flux and temperature modulations. These X-ray modulations are separated by roughly 15 days and persist for about 130 days during the early phase of the TDE. Lense–Thirring precession of the accretion flow can produce this X-ray variability, but other physical mechanisms, such as the radiation-pressure instability3,4, cannot be ruled out. Assuming typical TDE parameters, that is, a solar-like star with the resulting disk extending at most to the so-called circularization radius, and that the disk precesses as a rigid body, we constrain the disrupting dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole to be 0.05 ≲ ∣a∣ ≲ 0.5. The accretion disk from a star tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole undergoes Lense–Thirring precession with strong, quasi-periodic X-ray flux and temperature modulations.",

    "abstract": "In developing B cells, V(D)J recombination assembles exons encoding IgH and Igκ variable regions from hundreds of gene segments clustered across Igh and Igk loci. V, D and J gene segments are flanked by conserved recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that target RAG endonuclease1. RAG orchestrates Igh V(D)J recombination upon capturing a JH-RSS within the JH-RSS-based recombination centre1–3 (RC). JH-RSS orientation programmes RAG to scan upstream D- and VH-containing chromatin that is presented in a linear manner by cohesin-mediated loop extrusion4–7. During Igh scanning, RAG robustly utilizes only D-RSSs or VH-RSSs in convergent (deletional) orientation with JH-RSSs4–7. However, for Vκ-to-Jκ joining, RAG utilizes Vκ-RSSs from deletional- and inversional-oriented clusters8, inconsistent with linear scanning2. Here we characterize the Vκ-to-Jκ joining mechanism. Igk undergoes robust primary and secondary rearrangements9,10, which confounds scanning assays. We therefore engineered cells to undergo only primary Vκ-to-Jκ rearrangements and found that RAG scanning from the primary Jκ-RC terminates just 8 kb upstream within the CTCF-site-based Sis element11. Whereas Sis and the Jκ-RC barely interacted with the Vκ locus, the CTCF-site-based Cer element12 4 kb upstream of Sis interacted with various loop extrusion impediments across the locus. Similar to VH locus inversion7, DJH inversion abrogated VH-to-DJH joining; yet Vκ locus or Jκ inversion allowed robust Vκ-to-Jκ joining. Together, these experiments implicated loop extrusion in bringing Vκ segments near Cer for short-range diffusion-mediated capture by RC-based RAG. To identify key mechanistic elements for diffusional V(D)J recombination in Igk versus Igh, we assayed Vκ-to-JH and D-to-Jκ rearrangements in hybrid Igh–Igk loci generated by targeted chromosomal translocations, and pinpointed remarkably strong Vκ and Jκ RSSs. Indeed, RSS replacements in hybrid or normal Igk and Igh loci confirmed the ability of Igk-RSSs to promote robust diffusional joining compared with Igh-RSSs. We propose that Igk evolved strong RSSs to mediate diffusional Vκ-to-Jκ joining, whereas Igh evolved weaker RSSs requisite for modulating VH joining by RAG-scanning impediments. Experiments in mouse models, and in cell lines that only allow primary Vκ-to-Jκ rearrangements, enable characterization of the mechanisms of V(D)J recombination.",

    "abstract": "Humans express 15 formins that play crucial roles in actin-based processes, including cytokinesis, cell motility and mechanotransduction1,2. However, the lack of structures bound to the actin filament (F-actin) has been a major impediment to understanding formin function. Whereas formins are known for their ability to nucleate and elongate F-actin3–7, some formins can additionally depolymerize, sever or bundle F-actin. Two mammalian formins, inverted formin 2 (INF2) and diaphanous 1 (DIA1, encoded by DIAPH1), exemplify this diversity. INF2 shows potent severing activity but elongates weakly8–11 whereas DIA1 has potent elongation activity but does not sever4,8. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) we show five structural states of INF2 and two of DIA1 bound to the middle and barbed end of F-actin. INF2 and DIA1 bind differently to these sites, consistent with their distinct activities. The formin-homology 2 and Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein-homology 2 (FH2 and WH2, respectively) domains of INF2 are positioned to sever F-actin, whereas DIA1 appears unsuited for severing. These structures also show how profilin-actin is delivered to the fast-growing barbed end, and how this is followed by a transition of the incoming monomer into the F-actin conformation and the release of profilin. Combined, the seven structures presented here provide step-by-step visualization of the mechanisms of F-actin severing and elongation by formins. Cryo-electron microscopy shows five structural states of inverted formin 2 and two of formin diaphanous 1 bound to F-actin, providing step-by-step visualization of the mechanisms of F-actin severing and elongation by formins.",

    "abstract": "Pericentric heterochromatin is a critical component of chromosomes marked by histone H3 K9 (H3K9) methylation1–3. However, what recruits H3K9-specific histone methyltransferases to pericentric regions in vertebrates remains unclear4, as does why pericentric regions in different species share the same H3K9 methylation mark despite lacking highly conserved DNA sequences2,5. Here we show that zinc-finger proteins ZNF512 and ZNF512B specifically localize at pericentric regions through direct DNA binding. Notably, both ZNF512 and ZNF512B are sufficient to initiate de novo heterochromatin formation at ectopically targeted repetitive regions and pericentric regions, as they directly recruit SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 (SUV39H) to catalyse H3K9 methylation. SUV39H2 makes a greater contribution to H3K9 trimethylation, whereas SUV39H1 seems to contribute more to silencing, probably owing to its preferential association with HP1 proteins. ZNF512 and ZNF512B from different species can specifically target pericentric regions of other vertebrates, because the atypical long linker residues between the zinc-fingers of ZNF512 and ZNF512B offer flexibility in recognition of non-consecutively organized three-nucleotide triplets targeted by each zinc-finger. This study addresses two long-standing questions: how constitutive heterochromatin is initiated and how seemingly variable pericentric sequences are targeted by the same set of conserved machinery in vertebrates. Zinc-finger proteins ZNF512 and ZNF512B are shown to target pericentric DNA through a conserved mechanism that depends on their atypical long linkers, providing insight into how constitutive heterochromatin formation is initiated across various species.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia and meningitis worldwide. Many different serotypes co-circulate endemically in any one location1,2. The extent and mechanisms of spread and vaccine-driven changes in fitness and antimicrobial resistance remain largely unquantified. Here using geolocated genome sequences from South Africa (n = 6,910, collected from 2000 to 2014), we developed models to reconstruct spread, pairing detailed human mobility data and genomic data. Separately, we estimated the population-level changes in fitness of strains that are included (vaccine type (VT)) and not included (non-vaccine type (NVT)) in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, first implemented in South Africa in 2009. Differences in strain fitness between those that are and are not resistant to penicillin were also evaluated. We found that pneumococci only become homogenously mixed across South Africa after 50 years of transmission, with the slow spread driven by the focal nature of human mobility. Furthermore, in the years following vaccine implementation, the relative fitness of NVT compared with VT strains increased (relative risk of 1.68; 95% confidence interval of 1.59–1.77), with an increasing proportion of these NVT strains becoming resistant to penicillin. Our findings point to highly entrenched, slow transmission and indicate that initial vaccine-linked decreases in antimicrobial resistance may be transient. Mathematical modelling of 15 years of data from South Africa reveals the spread and vaccine-driven changes in fitness and antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae.",

    "abstract": "In all organisms, regulation of gene expression must be adjusted to meet cellular requirements and frequently involves helix–turn–helix (HTH) domain proteins1. For instance, in the arms race between bacteria and bacteriophages, rapid expression of phage anti-CRISPR (acr) genes upon infection enables evasion from CRISPR–Cas defence; transcription is then repressed by an HTH-domain-containing anti-CRISPR-associated (Aca) protein, probably to reduce fitness costs from excessive expression2–5. However, how a single HTH regulator adjusts anti-CRISPR production to cope with increasing phage genome copies and accumulating acr mRNA is unknown. Here we show that the HTH domain of the regulator Aca2, in addition to repressing Acr synthesis transcriptionally through DNA binding, inhibits translation of mRNAs by binding conserved RNA stem-loops and blocking ribosome access. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the approximately 40 kDa Aca2–RNA complex demonstrates how the versatile HTH domain specifically discriminates RNA from DNA binding sites. These combined regulatory modes are widespread in the Aca2 family and facilitate CRISPR–Cas inhibition in the face of rapid phage DNA replication without toxic acr overexpression. Given the ubiquity of HTH-domain-containing proteins, it is anticipated that many more of them elicit regulatory control by dual DNA and RNA binding. The helix–turn–helix domain of an anti-CRISPR-associated (Aca) protein represses transcription of anti-CRISPR (Acr)-encoding genes and inhibits their translation to protein via distinct binding modes to DNA and RNA, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The newly identified type VII CRISPR–Cas candidate system uses a CRISPR RNA-guided ribonucleoprotein complex formed by Cas5 and Cas7 proteins to target RNA1. However, the RNA cleavage is executed by a dedicated Cas14 nuclease, which is distinct from the effector nucleases of the other CRISPR–Cas systems. Here we report seven cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Cas14-bound interference complex at different functional states. Cas14, a tetrameric protein in solution, is recruited to the Cas5–Cas7 complex in a target RNA-dependent manner. The N-terminal catalytic domain of Cas14 binds a stretch of the substrate RNA for cleavage, whereas the C-terminal domain is primarily responsible for tethering Cas14 to the Cas5–Cas7 complex. The biochemical cleavage assays corroborate the captured functional conformations, revealing that Cas14 binds to different sites on the Cas5–Cas7 complex to execute individual cleavage events. Notably, a plugged-in arginine of Cas7 sandwiched by a C-shaped clamp of C-terminal domain precisely modulates Cas14 binding. More interestingly, target RNA cleavage is altered by a complementary protospacer flanking sequence at the 5′ end, but not at the 3′ end. Altogether, our study elucidates critical molecular details underlying the assembly of the interference complex and substrate cleavage in the type VII CRISPR–Cas system, which may help rational engineering of the type VII CRISPR–Cas system for biotechnological applications. We describe the structure and activity of Cas14 nuclease, a component of the type VII CRISPR–Cas interference complex with Cas5 and Cas7, in different functional states.",

    "abstract": "Faithful DNA replication is essential for genome integrity1–4. Under-replicated DNA leads to defects in chromosome segregation, which are common during embryogenesis5–8. However, the regulation of DNA replication remains poorly understood in early mammalian embryos. Here we constructed a single-cell genome-wide DNA replication atlas of pre-implantation mouse embryos and identified an abrupt replication program switch accompanied by a transient period of genomic instability. In 1- and 2-cell embryos, we observed the complete absence of a replication timing program, and the entire genome replicated gradually and uniformly using extremely slow-moving replication forks. In 4-cell embryos, a somatic-cell-like replication timing program commenced abruptly. However, the fork speed was still slow, S phase was extended, and markers of replication stress, DNA damage and repair increased. This was followed by an increase in break-type chromosome segregation errors specifically during the 4-to-8-cell division with breakpoints enriched in late-replicating regions. These errors were rescued by nucleoside supplementation, which accelerated fork speed and reduced the replication stress. By the 8-cell stage, forks gained speed, S phase was no longer extended and chromosome aberrations decreased. Thus, a transient period of genomic instability exists during normal mouse development, preceded by an S phase lacking coordination between replisome-level regulation and megabase-scale replication timing regulation, implicating a link between their coordination and genome stability. A single-cell genome-wide DNA replication atlas of pre-implantation mouse embryos reveals an abrupt replication program switch accompanied by a transient period of genomic instability.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids are essential building blocks in biology and chemistry. Whereas nature relies on a small number of amino acid structures, chemists desire access to a vast range of structurally diverse analogues1–3. The selective modification of amino acid side-chain residues represents an efficient strategy to access non-canonical derivatives of value in chemistry and biology. While semisynthetic methods leveraging the functional groups found in polar and aromatic amino acids have been extensively explored, highly selective and general approaches to transform unactivated C–H bonds in aliphatic amino acids remain less developed4,5. Here we disclose a stepwise dehydrogenative method to convert aliphatic amino acids into structurally diverse analogues. The key to the success of this approach lies in the development of a selective catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation method driven by photochemical irradiation, which provides access to terminal alkene intermediates for downstream functionalization. Overall, this strategy enables the rapid synthesis of new amino acid building blocks and suggests possibilities for the late-stage modification of more complex oligopeptides. Effective dehydrogenation of amino acids and short peptides using cobalt and photocatalysis is used to make a range of unnatural products of value in chemistry and biology.",

    "abstract": "When sustained for megayears (refs. 1,2), high-power jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) become the largest galaxy-made structures in the Universe3. By pumping electrons, atomic nuclei and magnetic fields into the intergalactic medium (IGM), these energetic flows affect the distribution of matter and magnetism in the cosmic web4–6 and could have a sweeping cosmological influence if they reached far at early epochs. For the past 50 years, the known size range of black hole jet pairs ended at 4.6–5.0 Mpc (refs. 7–9), or 20–30% of a cosmic void radius in the Local Universe10. An observational lack of longer jets, as well as theoretical results11, thus suggested a growth limit at about 5 Mpc (ref. 12). Here we report observations of a radio structure spanning about 7 Mpc, or roughly 66% of a coeval cosmic void radius, apparently generated by a black hole between \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${4.4}_{-0.7}^{+0.2}$$\n                \n               and 6.3 Gyr after the Big Bang. The structure consists of a northern lobe, a northern jet, a core, a southern jet with an inner hotspot and a southern outer hotspot with a backflow. This system demonstrates that jets can avoid destruction by magnetohydrodynamical instabilities over cosmological distances, even at epochs when the Universe was 7 to \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$1{5}_{-2}^{+6}$$\n                \n               times denser than it is today. How jets can retain such long-lived coherence is unknown at present. Radio images reveal distant black hole jets of cosmological length, suggesting that the environmental impact of supermassive black holes extends further in space and time than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Micronuclear batteries harness energy from the radioactive decay of radioisotopes to generate electricity on a small scale, typically in the nanowatt or microwatt range1,2. Contrary to chemical batteries, the longevity of a micronuclear battery is tied to the half-life of the used radioisotope, enabling operational lifetimes that can span several decades3. Furthermore, the radioactive decay remains unaffected by environmental factors such as temperature, pressure and magnetic fields, making the micronuclear battery an enduring and reliable power source in scenarios in which conventional batteries prove impractical or challenging to replace4. Common radioisotopes of americium (241Am and 243Am) are α-decay emitters with half-lives longer than hundreds of years. Severe self-adsorption in traditional architectures of micronuclear batteries impedes high-efficiency α-decay energy conversion, making the development of α-radioisotope micronuclear batteries challenging5,6. Here we propose a micronuclear battery architecture that includes a coalescent energy transducer by incorporating 243Am into a luminescent lanthanide coordination polymer. This couples radioisotopes with energy transducers at the molecular level, resulting in an 8,000-fold enhancement in energy conversion efficiency from α decay energy to sustained autoluminescence compared with that of conventional architectures. When implemented in conjunction with a photovoltaic cell that translates autoluminescence into electricity, a new type of radiophotovoltaic micronuclear battery with a total power conversion efficiency of 0.889% and a power per activity of 139 microwatts per curie (μW Ci−1) is obtained. A micronuclear battery is built based on an autoluminescent americium–terbium compound that couples radioisotopes with energy transducers at the molecular level, resulting in an 8,000-fold enhancement in energy conversion efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Neural coding has traditionally been examined through changes in firing rates and latencies in response to different stimuli1–5. However, populations of neurons can also exhibit transient bursts of spiking activity, wherein neurons fire in a specific temporal order or sequence6–8. The human brain may utilize these neuronal sequences within population bursts to efficiently represent information9–12, thereby complementing the well-known neural code based on spike rate or latency. Here we examined this possibility by recording the spiking activity of populations of single units in the human anterior temporal lobe as eight participants performed a visual categorization task. We find that population spiking activity organizes into bursts during the task. The temporal order of spiking across the activated units within each burst varies across stimulus categories, creating unique stereotypical sequences for individual categories as well as for individual exemplars within a category. The information conveyed by the temporal order of spiking activity is separable from and complements the information conveyed by the units’ spike rates or latencies following stimulus onset. Collectively, our data provide evidence that the human brain contains a complementary code based on the neuronal sequence within bursts of population spiking to represent information. The temporal order of neuronal firing within bursts of population spiking in the human anterior temporal lobe is dependent on the category as well as the identity of the individual stimulus, and this encodes information independently of spike rate or latency.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors are widely used anticancer therapies1 that can cause morbid and potentially fatal immune-related adverse events such as immune-related myocarditis (irMyocarditis)2–5. The pathogenesis of irMyocarditis and its relationship to antitumour immunity remain poorly understood. Here we sought to define immune responses in heart, tumour and blood in patients with irMyocarditis by leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, microscopy and proteomics analyses of samples from 28 patients with irMyocarditis and 41 unaffected individuals. Analyses of 84,576 cardiac cells by single-cell RNA sequencing combined with multiplexed microscopy demonstrated increased frequencies and co-localization of cytotoxic T cells, conventional dendritic cells and inflammatory fibroblasts in irMyocarditis heart tissue. Analyses of 366,066 blood cells revealed decreased frequencies of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conventional dendritic cells and B lineage cells but an increased frequency of other mononuclear phagocytes in irMyocarditis. Fifty-two heart-expanded TCR clones from eight patients did not recognize the putative cardiac autoantigens α-myosin, troponin I or troponin T. Additionally, TCRs enriched in heart tissue were largely nonoverlapping with those enriched in paired tumour tissue. The presence of heart-expanded TCRs in a cycling blood CD8 T cell population was associated with fatal irMyocarditis case status. Collectively, these findings highlight crucial biology driving irMyocarditis and identify putative biomarkers. The molecular characteristics of myocarditis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are described and potential biomarkers of onset and severity are identified.",

    "abstract": "Memories are encoded in neural ensembles during learning1–6 and are stabilized by post-learning reactivation7–17. Integrating recent experiences into existing memories ensures that memories contain the most recently available information, but how the brain accomplishes this critical process remains unclear. Here we show that in mice, a strong aversive experience drives offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed 2 days before, linking fear of the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory. Fear specifically links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral memories across days. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the recent aversive memory ensemble is reactivated during the offline period after learning. However, a strong aversive experience also increases co-reactivation of the aversive and neutral memory ensembles during the offline period. Ensemble co-reactivation occurs more during wake than during sleep. Finally, the expression of fear in the neutral context is associated with reactivation of the shared ensemble between the aversive and neutral memories. Collectively, these results demonstrate that offline ensemble co-reactivation is a neural mechanism by which memories are integrated across days. In mice, a strong aversive experience drives offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed 2 days before, linking fear of the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory.",

To address this question, we applied single-cell DNA sequencing to profile copy number alterations in 83,206 epithelial cells from the breast tissues of 49 healthy women, and we applied single-cell DNA and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing co-assays to the samples of 19 women. Our data show that all women harboured rare aneuploid epithelial cells (median 3.19%) that increased with age. Many aneuploid epithelial cells (median 82.22%) in normal breast tissues underwent clonal expansions and harboured copy number alterations reminiscent of invasive breast cancers (gains of 1q; losses of 10q, 16q and 22q). Co-assay profiling showed that the aneuploid cells were mainly associated with the two luminal epithelial lineages, and spatial mapping showed that they localized in ductal and lobular structures with normal histopathology. Collectively, these data show that even healthy women have clonal expansions of rare aneuploid epithelial cells in their breast tissues. Using single-cell DNA sequencing we show that most healthy women harbour rare populations of aneuploid epithelial cells with copy number alteration events in their breast tissue that expand and accumulate with age.",

    "abstract": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has a central role in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and is a key agent in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, the leading cause of mortality worldwide1,2. Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), one of the largest proteins in the genome, is the primary structural and functional component of LDL, yet its size and complex lipid associations have posed major challenges for structural studies3. Here we present the structure of apoB100 resolved to subnanometre resolution in most regions using an integrative approach of cryo-electron microscopy, AlphaFold24 and molecular-dynamics-based refinement5. The structure consists of a large globular N-terminal domain and an approximately 61-nm-long continuous amphipathic β-sheet that wraps around the LDL particle like a belt. Distributed quasi-symmetrically across the two sides of the β-belt are nine strategically located interstrand inserts that extend across the lipid surface to provide additional structural support through a network of long-range interactions. We further compare our structure to a comprehensive list of more than 200 intramolecular cross-links and find close agreement between the two. These results suggest a mechanism for how the various domains of apoB100 act in concert to maintain LDL shape and cohesion across a range of particle sizes. More generally, they advance our fundamental understanding of LDL synthesis, form and function, and will help to accelerate the design of potential therapeutics. The structure of apolipoprotein B100 provides insights into how the various domains of apoB100 act in concert to maintain low-density lipoprotein shape and cohesion across a range of particle sizes.",

Yet, current datasets are unable to differentiate between these various scenarios. Here we report the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad Hα emission in a galaxy at z = 6.68, which traces a black hole with a mass of about 4 × 108M⊙ and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The black hole to host galaxy stellar mass ratio is about 0.4—that is, about 1,000 times above the local relation—whereas the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely an indication of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionization. Its properties are consistent with scenarios in which short bursts of super-Eddington accretion have resulted in black hole overgrowth and massive gas expulsion from the accretion disk; in between bursts, black holes spend most of their life in a dormant state. A dormant supermassive black hole at high redshift that is substantially overmassive relative to its host galaxy has been detected, indicating a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionization.",

    "abstract": "The relation between crystal symmetries, electron correlations and electronic structure steers the formation of a large array of unconventional phases of matter, including magneto-electric loop currents and chiral magnetism1–6. The detection of such hidden orders is an important goal in condensed-matter physics. However, until now, non-standard forms of magnetism with chiral electronic ordering have been difficult to detect experimentally7. Here we develop a theory for symmetry-broken chiral ground states and propose a methodology based on circularly polarized, spin-selective, angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to study them. We use the archetypal quantum material Sr2RuO4 and reveal spectroscopic signatures that, despite being subtle, can be reconciled with the formation of spin–orbital chiral currents at the surface of the material8–10. As we shed light on these chiral regimes, our findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of ordering phenomena and unconventional magnetism. A spin–orbital- and angular-momentum-sensitive methodology used to study Sr2RuO4 reveals subtle spectroscopic signatures that are consistent with the formation of spin–orbital chiral currents at the surface of the material.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a bacterial pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease that is responsible for major health and economic costs worldwide1. Mtb encounters diverse environments during its life cycle and responds to these changes largely by reprogramming its transcriptional output2. However, the mechanisms of Mtb transcription and how they are regulated remain poorly understood. Here we use a sequencing method that simultaneously determines both termini of individual RNA molecules in bacterial cells3 to profile the Mtb transcriptome at high resolution. Unexpectedly, we find that most Mtb transcripts are incomplete, with their 5′ ends aligned at transcription start sites and 3′ ends located 200–500 nucleotides downstream. We show that these short RNAs are mainly associated with paused RNA polymerases (RNAPs) rather than being products of premature termination. We further show that the high propensity of Mtb RNAP to pause early in transcription relies on the binding of the σ-factor. Finally, we show that a translating ribosome promotes transcription elongation, revealing a potential role for transcription–translation coupling in controlling Mtb gene expression. In sum, our findings depict a mycobacterial transcriptome that prominently features incomplete transcripts resulting from RNAP pausing. We propose that the pausing phase constitutes an important transcriptional checkpoint in Mtb that allows the bacterium to adapt to environmental changes and could be exploited for TB therapeutics. A study reveals that most transcripts in Mycobacterium tuberculosis are incomplete, likely because of the tendency of the transcription machinery in this species to pause on genomic DNA.",

    "abstract": "Ordinary metals contain electron liquids within well-defined ‘Fermi’ surfaces at which the electrons behave as if they were non-interacting. In the absence of transitions to entirely new phases such as insulators or superconductors, interactions between electrons induce scattering that is quadratic in the deviation of the binding energy from the Fermi level. A long-standing puzzle is that certain materials do not fit this ‘Fermi liquid’ description. A common feature is strong interactions between electrons relative to their kinetic energies. One route to this regime is special lattices to reduce the electron kinetic energies. Twisted bilayer graphene1–4 is an example, and trihexagonal tiling lattices (triangular ‘kagome’), with all corner sites removed on a 2 × 2 superlattice, can also host narrow electron bands5 for which interaction effects would be enhanced. Here we describe spectroscopy revealing non-Fermi-liquid behaviour for the ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 (ref. 6). We discover three C3-symmetric electron pockets at the Brillouin zone centre, two of which are expected from density functional theory. The third and most sharply defined band emerges at low temperatures and binding energies by means of fractionalization of one of the other two, most likely on the account of enhanced electron–electron interactions owing to a flat band predicted to lie just above the Fermi level. Our discovery opens the topic of how such many-body physics involving flat bands7,8 could differ depending on whether they arise from lattice geometry or from strongly localized atomic orbitals9,10. Laser-based micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals both fractionalized and marginal quasiparticles in C3-symmetric electron pockets near the Brillouin zone centre of the ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes have evolved intricate innate immune systems against phage infection1–7. Gabija is a highly widespread prokaryotic defence system that consists of two components, GajA and GajB8. GajA functions as a DNA endonuclease that is inactive in the presence of ATP9. Here, to explore how the Gabija system is activated for anti-phage defence, we report its cryo-electron microscopy structures in five states, including apo GajA, GajA in complex with DNA, GajA bound by ATP, apo GajA–GajB, and GajA–GajB in complex with ATP and Mg2+. GajA is a rhombus-shaped tetramer with its ATPase domain clustered at the centre and the topoisomerase–primase (Toprim) domain located peripherally. ATP binding at the ATPase domain stabilizes the insertion region within the ATPase domain, keeping the Toprim domain in a closed state. Upon ATP depletion by phages, the Toprim domain opens to bind and cleave the DNA substrate. GajB, which docks on GajA, is activated by the cleaved DNA, ultimately leading to prokaryotic cell death. Our study presents a mechanistic landscape of Gabija activation. Structures of complexes containing GajA and GajB proteins of the prokaryotic Gabija anti-phage defence system reveal the mechanism of its activation after DNA cleavage upon ATP depletion.",

    "abstract": "The neural crest is an embryonic stem cell population unique to vertebrates1 whose expansion and diversification are thought to have promoted vertebrate evolution by enabling emergence of new cell types and structures such as jaws and peripheral ganglia2. Although jawless vertebrates have sensory ganglia, convention has it that trunk sympathetic chain ganglia arose only in jawed vertebrates3–8. Here, by contrast, we report the presence of trunk sympathetic neurons in the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, an extant jawless vertebrate. These neurons arise from sympathoblasts near the dorsal aorta that undergo noradrenergic specification through a transcriptional program homologous to that described in gnathostomes. Lamprey sympathoblasts populate the extracardiac space and extend along the length of the trunk in bilateral streams, expressing the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase. CM-DiI lineage tracing analysis further confirmed that these cells derive from the trunk neural crest. RNA sequencing of isolated ammocoete trunk sympathoblasts revealed gene profiles characteristic of sympathetic neuron function. Our findings challenge the prevailing dogma that posits that sympathetic ganglia are a gnathostome innovation, instead suggesting that a late-developing rudimentary sympathetic nervous system may have been characteristic of the earliest vertebrates. Challenging the belief that sympathetic ganglia are an innovation of jawed vertebrates, a study reports the presence of sympathetic neurons in an extant jawless vertebrate, the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus.",

    "abstract": "A central assumption of neuroscience is that long-term memories are represented by the same brain areas that encode sensory stimuli1. Neurons in inferotemporal (IT) cortex represent the sensory percept of visual objects using a distributed axis code2–4. Whether and how the same IT neural population represents the long-term memory of visual objects remains unclear. Here we examined how familiar faces are encoded in the IT anterior medial face patch (AM), perirhinal face patch (PR) and temporal pole face patch (TP). In AM and PR we observed that the encoding axis for familiar faces is rotated relative to that for unfamiliar faces at long latency; in TP this memory-related rotation was much weaker. Contrary to previous claims, the relative response magnitude to familiar versus unfamiliar faces was not a stable indicator of familiarity in any patch5–11. The mechanism underlying the memory-related axis change is likely intrinsic to IT cortex, because inactivation of PR did not affect axis change dynamics in AM. Overall, our results suggest that memories of familiar faces are represented in AM and perirhinal cortex by a distinct long-latency code, explaining how the same cell population can encode both the percept and memory of faces. We examined how familiar faces are encoded in inferotemporal, perirhinal and temporal pole face patches, and found that relative response magnitude to familiar versus unfamiliar faces was not a stable indicator of familiarity in any patch.",

    "abstract": "Concerted nucleophilic substitution, known as SN2 reaction, is a fundamental organic transformation used in synthesis to introduce new functional groups and construct carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds1. SN2 reactions typically involve backside attack of a nucleophile to the σ* orbital of a C(sp3)–X bond (X = halogen or other leaving group), resulting in complete inversion of a stereocentre2. By contrast, the corresponding stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution on electronically unbiased sp2 vinyl electrophiles, namely concerted SNV(σ) reaction, is much rarer, and so far limited to carefully designed substrates mostly in ring-forming processes3,4. Here we show that concerted SNV reactions can be accelerated by a proposed strain-release mechanism in metallated complexes, leading to the development of a general and stereospecific alkenylidene homologation of diverse organoboronates. This method enables the iterative incorporation of multiple alkenylidene units, giving cross-conjugated polyenes that are challenging to prepare otherwise. Further application to the synthesis of bioactive compounds containing multi-substituted alkenes is also demonstrated. Computational studies suggest an unusual SN2-like concerted pathway promoted by diminishing steric strain in the square planar transition state, which explains the high efficiency and stereoinversive feature of this metallate SNV reaction. We report an SNV reaction, a rare nucleophilic substitution that involves electronically unbiased vinyl electrophiles, which allows the synthesis of cross-conjugated polyenes and bioactive compounds with multi-substituted alkenes.",

    "abstract": "Organs have a distinctive yet often overlooked spatial arrangement in the body1–5. We propose that there is a logic to the shape of an organ and its proximity to its neighbours. Here, by using volumetric scans of many Drosophila melanogaster flies, we develop methods to quantify three-dimensional features of organ shape, position and interindividual variability. We find that both the shapes of organs and their relative arrangement are consistent yet differ between the sexes, and identify unexpected interorgan adjacencies and left–right organ asymmetries. Focusing on the intestine, which traverses the entire body, we investigate how sex differences in three-dimensional organ geometry arise. The configuration of the adult intestine is only partially determined by physical constraints imposed by adjacent organs; its sex-specific shape is actively maintained by mechanochemical crosstalk between gut muscles and vascular-like trachea. Indeed, sex-biased expression of a muscle-derived fibroblast growth factor-like ligand renders trachea sexually dimorphic. In turn, tracheal branches hold gut loops together into a male or female shape, with physiological consequences. Interorgan geometry represents a previously unrecognized level of biological complexity which might enable or confine communication across organs and could help explain sex or species differences in organ function. In fruit flies, three-dimensional organ arrangement is stereotypical, sexually dimorphic and actively maintained by muscle-vessel mechanochemical crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "Genetic screens have transformed our ability to interrogate cellular factor requirements for viral infections1,2, but most current approaches are limited in their sensitivity, biased towards early stages of infection and provide only simplistic phenotypic information that is often based on survival of infected cells2–4. Here, by engineering human cytomegalovirus to express single guide RNA libraries directly from the viral genome, we developed virus-encoded CRISPR-based direct readout screening (VECOS), a sensitive, versatile, viral-centric approach that enables profiling of different stages of viral infection in a pooled format. Using this approach, we identified hundreds of host dependency and restriction factors and quantified their direct effects on viral genome replication, viral particle secretion and infectiousness of secreted particles, providing a multi-dimensional perspective on virus–host interactions. These high-resolution measurements reveal that perturbations altering late stages in the life cycle of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) mostly regulate viral particle quality rather than quantity, establishing correct virion assembly as a critical stage that is heavily reliant on virus–host interactions. Overall, VECOS facilitates systematic high-resolution dissection of the role of human proteins during the infection cycle, providing a roadmap for in-depth study of host–herpesvirus interactions. A genetic screen that expresses single guide RNA libraries targeting host genes in the human cytomegalovirus genome enables identification of host factors and provides insights into their roles during the viral replication cycle.",

    "abstract": "Introducing the concept of topology has revolutionized materials classification, leading to the discovery of topological insulators and Dirac–Weyl semimetals1–3. One of the most fundamental theories underpinning topological materials is the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model4,5, which was developed in 1979—decades before the recognition of topological insulators—to describe conducting polymers. Distinct from the vast majority of known topological insulators with two and three dimensions1–3, the SSH model predicts a one-dimensional analogue of topological insulators, which hosts topological bound states at the endpoints of a chain4–8. To establish this unique and pivotal state, it is crucial to identify the low-energy excitations stemming from bound states, but this has remained unknown in solids because of the absence of suitable platforms. Here we report unusual electronic states that support the emergent bound states in elemental tellurium, the single helix of which was recently proposed to realize an extended version of the SSH chain9,10. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, we have shown spin-polarized in-gap states confined to the edges of the (0001) surface. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that these states are attributed to the interacting bound states originating from the one-dimensional array of SSH tellurium chains. Helices in solids offer a promising experimental platform for investigating exotic properties associated with the SSH chain and exploring topological phases through dimensionality control. Unusual electronic states derived from topological helix chains were observed that support the emergent bound states in elemental tellurium.",

Sulfur mass-independent fractionation records suggest that the rise of atmospheric O2 was oscillatory, with multiple returns to an anoxic state until perhaps 2.2 billion years ago1–3. Yet few constraints exist for contemporaneous marine oxygenation dynamics, precluding a holistic understanding of planetary oxygenation. Here we report thallium (Tl) isotope ratio and redox-sensitive element data for marine shales from the Transvaal Supergroup, South Africa. Synchronous with sulfur isotope evidence of atmospheric oxygenation in the same shales3, we found lower authigenic 205Tl/203Tl ratios indicative of widespread manganese oxide burial on an oxygenated seafloor and higher redox-sensitive element abundances consistent with expanded oxygenated waters. Both signatures disappear when the sulfur isotope data indicate a brief return to an anoxic atmospheric state. Our data connect recently identified atmospheric O2 dynamics on early Earth with the marine realm, marking an important turning point in Earth’s redox history away from heterogeneous and highly localized ‘oasis’-style oxygenation. The Great Oxidation Event represents a tipping point in Earth’s O2 mass balance—when more O2 was being produced than destroyed—that forever changed the habitability of worldwide oceans.",

    "abstract": "When mRNAs have been transcribed and processed in the nucleus, they are exported to the cytoplasm for translation. This export is mediated by the export receptor heterodimer Mex67–Mtr2 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (TAP–p15 in humans)1,2. Interestingly, many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) also leave the nucleus but it is currently unclear why they move to the cytoplasm3. Here we show that antisense RNAs (asRNAs) accelerate mRNA export by annealing with their sense counterparts through the helicase Dbp2. These double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) dominate export compared with single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) because they have a higher capacity and affinity for the export receptor Mex67. In this way, asRNAs boost gene expression, which is beneficial for cells. This is particularly important when the expression program changes. Consequently, the degradation of dsRNA, or the prevention of its formation, is toxic for cells. This mechanism illuminates the general cellular occurrence of asRNAs and explains their nuclear export. Antisense RNAs boost gene expression by accelerating the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through the Dbp2-mediated formation of double-stranded RNAs, which might explain the prevalence of antisense RNAs.",

    "abstract": "Mass is commonly considered an intrinsic property of matter, but modern physics reveals particle masses to have complex origins1, such as the Higgs mechanism in high-energy physics2,3. In crystal lattices such as graphene, relativistic Dirac particles can exist as low-energy quasiparticles4 with masses imparted by lattice symmetry-breaking perturbations5–8. These mass-generating mechanisms all assume Hermiticity, or the conservation of energy in detail. Using a photonic synthetic lattice, we show experimentally that Dirac masses can be generated by means of non-Hermitian perturbations based on optical gain and loss. We then explore how the spacetime engineering of the gain and loss-induced Dirac mass affects the quasiparticles. As we show, the quasiparticles undergo Klein tunnelling at spatial boundaries, but a local breaking of a non-Hermitian symmetry can produce a new flux non-conservation effect at the domain walls. At a temporal boundary that abruptly flips the sign of the Dirac mass, we observe a variant of the time-reflection phenomenon: in the non-relativistic limit, the Dirac quasiparticle reverses its velocity, whereas in the relativistic limit, the original velocity is retained. By using a photonic synthetic lattice, it can be experimentally demonstrated that Dirac masses can be induced by means of non-Hermitian perturbations based on optical gain and loss.",

    "abstract": "In the period between 5,300 and 4,900 calibrated years before present (cal. bp), populations across large parts of Europe underwent a period of demographic decline1,2. However, the cause of this so-called Neolithic decline is still debated. Some argue for an agricultural crisis resulting in the decline3, others for the spread of an early form of plague4. Here we use population-scale ancient genomics to infer ancestry, social structure and pathogen infection in 108 Scandinavian Neolithic individuals from eight megalithic graves and a stone cist. We find that the Neolithic plague was widespread, detected in at least 17% of the sampled population and across large geographical distances. We demonstrate that the disease spread within the Neolithic community in three distinct infection events within a period of around 120 years. Variant graph-based pan-genomics shows that the Neolithic plague genomes retained ancestral genomic variation present in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, including virulence factors associated with disease outcomes. In addition, we reconstruct four multigeneration pedigrees, the largest of which consists of 38 individuals spanning six generations, showing a patrilineal social organization. Lastly, we document direct genomic evidence for Neolithic female exogamy in a woman buried in a different megalithic tomb than her brothers. Taken together, our findings provide a detailed reconstruction of plague spread within a large patrilineal kinship group and identify multiple plague infections in a population dated to the beginning of the Neolithic decline. Population-scale ancient genomics are used to infer ancestry, social structure and pathogen infection in 108 Scandinavian Neolithic individuals from eight megalithic graves and a stone cist, showing that Neolithic plague was widespread.",

    "abstract": "Platelet homeostasis is essential for vascular integrity and immune defence1,2. Although the process of platelet formation by fragmenting megakaryocytes (MKs; thrombopoiesis) has been extensively studied, the cellular and molecular mechanisms required to constantly replenish the pool of MKs by their progenitor cells (megakaryopoiesis) remains unclear3,4. Here we use intravital imaging to track the cellular dynamics of megakaryopoiesis over days. We identify plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) as homeostatic sensors that monitor the bone marrow for apoptotic MKs and deliver IFNα to the MK niche triggering local on-demand proliferation and maturation of MK progenitors. This pDC-dependent feedback loop is crucial for MK and platelet homeostasis at steady state and under stress. pDCs are best known for their ability to function as vigilant detectors of viral infection5. We show that virus-induced activation of pDCs interferes with their function as homeostatic sensors of megakaryopoiesis. Consequently, activation of pDCs by SARS-CoV-2 leads to excessive megakaryopoiesis. Together, we identify a pDC-dependent homeostatic circuit that involves innate immune sensing and demand-adapted release of inflammatory mediators to maintain homeostasis of the megakaryocytic lineage. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells monitor the bone marrow for apoptotic megakaryocytes (MKs) and deliver IFNα to the MK niche, triggering local on-demand proliferation and maturation of MK progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Giant exoplanets orbiting close to their host stars are unlikely to have formed in their present configurations1. These ‘hot Jupiter’ planets are instead thought to have migrated inward from beyond the ice line and several viable migration channels have been proposed, including eccentricity excitation through angular-momentum exchange with a third body followed by tidally driven orbital circularization2,3. The discovery of the extremely eccentric (e = 0.93) giant exoplanet HD 80606 b (ref. 4) provided observational evidence that hot Jupiters may have formed through this high-eccentricity tidal-migration pathway5. However, no similar hot-Jupiter progenitors have been found and simulations predict that one factor affecting the efficacy of this mechanism is exoplanet mass, as low-mass planets are more likely to be tidally disrupted during periastron passage6–8. Here we present spectroscopic and photometric observations of TIC 241249530 b, a high-mass, transiting warm Jupiter with an extreme orbital eccentricity of e = 0.94. The orbit of TIC 241249530 b is consistent with a history of eccentricity oscillations and a future tidal circularization trajectory. Our analysis of the mass and eccentricity distributions of the transiting-warm-Jupiter population further reveals a correlation between high mass and high eccentricity. The spectroscopic and photometric observations of a high-mass, transiting warm Jupiter, TIC 241249530 b, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.94, provide evidence that hot Jupiters may have formed by means of a high-eccentricity tidal-migration pathway.",

    "abstract": "The brain is highly sensitive to damage caused by infection and inflammation1,2. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus and the cause of herpes simplex encephalitis3. It is unknown whether neuron-specific antiviral factors control virus replication to prevent infection and excessive inflammatory responses, hence protecting the brain. Here we identify TMEFF1 as an HSV-1 restriction factor using genome-wide CRISPR screening. TMEFF1 is expressed specifically in neurons of the central nervous system and is not regulated by type I interferon, the best-known innate antiviral system controlling virus infections. Depletion of TMEFF1 in stem-cell-derived human neurons led to elevated viral replication and neuronal death following HSV-1 infection. TMEFF1 blocked the HSV-1 replication cycle at the level of viral entry through interactions with nectin-1 and non-muscle myosin heavy chains IIA and IIB, which are core proteins in virus–cell binding and virus–cell fusion, respectively4–6. Notably, Tmeff1−/− mice exhibited increased susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in the brain but not in the periphery. Within the brain, elevated viral load was observed specifically in neurons. Our study identifies TMEFF1 as a neuron-specific restriction factor essential for prevention of HSV-1 replication in the central nervous system.

    "abstract": "Continuous attractors are an emergent property of neural population dynamics that have been hypothesized to encode continuous variables such as head direction and eye position1–4. In mammals, direct evidence of neural implementation of a continuous attractor has been hindered by the challenge of targeting perturbations to specific neurons within contributing ensembles2,3. Dynamical systems modelling has revealed that neurons in the hypothalamus exhibit approximate line-attractor dynamics in male mice during aggressive encounters5. We have previously hypothesized that these dynamics may encode the variable intensity and persistence of an aggressive internal state. Here we report that these neurons also showed line-attractor dynamics in head-fixed mice observing aggression6. This allowed us to identify and manipulate line-attractor-contributing neurons using two-photon calcium imaging and holographic optogenetic perturbations. On-manifold perturbations yielded integration of optogenetic stimulation pulses and persistent activity that drove the system along the line attractor, while transient off-manifold perturbations were followed by rapid relaxation back into the attractor. Furthermore, single-cell stimulation and imaging revealed selective functional connectivity among attractor-contributing neurons. Notably, individual differences among mice in line-attractor stability were correlated with the degree of functional connectivity among attractor-contributing neurons. Mechanistic recurrent neural network modelling indicated that dense subnetwork connectivity and slow neurotransmission7 best recapitulate our empirical findings. Our work bridges circuit and manifold levels3, providing causal evidence of continuous attractor dynamics encoding an affective internal state in the mammalian hypothalamus. Single-cell optogenetic stimulation and calcium imaging experiments provide direct evidence of line-attractor dynamics, including functional network connectivity, in the mammalian hypothalamus.",

    "abstract": "Chaperonins are large barrel-shaped complexes that mediate ATP-dependent protein folding1–3. The bacterial chaperonin GroEL forms juxtaposed rings that bind unfolded protein and the lid-shaped cofactor GroES at their apertures. In vitro analyses of the chaperonin reaction have shown that substrate protein folds, unimpaired by aggregation, while transiently encapsulated in the GroEL central cavity by GroES4–6. To determine the functional stoichiometry of GroEL, GroES and client protein in situ, here we visualized chaperonin complexes in their natural cellular environment using cryo-electron tomography. We find that, under various growth conditions, around 55–70% of GroEL binds GroES asymmetrically on one ring, with the remainder populating symmetrical complexes. Bound substrate protein is detected on the free ring of the asymmetrical complex, defining the substrate acceptor state. In situ analysis of GroEL–GroES chambers, validated by high-resolution structures obtained in vitro, showed the presence of encapsulated substrate protein in a folded state before release into the cytosol. Based on a comprehensive quantification and conformational analysis of chaperonin complexes, we propose a GroEL–GroES reaction cycle that consists of linked asymmetrical and symmetrical subreactions mediating protein folding. Our findings illuminate the native conformational and functional chaperonin cycle directly within cells.

    "abstract": "Early plant responses to different stress situations often encompass cytosolic Ca2+ increases, plasma membrane depolarization and the generation of reactive oxygen species1–3. However, the mechanisms by which these signalling elements are translated into defined physiological outcomes are poorly understood. Here, to study the basis for encoding of specificity in plant signal processing, we used light-gated ion channels (channelrhodopsins). We developed a genetically engineered channelrhodopsin variant called XXM 2.0 with high Ca2+ conductance that enabled triggering cytosolic Ca2+ elevations in planta. Plant responses to light-induced Ca2+ influx through XXM 2.0 were studied side by side with effects caused by an anion efflux through the light-gated anion channelrhodopsin ACR1 2.04. Although both tools triggered membrane depolarizations, their activation led to distinct plant stress responses: XXM 2.0-induced Ca2+ signals stimulated production of reactive oxygen species and defence mechanisms; ACR1 2.0-mediated anion efflux triggered drought stress responses. Our findings imply that discrete Ca2+ signals and anion efflux serve as triggers for specific metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming enabling plants to adapt to particular stress situations. Our optogenetics approach unveiled that within plant leaves, distinct physiological responses are triggered by specific ion fluxes, which are accompanied by similar electrical signals. Using new optogenetic tools to induce distinct ion fluxes, a study shows that these discrete signals trigger different metabolic and transcriptional pathways that allow plants to respond to specific types of stress.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations are abundant in the tissues of healthy individuals, but rarely form tumours1–3. Yet, the underlying protection mechanisms are largely unknown. To resolve these mechanisms in mouse mammary tissue, we use lineage tracing to map the fate of wild-type and Brca1−/−;Trp53−/− cells, and find that both follow a similar pattern of loss and spread within ducts. Clonal analysis reveals that ducts consist of small repetitive units of self-renewing cells that give rise to short-lived descendants. This offers a first layer of protection as any descendants, including oncogenic mutant cells, are constantly lost, thereby limiting the spread of mutations to a single stem cell-descendant unit. Local tissue remodelling during consecutive oestrous cycles leads to the cooperative and stochastic loss and replacement of self-renewing cells. This process provides a second layer of protection, leading to the elimination of most mutant clones while enabling the minority that by chance survive to expand beyond the stem cell-descendant unit. This leads to fields of mutant cells spanning large parts of the epithelial network, predisposing it for transformation. Eventually, clone expansion becomes restrained by the geometry of the ducts, providing a third layer of protection. Together, these mechanisms act to eliminate most cells that acquire somatic mutations at the expense of driving the accelerated expansion of a minority of cells, which can colonize large areas, leading to field cancerization. The authors use lineage tracing to map the fate of wild-type and Brca1−/−;Trp53−/− cells in the adult mouse mammary gland, identifying three layers of protection that limit the spread of mutant cells at the expense of allowing a minority of mutant cells to expand, which leads to field cancerization.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin structure is a key regulator of DNA transcription, replication and repair1. In humans, the TIP60–EP400 complex (TIP60-C) is a 20-subunit assembly that affects chromatin structure through two enzymatic activities: ATP-dependent exchange of histone H2A–H2B for H2A.Z–H2B, and histone acetylation. In yeast, however, these activities are performed by two independent complexes—SWR1 and NuA4, respectively2,3. How the activities of the two complexes are merged into one supercomplex in humans, and what this association entails for the structure and mechanism of the proteins and their recruitment to chromatin, are unknown. Here we describe the structure of the endogenous human TIP60-C. We find a three-lobed architecture composed of SWR1-like (SWR1L) and NuA4-like (NuA4L) parts, which associate with a TRRAP activator-binding module. The huge EP400 subunit contains the ATPase motor, traverses the junction between SWR1L and NuA4L twice and constitutes the scaffold of the three-lobed architecture. NuA4L is completely rearranged compared with its yeast counterpart. TRRAP is flexibly tethered to NuA4L—in stark contrast to its robust connection to the completely opposite side of NuA4 in yeast4–7. A modelled nucleosome bound to SWR1L, supported by tests of TIP60-C activity, suggests that some aspects of the histone exchange mechanism diverge from what is seen in yeast8,9. Furthermore, a fixed actin module (as opposed to the mobile actin subcomplex in SWR1; ref. 8), the flexibility of TRRAP and the weak effect of extranucleosomal DNA on exchange activity lead to a different, activator-based mode of enlisting TIP60-C to chromatin. The structure of human TIP60-C uncovers a molecular machine that modifies and exchanges histones in the nucleosome, illustrating how vertebrates merge these activities, which are carried out by two independent assemblies in yeast.",

    "abstract": "Space radiation is a notable hazard for long-duration human spaceflight1. Associated risks include cancer, cataracts, degenerative diseases2 and tissue reactions from large, acute exposures3. Space radiation originates from diverse sources, including galactic cosmic rays4, trapped-particle (Van Allen) belts5 and solar-particle events6. Previous radiation data are from the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle in low-Earth orbit protected by heavy shielding and Earth’s magnetic field7,8 and lightly shielded interplanetary robotic probes such as Mars Science Laboratory and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter9,10. Limited data from the Apollo missions11–13 and ground measurements with substantial caveats are also available14. Here we report radiation measurements from the heavily shielded Orion spacecraft on the uncrewed Artemis I lunar mission. At differing shielding locations inside the vehicle, a fourfold difference in dose rates was observed during proton-belt passes that are similar to large, reference solar-particle events. Interplanetary cosmic-ray dose equivalent rates in Orion were as much as 60% lower than previous observations9. Furthermore, a change in orientation of the spacecraft during the proton-belt transit resulted in a reduction of radiation dose rates of around 50%. These measurements validate the Orion for future crewed exploration and inform future human spaceflight mission design. Measurements from the heavily shielded Orion spacecraft during the uncrewed Artemis I mission show dose-rate reductions due to shielding and orientation for Van Allen belt crossings and quantify the interplanetary cosmic-ray radiation in a human-rated spacecraft.",

    "abstract": "The jet stream is an important dynamic driver of climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes1–3. Modern variability in the position of summer jet stream latitude in the North Atlantic–European sector (EU JSL) promotes dipole patterns in air pressure, temperature, precipitation and drought between northwestern and southeastern Europe. EU JSL variability and its impacts on regional climatic extremes and societal events are poorly understood, particularly before anthropogenic warming. Based on three temperature-sensitive European tree-ring records, we develop a reconstruction of interannual summer EU JSL variability over the period 1300–2004 ce (R2 = 38.5%) and compare it to independent historical documented climatic and societal records, such as grape harvest, grain prices, plagues and human mortality. Here we show contrasting summer climate extremes associated with EU JSL variability back to 1300 ce as well as biophysical, economic and human demographic impacts, including wildfires and epidemics. In light of projections for altered jet stream behaviour and intensified climate extremes, our findings underscore the importance of considering EU JSL variability when evaluating amplified future climate risk. Tree-ring records used to reconstruct the variability of the European jet stream from 1300 to 2004 ce show modulation of extreme regional climate events and extensive impacts on agriculture and human well-being.",

The starting point for many investigations will become neuronal wiring diagrams, which will be interpreted to make theoretical predictions about function. Here I demonstrate this emerging approach with the Drosophila optic lobe, analysing its structure to predict that three Dm3 (refs. 1–4) and three TmY (refs. 2,4) cell types are part of a circuit that serves the function of form vision. Receptive fields are predicted from connectivity, and suggest that the cell types encode the local orientation of a visual stimulus. Extraclassical5,6 receptive fields are also predicted, with implications for robust orientation tuning7, position invariance8,9 and completion of noisy or illusory contours10,11. The TmY types synapse onto neurons that project from the optic lobe to the central brain12,13, which are conjectured to compute conjunctions and disjunctions of oriented features. My predictions can be tested through neurophysiology, which would constrain the parameters and biophysical mechanisms in neural network models of fly vision14. A study demonstrates the interpretation of a neuronal wiring diagram of the optic lobe of Drosophila, yielding theoretical predictions about visual functions of this structure.",

    "abstract": "Many animals use visual information to navigate1–4, but how such information is encoded and integrated by the navigation system remains incompletely understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, EPG neurons in the central complex compute the heading direction5 by integrating visual input from ER neurons6–12, which are part of the anterior visual pathway (AVP)10,13–16. Here we densely reconstruct all neurons in the AVP using electron-microscopy data17. The AVP comprises four neuropils, sequentially linked by three major classes of neurons: MeTu neurons10,14,15, which connect the medulla in the optic lobe to the small unit of the anterior optic tubercle (AOTUsu) in the central brain; TuBu neurons9,16, which connect the AOTUsu to the bulb neuropil; and ER neurons6–12, which connect the bulb to the EPG neurons. On the basis of morphologies, connectivity between neural classes and the locations of synapses, we identify distinct information channels that originate from four types of MeTu neurons, and we further divide these into ten subtypes according to the presynaptic connections in the medulla and the postsynaptic connections in the AOTUsu. Using the connectivity of the entire AVP and the dendritic fields of the MeTu neurons in the optic lobes, we infer potential visual features and the visual area from which any ER neuron receives input. We confirm some of these predictions physiologically. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding how distinct sensory features can be extracted and transformed across multiple processing stages to construct higher-order cognitive representations. Electron-microscopy data are used to reconstruct the neurons that make up the anterior visual pathway in the Drosophila brain, providing insight into how visual features are encoded to guide navigation.",

    "abstract": "Behavioural time scale plasticity (BTSP) is non-Hebbian plasticity induced by integrating presynaptic and postsynaptic components separated by a behaviourally relevant time scale (seconds)1. BTSP in hippocampal CA1 neurons underlies place cell formation. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable synapse-specific plasticity on a behavioural time scale are unknown. Here we show that BTSP can be induced in a single dendritic spine using two-photon glutamate uncaging paired with postsynaptic current injection temporally separated by a behavioural time scale. Using an improved Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) sensor, we did not detect CaMKII activation during this BTSP induction. Instead, we observed dendritic, delayed and stochastic CaMKII activation (DDSC) associated with Ca2+ influx and plateau potentials 10–100 s after BTSP induction. DDSC required both presynaptic and postsynaptic activity, which suggests that CaMKII can integrate these two signals. Also, optogenetically blocking CaMKII 15–30 s after the BTSP protocol inhibited synaptic potentiation, which indicated that DDSC is an essential mechanism of BTSP. IP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ release facilitated both DDSC and BTSP. Thus, our study suggests that non-synapse-specific CaMKII activation provides an instructive signal with an extensive time window over tens of seconds during BTSP. Induction of behavioural time scale plasticity leads to dendritic, delayed and stochastic Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II activation, findings that clarify the mechanisms that underlie place cell formation.",

    "abstract": "The Tesla valve benefits the rectification of fluid flow in microfluidic systems1–6 and inspires researchers to design modern solid-state electronic and thermal rectifiers referring to fluid-rectification mechanisms in a liquid-state context. In contrast to the rectification of fluids in microfluidic channels, the rectification of thermal phonons in micro-solid channels presents increased complexity owing to the lack of momentum-conserving collisions between phonons and the infrequent occurrence of liquid-like phonon flows. Recently, investigations and revelations of phonon hydrodynamics in graphitic materials7–10 have opened up new avenues for achieving thermal rectification. Here we demonstrate a phonon hydrodynamics approach to realize the rectification of heat conduction in isotopically enriched graphite crystals. We design a micrometre-scale Tesla valve within 90-nm-thick graphite and experimentally observe a discernible 15.2% difference in thermal conductivity between opposite directions at 45 K. This work marks an important step towards using collective phonon behaviour for thermal management in microscale and nanoscale electronic devices, paving the way for thermal rectification in solids. By making use of the hydrodynamic behaviour of phonons in graphitic materials, a thermal version of a micrometre-scale Tesla valve is demonstrated, resulting in a method for thermal rectification in solids.",

Despite extensive research on surface marine heatwaves (MHWs) and marine cold spells (MCSs) based on satellite observations6,7, our knowledge of these extreme events and their drivers in the subsurface ocean—home to the majority of marine organisms—is very limited8,9. Here we present global observational evidence for the important role of mesoscale eddies in the occurrence and intensification of subsurface MHWs and MCSs. We found that 80% of measured MHWs and MCSs below a depth of 100 m do not concur with surface events. In contrast to the weak link between surface MHWs (MCSs) and ocean eddies, nearly one-third of subsurface MHWs (MCSs) in the global ocean, and more than half of such events in subtropical gyres and mid-latitude main current systems, occur within anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies. These eddy-associated temperature extremes have intensified at rates greater than background level in past decades, suggesting a growing impact of ocean eddies on subsurface MHWs and MCSs with ongoing global warming. With climate change, mesoscale eddies are increasing in importance as drivers of subsurface extreme marine heatwaves and cold spells that do not correlate with surface events, with implications for severe impacts on marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services.",

    "abstract": "Regulated start-codon selection has the potential to reshape the proteome through the differential production of upstream open reading frames, canonical proteins, and alternative translational isoforms1–3. However, conditions under which start codon selection is altered remain poorly defined. Here, using transcriptome-wide translation-initiation-site profiling4, we reveal a global increase in the stringency of start-codon selection during mammalian mitosis. Low-efficiency initiation sites are preferentially repressed in mitosis, resulting in pervasive changes in the translation of thousands of start sites and their corresponding protein products. This enhanced stringency of start-codon selection during mitosis results from increased association between the 40S ribosome and the key regulator of start-codon selection, eIF1. We find that increased eIF1–40S ribosome interaction during mitosis is mediated by the release of a nuclear pool of eIF1 upon nuclear envelope breakdown. Selectively depleting the nuclear pool of eIF1 eliminates the change to translational stringency during mitosis, resulting in altered synthesis of thousands of protein isoforms. In addition, preventing mitotic translational rewiring results in substantially increased cell death and decreased mitotic slippage in cells that experience a mitotic delay induced by anti-mitotic chemotherapies. Thus, cells globally control stringency of translation initiation, which has critical roles during the mammalian cell cycle in preserving mitotic cell physiology. Transcriptome-wide profiling studies in mammalian cells show that the stringency of start-codon selection is increased during mitosis, and that this is regulated by nuclear eIF1 to preserve mitotic arrest physiology.",

    "abstract": "Aqueous redox flow batteries with halide-based catholytes (where the halogen atom (X) is Br or I) are promising for sustainable grid energy storage. However, the formation of polyhalides during electrochemical charging and the associated phase separation into X2 limits the operable state of charge (SoC), results in vaporization and self-discharge inefficiencies, and spurs complete device failure1–3. Here we introduce soft–hard zwitterionic trappers (SH-ZITs) as complexing agents composed of a polyhalide-complexing ‘soft’ cationic motif and a water-soluble ‘hard’ anionic motif to enable homogeneous halide cycling. More than 300 structures were designed and 13 were characterized, showcasing the ability to complex polyhalides in homogeneous aqueous solution, to deter cation-exchange membrane crossover and to alter the electrochemical electrode mechanism. In flow battery cycling at a standard catholyte SoC of 66.6 per cent (stoichiometrically X3–), an average coulombic efficiency of more than 99.9 per cent at 40 milliamperes per square centimetre with no apparent decay was observed after more than 1,000 cycles over 2 months, with stability at elevated temperatures also demonstrated. Interestingly, SH-ZITs enable homogeneous cycling of the halide catholyte up to 90 per cent SoC at 2 moles per litre (47.7 ampere-hours per litre) for bromide, revealing previously unknown polyhalide regimes to be studied. Ultimately, SH-ZIT enables ultrahigh catholyte capacity utilization up to over 120 ampere-hours per litre at 80 per cent SoC with homogeneous cycling as well as the ability to pair with a zinc anode in a hybrid flow battery. Zwitterionic additives composed of a ‘soft’ organic cation and a ‘hard’ anion enable homogeneous halide cycling in aqueous halide redox flow batteries, resulting in improved cycling life and stability.",

We reveal that IL-17-producing γδ (γδ17) T cells, in particular, rely on the molecular clock to maintain adipose tissue homeostasis, and exhibit a robust circadian rhythm for RORγt and IL-17A across adipose depots, which peaks at night. In mice, loss of the molecular clock in the CD45 compartment (Bmal1∆Vav1) affects the production of IL-17 by adipose γδ17 T cells, but not cytokine production by αβ or IFNγ-producing γδ (γδIFNγ) T cells. Circadian IL-17 is essential for de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue, and mice with an adipocyte-specific deficiency in IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) have defects in de novo lipogenesis. Whole-body metabolic analysis in vivo shows that Il17a−/−Il17f−/− mice (which lack expression of IL-17A and IL-17F) have defects in their circadian rhythm for de novo lipogenesis, which results in disruptions to their whole-body metabolic rhythm and core-body-temperature rhythm. This study identifies a crucial role for IL-17 in whole-body metabolic homeostasis and shows that de novo lipogenesis is a major target of IL-17. Innate IL-17-producing T cells—in particular, adipose γδ17 T cells—are enriched in molecular-clock genes, and the circadian expression of IL-17A and RORγt by these cells has a role in maintaining local homeostasis and regulating lipogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxic cancer cells resist many antineoplastic therapies and can seed recurrence1,2. We previously found that either deficiency or inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP1B) promotes human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer cell death in hypoxia by activation of RNF213 (ref. 3), a large protein with multiple AAA-ATPase domains and two ubiquitin ligase domains (RING and RZ) implicated in Moyamoya disease, lipotoxicity and innate immunity4. Here we report that PTP1B and ABL1/2 reciprocally control RNF213 tyrosine phosphorylation and, consequently, its oligomerization and RZ domain activation. The RZ domain ubiquitylates and induces the degradation of the major NF-κB regulator CYLD/SPATA2. Decreased CYLD/SPATA2 levels lead to NF-κB activation and induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome which, together with hypoxia-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, triggers pyroptotic cell death. Consistent with this model, CYLD deletion phenocopies, whereas NLRP3 deletion blocks, the effects of PTP1B deficiency on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer xenograft growth. Reconstitution studies with RNF213 mutants confirm that the RZ domain mediates tumour cell death. In concert, our results identify a unique, potentially targetable PTP1B–RNF213–CYLD–SPATA2 pathway critical for the control of inflammatory cell death in hypoxic tumours, provide new insights into RNF213 regulation and have potential implications for the pathogenesis of Moyamoya disease, inflammatory disorders and autoimmune disease. We find that PTP1B and ABL1/2 reciprocally control RNF213 tyrosine phosphorylation and its oligomerization and RZ domain activation, and identify a unique PTP1B–RNF213–CYLD–SPATA2 pathway critical for the control of inflammatory cell death in hypoxic tumours.",

    "abstract": "The phosphorylation of synaptic proteins is a significant biochemical reaction that controls the sleep–wake cycle in mammals1–3. Protein phosphorylation in vivo is reversibly regulated by kinases and phosphatases. In this study, we investigate a pair of kinases and phosphatases that reciprocally regulate sleep duration. First, we perform a comprehensive screen of protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family genes by generating 40 gene knockout mouse lines using prenatal and postnatal CRISPR targeting. We identify a regulatory subunit of PKA (Prkar2b), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1; Pppr1r9b) and catalytic and regulatory subunits of calcineurin (also known as PP2B) (Ppp3ca and Ppp3r1) as sleep control genes. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated stimulation of PKA and PP1–calcineurin activities, we show that PKA is a wake-promoting kinase, whereas PP1 and calcineurin function as sleep-promoting phosphatases. The importance of these phosphatases in sleep regulation is supported by the marked changes in sleep duration associated with their increased and decreased activities, ranging from approximately 17.3 h per day (PP1 expression) to 4.3 h per day (postnatal CRISPR targeting of calcineurin). Localization signals to the excitatory post-synapse are necessary for these phosphatases to exert their sleep-promoting effects. Furthermore, the wake-promoting effect of PKA localized to the excitatory post-synapse negated the sleep-promoting effect of PP1–calcineurin. These findings indicate that PKA and PP1–calcineurin have competing functions in sleep regulation at excitatory post-synapses. Calcineurin–PP1 and PKA acting at excitatory post-synapses reciprocally regulate sleep duration in mice, whereby PKA promotes wakefulness and calcineurin–PP1 promote sleep.",

    "abstract": "The neuromodulators dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) powerfully regulate associative learning1–8. Similarities in the activity and connectivity of these neuromodulatory systems have inspired competing models of how DA and 5HT interact to drive the formation of new associations9–14. However, these hypotheses have not been tested directly because it has not been possible to interrogate and manipulate multiple neuromodulatory systems in a single subject. Here we establish a mouse model that enables simultaneous genetic access to the brain’s DA and 5HT neurons. Anterograde tracing revealed the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to be a putative hotspot for the integration of convergent DA and 5HT signals. Simultaneous recording of DA and 5HT axon activity, together with genetically encoded DA and 5HT sensor recordings, revealed that rewards increase DA signalling and decrease 5HT signalling in the NAc. Optogenetically dampening DA or 5HT reward responses individually produced modest behavioural deficits in an appetitive conditioning task, while blunting both signals together profoundly disrupted learning and reinforcement. Optogenetically reproducing DA and 5HT reward responses together was sufficient to drive the acquisition of new associations and supported reinforcement more potently than either manipulation did alone. Together, these results demonstrate that striatal DA and 5HT signals shape learning by exerting opponent control of reinforcement. A double-transgenic mouse model that enables monitoring or manipulation of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously in the brain’s nucleus accumbens shows that these neuromodulators have opponent roles in reward learning.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic receptors that mediate antigen-dependent cell responses are transforming therapeutics, drug discovery and basic research1,2. However, established technologies such as chimeric antigen receptors3 can only detect immobilized antigens, have limited output scope and lack built-in drug control3–7. Here we engineer synthetic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are capable of driving a wide range of native or non-native cellular processes in response to a user-defined antigen. We achieve modular antigen gating by engineering and fusing a conditional auto-inhibitory domain onto GPCR scaffolds. Antigen binding to a fused nanobody relieves auto-inhibition and enables receptor activation by drug, thus generating programmable antigen-gated G-protein-coupled engineered receptors (PAGERs). We create PAGERs that are responsive to more than a dozen biologically and therapeutically important soluble and cell-surface antigens in a single step from corresponding nanobody binders. Different PAGER scaffolds allow antigen binding to drive transgene expression, real-time fluorescence or endogenous G-protein activation, enabling control of diverse cellular functions. We demonstrate multiple applications of PAGER, including induction of T cell migration along a soluble antigen gradient, control of macrophage differentiation, secretion of therapeutic antibodies and inhibition of neuronal activity in mouse brain slices. Owing to its modular design and generalizability, we expect PAGERs to have broad utility in discovery and translational science. Modular synthetic G-protein-coupled receptors with nanobody-based ligand-recognition domains can be designed and used to programme transgene expression, real-time fluorescence or endogenous G-protein activation in response to soluble or cell-surface ligands, enabling control of diverse cellular behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is associated with a decline in the number and fitness of adult stem cells1,2. Ageing-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress tumorigenesis3,4, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here we use physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered5,6 mouse models and primary cells5,6 to demonstrate that ageing suppresses lung cancer initiation and progression by degrading the stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This phenotype is underpinned by the ageing-associated induction of the transcription factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice and humans, which leads to functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1–lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation rescues stemness and promotes the tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. Conversely, targeting the NUPR1–lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young alveolar cells through ferroptosis induction. Ageing-associated DNA hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites is associated with increased NUPR1 expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells through DNA methylation inhibition. We uncover that ageing drives functional iron insufficiency that leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis but promotes resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have implications for the therapeutic modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most human cancers initiate at a young age, thereby highlighting the importance of directing cancer prevention efforts towards young individuals. Studies using mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma identify an association between age, iron homeostasis and tumour initiation potential that involves NUPR1 and lipocalin-2.",

    "abstract": "Aircraft observations have revealed ubiquitous new particle formation in the tropical upper troposphere over the Amazon1,2 and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans3,4. Although the vapours involved remain unknown, recent satellite observations have revealed surprisingly high night-time isoprene mixing ratios of up to 1 part per billion by volume (ppbv) in the tropical upper troposphere5. Here, in experiments performed with the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber, we report new particle formation initiated by the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with isoprene at upper-tropospheric temperatures of −30 °C and −50 °C. We find that isoprene-oxygenated organic molecules (IP-OOM) nucleate at concentrations found in the upper troposphere, without requiring any more vapours. Moreover, the nucleation rates are enhanced 100-fold by extremely low concentrations of sulfuric acid or iodine oxoacids above 105 cm−3, reaching rates around 30 cm−3 s−1 at acid concentrations of 106 cm−3. Our measurements show that nucleation involves sequential addition of IP-OOM, together with zero or one acid molecule in the embryonic molecular clusters. IP-OOM also drive rapid particle growth at 3–60 nm h−1. We find that rapid nucleation and growth rates persist in the presence of NOx at upper-tropospheric concentrations from lightning. Our laboratory measurements show that isoprene emitted by rainforests may drive rapid new particle formation in extensive regions of the tropical upper troposphere1,2, resulting in tens of thousands of particles per cubic centimetre. Experiments performed in the CERN CLOUD chamber show that, under upper-tropospheric conditions, new atmospheric particle formation may be initiated by the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with isoprene emitted by rainforests.",

    "abstract": "Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are megaenzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of many clinically important natural products, from early modern medicines (penicillin, bacitracin) to current blockbuster drugs (cubicin, vancomycin) and newly approved therapeutics (rezafungin)1,2. The key chemical step in these biosyntheses is amide bond formation between aminoacyl building blocks, catalysed by the condensation (C) domain3. There has been much debate over the mechanism of this reaction3–12. NRPS condensation has been difficult to fully characterize because it is one of many successive reactions in the NRPS synthetic cycle and because the canonical substrates are each attached transiently as thioesters to mobile carrier domains, which are often both contained in the same very flexible protein as the C domain. Here we have produced a dimodular NRPS protein in two parts, modified each with appropriate non-hydrolysable substrate analogues13,14, assembled the two parts with protein ligation15, and solved the structures of the substrate- and product-bound states. The structures show the precise orientation of the megaenzyme preparing the nucleophilic attack of its key chemical step, and enable biochemical assays and quantum mechanical simulations to precisely interrogate the reaction. These data suggest that NRPS C domains use a concerted reaction mechanism, whereby the active-site histidine likely functions not as a general base, but as a crucial stabilizing hydrogen bond acceptor for the developing ammonium. The condensation domains of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases use a concerted reaction mechanism in which the active site histidine probably serves as a crucial stabilizing hydrogen bond acceptor for the developing ammonium.",

In this rate-limiting step, the heterotrimeric protein eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F must recognize and productively interact with the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA and subsequently activate the message1–3. Despite its fundamental, regulatory role in gene expression, the molecular events underlying cap recognition and mRNA activation remain unclear3. Here we generate a single-molecule fluorescence imaging system to examine the dynamics with which eIF4F discriminates productive and non-productive locations on full-length, native mRNA molecules. At the single-molecule level, we observe stochastic sampling of eIF4F along the length of the mRNA and identify allosteric communication between the eIF4F subunits that ultimately drive cap-recognition and subsequent activation of the message. Our experiments uncover functions for each subunit of eIF4F and we conclude by presenting a model for mRNA activation that precisely defines the composition of the activated message. This model provides a general framework for understanding how mRNA molecules may be discriminated from one another and how other RNA-binding proteins may control the efficiency of translation initiation. Allosteric communication between the eIF4F subunits drives mRNA cap-recognition and subsequent activation of the message.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic life is strongly structured by the distribution of light, which, besides attenuation in intensity, exhibits a continuous change in the spectrum with depth1. The extent to which these light changes are perceived by phytoplankton through photoreceptors is still inadequately known. We addressed this issue by integrating functional studies of diatom phytochrome (DPH) photoreceptors in model species2 with environmental surveys of their distribution and activity. Here, by developing an in vivo dose–response assay to light spectral variations mediated by DPH, we show that DPH can trigger photoreversible responses across the entire light spectrum, resulting in a change in DPH photoequilibrium with depth. By generating dph mutants in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, we also demonstrate that under simulated low-blue-light conditions of ocean depth, DPH regulates photosynthesis acclimation, thus linking optical depth detection with a functional response. The latitudinal distribution of DPH-containing diatoms from permanently stratified regions to seasonally mixed regions suggests an adaptive value of DPH functions in coping with vertical displacements in the water column. By establishing DPH as a detector of optical depth, this study provides a new view of how information embedded in the underwater light field can be exploited by diatoms to modulate their physiology throughout the photic zone. This study demonstrates that diatoms with phytochrome photoreceptors can detect and functionally respond to the entire visible light spectrum through these sensors, enabling them to sense depth and regulate photosynthesis accordingly in marine environments.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of the lunar dynamo is essential for deciphering the deep interior structure, thermal history and surface environment of the Moon1–4. Previous palaeomagnetic investigations on samples returned from the nearside of the Moon have established the general variation of the lunar magnetic field5–7. However, limited spatial and temporal palaeomagnetic constraints leave the evolution of the lunar dynamo ambiguous. The Chang’e-6 mission returned the first farside basalts dated at about 2.8 billion years ago (Ga) (refs. 8,9), offering an opportunity to investigate a critical spatiotemporal gap in the evolution of the global lunar dynamo. Here we report palaeointensities (around 5–21 μT) recovered from the Chang’e-6 basalts, providing the first constraint on the magnetic field from the lunar farside and a critical anchor within the large gap between 3 Ga and 2 Ga. These results record a rebound of the field strength after its previous sharp decline of around 3.1 Ga, which attests to an active lunar dynamo at about 2.8 Ga in the mid-early stage and argues against the suggestion that the lunar dynamo may have remained in a low-energy state after 3 Ga until its demise. The results indicate that the lunar dynamo was probably driven by either a basal magma ocean or a precession, supplemented by other mechanisms such as core crystallization. Samples from the Chang’e-6 mission show that the lunar magnetic field rebounded in field strength after its previous sharp decline of about 3.1 Ga.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that neutrophils adopt malleable polymorphonuclear shapes to migrate through narrow interstitial tissue spaces1–3. However, how polymorphonuclear structures are assembled remains unknown4. Here we show that in neutrophil progenitors, halting loop extrusion—a motor-powered process that generates DNA loops by pulling in chromatin5—leads to the assembly of polymorphonuclear genomes. Specifically, we found that in mononuclear neutrophil progenitors, acute depletion of the loop-extrusion loading factor nipped-B-like protein (NIPBL) induced the assembly of horseshoe, banded, ringed and hypersegmented nuclear structures and led to a reduction in nuclear volume, mirroring what is observed during the differentiation of neutrophils. Depletion of NIPBL also induced cell-cycle arrest, activated a neutrophil-specific gene program and conditioned a loss of interactions across topologically associating domains to generate a chromatin architecture that resembled that of differentiated neutrophils. Removing NIPBL resulted in enrichment for mega-loops and interchromosomal hubs that contain genes associated with neutrophil-specific enhancer repertoires and an inflammatory gene program. On the basis of these observations, we propose that in neutrophil progenitors, loop-extrusion programs produce lineage-specific chromatin architectures that permit the packing of chromosomes into geometrically confined lobular structures. Our data also provide a blueprint for the assembly of polymorphonuclear structures, and point to the possibility of engineering de novo nuclear shapes to facilitate the migration of effector cells in densely populated tumorigenic environments. In neutrophil progenitor cells, stopping the process of loop extrusion by depleting nipped-B-like protein (NIPBL) results in the assembly of polymorphonuclear structures and the activation of a neutrophil-specific gene program.",

    "abstract": "The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) dominates global patterns of diversity1,2, but the factors that underlie the LDG remain elusive. Here we use a unique global dataset3 to show that vascular plants on oceanic islands exhibit a weakened LDG and explore potential mechanisms for this effect. Our results show that traditional physical drivers of island biogeography4—namely area and isolation—contribute to the difference between island and mainland diversity at a given latitude (that is, the island species deficit), as smaller and more distant islands experience reduced colonization. However, plant species with mutualists are underrepresented on islands, and we find that this plant mutualism filter explains more variation in the island species deficit than abiotic factors. In particular, plant species that require animal pollinators or microbial mutualists such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute disproportionately to the island species deficit near the Equator, with contributions decreasing with distance from the Equator. Plant mutualist filters on species richness are particularly strong at low absolute latitudes where mainland richness is highest, weakening the LDG of oceanic islands. These results provide empirical evidence that mutualisms, habitat heterogeneity and dispersal are key to the maintenance of high tropical plant diversity and mediate the biogeographic patterns of plant diversity on Earth. The effect of the latitudinal diversity gradient on plants on oceanic islands is weakened by classical abiotic physical drivers of island biogeography and, to a greater extent, by mutualism with other species.",

    "abstract": "RAD51 is the central eukaryotic recombinase required for meiotic recombination and mitotic repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs)1,2. However, the mechanism by which RAD51 functions at DSB sites in chromatin has remained elusive. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human RAD51–nucleosome complexes, in which RAD51 forms ring and filament conformations. In the ring forms, the N-terminal lobe domains (NLDs) of RAD51 protomers are aligned on the outside of the RAD51 ring, and directly bind to the nucleosomal DNA. The nucleosomal linker DNA that contains the DSB site is recognized by the L1 and L2 loops—active centres that face the central hole of the RAD51 ring. In the filament form, the nucleosomal DNA is peeled by the RAD51 filament extension, and the NLDs of RAD51 protomers proximal to the nucleosome bind to the remaining nucleosomal DNA and histones. Mutations that affect nucleosome-binding residues of the RAD51 NLD decrease nucleosome binding, but barely affect DNA binding in vitro. Consistently, yeast Rad51 mutants with the corresponding mutations are substantially defective in DNA repair in vivo. These results reveal an unexpected function of the RAD51 NLD, and explain the mechanism by which RAD51 associates with nucleosomes, recognizes DSBs and forms the active filament in chromatin. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of human RAD51 in complex with the nucleosome show that RAD51 can adopt two conformations—rings and filaments—and reveal how RAD51 binds to the nucleosome through its N-terminal lobe domain.",

    "abstract": "Relativistic jets are observed from accreting and cataclysmic transients throughout the Universe, and have a profound impact on their surroundings1,2. Despite their importance, their launch mechanism is not known. For accreting neutron stars, the speed of their compact jets can reveal whether the jets are powered by magnetic fields anchored in the accretion flow3 or in the star itself4,5, but so far no such measurements exist. These objects can show bright explosions on their surface due to unstable thermonuclear burning of recently accreted material, called type-I X-ray bursts6, during which the mass-accretion rate increases7–9. Here, we report on bright flares in the jet emission for a few minutes after each X-ray burst, attributed to the increased accretion rate. With these flares, we measure the speed of a neutron star compact jet to be \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$v={0.38}_{-0.08}^{+0.11}c$$\n                \n              , much slower than those from black holes at similar luminosities. This discovery provides a powerful new tool in which we can determine the role that individual system properties have on the jet speed, revealing the dominant jet launching mechanism. Relativistic jets observed from transient neutron stars throughout the Universe produce bright flares for minutes after each X-ray burst, helping to determine the role individual system properties have on the speed and revealing the dominant launching mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic variation among species is a product of evolutionary changes to developmental programs1,2. However, how these changes generate novel morphological traits remains largely unclear. Here we studied the genomic and developmental basis of the mammalian gliding membrane, or patagium—an adaptative trait that has repeatedly evolved in different lineages, including in closely related marsupial species. Through comparative genomic analysis of 15 marsupial genomes, both from gliding and non-gliding species, we find that the Emx2 locus experienced lineage-specific patterns of accelerated cis-regulatory evolution in gliding species. By combining epigenomics, transcriptomics and in-pouch marsupial transgenics, we show that Emx2 is a critical upstream regulator of patagium development. Moreover, we identify different cis-regulatory elements that may be responsible for driving increased Emx2 expression levels in gliding species. Lastly, using mouse functional experiments, we find evidence that Emx2 expression patterns in gliders may have been modified from a pre-existing program found in all mammals. Together, our results suggest that patagia repeatedly originated through a process of convergent genomic evolution, whereby regulation of Emx2 was altered by distinct cis-regulatory elements in independently evolved species. Thus, different regulatory elements targeting the same key developmental gene may constitute an effective strategy by which natural selection has harnessed regulatory evolution in marsupial genomes to generate phenotypic novelty. Patagia—the mammalian gliding membrane—repeatedly originated through a process of convergent genomic evolution, whereby the regulation of Emx2 was altered by distinct cis-regulatory elements in independently evolved species.",

    "abstract": "Cobalamin (vitamin B12, herein referred to as B12) is an essential cofactor for most marine prokaryotes and eukaryotes1,2. Synthesized by a limited number of prokaryotes, its scarcity affects microbial interactions and community dynamics2–4. Here we show that two bacterial B12 auxotrophs can salvage different B12 building blocks and cooperate to synthesize B12. A Colwellia sp. synthesizes and releases the activated lower ligand α-ribazole, which is used by another B12 auxotroph, a Roseovarius sp., to produce the corrin ring and synthesize B12. Release of B12 by Roseovarius sp. happens only in co-culture with Colwellia sp. and only coincidently with the induction of a prophage encoded in Roseovarius sp. Subsequent growth of Colwellia sp. in these conditions may be due to the provision of B12 by lysed cells of Roseovarius sp. Further evidence is required to support a causative role for prophage induction in the release of B12. These complex microbial interactions of ligand cross-feeding and joint B12 biosynthesis seem to be widespread in marine pelagic ecosystems. In the western and northern tropical Atlantic Ocean, bacteria predicted to be capable of salvaging cobinamide and synthesizing only the activated lower ligand outnumber B12 producers. These findings add new players to our understanding of B12 supply to auxotrophic microorganisms in the ocean and possibly in other ecosystems. Two species of auxotrophic marine bacteria are shown to share precursors to synthesize the essential cofactor vitamin B12, and such ligand cross-feeding may be a common phenomenon in the ocean and other ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Sponges are the most basal metazoan phylum1 and may have played important roles in modulating the redox architecture of Neoproterozoic oceans2. Although molecular clocks predict that sponges diverged in the Neoproterozoic era3,4, their fossils have not been unequivocally demonstrated before the Cambrian period5–8, possibly because Precambrian sponges were aspiculate and non-biomineralized9. Here we describe a late-Ediacaran fossil, Helicolocellus cantori gen. et sp. nov., from the Dengying Formation (around 551–539 million years ago) of South China. This fossil is reconstructed as a large, stemmed benthic organism with a goblet-shaped body more than 0.4 m in height, with a body wall consisting of at least three orders of nested grids defined by quadrate fields, resembling a Cantor dust fractal pattern. The resulting lattice is interpreted as an organic skeleton comprising orthogonally arranged cruciform elements, architecturally similar to some hexactinellid sponges, although the latter are built with biomineralized spicules. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis resolves H. cantori as a crown-group sponge related to the Hexactinellida. H. cantori confirms that sponges diverged and existed in the Precambrian as non-biomineralizing animals with an organic skeleton. Considering that siliceous biomineralization may have evolved independently among sponge classes10–13, we question the validity of biomineralized spicules as a necessary criterion for the identification of Precambrian sponge fossils. Cross-hatch impressions from Ediacaran rocks in China are interpreted as having been left by a crown-group sponge fossil, Helicolocellus cantori gen. et sp. nov., characterized by an organic latticework skeleton.",

    "abstract": "Transposon-encoded tnpB and iscB genes encode RNA-guided DNA nucleases that promote their own selfish spread through targeted DNA cleavage and homologous recombination1–4. These widespread gene families were repeatedly domesticated over evolutionary timescales, leading to the emergence of diverse CRISPR-associated nucleases including Cas9 and Cas12 (refs. 5,6). We set out to test the hypothesis that TnpB nucleases may have also been repurposed for novel, unexpected functions other than CRISPR–Cas adaptive immunity. Here, using phylogenetics, structural predictions, comparative genomics and functional assays, we uncover multiple independent genesis events of programmable transcription factors, which we name TnpB-like nuclease-dead repressors (TldRs). These proteins use naturally occurring guide RNAs to specifically target conserved promoter regions of the genome, leading to potent gene repression in a mechanism akin to CRISPR interference technologies invented by humans7. Focusing on a TldR clade found broadly in Enterobacteriaceae, we discover that bacteriophages exploit the combined action of TldR and an adjacently encoded phage gene to alter the expression and composition of the host flagellar assembly, a transformation with the potential to impact motility8, phage susceptibility9, and host immunity10. Collectively, this work showcases the diverse molecular innovations that were enabled through repeated exaptation of transposon-encoded genes, and reveals the evolutionary trajectory of diverse RNA-guided transcription factors. RNA-guided transcription factors arose repeatedly via the domestication of transposon-encoded tnpB genes, representing a parallel evolutionary path to CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity.",

    "abstract": "Small-scale turbulent mixing drives the upwelling of deep water masses in the abyssal ocean as part of the global overturning circulation1. However, the processes leading to mixing and the pathways through which this upwelling occurs remain insufficiently understood. Recent observational and theoretical work2–5 has suggested that deep-water upwelling may occur along the ocean’s sloping seafloor; however, evidence has, so far, been indirect. Here we show vigorous near-bottom upwelling across isopycnals at a rate of the order of 100 metres per day, coupled with adiabatic exchange of near-boundary and interior fluid. These observations were made using a dye released close to the seafloor within a sloping submarine canyon, and they provide direct evidence of strong, bottom-focused diapycnal upwelling in the deep ocean. This supports previous suggestions that mixing at topographic features, such as canyons, leads to globally significant upwelling3,6–8. The upwelling rates observed were approximately 10,000 times higher than the global average value required for approximately 30 × 106 m3 s−1 of net upwelling globally9. A dye-release experiment within a sloping submarine canyon provides direct evidence that vigorous mixing at topographic features, such as canyons, leads to rapid diapycnal upwelling of deep water.",

Long-wavelength modulations incommensurate with the atomic lattice are particularly interesting1, exemplified by recent advances in two-dimensional (2D) moiré materials2,3. Bulk van der Waals (vdW) superlattices4–8 hosting 2D interfaces between minimally disordered layers represent scalable bulk analogues of artificial vdW heterostructures and present a complementary venue to explore incommensurately modulated 2D states. Here we report the bulk vdW superlattice SrTa2S5 realizing an incommensurate one-dimensional (1D) structural modulation of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) H-TaS2 layers. High-quality electronic transport in the H-TaS2 layers, evidenced by quantum oscillations, is made anisotropic by the modulation and exhibits commensurability oscillations paralleling lithographically modulated 2D systems9–11. We also find unconventional, clean-limit superconductivity in SrTa2S5 with a pronounced suppression of interlayer relative to intralayer coherence. The in-plane magnetic field dependence of interlayer critical current, together with electron diffraction from the structural modulation, suggests superconductivity12–14 in SrTa2S5 is spatially modulated and mismatched between adjacent TMD layers. With phenomenology suggestive of pair-density wave superconductivity15–17, SrTa2S5 may present a pathway for microscopic evaluation of this unconventional order18–21. More broadly, SrTa2S5 establishes bulk vdW superlattices as versatile platforms to address long-standing predictions surrounding modulated electronic phases in the form of nanoscale vdW devices12,13 to macroscopic crystals22,23. Evidence of modulated metallic and superconducting states stemming from an incommensurate structural stripe motif is reported in the bulk van der Waals superlattice SrTa2S5.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination pathways have crucial roles in protein homeostasis, signalling and innate immunity1–3. In these pathways, an enzymatic cascade of E1, E2 and E3 proteins conjugates ubiquitin or a ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) to target-protein lysine residues4. Bacteria encode ancient relatives of E1 and Ubl proteins involved in sulfur metabolism5,6, but these proteins do not mediate Ubl–target conjugation, leaving open the question of whether bacteria can perform ubiquitination-like protein conjugation. Here we demonstrate that a bacterial operon associated with phage defence islands encodes a complete ubiquitination pathway. Two structures of a bacterial E1–E2–Ubl complex reveal striking architectural parallels with canonical eukaryotic ubiquitination machinery. The bacterial E1 possesses an amino-terminal inactive adenylation domain and a carboxy-terminal active adenylation domain with a mobile α-helical insertion containing the catalytic cysteine (CYS domain). One structure reveals a pre-reaction state with the bacterial Ubl C terminus positioned for adenylation, and a second structure mimics an E1-to-E2 transthioesterification state with the E1 CYS domain adjacent to the bound E2. We show that a deubiquitinase in the same pathway preprocesses the bacterial Ubl, exposing its C-terminal glycine for adenylation. Finally, we show that the bacterial E1 and E2 collaborate to conjugate Ubl to target-protein lysine residues. Together, these data reveal that bacteria possess bona fide ubiquitination systems with strong mechanistic and architectural parallels to canonical eukaryotic ubiquitination pathways, suggesting that these pathways arose first in bacteria. A study reports the structure and molecular mechanism of the Bil anti-phage defence system, demonstrating that it is the closest prokaryotic homologue of canonical eukaryotic ubiquitination pathways.",

    "abstract": "Biological membranes are partitioned into functional zones termed membrane microdomains, which contain specific lipids and proteins1–3. The composition and organization of membrane microdomains remain controversial because few techniques are available that allow the visualization of lipids in situ without disrupting their native behaviour3,4. The yeast eisosome, composed of the BAR-domain proteins Pil1 and Lsp1 (hereafter, Pil1/Lsp1), scaffolds a membrane compartment that senses and responds to mechanical stress by flattening and releasing sequestered factors5–9. Here we isolated near-native eisosomes as helical tubules made up of a lattice of Pil1/Lsp1 bound to plasma membrane lipids, and solved their structures by helical reconstruction. Our structures reveal a striking organization of membrane lipids, and, using in vitro reconstitutions and molecular dynamics simulations, we confirmed the positioning of individual PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylserine and sterol molecules sequestered beneath the Pil1/Lsp1 coat. Three-dimensional variability analysis of the native-source eisosomes revealed a dynamic stretching of the Pil1/Lsp1 lattice that affects the sequestration of these lipids. Collectively, our results support a mechanism in which stretching of the Pil1/Lsp1 lattice liberates lipids that would otherwise be anchored by the Pil1/Lsp1 coat, and thus provide mechanistic insight into how eisosome BAR-domain proteins create a mechanosensitive membrane microdomain. Cryo-electron microscopy, in vitro reconstitution and molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into the architecture of a plasma membrane microdomain in yeast, the organization and dynamics of the membrane lipids within this microdomain and how it responds to mechanical stress.",

    "abstract": "Nasal vaccination elicits a humoral immune response that provides protection from airborne pathogens1, yet the origins and specific immune niches of antigen-specific IgA-secreting cells in the upper airways are unclear2. Here we define nasal glandular acinar structures and the turbinates as immunological niches that recruit IgA-secreting plasma cells from the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALTs)3. Using intact organ imaging, we demonstrate that nasal vaccination induces B cell expansion in the subepithelial dome of the NALT, followed by invasion into commensal-bacteria-driven chronic germinal centres in a T cell-dependent manner. Initiation of the germinal centre response in the NALT requires pre-expansion of antigen-specific T cells, which interact with cognate B cells in interfollicular regions. NALT ablation and blockade of PSGL-1, which mediates interactions with endothelial cell selectins, demonstrated that NALT-derived IgA-expressing B cells home to the turbinate region through the circulation, where they are positioned primarily around glandular acinar structures. CCL28 expression was increased in the turbinates in response to vaccination and promoted homing of IgA+ B cells to this site. Thus, in response to nasal vaccination, the glandular acini and turbinates provide immunological niches that host NALT-derived IgA-secreting cells. These cellular events could be manipulated in vaccine design or in the treatment of upper airway allergic responses. Nasal vaccination induces B cell expansion in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues, followed by homing to the nasal turbinates and glandular acinar structures.",

    "abstract": "Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels1 are essential for pacemaking activity and neural signalling2,3. Drugs inhibiting HCN1 are promising candidates for management of neuropathic pain4 and epileptic seizures5. The general anaesthetic propofol (2,6-di-iso-propylphenol) is a known HCN1 allosteric inhibitor6 with unknown structural basis. Here, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and electrophysiology, we show that propofol inhibits HCN1 by binding to a mechanistic hotspot in a groove between the S5 and S6 transmembrane helices. We found that propofol restored voltage-dependent closing in two HCN1 epilepsy-associated polymorphisms that act by destabilizing the channel closed state: M305L, located in the propofol-binding site in S5, and D401H in S6 (refs. 7,8). To understand the mechanism of propofol inhibition and restoration of voltage-gating, we tracked voltage-sensor movement in spHCN channels and found that propofol inhibition is independent of voltage-sensor conformational changes. Mutations at the homologous methionine in spHCN and an adjacent conserved phenylalanine in S6 similarly destabilize closing without disrupting voltage-sensor movements, indicating that voltage-dependent closure requires this interface intact. We propose a model for voltage-dependent gating in which propofol stabilizes coupling between the voltage sensor and pore at this conserved methionine–phenylalanine interface in HCN channels. These findings unlock potential exploitation of this site to design specific drugs targeting HCN channelopathies. Propofol repairs malfunctioning mutant HCN1 channels associated with epilepsy, and its unusual mechanism of action on these ion channels can potentially be exploited to design precision drugs targeting HCN channelopathies.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic RAS-induced senescence (OIS) is an autonomous tumour suppressor mechanism associated with premalignancy1,2. Achieving this phenotype typically requires a high level of oncogenic stress, yet the phenotype provoked by lower oncogenic dosage remains unclear. Here we develop oncogenic RAS dose-escalation models in vitro and in vivo, revealing a RAS dose-driven non-linear continuum of downstream phenotypes. In a hepatocyte OIS model in vivo, ectopic expression of NRAS(G12V) does not induce tumours, in part owing to OIS-driven immune clearance3. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses reveal distinct hepatocyte clusters with typical OIS or progenitor-like features, corresponding to high and intermediate levels of NRAS(G12V), respectively. When titred down, NRAS(G12V)-expressing hepatocytes become immune resistant and develop tumours. Time-series monitoring at single-cell resolution identifies two distinct tumour types: early-onset aggressive undifferentiated and late-onset differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. The molecular signature of each mouse tumour type is associated with different progenitor features and enriched in distinct human hepatocellular carcinoma subclasses. Our results define the oncogenic dosage-driven OIS spectrum, reconciling the senescence and tumour initiation phenotypes in early tumorigenesis. Oncogenic RAS dose-escalation models are used to explore how the level of RAS determines whether cells enter a senescent state or have tumour-initiating activity.",

    "abstract": "Guanidine is a chemically stable nitrogen compound that is excreted in human urine and is widely used in manufacturing of plastics, as a flame retardant and as a component of propellants, and is well known as a protein denaturant in biochemistry1–3. Guanidine occurs widely in nature and is used by several microorganisms as a nitrogen source, but microorganisms growing on guanidine as the only substrate have not yet been identified. Here we show that the complete ammonia oxidizer (comammox) Nitrospira inopinata and probably most other comammox microorganisms can grow on guanidine as the sole source of energy, reductant and nitrogen. Proteomics, enzyme kinetics and the crystal structure of a N. inopinata guanidinase homologue demonstrated that it is a bona fide guanidinase. Incubation experiments with comammox-containing agricultural soil and wastewater treatment plant microbiomes suggested that guanidine serves as substrate for nitrification in the environment. The identification of guanidine as a growth substrate for comammox shows an unexpected niche of these globally important nitrifiers and offers opportunities for their isolation. Nitrospira inopinata and probably most other comammox microorganisms can grow on the non-conventional substrate guanidine as the sole source of energy, reductant and nitrogen.",

    "abstract": "Temporally fluctuating environmental conditions are a ubiquitous feature of natural habitats. Yet, how finely natural populations adaptively track fluctuating selection pressures via shifts in standing genetic variation is unknown1,2. Here we generated genome-wide allele frequency data every 1–2 generations from a genetically diverse population of Drosophila melanogaster in extensively replicated field mesocosms from late June to mid-December (a period of approximately 12 total generations). Adaptation throughout the fundamental ecological phases of population expansion, peak density and collapse was underpinned by extremely rapid, parallel changes in genomic variation across replicates. Yet, the dominant direction of selection fluctuated repeatedly, even within each of these ecological phases. Comparing patterns of change in allele frequency to an independent dataset procured from the same experimental system demonstrated that the targets of selection are predictable across years. In concert, our results reveal a fitness relevance of standing variation that is likely to be masked by inference approaches based on static population sampling or insufficiently resolved time-series data. We propose that such fine-scaled, temporally fluctuating selection may be an important force contributing to the maintenance of functional genetic variation in natural populations and an important stochastic force impacting genome-wide patterns of diversity at linked neutral sites, akin to genetic draft. Natural environmental and ecological shifts impose sufficiently strong selection to drive exceptionally rapid, parallel and fluctuating adaptive tracking in a Drosophila melangaster mesocosm.",

However, the structure and mechanism of NET remain unclear. Here we provide cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the human NET (hNET) in three functional states—the apo state, and in states bound to the substrate meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) or the orthosteric inhibitor radafaxine. These structures were captured in an inward-facing conformation, with a tightly sealed extracellular gate and an open intracellular gate. The substrate MIBG binds at the centre of hNET. Radafaxine also occupies the substrate-binding site and might block the structural transition of hNET for inhibition. These structures provide insights into the mechanism of substrate recognition and orthosteric inhibition of hNET. Structures of human NET in the apo state and bound to meta-iodobenzylguanidine and radafaxine provide insights into the mechanism of substrate recognition and orthosteric inhibition of hNET.",

Here we used Floquet engineering7 to realize new quantum many-body systems of polar molecules. Using a spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states of ultracold 40K87Rb molecules, we mutually validated XXZ spin models tuned by a Floquet microwave pulse sequence against those tuned by a d.c. electric field through observations of Ramsey contrast dynamics. This validation sets the stage for the realization of Hamiltonians inaccessible with static fields. In particular, we observed two-axis twisting8 mean-field dynamics, generated by a Floquet-engineered XYZ model using itinerant molecules in two-dimensional layers. In the future, Floquet-engineered Hamiltonians could generate entangled states for molecule-based precision measurement9 or could take advantage of the rich molecular structure for quantum simulation of multi-level systems10,11.

This is essential for the fundamental studies of physics as well as practical applications such as precision spectroscopy4–7, ultracold gases with quantum statistical properties8–10 and quantum computing. In laser cooling, atoms are slowed to otherwise unattainable velocities through repeated cycles of laser photon absorption and spontaneous emission in random directions. Simple systems can serve as rigorous testing grounds for fundamental physics—one such case is the purely leptonic positronium11,12, an exotic atom comprising an electron and its antiparticle, the positron. Laser cooling of positronium, however, has hitherto remained unrealized. Here we demonstrate the one-dimensional laser cooling of positronium. An innovative laser system emitting a train of broadband pulses with successively increasing central frequencies was used to overcome major challenges posed by the short positronium lifetime and the effects of Doppler broadening and recoil. One-dimensional chirp cooling was used to cool a portion of the dilute positronium gas to a velocity distribution of approximately 1 K in 100 ns. A major advancement in the field of low-temperature fundamental physics of antimatter, this study on a purely leptonic system complements work on antihydrogen13, a hadron-containing exotic atom. The successful application of laser cooling to positronium affords unique opportunities to rigorously test bound-state quantum electrodynamics and to potentially realize Bose–Einstein condensation14–18 in this matter–antimatter system. The one-dimensional laser cooling of positronium enables testing of quantum electrodynamics and could realize Bose–Einstein condensation in positronium.",

    "abstract": "The rate of river migration affects the stability of Arctic infrastructure and communities1,2 and regulates the fluxes of carbon3,4, nutrients5 and sediment6,7 to the oceans. However, predicting how the pace of river migration will change in a warming Arctic8 has so far been stymied by conflicting observations about whether permafrost9 primarily acts to slow10,11 or accelerate12,13 river migration. Here we develop new computational methods that enable the detection of riverbank erosion at length scales 5–10 times smaller than the pixel size in satellite imagery, an innovation that unlocks the ability to quantify erosion at the sub-monthly timescales when rivers undergo their largest variations in water temperature and flow. We use these high-frequency observations to constrain the extent to which erosion is limited by the thermal condition of melting the pore ice that cements bank sediment14, a requirement that will disappear when permafrost thaws, versus the mechanical condition of having sufficient flow to transport the sediment comprising the riverbanks, a condition experienced by all rivers15. Analysis of high-resolution data from the Koyukuk River, Alaska, shows that the presence of permafrost reduces erosion rates by 47%. Using our observations, we calibrate and validate a numerical model that can be applied to diverse Arctic rivers. The model predicts that full permafrost thaw may lead to a 30–100% increase in the migration rates of Arctic rivers. Analysis of the sub-seasonal patterns of river migration reveals that permafrost reduces erosion rates and suggests that full permafrost thaw may lead to a 30–100% increase in the migration rates of Arctic rivers.",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial photosynthesis, or gross primary production (GPP), is the largest carbon flux in the biosphere, but its global magnitude and spatiotemporal dynamics remain uncertain1. The global annual mean GPP is historically thought to be around 120 PgC yr−1 (refs. 2–6), which is about 30–50 PgC yr−1 lower than GPP inferred from the oxygen-18 (18O) isotope7 and soil respiration8. This disparity is a source of uncertainty in predicting climate–carbon cycle feedbacks9,10. Here we infer GPP from carbonyl sulfide, an innovative tracer for CO2 diffusion from ambient air to leaf chloroplasts through stomata and mesophyll layers. We demonstrate that explicitly representing mesophyll diffusion is important for accurately quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbonyl sulfide uptake by plants. From the estimate of carbonyl sulfide uptake by plants, we infer a global contemporary GPP of 157 (±8.5) PgC yr−1, which is consistent with estimates from 18O (150–175 PgC yr−1) and soil respiration (\n                \n                  \n                \n                $${149}_{-23}^{+29}$$\n                \n               PgC yr−1), but with an improved confidence level. Our global GPP is higher than satellite optical observation-driven estimates (120–140 PgC yr–1) that are used for Earth system model benchmarking. This difference predominantly occurs in the pan-tropical rainforests and is corroborated by ground measurements11, suggesting a more productive tropics than satellite-based GPP products indicated. As GPP is a primary determinant of terrestrial carbon sinks and may shape climate trajectories9,10, our findings lay a physiological foundation on which the understanding and prediction of carbon–climate feedbacks can be advanced. An analysis of the effect of mesophyll diffusion on the dynamics of the uptake of carbonyl sulfide by plants estimates global contemporary gross primary productivity to be 157 (±8.5) petagrams of carbon per year.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that, when compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars form, they may receive a ‘natal kick’, during which the stellar remnant gains momentum. Observational evidence for neutron star kicks is substantial1,2, yet is limited for black hole natal kicks, and some proposed black hole formation scenarios result in very small kicks3–5. Here we report that the canonical black hole low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) V404 Cygni is part of a wide hierarchical triple with a tertiary companion at least 3,500 astronomical units (au) away from the inner binary. Given the orbital configuration, the black hole probably received a sub-5 km s−1 kick to have avoided unbinding the tertiary. This discovery lends support to the idea that at least some black holes form with nearly no natal kick. Furthermore, the tertiary in this system lends credence to evolutionary models of LMXBs involving a hierarchical triple structure6. Remarkably, the tertiary is evolved, indicating that the system formed 3–5 billion years ago and that the black hole has removed at least half a solar mass of matter from its evolved secondary companion. During the event in which the black hole formed, it is required that at least half of the mass of the black hole progenitor collapsed into the black hole; it may even have undergone a complete implosion, enabling the tertiary to remain loosely bound. Analysis of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary V404 Cygni shows that it is part of a wide hierarchical triple whose configuration provides evidence that some black holes form with nearly no natal kick.",

    "abstract": "The Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is at present the largest single contributor to global-mass-induced sea-level rise, primarily because of Arctic amplification on an increasingly warmer Earth1–5. However, the processes of englacial water accumulation, storage and ultimate release remain poorly constrained. Here we show that a noticeable amount of the summertime meltwater mass is temporally buffered along the entire GrIS periphery, peaking in July and gradually reducing thereafter. Our results arise from quantifying the spatiotemporal behaviour of the total mass of water leaving the GrIS by analysing bedrock elastic deformation measured by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations. The buffered meltwater causes a subsidence of the bedrock close to GNSS stations of at most approximately 5 mm during the melt season. Regionally, the duration of meltwater storage ranges from 4.5 weeks in the southeast to 9 weeks elsewhere. We also show that the meltwater runoff modelled from regional climate models may contain systematic errors, requiring further scaling of up to about 20% for the warmest years. These results reveal a high potential for GNSS data to constrain poorly known hydrological processes in Greenland, forming the basis for improved projections of future GrIS melt behaviour and the associated sea-level rise6. Analysis of bedrock elastic deformation using high-resolution observations from 22 Greenland GNSS Network stations shows that the Greenland ice sheet buffers enough summer meltwater englacially to cause subsidence of about 5 mm during the melt season.",

    "abstract": "Somatic alterations in the oncogenic kinase AKT1 have been identified in a broad spectrum of solid tumours. The most common AKT1 alteration replaces Glu17 with Lys (E17K) in the regulatory pleckstrin homology domain1, resulting in constitutive membrane localization and activation of oncogenic signalling. In clinical studies, pan-AKT inhibitors have been found to cause dose-limiting hyperglycaemia2–6, which has motivated the search for mutant-selective inhibitors. We exploited the E17K mutation to design allosteric, lysine-targeted salicylaldehyde inhibitors with selectivity for AKT1 (E17K) over wild-type AKT paralogues, a major challenge given the presence of three conserved lysines near the allosteric site. Crystallographic analysis of the covalent inhibitor complex unexpectedly revealed an adventitious tetrahedral zinc ion that coordinates two proximal cysteines in the kinase activation loop while simultaneously engaging the E17K–imine conjugate. The salicylaldimine complex with AKT1 (E17K), but not that with wild-type AKT1, recruits endogenous Zn2+ in cells, resulting in sustained inhibition. A salicylaldehyde-based inhibitor was efficacious in AKT1 (E17K) tumour xenograft models at doses that did not induce hyperglycaemia. Our study demonstrates the potential to achieve exquisite residence-time-based selectivity for AKT1 (E17K) by targeting the mutant lysine together with Zn2+ chelation by the resulting salicylaldimine adduct. A mutant-selective AKT inhibitor shows potential as a targeted therapy for breast cancer, enabling enhanced target engagement and avoiding the dose-limiting toxicity associated with pan-AKT inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in mammalian synthetic biology, there remains a lack of modular synthetic receptors that can robustly respond to soluble ligands and, in turn, activate bespoke cellular functions. Such receptors would have extensive clinical potential to regulate the activity of engineered therapeutic cells, but so far only receptors against cell-surface targets have approached clinical translation1. To address this gap, here we adapt a receptor architecture called the synthetic intramembrane proteolysis receptor (SNIPR) for activation by soluble ligands. Our SNIPR platform can be activated by both natural and synthetic soluble factors, with notably low baseline activity and high fold activation, through an endocytic, pH-dependent cleavage mechanism. We demonstrate the therapeutic capabilities of the receptor platform by localizing the activity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to solid tumours in which soluble disease-associated factors are expressed, bypassing the major hurdle of on-target off-tumour toxicity in bystander organs. We further apply the SNIPR platform to engineer fully synthetic signalling networks between cells orthogonal to natural signalling pathways, expanding the scope of synthetic biology. Our design framework enables cellular communication and environmental interactions, extending the capabilities of synthetic cellular networking in clinical and research contexts. A synthetic receptor platform that enables mammalian cells to respond to soluble factors allows specific signalling networks to be precisely controlled, with a variety of therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "The binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to genomic enhancers drives gene expression in mammalian cells1. However, the molecular details that link enhancer sequence to TF binding, promoter state and transcription levels remain unclear. Here we applied single-molecule footprinting2,3 to measure the simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes and other regulatory proteins on engineered enhancer–promoter constructs with variable numbers of TF binding sites for both a synthetic TF and an endogenous TF involved in the type I interferon response. Although TF binding events on nucleosome-free DNA are independent, activation domains recruit cofactors that destabilize nucleosomes, driving observed TF binding cooperativity. Average TF occupancy linearly determines promoter activity, and we decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the enhancer binding microstates and gene expression dynamics. This work provides a template for the quantitative dissection of distinct contributors to gene expression, including TF activation domains, concentration, binding affinity, binding site configuration and recruitment of chromatin regulators. A study uses single-molecule footprinting to measure protein occupancy at regulatory elements on individual molecules in human cells and describes how different properties of transcription factor binding contribute to gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled regeneration leads to neoplastic transformation1–3. The intestinal epithelium requires precise regulation during continuous homeostatic and damage-induced tissue renewal to prevent neoplastic transformation, suggesting that pathways unlinking tumour growth from regenerative processes must exist. Here, by mining RNA-sequencing datasets from two intestinal damage models4,5 and using pharmacological, transcriptomics and genetic tools, we identified liver X receptor (LXR) pathway activation as a tissue adaptation to damage that reciprocally regulates intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, intestinal organoids, and gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that LXR activation in intestinal epithelial cells induces amphiregulin (Areg), enhancing regenerative responses. This response is coordinated by the LXR-ligand-producing enzyme CYP27A1, which was upregulated in damaged intestinal crypt niches. Deletion of Cyp27a1 impaired intestinal regeneration, which was rescued by exogenous LXR agonists. Notably, in tumour models, Cyp27a1 deficiency led to increased tumour growth, whereas LXR activation elicited anti-tumour responses dependent on adaptive immunity. Consistently, human colorectal cancer specimens exhibited reduced levels of CYP27A1, LXR target genes, and B and CD8 T cell gene signatures. We therefore identify an epithelial adaptation mechanism to damage, whereby LXR functions as a rheostat, promoting tissue repair while limiting tumorigenesis. Liver X receptor drives epithelial Areg-mediated intestinal regeneration, while preventing tumour growth through adaptive immune responses.",

Here we use comprehensive social network mapping and detailed microbiome sequencing data in 1,787 adults within 18 isolated villages in Honduras7 to investigate the relationship between network structure and gut microbiome composition. Using both species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial sharing occurs between many relationship types, notably including non-familial and non-household connections. Furthermore, strain-sharing extends to second-degree social connections, suggesting the relevance of a person’s broader network. We also observe that socially central people are more microbially similar to the overall village than socially peripheral people. Among 301 people whose microbiome was re-measured 2 years later, we observe greater convergence in strain-sharing in connected versus otherwise similar unconnected co-villagers. Clusters of species and strains occur within clusters of people in village social networks, meaning that social networks provide the social niches within which microbiome biology and phenotypic impact are manifested. An investigation into the relationship between network structure and gut microbiome composition among people living in 18 isolated Honduras villages reveals that strain-sharing can be mediated by complex, village-wide social interactions.",

    "abstract": "The stretch reflex is a fundamental component of the motor system that orchestrates the coordinated muscle contractions underlying movement. At the heart of this process lie the muscle spindles (MS), specialized receptors finely attuned to fluctuations in tension within intrafusal muscle fibres. The tension variation in the MS triggers a series of neuronal events including an initial depolarization of sensory type Ia afferents that subsequently causes the activation of motoneurons within the spinal cord1,2. This neuronal cascade culminates in the execution of muscle contraction, underscoring a presumed closed-loop mechanism between the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. By contrast, here we report the discovery of a new population of macrophages with exclusive molecular and functional signatures within the MS that express the machinery for synthesizing and releasing glutamate. Using mouse intersectional genetics with optogenetics and electrophysiology, we show that activation of MS macrophages (MSMP) drives proprioceptive sensory neuron firing on a millisecond timescale. MSMP activate spinal circuits, motor neurons and muscles by means of a glutamate-dependent mechanism that excites the MS. Furthermore, MSMP respond to neural and muscle activation by increasing the expression of glutaminase, enabling them to convert the uptaken glutamine released by myocytes during muscle contraction into glutamate. Selective silencing or depletion of MSMP in hindlimb muscles disrupted the modulation of the stretch reflex for force generation and sensory feedback correction, impairing locomotor strategies in mice. Our results have identified a new cellular component, the MSMP, that directly regulates neural activity and muscle contraction. The glutamate-mediated signalling of MSMP and their dynamic response to sensory cues introduce a new dimension to our understanding of sensation and motor action, potentially offering innovative therapeutic approaches in conditions that affect sensorimotor function. A population of macrophages with exclusive molecular and functional signatures in the muscle spindles express machinery for synthesizing and releasing glutamate, and a cellular component, the muscle spindle macrophages, directly regulates neural activity and muscle contraction.",

    "abstract": "Natural tissues are composed of diverse cells and extracellular materials whose arrangements across several length scales—from subcellular lengths1 (micrometre) to the organ scale2 (centimetre)—regulate biological functions. Tissue-fabrication methods have progressed to large constructs, for example, through stereolithography3 and nozzle-based bioprinting4,5, and subcellular resolution through subtractive photoablation6–8. However, additive bioprinting struggles with sub-nozzle/voxel features9 and photoablation is restricted to small volumes by prohibitive heat generation and time10. Building across several length scales with temperature-sensitive, water-based soft biological matter has emerged as a critical challenge, leaving large classes of biological motifs—such as multiscalar vascular trees with varying calibres—inaccessible with present technologies11,12. Here we use gallium-based engineered sacrificial capillary pumps for evacuation (ESCAPE) during moulding to generate multiscalar structures in soft natural hydrogels, achieving both cellular-scale (<10 µm) and millimetre-scale features. Decoupling the biomaterial of interest from the process of constructing the geometry allows non-biocompatible tools to create the initial geometry. As an exemplar, we fabricated branched, cell-laden vascular trees in collagen, spanning approximately 300-µm arterioles down to the microvasculature (roughly ten times smaller). The same approach can micropattern the inner surface of vascular walls with topographical cues to orient cells in 3D and engineer fine structures such as vascular malformations. ESCAPE moulding enables the fabrication of multiscalar forms in soft biomaterials, paving the way for a wide range of tissue architectures that were previously inaccessible in vitro. A patterning method using gallium-based engineered sacrificial capillary pumps for evacuation is described for generating structures in soft natural hydrogels across several length scales and enabling a wide range of tissue architectures to be fabricated.",

These structures typically develop as genetically controlled units1, the spatial patterning of which emerges from a self-organized chemical Turing system2,3 with integrated mechanical feedback4,5. The seemingly purely mechanical patterning of polygonal crocodile head scales provides an exception to this paradigm6. However, the nature and origin of the mechanical stress field driving this patterning remain unclear. Here, using precise in ovo intravenous injections of epidermal growth factor protein, we generate Nile crocodile embryos with substantially convoluted head skin, as well as hatchlings with smaller polygonal head scales resembling those of caimans. We then use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to quantify embryonic tissue-layer geometry, collagen architecture and the spatial distribution of proliferating cells. Using these data, we build a phenomenological three-dimensional mechanical growth model that recapitulates both normal and experimentally modified patterning of crocodile head scales. Our experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that crocodile head scales self-organize through compressive folding, originating from near-homogeneous skin growth with differential stiffness of the dermis versus the epidermis. Our experiments and theoretical morphospace analyses indicate that variation in embryonic growth and material properties of skin layers provides a simple evolutionary mechanism that produces a diversity of head-scale patterns among crocodilian species. Crocodile head scales self-organize through purely mechanical compressive skin folding rather than a patterning process controlled by gene interactions.",

    "abstract": "Molecular ions are ubiquitous and play pivotal roles1–3 in many reactions, particularly in the context of atmospheric and interstellar chemistry4–6. However, their structures and conformational transitions7,8, particularly in the gas phase, are less explored than those of neutral molecules owing to experimental difficulties. A case in point is the halonium ions9–11, whose highly reactive nature and ring strain make them short-lived intermediates that are readily attacked even by weak nucleophiles and thus challenging to isolate or capture before they undergo further reaction. Here we show that mega-electronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction (MeV-UED)12–14, used in conjunction with resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization, can monitor the formation of 1,3-dibromopropane (DBP) cations and their subsequent structural dynamics forming a halonium ion. We find that the DBP+ cation remains for a substantial duration of 3.6 ps in aptly named ‘dark states’ that are structurally indistinguishable from the DBP electronic ground state. The structural data, supported by surface-hopping simulations15 and ab initio calculations16, reveal that the cation subsequently decays to iso-DBP+, an unusual intermediate with a four-membered ring containing a loosely bound17,18 bromine atom, and eventually loses the bromine atom and forms a bromonium ion with a three-membered-ring structure19. We anticipate that the approach used here can also be applied to examine the structural dynamics of other molecular ions and thereby deepen our understanding of ion chemistry. The use of mega-electronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction combined with resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization yields data that can reveal the formation and subsequent structural relaxation of a molecular ion on an ultrafast timescale.",

    "abstract": "Social interactions represent a ubiquitous aspect of our everyday life that we acquire by interpreting and responding to visual cues from conspecifics1. However, despite the general acceptance of this view, how visual information is used to guide the decision to cooperate is unknown. Here, we wirelessly recorded the spiking activity of populations of neurons in the visual and prefrontal cortex in conjunction with wireless recordings of oculomotor events while freely moving macaques engaged in social cooperation. As animals learned to cooperate, visual and executive areas refined the representation of social variables, such as the conspecific or reward, by distributing socially relevant information among neurons in each area. Decoding population activity showed that viewing social cues influences the decision to cooperate. Learning social events increased coordinated spiking between visual and prefrontal cortical neurons, which was associated with improved accuracy of neural populations to encode social cues and the decision to cooperate. These results indicate that the visual-frontal cortical network prioritizes relevant sensory information to facilitate learning social interactions while freely moving macaques interact in a naturalistic environment. Behavioural tracking and wireless neural and eye-tracking recordings show that freely moving macaques learn to cooprate using visually guided signals along the visual-frontal cortical network.",

    "abstract": "In palaeontological studies, groups with consistent ecological and morphological traits across a clade’s history (functional groups)1 afford different perspectives on biodiversity dynamics than do species and genera2,3, which are evolutionarily ephemeral. Here we analyse Triton, a global dataset of Cenozoic macroperforate planktonic foraminiferal occurrences4, to contextualize changes in latitudinal equitability gradients1, functional diversity, palaeolatitudinal specialization and community equitability. We identify: global morphological communities becoming less specialized preceding the richness increase after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction; ecological specialization during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, suggesting inhibitive equatorial temperatures during the peak of the Cenozoic hothouse; increased specialization due to circulation changes across the Eocene–Oligocene transition, preceding the loss of morphological diversity; changes in morphological specialization and richness about 19 million years ago, coeval with pelagic shark extinctions5; delayed onset of changing functional group richness and specialization between hemispheres during the mid-Miocene plankton diversification. The detailed nature of the Triton dataset permits a unique spatiotemporal view of Cenozoic pelagic macroevolution, in which global biogeographic responses of functional communities and richness are decoupled during Cenozoic climate events. The global response of functional groups to similar abiotic selection pressures may depend on the background climatic state (greenhouse or icehouse) to which a group is adapted. Analysis of a global dataset reveals spatiotemporal patterns of marine plankton and their biogeographical responses during climatic and environmental changes across the Cenozoic era.",

    "abstract": "Streptomyces are a genus of ubiquitous soil bacteria from which the majority of clinically utilized antibiotics derive1. The production of these antibacterial molecules reflects the relentless competition Streptomyces engage in with other bacteria, including other Streptomyces species1,2. Here we show that in addition to small-molecule antibiotics, Streptomyces produce and secrete antibacterial protein complexes that feature a large, degenerate repeat-containing polymorphic toxin protein. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of these particles reveals an extended stalk topped by a ringed crown comprising the toxin repeats scaffolding five lectin-tipped spokes, which led us to name them umbrella particles. Streptomyces coelicolor encodes three umbrella particles with distinct toxin and lectin composition. Notably, supernatant containing these toxins specifically and potently inhibits the growth of select Streptomyces species from among a diverse collection of bacteria screened. For one target, Streptomyces griseus, inhibition relies on a single toxin and that intoxication manifests as rapid cessation of vegetative hyphal growth. Our data show that Streptomyces umbrella particles mediate competition among vegetative mycelia of related species, a function distinct from small-molecule antibiotics, which are produced at the onset of reproductive growth and act broadly3,4. Sequence analyses suggest that this role of umbrella particles extends beyond Streptomyces, as we identified umbrella loci in nearly 1,000 species across Actinobacteria. Streptomyces are discovered to produce antibacterial protein complexes that selectively inhibit the hyphal growth of related species, a function distinct from that of the small-molecule antibiotics they are known for.",

    "abstract": "The luminosity of stripped-envelope supernovae, a common type of stellar explosion, is believed to be mainly driven by the radioactive decay of the nickel synthesized in the explosion and carried in its ejecta. Additional possible energy sources have been previously suggested1–5, in which the two most observationally based results have been from a comparison of the observed time-weighted luminosity with the inferred radioactive power1 and from a comparison of the light curves with particular theoretical models3. However, the former result1 was not statistically significant, and the latter3 is highly dependent on the specific models assumed. Here we analyse the energy budget of a sample of 54 well-observed stripped-envelope supernovae of all sub-types and present statistically significant, largely model-independent, observational evidence for a non-radioactive power source in most of them (and possibly in all). We consider various energy sources, or alternatively, plausible systematic errors, that could drive this result, and conclude that the most likely option is the existence of a long-lived central engine, operating over ≈103–106 s after the explosion. We infer, from the observations, constraints on the engine properties. If, for example, the central engine is a magnetized neutron star, then the initial magnetic field is ≈1015 G and the initial rotation period is 1–100 ms, suggesting that stripped-envelope supernovae may constitute the formation events of the objects known as magnetars. Analysis of the energy budget of a sample of 54 well-observed stripped-envelope supernovae of all sub-types shows statistically significant, largely model-independent, observational evidence for a non-radioactive power source in most of them.",

    "abstract": "Working memory, the process through which information is transiently maintained and manipulated over a brief period, is essential for most cognitive functions1–4. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation and evolution of working-memory neuronal representations at the population level over long timescales remain unclear. Here, to identify these mechanisms, we trained head-fixed mice to perform an olfactory delayed-association task in which the mice made decisions depending on the sequential identity of two odours separated by a 5 s delay. Optogenetic inhibition of secondary motor neurons during the late-delay and choice epochs strongly impaired the task performance of the mice. Mesoscopic calcium imaging of large neuronal populations of the secondary motor cortex (M2), retrosplenial cortex (RSA) and primary motor cortex (M1) showed that many late-delay-epoch-selective neurons emerged in M2 as the mice learned the task. Working-memory late-delay decoding accuracy substantially improved in the M2, but not in the M1 or RSA, as the mice became experts. During the early expert phase, working-memory representations during the late-delay epoch drifted across days, while the stimulus and choice representations stabilized. In contrast to single-plane layer 2/3 (L2/3) imaging, simultaneous volumetric calcium imaging of up to 73,307 M2 neurons, which included superficial L5 neurons, also revealed stabilization of late-delay working-memory representations with continued practice. Thus, delay- and choice-related activities that are essential for working-memory performance drift during learning and stabilize only after several days of expert performance.

    "abstract": "The financial motivation to earn advertising revenue has been widely conjectured to be pivotal for the production of online misinformation1–4. Research aimed at mitigating misinformation has so far focused on interventions at the user level5–8, with little emphasis on how the supply of misinformation can itself be countered. Here we show how online misinformation is largely financed by advertising, examine how financing misinformation affects the companies involved, and outline interventions for reducing the financing of misinformation. First, we find that advertising on websites that publish misinformation is pervasive for companies across several industries and is amplified by digital advertising platforms that algorithmically distribute advertising across the web. Using an information-provision experiment9, we find that companies that advertise on websites that publish misinformation can face substantial backlash from their consumers. To examine why misinformation continues to be monetized despite the potential backlash for the advertisers involved, we survey decision-makers at companies. We find that most decision-makers are unaware that their companies’ advertising appears on misinformation websites but have a strong preference to avoid doing so. Moreover, those who are unaware and uncertain about their company’s role in financing misinformation increase their demand for a platform-based solution to reduce monetizing misinformation when informed about how platforms amplify advertising placement on misinformation websites. We identify low-cost, scalable information-based interventions to reduce the financial incentive to misinform and counter the supply of misinformation online. Many companies unknowingly advertise on websites that publish misinformation despite the reputational and financial risks, and increased transparency for consumers and advertisers could counter unintended ad revenue going to misinformation websites.",

    "abstract": "The carbon skeleton of any organic molecule serves as the foundation for its three-dimensional structure, playing a pivotal role in determining its physical and biological properties1. As such, taxane diterpenes are one of the most well-known natural product families, primarily owing to the success of their most prominent compound, paclitaxel, an effective anticancer therapeutic for more than 25 years2–6. In contrast to classical taxanes, the bioactivity of cyclotaxanes (also referred to as complex taxanes) remains significantly underexplored. The carbon skeletons of these two groups of taxanes differ significantly, and so would typically their own distinct synthetic approaches. Here we report a versatile synthetic strategy based on the interconversion of complex molecular frameworks, providing general access to the wider taxane diterpene family. A range of classical and cyclotaxane frameworks was prepared including, among others, the total syntheses of taxinine K (2), canataxapropellane (5) and dipropellane C from a single advanced intermediate. The synthetic approach deliberately eschews biomimicry, emphasizing instead the power of stereoelectronic control in orchestrating the interconversion of polycyclic frameworks. We describe a versatile synthetic strategy for making a range of taxanes belonging to the family of anticancer drug taxol using a single precursor.",

    "abstract": "Atomic-scale observations of a specific local area would be considerably beneficial when exploring new fundamental materials and devices. The development of hardware-type aberration correction1,2 in electron microscopy has enabled local structural observations with atomic resolution3–5 as well as chemical and vibration analysis6–8. In magnetic imaging, however, atomic-level spin configurations are analysed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy by placing samples in strong magnetic fields9–11, which destroy the nature of the magnetic ordering in the samples. Although magnetic-field-free observations can visualize the intrinsic magnetic fields of an antiferromagnet by unit-cell averaging12, directly observing the magnetic field of an individual atomic layer of a non-uniform structure is challenging. Here we report that the magnetic fields of an individual lattice plane inside materials with a non-uniform structure can be observed under magnetic-field-free conditions by electron holography with a hardware-type aberration corrector assisted by post-digital aberration correction. The magnetic phases of the net magnetic moments of (111) lattice planes formed by opposite spin orderings between Fe3+ and Mo5+ in a ferrimagnetic double-perovskite oxide (Ba2FeMoO6) were successfully observed. This result opens the door to direct observations of the magnetic lattice in local areas, such as interfaces and grain boundaries, in many materials and devices. The magnetic fields of an individual lattice plane inside materials with a non-uniform structure were observed under magnetic-field-free conditions by electron holography.",

    "abstract": "In biological systems, the activities of macromolecular complexes must sometimes be turned off. Thus, a wide variety of protein inhibitors has evolved for this purpose. These inhibitors function through diverse mechanisms, including steric blocking of crucial interactions, enzymatic modification of key residues or substrates, and perturbation of post-translational modifications1. Anti-CRISPRs—proteins that block the activity of CRISPR–Cas systems—are one of the largest groups of inhibitors described, with more than 90 families that function through diverse mechanisms2–4. Here, we characterize the anti-CRISPR AcrIF25, and we show that it inhibits the type I-F CRISPR–Cas system by pulling apart the fully assembled effector complex. AcrIF25 binds to the predominant CRISPR RNA-binding components of this complex, comprising six Cas7 subunits, and strips them from the RNA. Structural and biochemical studies indicate that AcrIF25 removes one Cas7 subunit at a time, starting at one end of the complex. Notably, this feat is achieved with no apparent enzymatic activity. To our knowledge, AcrIF25 is the first example of a protein that disassembles a large and stable macromolecular complex in the absence of an external energy source. As such, AcrIF25 establishes a paradigm for macromolecular complex inhibitors that may be used for biotechnological applications. AcrIF25 inhibits the type I-F CRISPR–Cas system by disassembling its ribonucleoprotein effector complex without an external energy source.",

    "abstract": "Quantum annealers are commercial devices that aim to solve very hard computational problems1, typically those involving spin glasses2,3. Just as in metallurgic annealing, in which a ferrous metal is slowly cooled4, quantum annealers seek good solutions by slowly removing the transverse magnetic field at the lowest possible temperature. Removing the field diminishes the quantum fluctuations but forces the system to traverse the critical point that separates the disordered phase (at large fields) from the spin-glass phase (at small fields). A full understanding of this phase transition is still missing. A debated, crucial question regards the closing of the energy gap separating the ground state from the first excited state. All hopes of achieving an exponential speed-up, compared to classical computers, rest on the assumption that the gap will close algebraically with the number of spins5–9. However, renormalization group calculations predict instead that there is an infinite-randomness fixed point10. Here we solve this debate through extreme-scale numerical simulations, finding that both parties have grasped parts of the truth. Although the closing of the gap at the critical point is indeed super-algebraic, it remains algebraic if one restricts the symmetry of possible excitations. As this symmetry restriction is experimentally achievable (at least nominally), there is still hope for the quantum annealing paradigm11–13. We find that, in the quantum transition of Ising spin glass, the closing of the gap at the critical point can remain algebraic by restricting the symmetry of possible excitations, which is crucial for quantum annealing.",

    "abstract": "Most cases of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) remain unexplained1,2. Here, we report on two unrelated people who had HSE as children and are homozygous for rare deleterious variants of TMEFF1, which encodes a cell membrane protein that is preferentially expressed by brain cortical neurons. TMEFF1 interacts with the cell-surface HSV-1 receptor NECTIN-1, impairing HSV-1 glycoprotein D- and NECTIN-1-mediated fusion of the virus and the cell membrane, blocking viral entry. Genetic TMEFF1 deficiency allows HSV-1 to rapidly enter cortical neurons that are either patient specific or derived from CRISPR–Cas9-engineered human pluripotent stem cells, thereby enhancing HSV-1 translocation to the nucleus and subsequent replication. This cellular phenotype can be rescued by pretreatment with type I interferon (IFN) or the expression of exogenous wild-type TMEFF1. Moreover, ectopic expression of full-length TMEFF1 or its amino-terminal extracellular domain, but not its carboxy-terminal intracellular domain, impairs HSV-1 entry into NECTIN-1-expressing cells other than neurons, increasing their resistance to HSV-1 infection. Human TMEFF1 is therefore a host restriction factor for HSV-1 entry into cortical neurons. Its constitutively high abundance in cortical neurons protects these cells from HSV-1 infection, whereas inherited TMEFF1 deficiency renders them susceptible to this virus and can therefore underlie HSE. A study of two childhood cases of herpes simplex encephalitis shows that TMEFF1 interacts with the HSV-1 cell-surface receptor NECTIN-1, preventing HSV-1 from fusing with the cell membrane and entering cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "Selfish genetic elements contribute to hybrid incompatibility and bias or ‘drive’ their own transmission1,2. Chromosomal drive typically functions in asymmetric female meiosis, whereas gene drive is normally post-meiotic and typically found in males. Here, using single-molecule and single-pollen genome sequencing, we describe Teosinte Pollen Drive, an instance of gene drive in hybrids between maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte mexicana (Z. mays ssp. mexicana) that depends on RNA interference (RNAi). 22-nucleotide small RNAs from a non-coding RNA hairpin in mexicana depend on Dicer-like 2 (Dcl2) and target Teosinte Drive Responder 1 (Tdr1), which encodes a lipase required for pollen viability. Dcl2, Tdr1 and the hairpin are in tight pseudolinkage on chromosome 5, but only when transmitted through the male. Introgression of mexicana into early cultivated maize is thought to have been critical to its geographical dispersal throughout the Americas3, and a tightly linked inversion in mexicana spans a major domestication sweep in modern maize4. A survey of maize traditional varieties and sympatric populations of teosinte mexicana reveals correlated patterns of admixture among unlinked genes required for RNAi on at least four chromosomes that are also subject to gene drive in pollen from synthetic hybrids. Teosinte Pollen Drive probably had a major role in maize domestication and diversification, and offers an explanation for the widespread abundance of ‘self’ small RNAs in the germ lines of plants and animals. An example of hybrid incompatibility between maize and teosinte reveals a selfish toxin–antidote system mediated by small RNAs that may have contributed to the origin of maize.",

    "abstract": "Hot-carrier transistors are a class of devices that leverage the excess kinetic energy of carriers. Unlike regular transistors, which rely on steady-state carrier transport, hot-carrier transistors modulate carriers to high-energy states, resulting in enhanced device speed and functionality. These characteristics are essential for applications that demand rapid switching and high-frequency operations, such as advanced telecommunications and cutting-edge computing technologies1–5. However, the traditional mechanisms of hot-carrier generation are either carrier injection6–11 or acceleration12,13, which limit device performance in terms of power consumption and negative differential resistance14–17. Mixed-dimensional devices, which combine bulk and low-dimensional materials, can offer different mechanisms for hot-carrier generation by leveraging the diverse potential barriers formed by energy-band combinations18–21. Here we report a hot-emitter transistor based on double mixed-dimensional graphene/germanium Schottky junctions that uses stimulated emission of heated carriers to achieve a subthreshold swing lower than 1 millivolt per decade beyond the Boltzmann limit and a negative differential resistance with a peak-to-valley current ratio greater than 100 at room temperature. Multi-valued logic with a high inverter gain and reconfigurable logic states are further demonstrated. This work reports a multifunctional hot-emitter transistor with significant potential for low-power and negative-differential-resistance applications, marking a promising advancement for the post-Moore era. A mixed-dimensional hot-emitter transistor based on mixed-dimensional graphene/germanium Schottky junctions uses stimulated emission of heated carriers, achieving an ultralow subthreshold swing and a high negative differential resistance.",

    "abstract": "Conservation, restoration and land management are increasingly implemented at landscape scales1,2. However, because species interaction data are typically habitat- and/or guild-specific, exactly how those interactions connect habitats and affect the stability and function of communities at landscape scales remains poorly understood. We combine multi-guild species interaction data (plant–pollinator and three plant–herbivore–parasitoid communities, collected from landscapes with one, two or three habitats), a field experiment and a modelling approach to show that multi-habitat landscapes support higher species and interaction evenness, more complementary species interactions and more consistent robustness to species loss. These emergent network properties drive improved pollination success in landscapes with more habitats and are not explained by simply summing component habitat webs. Linking landscape composition, through community structure, to ecosystem function, highlights mechanisms by which several contiguous habitats can support landscape-scale ecosystem services. Species interaction data, a field experiment and modelling of plant–insect communities show that landscapes with more habitat types support more even species, more complementary interactions, are more consistently robust to species loss, and confer greater pollination function.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a pivotal role in allergic responses1,2. The high-affinity IgE receptor, FcεRI, found on mast cells and basophils, is central to the effector functions of IgE. FcεRI is a tetrameric complex, comprising FcεRIα, FcεRIβ and a homodimer of FcRγ (originally known as FcεRIγ), with FcεRIα recognizing the Fc region of IgE (Fcε) and FcεRIβ–FcRγ facilitating signal transduction3. Additionally, FcRγ is a crucial component of other immunoglobulin receptors, including those for IgG (FcγRI and FcγRIIIA) and IgA (FcαRI)4–8. However, the molecular basis of FcεRI assembly and the structure of FcRγ have remained elusive. Here we elucidate the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the Fcε–FcεRI complex. FcεRIα has an essential role in the receptor’s assembly, interacting with FcεRIβ and both FcRγ subunits. FcεRIβ is structured as a compact four-helix bundle, similar to the B cell antigen CD20. The FcRγ dimer exhibits an asymmetric architecture, and coils with the transmembrane region of FcεRIα to form a three-helix bundle. A cholesterol-like molecule enhances the interaction between FcεRIβ and the FcεRIα–FcRγ complex. Our mutagenesis analyses further indicate similarities between the interaction of FcRγ with FcεRIα and FcγRIIIA, but differences in that with FcαRI. These findings deepen our understanding of the signalling mechanisms of FcεRI and offer insights into the functionality of other immune receptors dependent on FcRγ. A study presents high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy structures detailing how the elements of FcεRI assemble and how this receptor complex interacts with the target immunoglobulin E.",

    "abstract": "Crustal accretion at mid-ocean ridges governs the creation and evolution of the oceanic lithosphere. Generally accepted models1–4 of passive mantle upwelling and melting predict notably decreased crustal thickness at a spreading rate of less than 20 mm year−1. We conducted the first, to our knowledge, high-resolution ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) experiment at the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean and imaged the crustal structure of the slowest-spreading ridge on the Earth. Unexpectedly, we find that crustal thickness ranges between 3.3 km and 8.9 km along the ridge axis and it increased from about 4.5 km to about 7.5 km over the past 5 Myr in an across-axis profile. The highly variable crustal thickness and relatively large average value does not align with the prediction of passive mantle upwelling models. Instead, it can be explained by a model of buoyant active mantle flow driven by thermal and compositional density changes owing to melt extraction. The influence of active versus passive upwelling is predicted to increase with decreasing spreading rate. The process of active mantle upwelling is anticipated to be primarily influenced by mantle temperature and composition. This implies that the observed variability in crustal accretion, which includes notably varied crustal thickness, is probably an inherent characteristic of ultraslow-spreading ridges. Results from a high-resolution ocean-bottom seismometer experiment at the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel Ridge show unexpected highly variable crustal thickness and a relatively large average value, which can be explained by an active mantle upwelling model.",

    "abstract": "Fifty-eight million individuals worldwide are affected by chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a primary driver of liver cancer for which no vaccine is available1. The HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2 form a heterodimer (E1/E2), which is the target for neutralizing antibodies2. However, the higher-order organization of these E1/E2 heterodimers, as well as that of any Hepacivirus envelope protein complex, remains unknown. Here we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of two E1/E2 heterodimers in a homodimeric arrangement. We reveal how the homodimer is established at the molecular level and provide insights into neutralizing antibody evasion and membrane fusion by HCV, as orchestrated by E2 motifs such as hypervariable region 1 and antigenic site 412, as well as the organization of the transmembrane helices, including two internal to E1. This study addresses long-standing questions on the higher-order oligomeric arrangement of Hepacivirus envelope proteins and provides a critical framework in the design of novel HCV vaccine antigens. Structural studies of a homodimeric arrangement of hepatitis C virus envelope E1/E2 heterodimers reveals the molecular basis of intracomplex interactions and  provides mechanistic insights into neutralizing antibody evasion and membrane fusion with host cells.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic CRISPR–Cas immunity is subverted by anti-CRISPRs (Acrs), which inhibit Cas protein activities when expressed during the phage lytic cycle or from resident prophages or plasmids1. Acrs often bind to specific cognate Cas proteins, and hence inhibition is typically limited to a single CRISPR–Cas subtype2. Furthermore, although acr genes are frequently organized together in phage-associated gene clusters3, how such inhibitors initially evolve has remained unclear. Here we investigated the Acr content and inhibition specificity of diverse Listeria isolates, which naturally harbour four CRISPR–Cas systems (types I-B, II-A, II-C and VI-A). We observed widespread antagonism of CRISPR, which we traced to 11 previously unknown and 4 known acr gene families encoded by endogenous mobile elements. Among these were two Acrs that possess sequence homology to type I-B Cas proteins, one of which assembles into a defective interference complex. Surprisingly, an additional type I-B Cas homologue did not affect type I immunity, but instead inhibited the RNA-targeting type VI CRISPR system by means of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) degradation. By probing viral sequence databases, we detected abundant orphan cas genes located within putative anti-defence gene clusters. Among them, we verified the activity of a particularly broad-spectrum cas3 homologue that inhibits type I-B, II-A and VI-A CRISPR immunity. Our observations provide direct evidence of Acr evolution by cas gene co-option, and new genes with potential for broad-spectrum control of genome editing technologies. We demonstrate that phages have co-opted cas genes from CRISPR defence systems, which subsequently evolved anti-defence functions.",

    "abstract": "The development of superconducting qubit technology has shown great potential for the construction of practical quantum computers1,2. As the complexity of quantum processors continues to grow, the need for stringent fabrication tolerances becomes increasingly critical3. Utilizing advanced industrial fabrication processes could facilitate the necessary level of fabrication control to support the continued scaling of quantum processors. However, at present, these industrial processes are not optimized to produce high-coherence devices, nor are they a priori compatible with the approaches commonly used to make superconducting qubits. Here we demonstrate superconducting transmon qubits manufactured in a 300 mm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) pilot line using industrial fabrication methods, with resulting relaxation and coherence times exceeding 100 μs. We show across-wafer, large-scale statistics of coherence, yield, variability and ageing that confirm the validity of our approach. The presented industry-scale fabrication process, which uses only optical lithography and reactive-ion etching, has a performance and yield in line with conventional laboratory-style techniques utilizing metal lift-off, angled evaporation and electron-beam writing4. Moreover, it offers the potential for further upscaling through three-dimensional integration5 and more process optimization. This result marks the advent of an alternative and new, large-scale, truly CMOS-compatible fabrication method for superconducting quantum computing processors. Superconducting transmon qubits have been fabricated in a 300 mm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) pilot line using industrial fabrication methods, achieving relaxation and coherence times exceeding 100 μs.",

    "abstract": "The coupling of conduction electrons and magnetic textures leads to quantum transport phenomena described by the language of emergent electromagnetic fields1–3. For magnetic skyrmions, spin-swirling particle-like objects, an emergent magnetic field is produced by their topological winding4–6, resulting in the conduction electrons exhibiting the topological Hall effect (THE)7. When the skyrmion lattice (SkL) acquires a drift velocity under conduction electron flow, an emergent electric field is also generated8,9. The resulting emergent electrodynamics dictate the magnitude of the THE by the relative motion of SkL and conduction electrons. Here we report the emergent electrodynamics induced by SkL motion in Gd2PdSi3, facilitated by its giant THE10,11. With increasing current excitation, we observe the dynamic transition of the SkL motion from the pinned to creep regime and finally to the flow regime, in which the THE is totally suppressed. We argue that the Galilean relativity required for the total cancellation of the THE may be generically recovered in the flow regime, even in complex multiband systems such as the present compound. Moreover, the observed THE voltages are large enough to enable real-time measurement of the SkL velocity–current profile, which shows the inertial-like motion of the SkL in the creep regime, appearing as the current hysteresis of the skyrmion velocity. The emergent electrodynamics induced by skyrmion lattice motion in Gd2PdSi3 is facilitated by its giant topological Hall effect dynamic transition, and implies the emergent Galilean relativity of current-driven skyrmions.",

    "abstract": "The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway guides the DNA methylation of young, active transposons during germline development in male mice1. piRNAs tether the PIWI protein MIWI2 (PIWIL4) to the nascent transposon transcript, resulting in DNA methylation through SPOCD1 (refs. 2–5). Transposon methylation requires great precision: every copy needs to be methylated but off-target methylation must be avoided. However, the underlying mechanisms that ensure this precision remain unknown. Here, we show that SPOCD1 interacts directly with SPIN1 (SPINDLIN1), a chromatin reader that primarily binds to H3K4me3-K9me3 (ref. 6). The prevailing assumption is that all the molecular events required for piRNA-directed DNA methylation occur after the engagement of MIWI2. We find that SPIN1 expression precedes that of both SPOCD1 and MIWI2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that young LINE1 copies, but not old ones, are marked by H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and SPIN1 before the initiation of piRNA-directed DNA methylation. We generated a Spocd1 separation-of-function allele in the mouse that encodes a SPOCD1 variant that no longer interacts with SPIN1. We found that the interaction between SPOCD1 and SPIN1 is essential for spermatogenesis and piRNA-directed DNA methylation of young LINE1 elements. We propose that piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation requires a developmentally timed two-factor authentication process. The first authentication is the recruitment of SPIN1–SPOCD1 to the young LINE1 promoter, and the second is MIWI2 engagement with the nascent transcript. In summary, independent authentication events underpin the precision of piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation. In male mouse germline development, the precise DNA methylation of young, active transposons requires a two-step process in which SPIN1 and SPOCD1 mark young LINE1 elements before the piRNA pathway triggers DNA methylation.",

    "abstract": "The developing placenta, which in mice originates through the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE), is essential for mammalian embryonic development. Yet unbiased characterization of the differentiation dynamics of the ExE and its interactions with the embryo proper remains incomplete. Here we develop a temporal single-cell model of mouse gastrulation that maps continuous and parallel differentiation in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages. This is matched with a three-way perturbation approach to target signalling from the embryo proper, the ExE alone, or both. We show that ExE specification involves early spatial and transcriptional bifurcation of uncommitted ectoplacental cone cells and chorion progenitors. Early BMP4 signalling from chorion progenitors is required for proper differentiation of uncommitted ectoplacental cone cells and later for their specification towards trophoblast giant cells. We also find biphasic regulation by BMP4 in the embryo. The early ExE-originating BMP4 signal is necessary for proper mesoendoderm bifurcation and for allantois and primordial germ cell specification. However, commencing at embryonic day 7.5, embryo-derived BMP4 restricts the primordial germ cell pool size by favouring differentiation of their extraembryonic mesoderm precursors towards an allantois fate. ExE and embryonic tissues are therefore entangled in time, space and signalling axes, highlighting the importance of their integrated understanding and modelling in vivo and in vitro. Temporally dynamic extraembryonic and embryonic BMP4 signalling shapes mouse embryo lineage choices.",

    "abstract": "In response to intense pressure, technology companies have enacted policies to combat misinformation1–4. The enforcement of these policies has, however, led to technology companies being regularly accused of political bias5–7. We argue that differential sharing of misinformation by people identifying with different political groups8–15 could lead to political asymmetries in enforcement, even by unbiased policies. We first analysed 9,000 politically active Twitter users during the US 2020 presidential election. Although users estimated to be pro-Trump/conservative were indeed substantially more likely to be suspended than those estimated to be pro-Biden/liberal, users who were pro-Trump/conservative also shared far more links to various sets of low-quality news sites—even when news quality was determined by politically balanced groups of laypeople, or groups of only Republican laypeople—and had higher estimated likelihoods of being bots. We find similar associations between stated or inferred conservatism and low-quality news sharing (on the basis of both expert and politically balanced layperson ratings) in 7 other datasets of sharing from Twitter, Facebook and survey experiments, spanning 2016 to 2023 and including data from 16 different countries. Thus, even under politically neutral anti-misinformation policies, political asymmetries in enforcement should be expected. Political imbalance in enforcement need not imply bias on the part of social media companies implementing anti-misinformation policies. We find that conservatives tend to share more low-quality news through social media than liberals, and so even if technology companies enact politically neutral anti-misinformation policies, political asymmetries in enforcement should be expected.",

    "abstract": "Owing to their similarities with giant exoplanets, brown dwarf companions of stars provide insights into the fundamental processes of planet formation and evolution. From their orbits, several brown dwarf companions are found to be more massive than theoretical predictions given their luminosities and the ages of their host stars1–3. Either the theory is incomplete or these objects are not single entities. For example, they could be two brown dwarfs each with a lower mass and intrinsic luminosity1,4. The most problematic example is Gliese 229 B (refs. 5,6), which is at least 2–6 times less luminous than model predictions given its dynamical mass of 71.4 ± 0.6 Jupiter masses (MJup) (ref. 1). We observed Gliese 229 B with the GRAVITY interferometer and, separately, the CRIRES+ spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. Both sets of observations independently resolve Gliese 229 B into two components, Gliese 229 Ba and Bb, settling the conflict between theory and observations. The two objects have a flux ratio of 0.47 ± 0.03 at a wavelength of 2 μm and masses of 38.1 ± 1.0 and 34.4 ± 1.5 MJup, respectively. They orbit each other every 12.1 days with a semimajor axis of 0.042 astronomical units (au). The discovery of Gliese 229 BaBb, each only a few times more massive than the most massive planets, and separated by 16 times the Earth–moon distance, raises new questions about the formation and prevalence of tight binary brown dwarfs around stars. Analysis of the cool brown dwarf Gliese 229 B suggests that it is actually a close binary of two less massive brown dwarfs, explaining its low luminosity and settling the conflict between theoretical predictions and measurements.",

    "abstract": "Now extinct, the aurochs (Bos primigenius) was a keystone species in prehistoric Eurasian and North African ecosystems, and the progenitor of cattle (Bos taurus), domesticates that have provided people with food and labour for millennia1. Here we analysed 38 ancient genomes and found 4 distinct population ancestries in the aurochs—European, Southwest Asian, North Asian and South Asian—each of which has dynamic trajectories that have responded to changes in climate and human influence. Similarly to Homo heidelbergensis, aurochsen first entered Europe around 650 thousand years ago2, but early populations left only trace ancestry, with both North Asian and European B. primigenius genomes coalescing during the most recent glaciation. North Asian and European populations then appear separated until mixing after the climate amelioration of the early Holocene. European aurochsen endured the more severe bottleneck during the Last Glacial Maximum, retreating to southern refugia before recolonizing from Iberia. Domestication involved the capture of a small number of individuals from the Southwest Asian aurochs population, followed by early and pervasive male-mediated admixture involving each ancestral strain of aurochs after domestic stocks dispersed beyond their cradle of origin. An analysis of 38 ancient genomes from the aurochs, the extinct ancestor of modern cattle, provides insight into the population ancestry and domestication of this species.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 3.4 million patients worldwide are diagnosed each year with cancers that have pathogenic mutations in one of three RAS proto-oncogenes (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS)1,2. These mutations impair the GTPase activity of RAS, leading to activation of downstream signalling and proliferation3–6. Long-standing efforts to restore the hydrolase activity of RAS mutants have been unsuccessful, extinguishing any consideration towards a viable therapeutic strategy7. Here we show that tri-complex inhibitors—that is, molecular glues with the ability to recruit cyclophilin A (CYPA) to the active state of RAS—have a dual mechanism of action: not only do they prevent activated RAS from binding to its effectors, but they also stimulate GTP hydrolysis. Drug-bound CYPA complexes modulate residues in the switch II motif of RAS to coordinate the nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of GTP in a mutation-specific manner. RAS mutants that were most sensitive to stimulation of GTPase activity were more susceptible to treatment than mutants in which the hydrolysis could not be enhanced, suggesting that pharmacological stimulation of hydrolysis potentiates the therapeutic effects of tri-complex inhibitors for specific RAS mutants. This study lays the foundation for developing a class of therapeutics that inhibit cancer growth by stimulating mutant GTPase activity. Tri-complex inhibitors—molecular glues with the ability to recruit cyclophilin A to the active state of RAS—stimulate GTP hydrolysis in a mutant-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Electrically induced amorphization is uncommon and has so far been realized by pulsed electrical current in only a few material systems, which are mostly based on the melt–quench process1. However, if the melting step can be avoided and solid-state amorphization can be realized electrically, it opens up the possibility for low-power device applications2–5. Here we report an energy-efficient, unconventional long-range solid-state amorphization in a new ferroic β″-phase of indium selenide nanowires through the application of a direct-current bias rather than a pulsed electrical stimulus. The complex interplay of the applied electric field perpendicular to the polarization, current flow parallel to the van der Waals layer and piezoelectric stress results in the formation of interlayer sliding defects and coupled disorder induced by in-plane polarization rotation in this layered material. On reaching a critical limit of the electrically induced disorder, the structure becomes frustrated and locally collapses into an amorphous phase6, and this phenomenon is replicated over a much larger microscopic-length scale through acoustic jerks7,8. Our work uncovers previously unknown multimodal coupling mechanisms of the ferroic order in materials to the externally applied electric field, current and internally generated stress, and can be useful to design new materials and devices for low-power electronic and photonic applications. Energy-efficient, solid-state amorphization of indium selenide nanowires is achieved using direct current, avoiding the melt–quench process.",

    "abstract": "Persister cells, rare phenotypic variants that survive normally lethal levels of antibiotics, present a major barrier to clearing bacterial infections1. However, understanding the precise physiological state and genetic basis of persister formation has been a longstanding challenge. Here we generated a high-resolution single-cell2 RNA atlas of Escherichia coli growth transitions, which revealed that persisters from diverse genetic and physiological models converge to transcriptional states that are distinct from standard growth phases and instead exhibit a dominant signature of translational deficiency. We then used ultra-dense CRISPR interference3 to determine how every E. coli gene contributes to persister formation across genetic models. Among critical genes with large effects, we found lon, which encodes a highly conserved protease4, and yqgE, a poorly characterized gene whose product strongly modulates the duration of post-starvation dormancy and persistence. Our work reveals key physiologic and genetic factors that underlie starvation-triggered persistence, a critical step towards targeting persisters in recalcitrant bacterial infections. Single-cell transcriptome analyses of growth phases in Escherichia coli identify a distinct transcriptional state occupied by antibiotic-tolerant persisters in which lon and yqgE have major roles.",

    "abstract": "Malaria pathology is driven by the accumulation of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in microvessels1. This process is mediated by the polymorphic erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesion proteins of the parasite. A subset of PfEMP1 variants that bind to human endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) through their CIDRα1 domains is responsible for severe malaria pathogenesis2. A longstanding question is whether individual antibodies can recognize the large repertoire of circulating PfEMP1 variants. Here we describe two broadly reactive and inhibitory human monoclonal antibodies to CIDRα1. The antibodies isolated from two different individuals exhibited similar and consistent EPCR-binding inhibition of diverse CIDRα1 domains, representing five of the six subclasses of CIDRα1. Both antibodies inhibited EPCR binding of both recombinant full-length and native PfEMP1 proteins, as well as parasite sequestration in bioengineered 3D human brain microvessels under physiologically relevant flow conditions. Structural analyses of the two antibodies in complex with three different CIDRα1 antigen variants reveal similar binding mechanisms that depend on interactions with three highly conserved amino acid residues of the EPCR-binding site in CIDRα1. These broadly reactive antibodies are likely to represent a common mechanism of acquired immunity to severe malaria and offer novel insights for the design of a vaccine or treatment targeting severe malaria. Two broadly reactive and inhibitory human monoclonal antibodies against the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum have been characterized, providing insights into immunity, prevention and treatment of severe malaria.",

    "abstract": "Predicting elemental cycles and maintaining water quality under increasing anthropogenic influence requires knowledge of the spatial drivers of river microbiomes. However, understanding of the core microbial processes governing river biogeochemistry is hindered by a lack of genome-resolved functional insights and sampling across multiple rivers. Here we used a community science effort to accelerate the sampling, sequencing and genome-resolved analyses of river microbiomes to create the Genome Resolved Open Watersheds database (GROWdb). GROWdb profiles the identity, distribution, function and expression of microbial genomes across river surface waters covering 90% of United States watersheds. Specifically, GROWdb encompasses microbial lineages from 27 phyla, including novel members from 10 families and 128 genera, and defines the core river microbiome at the genome level. GROWdb analyses coupled to extensive geospatial information reveals local and regional drivers of microbial community structuring, while also presenting foundational hypotheses about ecosystem function. Building on the previously conceived River Continuum Concept1, we layer on microbial functional trait expression, which suggests that the structure and function of river microbiomes is predictable. We make GROWdb available through various collaborative cyberinfrastructures2,3, so that it can be widely accessed across disciplines for watershed predictive modelling and microbiome-based management practices. GROWdb defines US river microbiomes at the genome level.",

    "abstract": "Astronomers have found more than a dozen planets transiting stars that are 10–40 million years old1, but younger transiting planets have remained elusive. The lack of such discoveries may be because planets have not fully formed at this age or because our view is blocked by the protoplanetary disk. However, we now know that many outer disks are warped or broken2; provided the inner disk is depleted, transiting planets may thus be visible. Here we report observations of the transiting planet IRAS 04125+2902 b orbiting a 3-million-year-old, 0.7-solar-mass, pre-main-sequence star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The host star harbours a nearly face-on (30 degrees inclination) transitional disk3 and a wide binary companion. The planet has a period of 8.83 days, a radius of 10.7 Earth radii (0.96 Jupiter radii) and a 95%-confidence upper limit on its mass of 90 Earth masses (0.3 Jupiter masses) from radial-velocity measurements, making it a possible precursor of the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes frequently found around main-sequence stars. The rotational broadening of the star and the orbit of the wide (4 arcseconds, 635 astronomical units) companion are both consistent with edge-on orientations. Thus, all components of the system are consistent with alignment except the outer disk; the origin of this misalignment is unclear. Observations of a 3-million-year-old pre-main-sequence star with a misaligned disk reveal a giant orbiting planet; the system is ideal for studying the early formation and migration of planets.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic DNA replication begins with the loading of the MCM replicative DNA helicase as a head-to-head double hexamer at origins of DNA replication1–3. Our current understanding of how the double hexamer is assembled by the origin recognition complex (ORC), CDC6 and CDT1 comes mostly from budding yeast. Here we characterize human double hexamer (hDH) loading using biochemical reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy with purified proteins. We show that the human double hexamer engages DNA differently from the yeast double hexamer (yDH), and generates approximately five base pairs of underwound DNA at the interface between hexamers, as seen in hDH isolated from cells4. We identify several differences from the yeast double hexamer in the order of factor recruitment and dependencies during hDH assembly. Unlike in yeast5–8, the ORC6 subunit of the ORC is not essential for initial MCM recruitment or hDH loading, but contributes to an alternative hDH assembly pathway that requires an intrinsically disordered region in ORC1, which may work through a MCM–ORC intermediate. Our work presents a detailed view of how double hexamers are assembled in an organism that uses sequence-independent replication origins, provides further evidence for diversity in eukaryotic double hexamer assembly mechanisms9, and represents a first step towards reconstitution of DNA replication initiation with purified human proteins. Biochemical and structural studies of the human MCM replicative DNA helicase complex show differences from the yeast complex and provide insights into mechanisms of double hexamer assembly on sequence-independent replication origins.",

    "abstract": "Loading of replicative helicases is obligatory for the assembly of DNA replication machineries. The eukaryotic MCM2–7 replicative helicase motor is deposited onto DNA by the origin recognition complex (ORC) and co-loader proteins as a head-to-head double hexamer to license replication origins. Although extensively studied in budding yeast1–4, the mechanisms of origin licensing in multicellular eukaryotes remain poorly defined. Here we use biochemical reconstitution and electron microscopy to reconstruct the human MCM loading pathway. We find that unlike in yeast, the ORC6 subunit of the ORC is not essential for—but enhances—human MCM loading. Electron microscopy analyses identify several intermediates en route to MCM double hexamer formation in the presence and absence of ORC6, including a DNA-loaded, closed-ring MCM single hexamer intermediate that can mature into a head-to-head double hexamer through multiple mechanisms. ORC6 and ORC3 facilitate the recruitment of the ORC to the dimerization interface of the first hexamer into MCM–ORC (MO) complexes that are distinct from the yeast MO complex5,6 and may orient the ORC for second MCM hexamer loading. Additionally, MCM double hexamer formation can proceed through dimerization of independently loaded MCM single hexamers, promoted by a propensity of human MCM2–7 hexamers to self-dimerize. This flexibility in human MCM loading may provide resilience against cellular replication stress, and the reconstitution system will enable studies addressing outstanding questions regarding DNA replication initiation and replication-coupled events in the future. Biochemical and structural studies of the loading pathway of the human MCM2–7 replicative helicase motor reveal differences from the orthologous yeast system that may increase resilience against challenges faced by multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "The early radiation of dinosaurs remains a complex and poorly understood evolutionary event1–4. Here we use hundreds of fossils with direct evidence of feeding to compare trophic dynamics across five vertebrate assemblages that record this event in the Triassic–Jurassic succession of the Polish Basin (central Europe). Bromalites, fossil digestive products, increase in size and diversity across the interval, indicating the emergence of larger dinosaur faunas with new feeding patterns. Well-preserved food residues and bromalite-taxon associations enable broad inferences of trophic interactions. Our results, integrated with climate and plant data, indicate a stepwise increase of dinosaur diversity and ecospace occupancy in the area. This involved (1) a replacement of non-dinosaur guild members by opportunistic and omnivorous dinosaur precursors, followed by (2) the emergence of insect and fish-eating theropods and small omnivorous dinosaurs. Climate change in the latest Triassic5–7 resulted in substantial vegetation changes that paved the way for ((3) and (4)) an expansion of herbivore ecospace and the replacement of pseudosuchian and therapsid herbivores by large sauropodomorphs and early ornithischians that ingested food of a broader range, even including burnt plants. Finally, (5) theropods rapidly evolved and developed enormous sizes in response to the appearance of the new herbivore guild. We suggest that the processes shown by the Polish data may explain global patterns, shedding new light on the environmentally governed emergence of dinosaur dominance and gigantism that endured until the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. Integrated analyses of bromalites provide robust pictures of past food webs, explaining early dinosaur evolution and the emergence of larger dinosaur faunas with new feeding patterns.",

    "abstract": "Anhedonia, the diminished drive to seek, value, and learn about rewards, is a core feature of major depressive disorder1–3. The neural underpinnings of anhedonia and how this emotional state drives behaviour remain unclear. Here we investigated the neural code of anhedonia by taking advantage of the fact that when mice are exposed to traumatic social stress, susceptible animals become socially withdrawn and anhedonic, whereas others remain resilient. By performing high-density electrophysiology to record neural activity patterns in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral CA1 (vCA1), we identified neural signatures of susceptibility and resilience. When mice actively sought rewards, BLA activity in resilient mice showed robust discrimination between reward choices. By contrast, susceptible mice exhibited a rumination-like signature, in which BLA neurons encoded the intention to switch or stay on a previously chosen reward. Manipulation of vCA1 inputs to the BLA in susceptible mice rescued dysfunctional neural dynamics, amplified dynamics associated with resilience, and reversed anhedonic behaviour. Finally, when animals were at rest, the spontaneous BLA activity of susceptible mice showed a greater number of distinct neural population states. This spontaneous activity allowed us to decode group identity and to infer whether a mouse had a history of stress better than behavioural outcomes alone. This work reveals population-level neural dynamics that explain individual differences in responses to traumatic stress, and suggests that modulating vCA1–BLA inputs can enhance resilience by regulating these dynamics. Examination of the neural activity in the basolateral amygdala and ventral CA1 of mice during tasks or rest following exposure to social stress reveals signatures of resilience and susceptibility to stress.",

    "abstract": "Zorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system that protects bacteria from viral (phage) infections. Three Zorya subtypes have been identified, each containing predicted membrane-embedded ZorA–ZorB (ZorAB) complexes paired with soluble subunits that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD in type I Zorya systems1,2. Here we investigate the molecular basis of Zorya defence using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics and functional studies. We present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ZorAB and show that it shares stoichiometry and features of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. The ZorA5B2 complex contains a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan-binding domain and a pentameric α-helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 70 nm into the cytoplasm. We also characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components ZorC and ZorD, finding that they have DNA-binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrate that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We provide evidence that ZorAB operates as a proton-driven motor that becomes activated after sensing of phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to recruit and activate the soluble ZorC and ZorD effectors, which facilitate the degradation of the phage DNA. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function as an anti-phage defence system. Zorya uses a membrane-anchored H+-driven rotary motor ZorAB to sense phage invasion and to recruit the intracellular effectors ZorC and ZorD that execute anti-phage defence.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. The rapid development of highly effective vaccines2,3 against SARS-CoV-2 has altered the trajectory of the pandemic, and antiviral therapeutics4 have further reduced the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that encode various structural and non-structural proteins, including those critical for viral RNA replication and evasion from innate immunity5. Here we report the discovery and development of a first-in-class non-covalent small-molecule inhibitor of the viral guanine-N7 methyltransferase (MTase) NSP14. High-throughput screening identified RU-0415529, which inhibited SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 by forming a unique ternary S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)-bound complex. Hit-to-lead optimization of RU-0415529 resulted in TDI-015051 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 61 pM and a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 11 nM, inhibiting virus infection in a cell-based system. TDI-015051 also inhibited viral replication in primary small airway epithelial cells and in a transgenic mouse model of SARS CoV-2 infection with an efficacy comparable with the FDA-approved reversible covalent protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir6. The inhibition of viral cap methylases as an antiviral strategy is also adaptable to other pandemic viruses. The development of a first-in-class non-covalent small-molecule inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication that targets the viral guanine-N7 methyltransferase NSP14 is reported.",

    "abstract": "Discrete protein assemblies ranging from hundreds of kilodaltons to hundreds of megadaltons in size are a ubiquitous feature of biological systems and perform highly specialized functions1,2. Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry3. Here, inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540 and 960 subunits. At 49, 71 and 96 nm diameter, these nanocages are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work substantially broadens the variety of self-assembling protein architectures that are accessible through design. A new computational method for design of pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials has resulted in purification of cage-like protein assemblies containing 960 subunits with a diameter of 96 nm.",

    "abstract": "Focal gene amplifications are among the most common cancer-associated mutations1 but have proven challenging to engineer in primary cells and model organisms. Here we describe a general strategy to engineer large (more than 1 Mbp) focal amplifications mediated by extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs)2 in a spatiotemporally controlled manner in cells and in mice. By coupling ecDNA formation with expression of selectable markers, we track the dynamics of ecDNA-containing cells under physiological conditions and in the presence of specific selective pressures. We also apply this approach to generate mice harbouring Cre-inducible Myc- and Mdm2-containing ecDNAs analogous to those occurring in human cancers. We show that the engineered ecDNAs spontaneously accumulate in primary cells derived from these animals, promoting their proliferation, immortalization and transformation. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of Mdm2-containing ecDNAs to promote tumour formation in an autochthonous mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings offer insights into the role of ecDNA-mediated gene amplifications in tumorigenesis. We anticipate that this approach will be valuable for investigating further unresolved aspects of ecDNA biology and for developing new preclinical immunocompetent mouse models of human cancers harbouring specific focal gene amplifications. Large extrachromosomal DNAs are engineered using a CRISPR- and Cre–loxP-based approach and shown to drive cancer in mouse models, with potential applications in determining the role of oncogene amplifications in human cancers.",

    "abstract": "A new class of extragalactic astronomical sources discovered in 2021, named odd radio circles (ORCs)1, are large rings of faint, diffuse radio continuum emission spanning approximately 1 arcminute on the sky. Galaxies at the centres of several ORCs have photometric redshifts of z ≃ 0.3–0.6, implying physical scales of several 100 kpc in diameter for the radio emission, the origin of which is unknown. Here we report spectroscopic data on an ORC including strong [O ii] emission tracing ionized gas in the central galaxy of ORC4 at z = 0.4512. The physical extent of the [O ii] emission is approximately 40 kpc in diameter, larger than expected for a typical early-type galaxy2 but an order of magnitude smaller than the large-scale radio continuum emission. We detect an approximately 200 km s−1 velocity gradient across the [O ii] nebula, as well as a high velocity dispersion of approximately 180 km s−1. The [O ii] equivalent width (approximately 50 Å) is extremely high for a quiescent galaxy. The morphology, kinematics and strength of the [O ii] emission are consistent with the infall of shock ionized gas near the galaxy, following a larger, outward-moving shock. Both the extended optical and radio emission, although observed on very different scales, may therefore result from the same dramatic event. We find that the optical emission due to ionized gas that is characteristic of a shock extends 40 kpc in diameter across the host galaxy of an odd radio circle.",

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting—the non-equivalence of maternal and paternal genomes—is a critical process that has evolved independently in many plant and mammalian species1,2. According to kinship theory, imprinting is the inevitable consequence of conflictive selective forces acting on differentially expressed parental alleles3,4. Yet, how these epigenetic differences evolve in the first place is poorly understood3,5,6. Here we report the identification and molecular dissection of a parent-of-origin effect on gene expression that might help to clarify this fundamental question. Toxin-antidote elements (TAs) are selfish elements that spread in populations by poisoning non-carrier individuals7–9. In reciprocal crosses between two Caenorhabditis tropicalis wild isolates, we found that the slow-1/grow-1 TA is specifically inactive when paternally inherited. This parent-of-origin effect stems from transcriptional repression of the slow-1 toxin by the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) host defence pathway. The repression requires PIWI Argonaute and SET-32 histone methyltransferase activities and is transgenerationally inherited via small RNAs. Remarkably, when slow-1/grow-1 is maternally inherited, slow-1 repression is halted by a translation-independent role of its maternal mRNA. That is, slow-1 transcripts loaded into eggs—but not SLOW-1 protein—are necessary and sufficient to counteract piRNA-mediated repression. Our findings show that parent-of-origin effects can evolve by co-option of the piRNA pathway and hinder the spread of selfish genes that require sex for their propagation. In Caenorhabditis tropicalis, selective expression of genetic alleles from one parent but not the other can arise from maternally inherited small transcripts acting via the PIWI-interacting RNA host defence pathway.",

    "abstract": "Subduction zones generate the largest earthquakes on Earth, yet their detailed structure, and its influence on seismic and aseismic slip, remains poorly understood. Geological studies of fossil subduction zones characterize the seismogenic interface as a 100 m–1 km thick zone1–3 in which deformation occurs mostly on metres-thick faults1,3–6. Conversely, seismological studies, with their larger spatial coverage and temporal resolution but lower spatial resolution, often image the seismogenic interface as a kilometres-wide band of seismicity7. Thus, how and when these metre-scale structures are active at the seismic-cycle timescale, and what influence they have on deformation is not known. Here we detect these metres-thick faults with seismicity and show their influence on afterslip propagation. Using a local three-dimensional velocity model and dense observations of more than 1,500 double-difference relocated earthquakes in Ecuador, we obtain an exceptionally detailed image of seismicity, showing that earthquakes occur sometimes on a single plane and sometimes on several metres-thick simultaneously active subparallel planes within the plate interface zone. This geometrical complexity affects afterslip propagation, demonstrating the influence of fault continuity and structure on slip at the seismogenic interface. Our findings can therefore help to create more realistic models of earthquake rupture, aseismic slip and earthquake hazard in subduction zones. Using observations of double-difference relocated earthquakes in a local three-dimensional velocity model for Ecuador, a detailed image of seismicity is created, forming the base for more realistic models of earthquake rupture, slip and hazard in subduction zones.",

    "abstract": "Colloidal crystals exhibit interesting properties1–4 that are in many ways analogous to their atomic counterparts. They have the same crystal structures2,5–7, undergo the same phase transitions8–10, and possess the same crystallographic defects11–14. In contrast to these structural properties, the mechanical properties of colloidal crystals are quite different from those of atomic systems. For example, unlike in atomic systems, the elasticity of hard-sphere colloidal crystals is purely entropic15; as a result, they are so soft that they can be melted just by stirring16,17. Moreover, crystalline materials deform plastically when subjected to increasing shear and become stronger because of the ubiquitous process of work hardening18; but this has so far never been observed in colloidal crystals, to our knowledge. Here we show that hard-sphere colloidal crystals exhibit work hardening. Moreover, despite their softness, the shear strength of colloidal crystals can increase and approach the theoretical limit for crystals, a value reached in very few other materials so far. We use confocal microscopy to show that the strength of colloidal crystals increases with dislocation density, and ultimately reaches the classic Taylor scaling behaviour for atomic materials19–21, although hard-sphere interactions lack the complexity of atomic interactions. We demonstrate that Taylor hardening arises through the formation of dislocation junctions22. The Taylor hardening regime, however, is established only after a transient phase, and it ceases when the colloidal crystals become so hard that the strain is localized within a thin boundary layer in which slip results from an unconventional motion of dislocations. The striking resemblance between colloidal and atomic crystals, despite the many orders of magnitude difference in particle size and shear modulus, demonstrates the universality of work hardening. Deformation of soft colloidal crystals lead to work hardening, similar to that seen in the deformation of metals.",

    "abstract": "The processes that govern human haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and engraftment are poorly understood and challenging to recapitulate in culture to reliably expand functional HSCs1–3. Here we identify MYC target 1 (MYCT1; also known as MTLC) as a crucial human HSC regulator that moderates endocytosis and environmental sensing in HSCs. MYCT1 is selectively expressed in undifferentiated human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and endothelial cells but becomes markedly downregulated during HSC culture. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of MYCT1 prevented human fetal liver and cord blood (CB) HSPC expansion and engraftment. By contrast, restoring MYCT1 expression improved the expansion and engraftment of cultured CB HSPCs. Single-cell RNA sequencing of human CB HSPCs in which MYCT1 was knocked down or overexpressed revealed that MYCT1 governs important regulatory programmes and cellular properties essential for HSC stemness, such as ETS factor expression and low mitochondrial activity. MYCT1 is localized in the endosomal membrane in HSPCs and interacts with vesicle trafficking regulators and signalling machinery. MYCT1 loss in HSPCs led to excessive endocytosis and hyperactive signalling responses, whereas restoring MYCT1 expression balanced culture-induced endocytosis and dysregulated signalling. Moreover, sorting cultured CB HSPCs on the basis of lowest endocytosis rate identified HSPCs with preserved MYCT1 expression and MYCT1-regulated HSC stemness programmes. Our work identifies MYCT1-moderated endocytosis and environmental sensing as essential regulatory mechanisms required to preserve human HSC stemness. Our data also pinpoint silencing of MYCT1 as a cell-culture-induced vulnerability that compromises human HSC expansion. MYCT1 is identified as a crucial regulator of cellular properties essential for the stemness of human haematopoietic stem cells, a finding that may help improve successful in vitro expansion of these cells for therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The social media platforms of the twenty-first century have an enormous role in regulating speech in the USA and worldwide1. However, there has been little research on platform-wide interventions on speech2,3. Here we evaluate the effect of the decision by Twitter to suddenly deplatform 70,000 misinformation traffickers in response to the violence at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 (a series of events commonly known as and referred to here as ‘January 6th’). Using a panel of more than 500,000 active Twitter users4,5 and natural experimental designs6,7, we evaluate the effects of this intervention on the circulation of misinformation on Twitter. We show that the intervention reduced circulation of misinformation by the deplatformed users as well as by those who followed the deplatformed users, though we cannot identify the magnitude of the causal estimates owing to the co-occurrence of the deplatforming intervention with the events surrounding January 6th. We also find that many of the misinformation traffickers who were not deplatformed left Twitter following the intervention. The results inform the historical record surrounding the insurrection, a momentous event in US history, and indicate the capacity of social media platforms to control the circulation of misinformation, and more generally to regulate public discourse. Difference-in-differences analysis indicates that the decision by Twitter to deplatform 70,000 users following the events at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 had wider effects on the spread of misinformation.",

    "abstract": "Histone acetylation regulates gene expression, cell function and cell fate1. Here we study the pattern of histone acetylation in the epithelial tissue of the Drosophila wing disc. H3K18ac, H4K8ac and total lysine acetylation are increased in the outer rim of the disc. This acetylation pattern is controlled by nuclear position, whereby nuclei continuously move from apical to basal locations within the epithelium and exhibit high levels of H3K18ac when they are in proximity to the tissue surface. These surface nuclei have increased levels of acetyl-CoA synthase, which generates the acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation. The carbon source for histone acetylation in the rim is fatty acid β-oxidation, which is also increased in the rim. Inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation causes H3K18ac levels to decrease in the genomic proximity of genes involved in disc development. In summary, there is a physical mark of the outer rim of the wing and other imaginal epithelia in Drosophila that affects gene expression. Analyses of histone acetylation in Drosophila wing imaginal discs reveal distinct patterns of acetylation and cellular metabolism that affect gene expression and cell specification.",

    "abstract": "Graphene-based, high-quality, two-dimensional electronic systems have emerged as a highly tunable platform for studying superconductivity1–21. Specifically, superconductivity has been observed in both electron- and hole-doped twisted graphene moiré systems1–17, whereas in crystalline graphene systems, superconductivity has so far been observed only in hole-doped rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG)18 and hole-doped Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG)19–21. Recently, enhanced superconductivity has been demonstrated20,21 in BBG because of the proximity to a monolayer WSe2. Here we report the observation of superconductivity and a series of flavour-symmetry-breaking phases in electron- and hole-doped BBG/WSe2 devices by electrostatic doping. The strength of the observed superconductivity is tunable by applied vertical electric fields. The maximum Berezinskii–Kosterlitz−Thouless transition temperature for the electron- and hole-doped superconductivity is about 210 mK and 400 mK, respectively. Superconductivities emerge only when the applied electric fields drive the BBG electron or hole wavefunctions towards the WSe2 layer, underscoring the importance of the WSe2 layer in the observed superconductivity. The hole-doped superconductivity violates the Pauli paramagnetic limit, consistent with an Ising-like superconductor. By contrast, the electron-doped superconductivity obeys the Pauli limit, although the proximity-induced Ising spin–orbit coupling is also notable in the conduction band. Our findings highlight the rich physics associated with the conduction band in BBG, paving the way for further studies into the superconducting mechanisms of crystalline graphene and the development of superconductor devices based on BBG. Tunable superconductivity and a series of flavour-symmetry-breaking phases are observed in electron- and hole-doped Bernal bilayer graphene.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of glycosidases characterized to date follow one of the variations of the ‘Koshland’ mechanisms1 to hydrolyse glycosidic bonds through substitution reactions. Here we describe a large-scale screen of a human gut microbiome metagenomic library using an assay that selectively identifies non-Koshland glycosidase activities2. Using this, we identify a cluster of enzymes with extremely broad substrate specificities and thoroughly characterize these, mechanistically and structurally. These enzymes not only break glycosidic linkages of both α and β stereochemistry and multiple connectivities, but also cleave substrates that are not hydrolysed by standard glycosidases. These include thioglycosides, such as the glucosinolates from plants, and pseudoglycosidic bonds of pharmaceuticals such as acarbose. This is achieved through a distinct mechanism of hydrolysis that involves oxidation/reduction and elimination/hydration steps, each catalysed by enzyme modules that are in many cases interchangeable between organisms and substrate classes. Homologues of these enzymes occur in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria associated with the gut microbiome and other body parts, as well as other environments, such as soil and sea. Such alternative step-wise mechanisms appear to constitute largely unrecognized but abundant pathways for glycan degradation as part of the metabolism of carbohydrates in bacteria. A screen of a human gut microbiome metagenomic library reveals a cluster of enzymes with an unconventional mechanism and an extremely broad substrate scope.",

    "abstract": "Locating sound sources such as prey or predators is critical for survival in many vertebrates. Terrestrial vertebrates locate sources by measuring the time delay and intensity difference of sound pressure at each ear1–5. Underwater, however, the physics of sound makes interaural cues very small, suggesting that directional hearing in fish should be nearly impossible6. Yet, directional hearing has been confirmed behaviourally, although the mechanisms have remained unknown for decades. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this remarkable ability, including the possibility that fish evolved an extreme sensitivity to minute interaural differences or that fish might compare sound pressure with particle motion signals7,8. However, experimental challenges have long hindered a definitive explanation. Here we empirically test these models in the transparent teleost Danionella cerebrum, one of the smallest vertebrates9,10. By selectively controlling pressure and particle motion, we dissect the sensory algorithm underlying directional acoustic startles. We find that both cues are indispensable for this behaviour and that their relative phase controls its direction. Using micro-computed tomography and optical vibrometry, we further show that D. cerebrum has the sensory structures to implement this mechanism. D. cerebrum shares these structures with more than 15% of living vertebrate species, suggesting a widespread mechanism for inferring sound direction. A study demonstrates that the fish Danionella cerebrum is able to discriminate the direction of sound by comparing the relative phase of pressure and particle motion.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase is intimately associated with stem cells and cancer, because it catalytically elongates telomeres—nucleoprotein caps that protect chromosome ends1. Overexpression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) enhances the proliferation of cells in a telomere-independent manner2–8, but so far, loss-of-function studies have provided no evidence that TERT has a direct role in stem cell function. In many tissues, homeostasis is shaped by stem cell competition, a process in which stem cells compete on the basis of inherent fitness. Here we show that conditional deletion of Tert in the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC)-containing population in mice markedly impairs competitive clone formation. Using lineage tracing from the Tert locus, we find that TERT-expressing SSCs yield long-lived clones, but that clonal inactivation of TERT promotes stem cell differentiation and a genome-wide reduction in open chromatin. This role for TERT in competitive clone formation occurs independently of both its reverse transcriptase activity and the canonical telomerase complex. Inactivation of TERT causes reduced activity of the MYC oncogene, and transgenic expression of MYC in the TERT-deleted pool of SSCs efficiently rescues clone formation. Together, these data reveal a catalytic-activity-independent requirement for TERT in enhancing stem cell competition, uncover a genetic connection between TERT and MYC and suggest that a selective advantage for stem cells with high levels of TERT contributes to telomere elongation in the male germline during homeostasis and ageing. Studies in mice show that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has a role in enhancing stem cell competition that is independent of its reverse transcriptase activity, and promotes chromatin accessibility and activity of the MYC oncogene.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the amount of daylight (photoperiod) alter physiology and behaviour1,2. Adaptive responses to seasonal photoperiods are vital to all organisms—dysregulation associates with disease, including affective disorders3 and metabolic syndromes4. The circadian rhythm circuitry is implicated in such responses5,6, yet little is known about the precise cellular substrates that underlie phase synchronization to photoperiod change. Here we identify a brain circuit and system of axon branch-specific and reversible neurotransmitter deployment that are critical for behavioural and sleep adaptation to photoperiod. A type of neuron called mrEn1-Pet17 in the mouse brainstem median raphe nucleus segregates serotonin from VGLUT3 (also known as SLC17A8, a proxy for glutamate) to different axonal branches that innervate specific brain regions involved in circadian rhythm and sleep–wake timing8,9. This branch-specific neurotransmitter deployment did not distinguish between daylight and dark phase; however, it reorganized with change in photoperiod. Axonal boutons, but not cell soma, changed neurochemical phenotype upon a shift away from equinox light/dark conditions, and these changes were reversed upon return to equinox conditions. When we genetically disabled Vglut3 in mrEn1-Pet1 neurons, sleep–wake periods, voluntary activity and clock gene expression did not synchronize to the new photoperiod or were delayed. Combining intersectional rabies virus tracing and projection-specific neuronal silencing, we delineated a preoptic area-to-mrEn1Pet1 connection that was responsible for decoding the photoperiodic inputs, driving the neurotransmitter reorganization and promoting behavioural synchronization. Our results reveal a brain circuit and periodic, branch-specific neurotransmitter deployment that regulates organismal adaptation to photoperiod change.  Changes in day length, conveyed by the preoptic area, drive axonal neurotransmitter reorganization in median raphe dual serotonin–glutamate neurons to regulate behaviour and sleep timing, highlighting a photoperiod-sensitive brain circuit.",

    "abstract": "Motivations bias our responses to stimuli, producing behavioural outcomes that match our needs and goals. Here we describe a mechanism behind this phenomenon: adjusting the time over which stimulus-derived information is permitted to accumulate towards a decision. As a Drosophila copulation progresses, the male becomes less likely to continue mating through challenges1–3. We show that a set of copulation decision neurons (CDNs) flexibly integrates information about competing drives to mediate this decision. Early in mating, dopamine signalling restricts CDN integration time by potentiating Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation in response to stimulatory inputs, imposing a high threshold for changing behaviours. Later into mating, the timescale over which the CDNs integrate termination-promoting information expands, increasing the likelihood of switching behaviours. We suggest scalable windows of temporal integration at dedicated circuit nodes as a key but underappreciated variable in state-based decision-making. In Drosophila, dopamine sets motivational state during mating by regulating the integration of competing drives in copulation decision neurons, potentially indicative of a more general role for control over neuronal integration time in the regulation of behavioural decisions.",

    "abstract": "Many cratonic continental fragments dispersed during the rifting and break-up of Gondwana are bound by steep topographic landforms known as ‘great escarpments’1–4, which rim elevated plateaus in the craton interior5,6. In terms of formation, escarpments and plateaus are traditionally considered distinct owing to their spatial separation, occasionally spanning more than a thousand kilometres. Here we integrate geological observations, statistical analysis, geodynamic simulations and landscape-evolution models to develop a physical model that mechanistically links both phenomena to continental rifting. Escarpments primarily initiate at rift-border faults and slowly retreat at about 1 km Myr−1 through headward erosion. Simultaneously, rifting generates convective instabilities in the mantle7–10 that migrate cratonward at a faster rate of about 15–20 km Myr−1 along the lithospheric root, progressively removing cratonic keels11, driving isostatic uplift of craton interiors and forming a stable, elevated plateau. This process forces a synchronized wave of denudation, documented in thermochronology studies, which persists for tens of millions of years and migrates across the craton at a comparable or slower pace. We interpret the observed sequence of rifting, escarpment formation and exhumation of craton interiors as an evolving record of geodynamic mantle processes tied to continental break-up, upending the prevailing notion of cratons as geologically stable terrains. By integrating geological observations, statistical analysis, geodynamic simulations and landscape-evolution models, a physical model is proposed to link the coevolution of craton margins and interiors with continental rifting.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the provenance of megaliths used in the Neolithic stone circle at Stonehenge, southern England, gives insight into the culture and connectivity of prehistoric Britain. The source of the Altar Stone, the central recumbent sandstone megalith, has remained unknown, with recent work discounting an Anglo-Welsh Basin origin1,2. Here we present the age and chemistry of detrital zircon, apatite and rutile grains from within fragments of the Altar Stone. The detrital zircon load largely comprises Mesoproterozoic and Archaean sources, whereas rutile and apatite are dominated by a mid-Ordovician source. The ages of these grains indicate derivation from an ultimate Laurentian crystalline source region that was overprinted by Grampian (around 460 million years ago) magmatism. Detrital age comparisons to sedimentary packages throughout Britain and Ireland reveal a remarkable similarity to the Old Red Sandstone of the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland. Such a provenance implies that the Altar Stone, a 6 tonne shaped block, was sourced at least 750 km from its current location. The difficulty of long-distance overland transport of such massive cargo from Scotland, navigating topographic barriers, suggests that it was transported by sea. Such routing demonstrates a high level of societal organization with intra-Britain transport during the Neolithic period. Mineral ages and chemical analysis of fragments of the Altar Stone from the Neolithic stone circle at Stonehenge suggest that it was transported from northeast Scotland, more than 750 km away, probably by sea.",

    "abstract": "The nitrogen isotopic composition of sedimentary rocks (δ15N) can trace redox-dependent biological pathways and early Earth oxygenation1,2. However, there is no substantial change in the sedimentary δ15N record across the Great Oxidation Event about 2.45 billion years ago (Ga)3, a prominent redox change. This argues for a temporal decoupling between the emergence of the first oxygen-based oxidative pathways of the nitrogen cycle and the accumulation of atmospheric oxygen after 2.45 Ga (ref. 3). The transition between both states shows strongly positive δ15N values (10–50‰) in rocks deposited between 2.8 Ga and 2.6 Ga, but their origin and spatial extent remain uncertain4,5. Here we report strongly positive δ15N values (>30‰) in the 2.68-Gyr-old shallow to deep marine sedimentary deposit of the Serra Sul Formation6, Amazonian Craton, Brazil. Our findings are best explained by regionally variable extents of ammonium oxidation to N2 or N2O tied to a cryptic oxygen cycle, implying that oxygenic photosynthesis was operating at 2.7 Ga. Molecular oxygen production probably shifted the redox potential so that an intermediate N cycle based on ammonium oxidation developed before nitrate accumulation in surface waters. We propose to name this period, when strongly positive nitrogen isotopic compositions are superimposed on the usual range of Precambrian δ15N values, the Nitrogen Isotope Event. We suggest that it marks the earliest steps of the biogeochemical reorganizations that led to the Great Oxidation Event. Observations of strongly positive nitrogen isotopic compositions of sedimentary rocks in the 2.68-Gyr-old shallow to deep marine sedimentary deposit of the Serra Sul Formation suggest that oxygenic photosynthesis predated the Great Oxidation Event.",

    "abstract": "Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are emergent zero-energy topological quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles1,2. Detected MZMs are spatially separated and electrically neutral, so producing hybridization between MZMs is extremely challenging in superconductors3,4. Here, we report the magnetic field response of vortex bound states in superconducting topological crystalline insulator SnTe (001) films. Several MZMs were predicted to coexist in a single vortex due to magnetic mirror symmetry. Using a scanning tunnelling microscope equipped with a three-axis vector magnet, we found that the zero-bias peak (ZBP) in a single vortex exhibits an apparent anisotropic response even though the magnetic field is weak. The ZBP can robustly extend a long distance of up to approximately 100 nm at the (001) surface when the magnetic field is parallel to the (\n                \n                  \n                \n                $$1\\bar{1}0$$\n                \n              )-type mirror plane, otherwise it displays an asymmetric splitting. Our systematic simulations demonstrate that the anisotropic response cannot be reproduced with trivial ZBPs. Although the different MZMs cannot be directly distinguished due to the limited energy resolution in our experiments, our comparisons between experimental measurements and theoretical simulations strongly support the existence and hybridization of symmetry-protected multiple MZMs. Our work demonstrates a way to hybridize different MZMs by controlling the orientation of the magnetic field and expands the types of MZM available for tuning topological states. We observe signatures of the existence and hybridization of multiple Majorana zero modes in a single vortex.",

    "abstract": "Rapa Nui (also known as Easter Island) is one of the most isolated inhabited places in the world. It has captured the imagination of many owing to its archaeological record, which includes iconic megalithic statues called moai1. Two prominent contentions have arisen from the extensive study of Rapa Nui. First, the history of the Rapanui has been presented as a warning tale of resource overexploitation that would have culminated in a major population collapse—the ‘ecocide’ theory2–4. Second, the possibility of trans-Pacific voyages to the Americas pre-dating European contact is still debated5–7. Here, to address these questions, we reconstructed the genomic history of the Rapanui on the basis of 15 ancient Rapanui individuals that we radiocarbon dated (1670–1950 ce) and whole-genome sequenced (0.4–25.6×). We find that these individuals are Polynesian in origin and most closely related to present-day Rapanui, a finding that will contribute to repatriation efforts. Through effective population size reconstructions and extensive population genetics simulations, we reject a scenario involving a severe population bottleneck during the 1600s, as proposed by the ecocide theory. Furthermore, the ancient and present-day Rapanui carry similar proportions of Native American admixture (about 10%). Using a Bayesian approach integrating genetic and radiocarbon dates, we estimate that this admixture event occurred about 1250–1430 ce. An analysis of 15 ancient genomes from individuals dating to AD 1670–1950 from Rapa Nui (also known as Easter Island) addresses questions about the population history of the island.",

    "abstract": "The biological pump supplies carbon to the oceans’ interior, driving long-term carbon sequestration and providing energy for deep-sea ecosystems1,2. Its efficiency is set by transformations of newly formed particles in the euphotic zone, followed by vertical flux attenuation via mesopelagic processes3. Depth attenuation of the particulate organic carbon (POC) flux is modulated by multiple processes involving zooplankton and/or microbes4,5. Nevertheless, it continues to be mainly parameterized using an empirically derived relationship, the ‘Martin curve’6. The derived power-law exponent is the standard metric used to compare flux attenuation patterns across oceanic provinces7,8. Here we present in situ experimental findings from C-RESPIRE9, a dual particle interceptor and incubator deployed at multiple mesopelagic depths, measuring microbially mediated POC flux attenuation. We find that across six contrasting oceanic regimes, representing a 30-fold range in POC flux, degradation by particle-attached microbes comprised 7–29 per cent of flux attenuation, implying a more influential role for zooplankton in flux attenuation. Microbial remineralization, normalized to POC flux, ranged by 20-fold across sites and depths, with the lowest rates at high POC fluxes. Vertical trends, of up to threefold changes, were linked to strong temperature gradients at low-latitude sites. In contrast, temperature played a lesser role at mid- and high-latitude sites, where vertical trends may be set jointly by particle biochemistry, fragmentation and microbial ecophysiology. This deconstruction of the Martin curve reveals the underpinning mechanisms that drive microbially mediated POC flux attenuation across oceanic provinces. In situ experimental findings from six contrasting oceanic regimes, at multiple mesopelagic depths, are used to determine the mechanisms that drive microbially mediated carbon flux attenuation in the oceanic biological pump.",

    "abstract": "Layer 5 extratelencephalic (ET) neurons are present across neocortical areas and send axons to multiple subcortical targets1–6. Two cardinal subtypes exist7,8: (1) Slco2a1-expressing neurons (ETdist), which predominate in the motor cortex and project distally to the pons, medulla and spinal cord; and (2) Npsr1- or Hpgd-expressing neurons (ETprox), which predominate in the visual cortex and project more proximally to the pons and thalamus. An understanding of how area-specific ETdist and ETprox emerge during development is important because they are critical for fine motor skills and are susceptible to spinal cord injury and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis9–12. Here, using cross-areal mapping of axonal projections in the mouse neocortex, we identify the subtype-specific developmental dynamics of ET neurons. Whereas subsets of ETprox emerge by pruning of ETdist axons, others emerge de novo. We outline corresponding subtype-specific developmental transcriptional programs using single-nucleus sequencing. Leveraging these findings, we use postnatal in vivo knockdown of subtype-specific transcription factors to reprogram ET neuron connectivity towards more proximal targets. Together, these results show the functional transcriptional programs driving ET neuron diversity and uncover cell subtype-specific gene regulatory networks that can be manipulated to direct target specificity in motor corticofugal pathways. Using cross-areal mapping of axonal projections in the mouse neocortex, we identify the subtype-specific developmental dynamics of extratelencephalic neurons and show the functional transcriptional programs driving extratelencephalic neuron diversity.",

    "abstract": "Avulsing rivers create new pathways on the floodplain and the associated flooding can profoundly affect society1–4. River avulsions are thought to occur when the water column becomes perched above the floodplain5 or when the slope down the flanks of the channel provides a steeper descent than the existing river channel6,7. We test these classical ideas by quantifying the topography around avulsing rivers and show that these mechanisms, historically invoked separately, work together. Near coasts, rivers avulse when the slope away from the channel is steeper, not because they are perched. The opposite is true near mountain fronts; on fans, the alternative paths are similarly steep to the downstream path, so rivers avulse when they are perched above the surrounding landscape. We reconcile these findings and present a new theoretical framework that identifies which rivers are vulnerable to avulsion and predicts the path of an avulsing river. These first-order rules of avulsion suggest that avulsion risks are underestimated in many coastal environments8 and that probabilistic predictions of avulsion pathfinding can efficiently map hazards with minimal information. Applying these principles for risk assessment could particularly benefit the Global South, which is disproportionately affected by avulsions. A novel theoretical framework reveals how topography surrounding rivers causes dramatic changes in their courses, with implications for natural hazard prediction, particularly in the Global South.",

    "abstract": "Studies of moiré systems have explained the effect of superlattice modulations on their properties, demonstrating new correlated phases1. However, most experimental studies have focused on a few layers in two-dimensional systems. Extending twistronics to three dimensions, in which the twist extends into the third dimension, remains underexplored because of the challenges associated with the manual stacking of layers. Here we study three-dimensional twistronics using a self-assembled twisted spiral superlattice of multilayered WS2. Our findings show an opto-twistronic Hall effect driven by structural chirality and coherence length, modulated by the moiré potential of the spiral superlattice. This is an experimental manifestation of the noncommutative geometry of the system. We observe enhanced light–matter interactions and an altered dependence of the Hall coefficient on photon momentum. Our model suggests contributions from higher-order quantum geometric quantities to this observation, providing opportunities for designing quantum-materials-based optoelectronic lattices with large nonlinearities. Opto-twistronic Hall effect driven by structural chirality and coherence length is observed in a three-dimensional self-assembled twisted spiral superlattice of WS2.",

    "abstract": "Primary production in the sunlit surface ocean is regulated by the supply of key nutrients, primarily nitrate, phosphate and iron (Fe), required by phytoplankton to fix carbon dioxide into biomass1–3. Below the surface ocean, remineralization of sinking organic matter rapidly regenerates nutrients, and microbial metabolism in the upper mesopelagic ‘twilight zone’ (200–500 m) is thought to be limited by the delivery of labile organic carbon4,5. However, few studies have examined the role of nutrients in shaping microbial production in the mesopelagic6–8. Here we report the distribution and uptake of siderophores, biomarkers for microbial Fe deficiency9 across a meridional section of the eastern Pacific Ocean. Siderophore concentrations are high not only in chronically Fe-limited surface waters but also in the twilight zone underlying the North and South Pacific subtropical gyres, two key ecosystems for the marine carbon cycle. Our findings suggest that bacterial Fe deficiency owing to low Fe availability is probably characteristic of the twilight zone in several large ocean basins, greatly expanding the region of the marine water column in which nutrients limit microbial metabolism, with potential implications for ocean carbon storage. The distribution and uptake of siderophores across a meridional section of the eastern Pacific Ocean suggests that iron availability limits microbial metabolism in the upper mesopelagic in several large ocean basins.",

    "abstract": "Animals must navigate changing environments to find food, shelter or mates. In mammals, grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex construct a neural spatial map of the external environment1–5. However, how grid cell firing patterns rapidly adapt to novel or changing environmental features on a timescale relevant to behaviour remains unknown. Here, by recording over 15,000 grid cells in mice navigating virtual environments, we tracked the real-time state of the grid cell network. This allowed us to observe and predict how altering environmental features influenced grid cell firing patterns on a nearly instantaneous timescale. We found evidence that visual landmarks provide inputs to fixed points in the grid cell network. This resulted in stable grid cell firing patterns in novel and altered environments after a single exposure. Fixed visual landmark inputs also influenced the grid cell network such that altering landmarks induced distortions in grid cell firing patterns. Such distortions could be predicted by a computational model with a fixed landmark to grid cell network architecture. Finally, a medial entorhinal cortex-dependent task revealed that although grid cell firing patterns are distorted by landmark changes, behaviour can adapt via a downstream region implementing behavioural timescale synaptic plasticity6. Overall, our findings reveal how the navigational system of the brain constructs spatial maps that balance rapidity and accuracy. Fixed connections between landmarks and grid cells enable the brain to quickly generate stable spatial maps, essential for navigation in novel or changing environments. Conversely, plasticity in regions downstream from grid cells allows the spatial maps of the brain to more accurately mirror the external spatial environment. More generally, these findings raise the possibility of a broader neural principle: by allocating fixed and plastic connectivity across different networks, the brain can solve problems requiring both rapidity and representational accuracy. How the navigational system of the brain constructs spatial maps that require both rapid changes and representational accuracy is explored.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori disturbs the stomach lining during long-term colonization of its human host, with sequelae including ulcers and gastric cancer1,2. Numerous H. pylori virulence factors have been identified, showing extensive geographic variation1. Here we identify a ‘Hardy’ ecospecies of H. pylori that shares the ancestry of ‘Ubiquitous’ H. pylori from the same region in most of the genome but has nearly fixed single-nucleotide polymorphism differences in 100 genes, many of which encode outer membrane proteins and host interaction factors. Most Hardy strains have a second urease, which uses iron as a cofactor rather than nickel3, and two additional copies of the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA. Hardy strains currently have a limited distribution, including in Indigenous populations in Siberia and the Americas and in lineages that have jumped from humans to other mammals. Analysis of polymorphism data implies that Hardy and Ubiquitous coexisted in the stomachs of modern humans since before we left Africa and that both were dispersed around the world by our migrations. Our results also show that highly distinct adaptive strategies can arise and be maintained stably within bacterial populations, even in the presence of continuous genetic exchange between strains. ‘Hardy’ Helicobacter pylori ecospecies shares the ancestry of ‘Ubiquitous’ H. pylori from the same region in most of the genome but has nearly fixed single-nucleotide polymorphism differences in 100 genes.",

    "abstract": "Many organisms, including cosmopolitan drosophilids, show circadian plasticity, varying their activity with changing dawn–dusk intervals1. How this behaviour evolves is unclear. Here we compare Drosophila melanogaster with Drosophila sechellia, an equatorial, ecological specialist that experiences minimal photoperiod variation, to investigate the mechanistic basis of circadian plasticity evolution2. D. sechellia has lost the ability to delay its evening activity peak time under long photoperiods. Screening of circadian mutants in D. melanogaster/D. sechellia hybrids identifies a contribution of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf) to this loss. Pdf exhibits species-specific temporal expression, due in part to cis-regulatory divergence. RNA interference and rescue experiments in D. melanogaster using species-specific Pdf regulatory sequences demonstrate that modulation of this neuropeptide’s expression affects the degree of behavioural plasticity. The Pdf regulatory region exhibits signals of selection in D. sechellia and across populations of D. melanogaster from different latitudes. We provide evidence that plasticity confers a selective advantage for D. melanogaster at elevated latitude, whereas D. sechellia probably suffers fitness costs through reduced copulation success outside its range. Our findings highlight this neuropeptide gene as a hotspot locus for circadian plasticity evolution that might have contributed to both D. melanogaster’s global distribution and D. sechellia’s specialization. We provide evidence that circadian plasticity has diverged through evolution of the neuropeptide gene Pdf, conferring a selective advantage for Drosophila melanogaster at elevated latitude, whereas Drosophila sechellia probably suffers fitness costs outside its range.",

APC-mutant intestinal stem cells outcompete their wild-type neighbours through the secretion of Wnt antagonists, which accelerates the fixation and subsequent rapid clonal expansion of mutants3–5. Reports of polyclonal intestinal tumours in human patients and mouse models appear at odds with this process6,7. Here we combine multicolour lineage tracing with chemical mutagenesis in mice to show that a large proportion of intestinal tumours have a multiancestral origin. Polyclonal tumours retain a structure comprising subclones with distinct Apc mutations and transcriptional states, driven predominantly by differences in KRAS and MYC signalling. These pathway-level changes are accompanied by profound differences in cancer stem cell phenotypes. Of note, these findings are confirmed by introducing an oncogenic Kras mutation that results in predominantly monoclonal tumour formation. Further, polyclonal tumours have accelerated growth dynamics, suggesting a link between polyclonality and tumour progression. Together, these findings demonstrate the role of interclonal interactions in promoting tumorigenesis through non-cell autonomous pathways that are dependent on the differential activation of oncogenic pathways between clones. Multicolour lineage tracing and mutagenesis studies in a mouse model show that many intestinal tumours are polyclonal, with multiple clones exhibiting independent Apc mutations driven by differences in KRAS and MYC signalling.",

    "abstract": "The fast increase of convergence rate between India and Eurasia around 65 million years ago (Ma)—from approximately 8 cm yr−1 to a peak rate of approximately 18 cm yr−1—remains a complex geological event to explain1–8, given the inherent uncertainty surrounding the tectonic history and the intricate interplay of forces influencing plate speed9–11. Here we use a combination of geochemical analysis and geodynamic modelling to propose that this rapid convergence can be explained by sediment subduction derived from the northern Indian passive margin. Through isotope and trace element analysis, we find an enhanced contribution of terrigenous sediment melt to the mantle source of the Gangdese magmatic rocks around 65 Ma, concurrent with the acceleration of India–Eurasia convergence. Numerical experiments suggest that subduction of sediments more than 1 km thick covering an approximately 1,000-km-wide ocean basin abutting the northern Indian passive margin starting from 65 Ma could have spurred the increased convergence rate and further led to significant crustal extension, consistent with empirical observations. Our study implies that the acceleration of India–Eurasia convergence marks the arrival of passive-margin-derived sediments, constraining the initial India–Eurasia collision to be around 60 Ma. It further suggests that temporary accelerations in subduction rates might be a common feature at the final stage of continental assembly. Geochemical data and geodynamic modelling suggest that the rapid increase of convergence rate between India and Eurasia about 65 million years ago can be explained by changes in sediment subduction.",

    "abstract": "Persistent, memorandum-specific neuronal spiking activity has long been hypothesized to underlie working memory1,2. However, emerging evidence suggests a potential role for ‘activity-silent’ synaptic mechanisms3–5. This issue remains controversial because evidence for either view has largely relied either on datasets that fail to capture single-trial population dynamics or on indirect measures of neuronal spiking. We addressed this controversy by examining the dynamics of mnemonic information on single trials obtained from large, local populations of lateral prefrontal neurons recorded simultaneously in monkeys performing a working memory task. Here we show that mnemonic information does not persist in the spiking activity of neuronal populations during memory delays, but instead alternates between coordinated ‘On’ and ‘Off’ states. At the level of single neurons, Off states are driven by both a loss of selectivity for memoranda and a return of firing rates to spontaneous levels. Further exploiting the large-scale recordings used here, we show that mnemonic information is available in the patterns of functional connections among neuronal ensembles during Off states. Our results suggest that intermittent periods of memorandum-specific spiking coexist with synaptic mechanisms to support working memory. By recording large populations of neurons in behaving monkeys using newly developed silicon probes, we show that intermittent periods of memorandum-specific spiking coexist with synaptic mechanisms to support working memory.",

    "abstract": "Human life history is characterized by an extended period of immaturity during which there is a disjunction between cerebral and somatic growth rates1. This mode of ontogeny is thought to be essential for the acquisition of advanced cognitive capabilities in a socially complex environment while the brain is still growing2. Key information about when and how this pattern evolved can be gleaned from the teeth of fossil hominins because dental development informs about the pace of life history3–5. Here we show that the first evolutionary steps towards an extended growth phase occurred in the genus Homo at least 1.77 million years ago, before any substantial increase in brain size. We used synchrotron phase-contrast tomography6 to track the microstructural development of the dentition of a subadult early Homo individual from Dmanisi, Georgia. The individual died at the age of 11.4 ± 0.6 years, shortly before reaching dental maturity. Tooth growth rates were high, similar to rates in living great apes. However, the Dmanisi individual showed a human-like delayed formation of the posterior relative to the anterior dentition, and a late growth spurt of the dentition as a whole. The unique combination of great-ape-like and human-like features of dental ontogeny suggests that early Homo had evolved an extended growth phase before a general slow-down in life history, possibly related to biocultural reproduction7 rather than brain growth. Fossil tooth development suggests an extended human growth phase occurred at least 1.77 million years ago, possibly reflecting a shift towards extended parenting and reproductive success, rather than increasing brain size.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers process information with the laws of quantum mechanics. Current quantum hardware is noisy, can only store information for a short time and is limited to a few quantum bits, that is, qubits, typically arranged in a planar connectivity1. However, many applications of quantum computing require more connectivity than the planar lattice offered by the hardware on more qubits than is available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU). The community hopes to tackle these limitations by connecting QPUs using classical communication, which has not yet been proven experimentally. Here we experimentally realize error-mitigated dynamic circuits and circuit cutting to create quantum states requiring periodic connectivity using up to 142 qubits spanning two QPUs with 127 qubits each connected in real time with a classical link. In a dynamic circuit, quantum gates can be classically controlled by the outcomes of mid-circuit measurements within run-time, that is, within a fraction of the coherence time of the qubits. Our real-time classical link enables us to apply a quantum gate on one QPU conditioned on the outcome of a measurement on another QPU. Furthermore, the error-mitigated control flow enhances qubit connectivity and the instruction set of the hardware thus increasing the versatility of our quantum computers. Our work demonstrates that we can use several quantum processors as one with error-mitigated dynamic circuits enabled by a real-time classical link. A 142-qubit processor can be realized by connecting two smaller quantum processors using classical communications and circuit cutting.",

    "abstract": "A central question in biology is how macromolecular machines function cooperatively. In bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, and can be physically and functionally coupled1–4. Although high-resolution structures of the ribosome–RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex have provided initial mechanistic insights into the coupling process5–10, we lack knowledge of how these structural snapshots are placed along a dynamic reaction trajectory. Here we reconstitute a complete and active transcription–translation system and develop multi-colour single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments to directly and simultaneously track transcription elongation, translation elongation and the physical and functional coupling between the ribosome and the RNAP in real time. Our data show that physical coupling between ribosome and RNAP can occur over hundreds of nucleotides of intervening mRNA by mRNA looping, a process facilitated by NusG. We detect active transcription elongation during mRNA looping and show that NusA-paused RNAPs can be activated by the ribosome by long-range physical coupling. Conversely, the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP. We hereby provide an alternative explanation for how the ribosome can efficiently rescue RNAP from frequent pausing without requiring collisions by a closely trailing ribosome. Overall, our dynamic data mechanistically highlight an example of how two central macromolecular machineries, the ribosome and RNAP, can physically and functionally cooperate to optimize gene expression. Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments with a recombinant Escherichia coli transcription–translation system provides insights into the coordination of the transcription and translation machineries mediated by the intervening mRNA.",

    "abstract": "The ability of cells to maintain distinct identities and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks1–3. These dynamic regulatory circuits that respond to extracellular cues in primary human cells remain poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in T cells, where distinct lineages must respond to diverse signals to mount effective immune responses and maintain homeostasis4–8. Here we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4+ T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL-2Rα, a canonical marker of T cell activation transiently expressed by pro-inflammatory effector T cells and constitutively expressed by anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells where it is required for fitness9–11. Approximately 90% of identified regulators of IL-2Rα had effects that varied across cell types and/or stimulation states, including a subset that even had opposite effects across conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits, we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. MED12 — a component of the Mediator complex — serves as a dynamic orchestrator of key regulators, controlling expression of distinct sets of regulators in different T cell contexts. Immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry revealed that MED12 interacts with the histone methylating COMPASS complex. MED12 was required for histone methylation and expression of genes encoding key context-specific regulators, including the rest maintenance factor KLF2 and the versatile regulator MYC. CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted the cell-state transitions between rest and activation and protected from activation-induced cell death. Overall, this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across conditions to define dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states. Resting and activated T cell states are established by context-specific regulators and dynamic gene circuits.",

    "abstract": "Cellular identity requires the concerted action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) bound together to enhancers of cell-type-specific genes. Despite TFs recognizing specific DNA motifs within accessible chromatin, this information is insufficient to explain how TFs select enhancers1. Here we compared four different TF combinations that induce different cell states, analysing TF genome occupancy, chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning and 3D genome organization at the nucleosome resolution. We show that motif recognition on mononucleosomes can decipher only the individual binding of TFs. When bound together, TFs act cooperatively or competitively to target nucleosome arrays with defined 3D organization, displaying motifs in particular patterns. In one combination, motif directionality funnels TF combinatorial binding along chromatin loops, before infiltrating laterally to adjacent enhancers. In other combinations, TFs assemble on motif-dense and highly interconnected loop junctions, and subsequently translocate to nearby lineage-specific sites. We propose a guided-search model in which motif grammar on nucleosome fibres acts as signpost elements, directing TF combinatorial binding to enhancers.

    "abstract": "Recent Antarctic sea-ice decline is a substantial source of concern, notably the record low in 2023 (ref. 1). Progress has been made towards establishing the causes of ice loss1–5 but uncertainty remains about its consequences for ocean–atmosphere interaction. Resolution of this uncertainty is important as ice decline can substantially alter surface heat loss and thus the ocean and atmosphere6. Here we show that the strongest winter 2023 ice-retraction regions provide an important new source of turbulent ocean heat loss to the atmosphere in wintertime. Ice concentration in these regions (located primarily in the Weddell, Bellingshausen and Ross seas) is reduced by up to 80% and is accompanied by an unprecedented doubling of mid-winter ocean heat loss. Also, there is a phase shift in the time of peak heat loss from late April to mid-June, with weaker than normal heat loss in austral autumn. The winter surface-heat-loss intensification is accompanied by substantial changes on both sides of the ocean–atmosphere interface. These include increases in atmospheric-storm frequency and surface-heat-loss-driven dense water formation, although the implications of the densification for broader processes such as Antarctic bottom water formation remain unclear. Our results reveal that the 2023 Antarctic sea-ice loss has substantially modified air–sea interaction in the Southern Ocean and motivate in-depth analysis of the wider climate-system impacts. The record-low Antarctic sea-ice decline in 2023 substantially altered Southern Ocean–atmosphere interaction leading to unprecedented wintertime turbulent ocean heat loss to the atmosphere, enhanced storminess and increased dense water formation.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow regions of intense water vapour transport in the Earth’s atmosphere. These transient phenomena carry water from the subtropics to the mid-latitudes and polar regions1,2, making up the majority of polewards moisture transport3–5 and exerting control on the precipitation and water resources in many regions6,7. In addition to transporting moisture, ARs also transport heat, but the impact of this transport on global near-surface air temperatures has not yet been characterized. Here we show that seasons with more frequent ARs also have warmer than average temperatures in many mid-latitude regions, and that AR events are associated with temperature anomalies of 5–10 °C above the climatological mean. This is due to anomalous horizontal transport and convergence of sensible heat and moisture in the lower atmosphere, which increases both downward sensible heat flux and downwelling long-wave radiation at the surface. On an hourly timescale, over 70% of extreme warm-temperature anomalies occur within ARs in large portions of the mid-latitudes, and ARs are associated with moist and compound heatwaves in many regions worldwide, suggesting that consideration of ARs may improve predictive capability for certain extreme heat events. Our results demonstrate that ARs significantly impact air temperatures on a wide array of timescales, and that they may play a wider role in global energy transport than previously recognized. Seasons with more frequent atmospheric rivers (ARs) also have warmer than average temperatures in many mid-latitude regions, and AR events are associated with temperature anomalies of 5–10 °C above the climatological mean.",

    "abstract": "In systemic lupus erythematosus, loss of immune tolerance, autoantibody production and immune complex deposition are required but not sufficient for organ damage1. How inflammatory signals are initiated and amplified in the setting of autoimmunity remains elusive. Here we set out to dissect layers and hierarchies of autoimmune kidney inflammation to identify tissue-specific cellular hubs that amplify autoinflammatory responses. Using high-resolution single-cell profiling of kidney immune and parenchymal cells, in combination with antibody blockade and genetic deficiency, we show that tissue-resident NKp46+ innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are crucial signal amplifiers of disease-associated macrophage expansion and epithelial cell injury in lupus nephritis, downstream of autoantibody production. NKp46 signalling in a distinct subset of group 1 ILCs (ILC1s) instructed an unconventional immune-regulatory transcriptional program, which included the expression of the myeloid cell growth factor CSF2. CSF2 production by NKp46+ ILCs promoted the population expansion of monocyte-derived macrophages. Blockade of the NKp46 receptor (using the antibody clone mNCR1.15; ref. 2) or genetic deficiency of NKp46 abrogated epithelial cell injury. The same cellular and molecular patterns were operative in human lupus nephritis. Our data provide support for the idea that NKp46+ ILC1s promote parenchymal cell injury by granting monocyte-derived macrophages access to epithelial cell niches. NKp46 activation in ILC1s therefore constitutes a previously unrecognized, crucial tissue rheostat that amplifies organ damage in autoimmune hosts, with broad implications for inflammatory pathologies and therapies. NKp46+ innate lymphoid cells are identified as pivotal signal amplifiers of autoinflammatory responses in lupus nephritis.",

    "abstract": "T cells in jawed vertebrates comprise two lineages, αβ T cells and γδ T cells, defined by the antigen receptors they express—that is, αβ and γδ T cell receptors (TCRs), respectively. The two lineages have different immunological roles, requiring that γδ TCRs recognize more structurally diverse ligands1. Nevertheless, the receptors use shared CD3 subunits to initiate signalling. Whereas the structural organization of αβ TCRs is understood2,3, the architecture of γδ TCRs is unknown. Here, we used cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of a fully assembled, MR1-reactive, human Vγ8Vδ3 TCR–CD3δγε2ζ2 complex bound by anti-CD3ε antibody Fab fragments4,5. The arrangement of CD3 subunits in γδ and αβ TCRs is conserved and, although the transmembrane α-helices of the TCR-γδ and -αβ subunits differ markedly in sequence, packing of the eight transmembrane-helix bundles is similar. However, in contrast to the apparently rigid αβ TCR2,3,6, the γδ TCR exhibits considerable conformational heterogeneity owing to the ligand-binding TCR-γδ subunits being tethered to the CD3 subunits by their transmembrane regions only. Reducing this conformational heterogeneity by transfer of the Vγ8Vδ3 TCR variable domains to an αβ TCR enhanced receptor signalling, suggesting that γδ TCR organization reflects a compromise between efficient signalling and the ability to engage structurally diverse ligands. Our findings reveal the marked structural plasticity of the TCR on evolutionary timescales, and recast it as a highly versatile receptor capable of initiating signalling as either a rigid or flexible structure. Cryogenic electron microscopy determines the structure of a fully assembled, MR1-reactive, human Vγ8Vδ3 TCR–CD3δγε2ζ2 complex bound by anti-CD3ε antibody Fab fragments.",

    "abstract": "Although aromatic rings are common elements in pharmaceutically active compounds, the presence of these motifs brings several liabilities with respect to the developability of a drug1. Nonoptimal potency, metabolic stability, solubility and lipophilicity in pharmaceutical compounds can be improved by replacing aromatic rings with non-aromatic isosteric motifs2. Moreover, whereas aromatic rings are planar and lack three-dimensionality, the binding pockets of most pharmaceutical targets are chiral. Thus, the stereochemical configuration of the isosteric replacements may offer an added opportunity to improve the affinity of derived ligands for target receptors. A notable impediment to this approach is the lack of simple and scalable catalytic enantioselective syntheses of candidate isosteres from readily available precursors. Here we present a previously unknown palladium-catalysed reaction that converts hydrocarbon-derived precursors to chiral boron-containing nortricyclanes and we show that the shape of these nortricyclanes makes them plausible isosteres for meta disubstituted aromatic rings. With chiral catalysts, the Pd-catalysed reaction can be accomplished in an enantioselective fashion and subsequent transformation of the boron group provides access to a broad array of structures. We also show that the incorporation of nortricyclanes into pharmaceutical motifs can result in improved biophysical properties along with stereochemistry-dependent activity. We anticipate that these features, coupled with the simple, inexpensive synthesis of the functionalized nortricyclane scaffold, will render this platform a useful foundation for the assembly of new biologically active agents. A palladium-catalysed reaction converts hydrocarbon-derived precursors to chiral boron-containing nortricyclanes, and the shape of these nortricyclanes makes them plausible isosteres for meta disubstituted aromatic rings.",

    "abstract": "Any electrical signal propagating in a metallic conductor loses amplitude due to the natural resistance of the metal. Compensating for such losses presently requires repeatedly breaking the conductor and interposing amplifiers that consume and regenerate the signal. This century-old primitive severely constrains the design and performance of modern interconnect-dense chips1. Here we present a fundamentally different primitive based on semi-stable edge of chaos (EOC)2,3, a long-theorized but experimentally elusive regime that underlies active (self-amplifying) transmission in biological axons4,5. By electrically accessing the spin crossover in LaCoO3, we isolate semi-stable EOC, characterized by small-signal negative resistance and amplification of perturbations6,7. In a metallic line atop a medium biased at EOC, a signal input at one end exits the other end amplified, without passing through a separate amplifying component. While superficially resembling superconductivity, active transmission offers controllably amplified time-varying small-signal propagation at normal temperature and pressure, but requires an electrically energized EOC medium. Operando thermal mapping reveals the mechanism of amplification—bias energy of the EOC medium, instead of fully dissipating as heat, is partly used to amplify signals in the metallic line, thereby enabling spatially continuous active transmission, which could transform the design and performance of complex electronic chips. A method using semi-stable edge of chaos in LaCoO3 enables continuous signal amplification in metallic conductors without separate amplifiers, potentially revolutionizing electronic chip design.",

    "abstract": "The brain helps us survive by forming internal representations of the external world1,2. Excitatory cortical neurons are often precisely tuned to specific external stimuli3,4. However, inhibitory neurons, such as parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, are generally less selective5. PV interneurons differ from excitatory neurons in their neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, including AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors (AMPARs)6,7. Excitatory neurons express calcium-impermeable AMPARs that contain the GluA2 subunit (encoded by GRIA2), whereas PV interneurons express receptors that lack the GluA2 subunit and are calcium-permeable (CP-AMPARs). Here we demonstrate a causal relationship between CP-AMPAR expression and the low feature selectivity of PV interneurons. We find low expression stoichiometry of GRIA2 mRNA relative to other subunits in PV interneurons that is conserved across ferrets, rodents, marmosets and humans, and causes abundant CP-AMPAR expression. Replacing CP-AMPARs in PV interneurons with calcium-impermeable AMPARs increased their orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Manipulations to induce sparse CP-AMPAR expression demonstrated that this increase was cell-autonomous and could occur with changes beyond development. Notably, excitatory–PV interneuron connectivity rates and unitary synaptic strength were unaltered by CP-AMPAR removal, which suggested that the selectivity of PV interneurons can be altered without markedly changing connectivity. In Gria2-knockout mice, in which all AMPARs are calcium-permeable, excitatory neurons showed significantly degraded orientation selectivity, which suggested that CP-AMPARs are sufficient to drive lower selectivity regardless of cell type. Moreover, hippocampal PV interneurons, which usually exhibit low spatial tuning, became more spatially selective after removing CP-AMPARs, which indicated that CP-AMPARs suppress the feature selectivity of PV interneurons independent of modality. These results reveal a new role of CP-AMPARs in maintaining low-selectivity sensory representation in PV interneurons and implicate a conserved molecular mechanism that distinguishes this cell type in the neocortex. Calcium-permeable AMPA receptors are identified to have a role in maintaining low feature selectivity in a specific population of inhibitory interneurons, and this function is conserved across ferrets, rodents, marmosets and humans.",

    "abstract": "Complex multicellularity has emerged independently across a few eukaryotic lineages and is often associated with the rise of elaborate, tightly coordinated developmental processes1,2. How multicellularity and development are interconnected in evolution is a major question in biology. The hourglass model of embryonic evolution depicts how developmental processes are conserved during evolution, and predicts morphological and molecular divergence in early and late embryogenesis, bridged by a conserved mid-embryonic (phylotypic) period linked to the formation of the basic body plan3,4. Initially found in animal embryos5–8, molecular hourglass patterns have recently been proposed for land plants and fungi9,10. However, whether the hourglass pattern is an intrinsic feature of all complex multicellular eukaryotes remains unknown. Here we tested the presence of a molecular hourglass in the brown algae, a eukaryotic lineage that has evolved multicellularity independently from animals, fungi and plants1,11,12. By exploring transcriptome evolution patterns of brown algae with distinct morphological complexities, we uncovered an hourglass pattern during embryogenesis in morphologically complex species. Filamentous algae without canonical embryogenesis display transcriptome conservation in multicellular stages of the life cycle, whereas unicellular stages are more rapidly evolving. Our findings suggest that transcriptome conservation in brown algae is associated with cell differentiation stages, but is not necessarily linked to embryogenesis. Together with previous work in animals, plants and fungi, we provide further evidence for the generality of a developmental hourglass pattern across complex multicellular eukaryotes. Similar to other eukaryotes, brown algae exhibit transcriptome conservation that is consistent with the molecular hourglass model during differentiation in embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Aerial light detection and ranging (lidar) has emerged as a powerful technology for mapping urban archaeological landscapes, especially where dense vegetation obscures site visibility1,2. More recently, uncrewed aerial vehicle/drone lidar scanning has markedly improved the resolution of three-dimensional point clouds, allowing for the detection of slight traces of structural features at centimetres of detail across large archaeological sites, a method particularly useful in areas such as mountains, where rapid deposition and erosion irregularly bury and expose archaeological remains3. Here we present the results of uncrewed aerial vehicle–lidar surveys in Central Asia, conducted at two recently discovered archaeological sites in southeastern Uzbekistan: Tashbulak and Tugunbulak. Situated at around 2,000–2,200 m above sea level, these sites illustrate a newly documented geography of large, high-altitude urban centres positioned along the mountainous crossroads of Asia’s medieval Silk Routes (6th–11th century CE (Common Era)4,5. Although hidden by centuries of surface processes, our pairing of very-high-resolution surface modelling with semiautomated feature detection produces a detailed plan of monumental fortifications and architecture spanning 120 ha at Tugunbulak, thereby demonstrating one of the largest highland urban constellations in premodern Central Asia. Documentation of extensive urban infrastructure and technological production among medieval communities in Central Asia’s mountains—a crucial nexus for Silk Road trade networks6—provides a new perspective on the participation of highland populations in the economic, political and social formation of medieval Eurasia. Pairing of very-high-resolution surface modelling with semiautomated feature detection produces a detailed plan of monumental fortifications and architecture spanning 120 ha at Tugunbulak, Uzbekistan, demonstrating one of the largest highland urban constellations in premodern Central Asia.",

    "abstract": "The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei evades clearance by the host immune system through antigenic variation of its dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat, periodically ‘switching’ expression of the VSG using a large genomic repertoire of VSG-encoding genes1–6. Recent studies of antigenic variation in vivo have focused near exclusively on parasites in the bloodstream6–8, but research has shown that many, if not most, parasites reside in the interstitial spaces of tissues9–13. We sought to explore the dynamics of antigenic variation in extravascular parasite populations using VSG-seq7, a high-throughput sequencing approach for profiling VSGs expressed in populations of T. brucei. Here we show that tissues, not the blood, are the primary reservoir of antigenic diversity during both needle- and tsetse bite-initiated T. brucei infections, with more than 75% of VSGs found exclusively within extravascular spaces. We found that this increased diversity is correlated with slower parasite clearance in tissue spaces. Together, these data support a model in which the slower immune response in extravascular spaces provides more time to generate the antigenic diversity needed to maintain a chronic infection. Our findings reveal the important role that extravascular spaces can have in pathogen diversification. The dynamics of antigenic variation in extravascular parasite populations using VSG-seq, a high-throughput sequencing approach for profiling variant surface glycoproteins expressed in populations of Trypanosoma brucei, are explored, showing the role of extravascular spaces in pathogen diversification.",

However, how phages neutralize these distinct and common systems is largely unclear. Here we show that the Thoeris anti-defence proteins Tad14 and Tad25 both achieve anti-cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling system (anti-CBASS) activity by simultaneously sequestering CBASS cyclic oligonucleotides. Apart from binding to the Thoeris signals 1′′-3′-gcADPR and 1′′-2′-gcADPR, Tad1 also binds to numerous CBASS CDNs and CTNs with high affinity, inhibiting CBASS systems that use these molecules in vivo and in vitro. The hexameric Tad1 has six binding sites for CDNs or gcADPR, which are independent of the two high-affinity binding sites for CTNs. Tad2 forms a tetramer that also sequesters various CDNs in addition to gcADPR molecules, using distinct binding sites to simultaneously bind to these signals. Thus, Tad1 and Tad2 are both two-pronged inhibitors that, alongside anti-CBASS protein 2 (Acb26–8), establish a paradigm of phage proteins that use distinct binding sites to flexibly sequester a considerable breadth of cyclic nucleotides. Phage Thoeris anti-defence proteins Tad1 and Tad2 both achieve anti-CBASS activity by simultaneously sequestering CBASS cyclic oligonucleotides.",

    "abstract": "Although coronaviruses use diverse receptors, the characterization of coronaviruses with unknown receptors has been impeded by a lack of infection models1,2. Here we introduce a strategy to engineer functional customized viral receptors (CVRs). The modular design relies on building artificial receptor scaffolds comprising various modules and generating specific virus-binding domains. We identify key factors for CVRs to functionally mimic native receptors by facilitating spike proteolytic cleavage, membrane fusion, pseudovirus entry and propagation for various coronaviruses. We delineate functional SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding sites for CVR design and reveal the mechanism of cell entry promoted by the N-terminal domain-targeting S2L20-CVR. We generated CVR-expressing cells for 12 representative coronaviruses from 6 subgenera, most of which lack known receptors, and show that a pan-sarbecovirus CVR supports propagation of a propagation-competent HKU3 pseudovirus and of authentic RsHuB2019A3. Using an HKU5-specific CVR, we successfully rescued wild-type and ZsGreen-HiBiT-incorporated HKU5-1 (LMH03f) and isolated a HKU5 strain from bat samples. Our study demonstrates the potential of the CVR strategy for establishing native receptor-independent infection models, providing a tool for studying viruses that lack known susceptible target cells. A strategy using engineered functional customized viral receptors enables the development of functional infection models for coronaviruses whose native cellular receptors are unknown.",

    "abstract": "The dangerous chemical hydrogen fluoride sits at the apex of the fluorochemical industry, but the substantial hazards linked to its production under harsh conditions (above 300 degrees Celsius) and transport are typically contracted to specialists. All fluorochemicals for applications, including refrigeration, electric transportation, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, are prepared from fluorspar (CaF2) through a procedure that generates highly dangerous hydrogen fluoride1–5. Here we report a mild method to obtain fluorochemicals directly from fluorspar, bypassing the necessity to manufacture hydrogen fluoride. Acid-grade fluorspar (more than 97 per cent CaF2) is treated with the fluorophilic Lewis acid boric acid (B(OH)3) or silicon dioxide (SiO2), in the presence of oxalic acid, a Brønsted acid that is highly effective for Ca2+ sequestration. This scalable process carried out in water at low temperature (below 50 degrees Celsius) enables access to widely used fluorochemicals, including tetrafluoroboric acid, alkali metal fluorides, tetraalkylammonium fluorides and fluoro(hetero)arenes. The replacement of oxalic acid with sulfuric acid gave comparable results for B(OH)3, but was not as effective when the fluorophilic Lewis acid was SiO2. A similar process also works with the lower-purity metspar. The production of fluorochemicals directly from fluorspar offers the possibility of decentralized manufacturing—an attractive model for the fluorochemical industry. With the renewed interest in innovative methods to synthesize oxalic acid via carbon dioxide capture and biomass6,7, and the challenges posed by our dependence on fossil fuels for sulfur and therefore sulfuric acid supply8,9, our technology may represent a departure towards a sustainable fluorochemical industry. Fluorochemicals are obtained directly from fluorspar activated in water at low temperature, without the requirement to manufacture hydrogen fluoride, a toxic and hazardous gas that is central to the current industrial process.",

    "abstract": "Animals are often bombarded with visual information and must prioritize specific visual features based on their current needs. The neuronal circuits that detect and relay visual features have been well studied1–8. Much less is known about how an animal adjusts its visual attention as its goals or environmental conditions change. During social behaviours, flies need to focus on nearby flies9–11. Here we study how the flow of visual information is altered when female Drosophila enter an aggressive state. From the connectome, we identify three state-dependent circuit motifs poised to modify the response of an aggressive female to fly-sized visual objects: convergence of excitatory inputs from neurons conveying select visual features and internal state; dendritic disinhibition of select visual feature detectors; and a switch that toggles between two visual feature detectors. Using cell-type-specific genetic tools, together with behavioural and neurophysiological analyses, we show that each of these circuit motifs is used during female aggression. We reveal that features of this same switch operate in male Drosophila during courtship pursuit, suggesting that disparate social behaviours may share circuit mechanisms. Our study provides a compelling example of using the connectome to infer circuit mechanisms that underlie dynamic processing of sensory signals. A connectome analysis identifies, and experiments confirm, three state-dependent circuit motifs that modify the response of an aggressive female Drosophila or a courting male to fly-sized visual objects.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is incurable and in urgent need of improved therapeutics1. Here we identify a small compound, gliocidin, that kills glioblastoma cells while sparing non-tumour replicative cells. Gliocidin activity targets a de novo purine synthesis vulnerability in glioblastoma through indirect inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2). IMPDH2 blockade reduces intracellular guanine nucleotide levels, causing nucleotide imbalance, replication stress and tumour cell death2. Gliocidin is a prodrug that is anabolized into its tumoricidal metabolite, gliocidin–adenine dinucleotide (GAD), by the enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1) of the NAD+ salvage pathway. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of GAD together with IMPDH2 demonstrates its entry, deformation and blockade of the NAD+ pocket3. In vivo, gliocidin penetrates the blood–brain barrier and extends the survival of mice with orthotopic glioblastoma. The DNA alkylating agent temozolomide induces Nmnat1 expression, causing synergistic tumour cell killing and additional survival benefit in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models. This study brings gliocidin to light as a prodrug with the potential to improve the survival of patients with glioblastoma. The prodrug gliocidin effectively kills glioblastoma cells by targeting de novo purine synthesis, improving survival in mouse models.",

Here we use a nanoscale superconducting sensor1,2 to map the magnetic fringe fields in twisted bilayers of MoTe2, in which transport3,4 and optical sensing5,6 experiments have revealed the formation of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states at zero magnetic field. We observe oscillations in the local magnetic field associated with fillings ν = −1, −2/3, −3/5, −4/7 and −5/9 of the first moiré hole band, consistent with the formation of FCIs at these fillings. We determine the local thermodynamic gaps of the most robust FCI state at ν = −2/3, finding −2/3Δ as large as 7 meV. We also characterize sample spatial disorder, which is dominated by both inhomogeneity in the effective unit cell area7 as well as inhomogeneity in the band edge offset and bound dipole moment. Our results highlight both the challenges posed by structural disorder in the study of twisted homobilayer moiré systems and the opportunities afforded by the robust nature of the underlying correlated topological states. A nanoscale superconducting sensor used to map the magnetic fringe fields in twisted bilayers of MoTe2 shows the formation of fractional Chern insulator states at zero magnetic field.",

    "abstract": "The ability to flexibly switch our responses to external stimuli according to contextual information is critical for successful interactions with a complex world. Context-dependent computations are necessary across many domains1–3, yet their neural implementations remain poorly understood. Here we developed a novel behavioural task in rats to study context-dependent selection and accumulation of evidence for decision-making4–6. Under assumptions supported by both monkey and rat data, we first show mathematically that this computation can be supported by three dynamical solutions and that all networks performing the task implement a combination of these solutions. These solutions can be identified and tested directly with experimental data. We further show that existing electrophysiological and modelling data are compatible with the full variety of possible combinations of these solutions, suggesting that different individuals could use different combinations. To study variability across individual subjects, we developed automated, high-throughput methods to train rats on our task and trained many subjects using these methods. Consistent with theoretical predictions, neural and behavioural analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity across rats, despite uniformly good task performance. Our theory further predicts a specific link between behavioural and neural signatures, which was robustly supported in the data. In summary, our results provide an experimentally supported theoretical framework to analyse individual variability in biological and artificial systems that perform flexible decision-making tasks, open the door to cellular-resolution studies of individual variability in higher cognition, and provide insights into neural mechanisms of context-dependent computation more generally. Behavioural experiments to study decision-making in response to context-dependent accumulation of evidence provide testable models that are consistent with the heterogeneity in neural signatures among rats that perform well in trials.",

    "abstract": "Although separation is entropically unfavourable, it is often essential for our life1,2. The separation of very similar macromolecules such as deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) and their single nucleotide variants is difficult but holds great advantage for the progress of life science3. Here we report that a particular liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) at a solid–liquid interface led to the partitioning of DNAs with nearly identical structures. We found this intriguing phenomenon when we did drop-casting onto a glass plate an aqueous ammonium sulfate dispersion of phase-separated droplets comprising a homogeneous mixture of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) samples with different termini. Even when the molecular weights of their PEG parts were identical to each other, terminally different PEGs spread competitively at the solid–liquid interface and partitioned into micrometre-scale concentric circles. We found that this competitive spreading was induced by an ammonium sulfate layer spontaneously formed on the glass surface. We successfully extended the above mechanism to partitioning a mixture of nearly identical DNAs into concentric circles followed by their selective extraction using the salting-in effect. We could isolate a human cancer-causing single nucleotide variant in 97% purity from its 1:1 mixture with the original DNA. A particular liquid–liquid phase separation at a solid–liquid interface led to the unexpected partitioning of highly similar polymeric molecules into concentric circles.",

    "abstract": "Aromatic compounds are used across chemistry and materials science as a result of their stability, characteristic interactions, defined molecular shape and the numerous approaches for their synthesis by a diversity of cyclization reactions1. By contrast, the cleavage of inert aromatic carbon–carbon bonds remained largely unfeasible owing to the unfavourable energetics of disrupting aromaticity on ring opening. For non-aromatic structures, alkene metathesis catalysed by transition-metal alkylidenes is established as one of the most versatile carbon–carbon bond-forming and -breaking reactions2,3. However, despite remarkable advancements, strategies to open aromatic compounds by metathesis remain elusive4. Here we report aromatic ring-opening metathesis (ArROM) for the cleavage of aromatic rings, including tetraphene, naphthalene, indole, benzofuran and phenanthrenes, by using Schrock–Hoveyda molybdenum catalysts. The reactions for each ring system proceed through unique alkylidene intermediates. We further show the possibility for stereoselective ArROM with exquisite catalyst control over the configuration of atropisomers. ArROM is, therefore, a viable and efficient approach to catalytically transform and interconvert various aromatics without the requirement for any reagents or photoexcitation. Aromatic ring-opening metathesis using Schrock–Hoveyda molybdenum catalysts enables the efficient cleavage of stable aromatic compounds such as tetraphene and naphthalene, offering controlled transformations without reagents or photoexcitation and overcoming previous challenges in aromatic bond cleavage.",

    "abstract": "A central question in neuroscience is how synaptic plasticity shapes the feature selectivity of neurons in behaving animals1. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons display one of the most striking forms of feature selectivity by forming spatially and contextually selective receptive fields called place fields, which serve as a model for studying the synaptic basis of learning and memory. Various forms of synaptic plasticity have been proposed as cellular substrates for the emergence of place fields. However, despite decades of work, our understanding of how synaptic plasticity underlies place-field formation and memory encoding remains limited, largely due to a shortage of tools and technical challenges associated with the visualization of synaptic plasticity at the single-neuron resolution in awake behaving animals. To address this, we developed an all-optical approach to monitor the spatiotemporal tuning and synaptic weight changes of dendritic spines before and after the induction of a place field in single CA1 pyramidal neurons during spatial navigation. We identified a temporally asymmetric synaptic plasticity kernel resulting from bidirectional modifications of synaptic weights around the induction of a place field. Our work identified compartment-specific differences in the magnitude and temporal expression of synaptic plasticity between basal dendrites and oblique dendrites. Our results provide experimental evidence linking synaptic plasticity to the rapid emergence of spatial selectivity in hippocampal neurons, a critical prerequisite for episodic memory. A temporally asymmetric synaptic plasticity kernel results from bidirectional modifications of synaptic weights around the induction of a place field.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the functional properties of quantum materials with light has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, leading to the discovery of various light-induced phases of matter, such as superconductivity1, ferroelectricity2,3, magnetism4–6 and charge density waves7. However, in most cases, the photoinduced phases return to equilibrium on ultrafast timescales after the light is turned off, limiting their practical applications. Here we use intense terahertz pulses to induce a metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature approaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical order parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the extended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a specific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours a ground state with finite magnetization near the Néel temperature. This analysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant antiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the new magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of the magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using terahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced order parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden quantum states. Intense terahertz pulses are used to induce metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, FePS3.",

    "abstract": "At the origin of the Universe, an asymmetry between the amount of created matter and antimatter led to the matter-dominated Universe as we know it today. The origins of this asymmetry remain unknown so far.

Much of the created antimatter escapes the rapidly expanding fireball without annihilating, making such collisions an effective experimental tool to create heavy antimatter nuclear objects and to study their properties7–14, hoping to shed some light on the existing questions on the asymmetry between matter and antimatter.

    "abstract": "Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are assembly line biosynthetic pathways that are used to produce critical therapeutic drugs and are typically arranged as large multi-domain proteins called megasynthetases1. They synthesize polypeptides using peptidyl carrier proteins that shuttle each amino acid through modular loading, modification and elongation2 steps, and remain challenging to structurally characterize, owing in part to the inherent dynamics of their multi-domain and multi-modular architectures3. Here we have developed site-selective crosslinking probes to conformationally constrain and resolve the interactions between carrier proteins and their partner enzymatic domains4,5. We apply tetrazine click chemistry to trap the condensation of two carrier protein substrates within the active site of the condensation domain that unites the first two modules of tyrocidine biosynthesis and report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this complex. Together with the X-ray crystal structure of the first carrier protein crosslinked to its epimerization domain, these structures highlight captured intermodular recognition events and define the processive movement of a carrier protein from one catalytic step to the next. Characterization of these structural relationships remains central to understanding the molecular details of these unique synthetases and critically informs future synthetic biology design of these pathways. Structural studies of tyrocidine synthetase using site-selective crosslinking probes to link condensation domains with carrier protein substrates define key interactions and molecular mechanisms of non-ribosomal protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "The quantum Hall effect is a prototypical realization of a topological state of matter. It emerges from a subtle interplay between topology, interactions and disorder1–9. The disorder enables the formation of localized states in the bulk that stabilize the quantum Hall states with respect to the magnetic field and carrier density3. Still, the details of the localized states and their contribution to transport remain beyond the reach of most experimental techniques10–31. Here we describe an extensive study of the bulk’s heat conductance. Using a novel ‘multiterminal’ short device (on a scale of 10 µm), we separate the longitudinal thermal conductance, \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${\\kappa }_{xx}T$$\n                \n               (owing to the bulk’s contribution), from the topological transverse value \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${\\kappa }_{xy}T$$\n                \n               by eliminating the contribution of the edge modes24.

    "abstract": "Transcription elongation stalls at lesions in the DNA template1. For the DNA lesion to be repaired, the stalled transcription elongation complex (EC) has to be removed from the damaged site2. Here we show that translation, which is coupled to transcription in bacteria, actively dislodges stalled ECs from the damaged DNA template. By contrast, paused, but otherwise elongation-competent, ECs are not dislodged by the ribosome. Instead, they are helped back into processive elongation. We also show that the ribosome slows down when approaching paused, but not stalled, ECs. Our results indicate that coupled ribosomes functionally and kinetically discriminate between paused ECs and stalled ECs, ensuring the selective destruction of only the latter. This functional discrimination is controlled by the RNA polymerase’s catalytic domain, the Trigger Loop. We show that the transcription-coupled DNA repair helicase UvrD, proposed to cause backtracking of stalled ECs3, does not interfere with ribosome-mediated dislodging. By contrast, the transcription-coupled DNA repair translocase Mfd4 acts synergistically with translation, and dislodges stalled ECs that were not destroyed by the ribosome. We also show that a coupled ribosome efficiently destroys misincorporated ECs that can cause conflicts with replication5. We propose that coupling to translation is an ancient and one of the main mechanisms of clearing non-functional ECs from the genome. Translation actively dislodges stalled transcription elongation complexes (ECs) from damaged DNA, which enables lesion repair and restoration of transcription activity, and coupled ribosomes discriminate between active ECs and stalled ECs, ensuring destruction of only the latter.",

    "abstract": "Mid-ocean ridges (MORs) are quintessential sites of tectonic extension1–4, at which divergence between lithospheric plates shapes abyssal hills that cover about two-thirds of the Earth’s surface5,6. Here we show that tectonic extension at the ridge axis can be partially undone by tectonic shortening across the ridge flanks. This process is evidenced by recent sequences of reverse-faulting earthquakes about 15 km off-axis at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Carlsberg Ridge. Using mechanical models, we show that shallow compression of the ridge flanks up to the brittle failure point is a natural consequence of lithosphere unbending away from the axial relief. Intrusion of magma-filled fractures, which manifests as migrating swarms of extensional seismicity along the ridge axis, can provide the small increment of compressive stress that triggers reverse-faulting earthquakes. Through bathymetric analyses, we further find that reverse reactivation of MOR normal faults is a widely occurring process that can reduce the amplitude of abyssal hills by as much as 50%, shortly after they form at the ridge axis. This ‘unfaulting’ mechanism exerts a first-order influence on the fabric of the global ocean floor and provides a physical explanation for reverse-faulting earthquakes in an extensional environment. Recent sequences of reverse-faulting earthquakes at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Carlsberg Ridge show that tectonic extension at mid-ocean ridge axes can be partially undone by tectonic shortening across the ridge flanks.",

    "abstract": "Shuotheriids are Jurassic mammaliaforms that possess pseudotribosphenic teeth in which a pseudotalonid is anterior to the trigonid in the lower molar, contrasting with the tribosphenic pattern of therian mammals (placentals, marsupials and kin) in which the talonid is posterior to the trigonid1–4. The origin of the pseudotribosphenic teeth remains unclear, obscuring our perception of shuotheriid affinities and the early evolution of mammaliaforms1,5–9. Here we report a new Jurassic shuotheriid represented by two skeletal specimens. Their complete pseudotribosphenic dentitions allow reidentification of dental structures using serial homology and the tooth occlusal relationship. Contrary to the conventional view1,2,6,10,11, our findings show that dental structures of shuotheriids can be homologized to those of docodontans and partly support homologous statements for some dental structures between docodontans and other mammaliaforms6,12. The phylogenetic analysis based on new evidence removes shuotheriids from the tribosphenic ausktribosphenids (including monotremes) and clusters them with docodontans to form a new clade, Docodontiformes, that is characterized by pseudotribosphenic features. In the phylogeny, docodontiforms and ‘holotherians’ (Kuehneotherium, monotremes and therians)13 evolve independently from a Morganucodon-like ancestor with triconodont molars by labio-lingual widening their posterior teeth for more efficient food processing. The pseudotribosphenic pattern passed a cusp semitriangulation stage9, whereas the tribosphenic pattern and its precursor went through a stage of cusp triangulation. The two different processes resulted in complex tooth structures and occlusal patterns that elucidate the earliest diversification of mammaliaforms. A newly described fossil mammaliaform from the Jurassic period of China shows that the shuotheriids are allied to the docodonts, and provides details on the processes of tooth evolution in early mammals.",

    "abstract": "The dual jaw joint of Morganucodon1,2 consists of the dentary–squamosal joint laterally and the articular–quadrate one medially. The articular–quadrate joint and its associated post-dentary bones constitute the precursor of the mammalian middle ear. Fossils documenting the transition from such a precursor to the mammalian middle ear are poor, resulting in inconsistent interpretations of this hallmark apparatus in the earliest stage of mammaliaform evolution1–5. Here we report mandibular middle ears from two Jurassic mammaliaforms: a new morganucodontan-like species and a pseudotribosphenic shuotheriid species6. The morganucodontan-like species shows many previously unknown post-dentary bone morphologies1,2 and exhibits features that suggest a loss of load-bearing function in its articular–quadrate joint. The middle ear of the shuotheriid approaches the mammalian condition in that it has features that are suitable for an exclusively auditory function, although the post-dentary bones are still attached to the dentary. With size reduction of the jaw-joint bones, the quadrate shifts medially at different degrees in relation to the articular in the two mammaliaforms. These changes provide evidence of a gradual loss of load-bearing function in the articular–quadrate jaw joint—a prerequisite for the detachment of the post-dentary bones from the dentary7–12 and the eventual breakdown of the Meckel’s cartilage13–15 during the evolution of mammaliaforms. A new morganucodontan-like species from the Jurassic in China shows evidence of a loss of load-bearing function in the articular–quadrate jaw joint, which probably had a role in the evolution of the mammalian middle ear.",

Isolated brown dwarfs with auroral signatures in the radio have been searched for corresponding infrared features, but only null detections have been reported3. CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3. (W1935 for short) is an isolated brown dwarf with a temperature of approximately 482 K. Here we report James Webb Space Telescope observations of strong methane emission from W1935 at 3.326 μm. Atmospheric modelling leads us to conclude that a temperature inversion of approximately 300 K centred at 1–10 mbar replicates the feature. This represents an atmospheric temperature inversion for a Jupiter-like atmosphere without irradiation from a host star. A plausible explanation for the strong inversion is heating by auroral processes, although other internal and external dynamical processes cannot be ruled out. The best-fitting model rules out the contribution of H3+ emission, which is prominent in Solar System gas giants. However, this is consistent with rapid destruction of H3+ at the higher pressure where the W1935 emission originates4. Methane emission from a very cool brown dwarf, perhaps arising from an aurora, has been detected in James Webb Space Telescope observations.",

    "abstract": "Despite its Earth-like size and source material1,2, Venus is extremely dry3,4, indicating near-total water loss to space by means of hydrogen outflow from an ancient, steam-dominated atmosphere5,6. Such hydrodynamic escape likely removed most of an initial Earth-like 3-km global equivalent layer (GEL) of water but cannot deplete the atmosphere to the observed 3-cm GEL because it shuts down below about 10–100 m GEL5,7. To complete Venus water loss, and to produce the observed bulk atmospheric enrichment in deuterium of about 120 times Earth8,9, nonthermal H escape mechanisms still operating today are required10,11. Early studies identified these as resonant charge exchange12–14, hot oxygen impact15,16 and ion outflow17,18, establishing a consensus view of H escape10,19 that has since received only minimal updates20. Here we show that this consensus omits the most important present-day H loss process, HCO+ dissociative recombination. This process nearly doubles the Venus H escape rate and, consequently, doubles the amount of present-day volcanic water outgassing and/or impactor infall required to maintain a steady-state atmospheric water abundance. These higher loss rates resolve long-standing difficulties in simultaneously explaining the measured abundance and isotope ratio of Venusian water21,22 and would enable faster desiccation in the wake of speculative late ocean scenarios23. Design limitations prevented past Venus missions from measuring both HCO+ and the escaping hydrogen produced by its recombination; future spacecraft measurements are imperative. Water loss to space late in Venus history is shown to be more active than previously thought, with unmeasured HCO+ dissociative recombination dominating present-day H loss.",

    "abstract": "An essential prerequisite for evolution by natural selection is variation among individuals in traits that affect fitness1. The ability of a system to produce selectable variation, known as evolvability2, thus markedly affects the rate of evolution. Although the immune system is among the fastest-evolving components in mammals3, the sources of variation in immune traits remain largely unknown4,5. Here we show that an important determinant of the immune system’s evolvability is its organization into interacting modules represented by different immune cell types. By profiling immune cell variation in bone marrow of 54 genetically diverse mouse strains from the Collaborative Cross6, we found that variation in immune cell frequencies is polygenic and that many associated genes are involved in homeostatic balance through cell-intrinsic functions of proliferation, migration and cell death. However, we also found genes associated with the frequency of a particular cell type that are expressed in a different cell type, exerting their effect in what we term cyto-trans. The vertebrate evolutionary record shows that genes associated in cyto-trans have faced weaker negative selection, thus increasing the robustness and hence evolvability2,7,8 of the immune system. This phenomenon is similarly observable in human blood. Our findings suggest that interactions between different components of the immune system provide a phenotypic space in which mutations can produce variation with little detriment, underscoring the role of modularity in the evolution of complex systems9. By profiling immune cell variation in bone marrow of 54 genetically diverse mouse strains and analysing the evolutionary record, we found that genes associated with the frequency of a particular cell type but expressed in a different cell type increase the evolvability of the immune system.",

    "abstract": "The ancient city of Chichén Itzá in Yucatán, Mexico, was one of the largest and most influential Maya settlements during the Late and Terminal Classic periods (ad 600–1000) and it remains one of the most intensively studied archaeological sites in Mesoamerica1–4. However, many questions about the social and cultural use of its ceremonial spaces, as well as its population’s genetic ties to other Mesoamerican groups, remain unanswered2. Here we present genome-wide data obtained from 64 subadult individuals dating to around ad 500–900 that were found in a subterranean mass burial near the Sacred Cenote (sinkhole) in the ceremonial centre of Chichén Itzá. Genetic analyses showed that all analysed individuals were male and several individuals were closely related, including two pairs of monozygotic twins. Twins feature prominently in Mayan and broader Mesoamerican mythology, where they embody qualities of duality among deities and heroes5, but until now they had not been identified in ancient Mayan mortuary contexts. Genetic comparison to present-day people in the region shows genetic continuity with the ancient inhabitants of Chichén Itzá, except at certain genetic loci related to human immunity, including the human leukocyte antigen complex, suggesting signals of adaptation due to infectious diseases introduced to the region during the colonial period. We present genome-wide data from 64 subadults interred in Chichén Itzá around ad 500–900 that gives insight into burial rituals, and shows that their genomic legacy is still present and has adapted to immune challenges post-1492.",

    "abstract": "Social communication guides decision-making, which is essential for survival. Social transmission of food preference (STFP) is an ecologically relevant memory paradigm in which an animal learns a desirable food odour from another animal in a social context, creating a long-term memory1,2. How food-preference memory is acquired, consolidated and stored is unclear. Here we show that the posteromedial nucleus of the cortical amygdala (COApm) serves as a computational centre in long-term STFP memory consolidation by integrating social and sensory olfactory inputs. Blocking synaptic signalling by the COApm-based circuit selectively abolished STFP memory consolidation without impairing memory acquisition, storage or recall. COApm-mediated STFP memory consolidation depends on synaptic inputs from the accessory olfactory bulb and on synaptic outputs to the anterior olfactory nucleus. STFP memory consolidation requires protein synthesis, suggesting a gene-expression mechanism. Deep single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics revealed robust but distinct gene-expression signatures induced by STFP memory formation in the COApm that are consistent with synapse restructuring. Our data thus define a neural circuit for the consolidation of a socially communicated long-term memory, thereby mechanistically distinguishing protein-synthesis-dependent memory consolidation from memory acquisition, storage or retrieval. Experiments in mice show that brain circuitry centred on the posteromedial nucleus of the cortical amygdala has a key role in consolidating socially transmitted long-term memories.",

    "abstract": "Living mammal groups exhibit rapid juvenile growth with a cessation of growth in adulthood1. Understanding the emergence of this pattern in the earliest mammaliaforms (mammals and their closest extinct relatives) is hindered by a paucity of fossils representing juvenile individuals. We report exceptionally complete juvenile and adult specimens of the Middle Jurassic docodontan Krusatodon, providing anatomical data and insights into the life history of early diverging mammaliaforms. We used synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography imaging of cementum growth increments in the teeth2–4 to provide evidence of pace of life in a Mesozoic mammaliaform. The adult was about 7 years and the juvenile 7 to 24 months of age at death and in the process of replacing its deciduous dentition with its final, adult generation. When analysed against a dataset of life history parameters for extant mammals5, the relative sequence of adult tooth eruption was already established in Krusatodon and in the range observed in extant mammals but this development was prolonged, taking place during a longer period as part of a significantly longer maximum lifespan than extant mammals of comparable adult body mass (156 g or less). Our findings suggest that early diverging mammaliaforms did not experience the same life histories as extant small-bodied mammals and the fundamental shift to faster growth over a shorter lifespan may not have taken place in mammaliaforms until during or after the Middle Jurassic. Juvenile and adult skeletons of Middle Jurassic Krusatodon from the Isle of Skye, Scotland, show that this mouse-sized mammaliaform had longer development and lifespan than modern mammals of similar mass.",

    "abstract": "Polyene cyclizations are among the most complex and challenging transformations in biology. In a single reaction step, multiple carbon–carbon bonds, ring systems and stereogenic centres are constituted from simple, acyclic precursors1–3. Simultaneously achieving this kind of precise control over product distribution and stereochemistry poses a formidable task for chemists. In particular, the polyene cyclization of (3E,7E)-homofarnesol to the valuable naturally occurring ambergris odorant (−)-ambrox is recognized as a longstanding challenge in chemical synthesis1,4–7. Here we report a diastereoselective and enantioselective synthesis of (−)-ambrox and the sesquiterpene lactone natural product (+)-sclareolide by a catalytic asymmetric polyene cyclization by using a highly Brønsted-acidic and confined imidodiphosphorimidate catalyst in the presence of fluorinated alcohols. Several experiments, including deuterium-labelling studies, suggest that the reaction predominantly proceeds through a concerted pathway in line with the Stork–Eschenmoser hypothesis8–10. Mechanistic studies show the importance of the enzyme-like microenvironment of the imidodiphosphorimidate catalyst for attaining exceptionally high selectivities, previously thought to be achievable only in enzyme-catalysed polyene cyclizations. The catalytic asymmetric polyene cyclization of homofarnesol to ambrox is achieved using a highly Brønsted-acidic and confined imidodiphosphorimidate catalyst.",

    "abstract": "The ability to learn novel items depends on brain functions that store information about items classified by their associated meanings and outcomes1–4, but the underlying neural circuit mechanisms of this process remain poorly understood. Here we show that deep layers of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) contain two groups of ‘item–outcome neurons’: one developing activity for rewarded items during learning, and another for punished items. As mice learned an olfactory item–outcome association, we found that the neuronal population of LEC layers 5/6 (LECL5/6) formed an internal map of pre-learned and novel items, classified into dichotomic rewarded versus punished groups. Neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which form a bidirectional loop circuit with LECL5/6, developed an equivalent item–outcome rule map during learning. When LECL5/6 neurons were optogenetically inhibited, tangled mPFC representations of novel items failed to split into rewarded versus punished groups, impairing new learning by mice. Conversely, when mPFC neurons were inhibited, LECL5/6 representations of individual items were held completely separate, disrupting both learning and retrieval of associations. These results suggest that LECL5/6 neurons and mPFC neurons co-dependently encode item memory as a map of associated outcome rules. The bidirectional loop circuit between layers 5/6 of the lateral entorhinal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex encodes item–outcome associative memory in mice.",

    "abstract": "Early expansion and long-term persistence predict efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CARTs)1–7, but mechanisms governing effector versus memory CART differentiation and whether asymmetric cell division induces differential fates in human CARTs remain unclear. Here we show that target-induced proximity labelling enables isolation of first-division proximal-daughter and distal-daughter CD8 CARTs that asymmetrically distribute their surface proteome and transcriptome, resulting in divergent fates. Target-engaged CARs remain on proximal daughters, which inherit a surface proteome resembling activated-undivided CARTs, whereas the endogenous T cell receptor and CD8 enrich on distal daughters, whose surface proteome resembles resting CARTs, correlating with glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, respectively. Despite memory-precursor phenotype and in vivo longevity, distal daughters demonstrate transient potent cytolytic activity similar to proximal daughters, uncovering an effector-like state in distal daughters destined to become memory CARTs. Both partitioning of pre-existing transcripts and changes in RNA velocity contribute to asymmetry of fate-determining factors, resulting in diametrically opposed transcriptional trajectories. Independent of naive, memory or effector surface immunophenotype, proximal-daughter CARTs use core sets of transcription factors known to support proliferation and effector function. Conversely, transcription factors enriched in distal daughters restrain differentiation and promote longevity, evidenced by diminished long-term in vivo persistence and function of distal-daughter CARTs after IKZF1 disruption. These studies establish asymmetric cell division as a framework for understanding mechanisms of CART differentiation and improving therapeutic outcomes. We show that target-induced proximity labelling enables isolation of first-division CD8 chimeric antigen receptor T cells that asymmetrically distribute their surface proteome and transcriptome, resulting in distinct phenotypic, metabolic and functional profiles in proximal and distal daughter cells.",

    "abstract": "Cold plasma of ionospheric origin has recently been found to be a much larger contributor to the magnetosphere of Earth than expected1–3. Numerous competing mechanisms have been postulated to drive ion escape to space, including heating and acceleration by wave–particle interactions4 and a global electrostatic field between the ionosphere and space (called the ambipolar or polarization field)5,6. Observations of heated O+ ions in the magnetosphere are consistent with resonant wave–particle interactions7. By contrast, observations of cold supersonic H+ flowing out of the polar ionosphere8,9 (called the polar wind) suggest the presence of an electrostatic field. Here we report the existence of a +0.55 ± 0.09 V electric potential drop between 250 km and 768 km from a planetary electrostatic field (E∥⊕ = 1.09 ± 0.17 μV m−1) generated exclusively by the outward pressure of ionospheric electrons. We experimentally demonstrate that the ambipolar field of Earth controls the structure of the polar ionosphere, boosting the scale height by 271%. We infer that this increases the supply of cold O+ ions to the magnetosphere by more than 3,800%, in which other mechanisms such as wave–particle interactions can heat and further accelerate them to escape velocity. The electrostatic field of Earth is strong enough by itself to drive the polar wind9,10 and is probably the origin of the cold H+ ion population1 that dominates much of the magnetosphere2,3. The ambipolar field of Earth controls the structure of the polar ionosphere and boosts its scale height by 271%, physically driving  the polar wind and acting as the source of the magnetospheric cold H+ ion population.",

    "abstract": "Fertilization introduces parental genetic information into the zygote to guide embryogenesis. Parental contributions to postfertilization development have been discussed for decades, and the data available show that both parents contribute to the zygotic transcriptome, suggesting a paternal role in early embryogenesis1–6. However, because the specific paternal effects on postfertilization development and the molecular pathways underpinning these effects remain poorly understood, paternal contribution to early embryogenesis and plant development has not yet been adequately demonstrated7. Here our research shows that TREE1 and its homologue DAZ3 are expressed exclusively in Arabidopsis sperm. Despite presenting no evident defects in sperm development and fertilization, tree1 daz3 unexpectedly led to aberrant differentiation of the embryo root stem cell niche. This defect persisted in seedlings and disrupted root tip regeneration, comparable to congenital defects in animals. TREE1 and DAZ3 function by suppression of maternal RKD2 transcription, thus mitigating the detrimental maternal effects from RKD2 on root stem cell niche. Therefore, our findings illuminate how genetic deficiencies in sperm can exert enduring paternal effects on specific plant organ differentiation and how parental-of-origin genes interact to ensure normal embryogenesis. This work also provides a new concept of how gamete quality or genetic deficiency can affect specific plant organ formation. TREE1 and its homologue DAZ3 are expressed exclusively in Arabidopsis sperm, showing how genetic deficiencies can exert enduring paternal effects on specific plant organ differentiation and how parental-of-origin genes interact to ensure normal embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "CDK1 has been known to be the sole cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) partner of cyclin B1 to drive mitotic progression1. Here we demonstrate that CDK5 is active during mitosis and is necessary for maintaining mitotic fidelity. CDK5 is an atypical CDK owing to its high expression in post-mitotic neurons and activation by non-cyclin proteins p35 and p392. Here, using independent chemical genetic approaches, we specifically abrogated CDK5 activity during mitosis, and observed mitotic defects, nuclear atypia and substantial alterations in the mitotic phosphoproteome. Notably, cyclin B1 is a mitotic co-factor of CDK5. Computational modelling, comparison with experimentally derived structures of CDK–cyclin complexes and validation with mutational analysis indicate that CDK5–cyclin B1 can form a functional complex. Disruption of the CDK5–cyclin B1 complex phenocopies CDK5 abrogation in mitosis. Together, our results demonstrate that cyclin B1 partners with both CDK5 and CDK1, and CDK5–cyclin B1 functions as a canonical CDK–cyclin complex to ensure mitotic fidelity. Cyclin B1 is a mitotic co-factor of CDK5.",

    "abstract": "The presence of disorder substantially influences the behaviour of physical systems. It can give rise to slow or glassy dynamics, or to a complete suppression of transport as in Anderson insulators1, where normally extended wavefunctions such as light fields or electronic Bloch waves become exponentially localized. The combined effect of disorder and interactions is central to the richness of condensed-matter physics2. In bosonic systems, it can also lead to additional quantum states such as the Bose glass3,4—an insulating but compressible state without long-range phase coherence that emerges in disordered bosonic systems and is distinct from the well-known superfluid and Mott insulating ground states of interacting bosons. Here we report the experimental realization of the two-dimensional Bose glass using ultracold atoms in an eight-fold symmetric quasicrystalline optical lattice5. By probing the coherence properties of the system, we observe a Bose-glass-to-superfluid transition and map out the phase diagram in the weakly interacting regime. We furthermore demonstrate that it is not possible to adiabatically traverse the Bose glass on typical experimental timescales by examining the capability to restore coherence and discuss the connection to the expected non-ergodicity of the Bose glass. Our observations are in good agreement with recent quantum Monte Carlo predictions6 and pave the way for experimentally testing the connection between the Bose glass, many-body localization and glassy dynamics more generally7,8. The two-dimensional Bose glass state of matter is realized experimentally using ultracold atoms in an eight-fold symmetric quasicrystalline optical lattice, and the phase transition between Bose glass and superfluid is directly observed.",

    "abstract": "SAR11 bacteria are the most abundant microorganisms in the surface ocean1 and have global biogeochemical importance2–4. To thrive in their competitive oligotrophic environment, these bacteria rely heavily on solute-binding proteins that facilitate uptake of specific substrates via membrane transporters5,6. The functions and properties of these transport proteins are key factors in the assimilation of dissolved organic matter and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients in the ocean, but they have remained largely inaccessible to experimental investigation. Here we performed genome-wide experimental characterization of all solute-binding proteins in a prototypical SAR11 bacterium, revealing specific functions and general trends in their properties that contribute to the success of SAR11 bacteria in oligotrophic environments. We found that the solute-binding proteins of SAR11 bacteria have extremely high binding affinity (dissociation constant >20 pM) and high binding specificity, revealing molecular mechanisms of oligotrophic adaptation. Our functional data have uncovered new carbon sources for SAR11 bacteria and enable accurate biogeographical analysis of SAR11 substrate uptake capabilities throughout the ocean. This study provides a comprehensive view of the substrate uptake capabilities of ubiquitous marine bacteria, providing a necessary foundation for understanding their contribution to assimilation of dissolved organic matter in marine ecosystems. Genome-wide characterization of solute-binding proteins in SAR11, a group of ubiquitous marine bacteria, reveals that they generally combine high binding affinities with narrow binding specificities, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the adaptation of SAR11 to diverse marine environments.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-selective chemoattractants direct lymphocytes to epithelial surfaces to establish local immune environments, regulate immune responses to food antigens and commensal organisms, and protect from pathogens. Homeostatic chemoattractants for small intestines, colon and skin are known1,2, but chemotropic mechanisms selective for respiratory tract and other non-intestinal mucosal tissues remain poorly understood. Here we leveraged diverse omics datasets to identify GPR25 as a lymphocyte receptor for CXCL17, a chemoattractant cytokine whose expression by epithelial cells of airways, upper gastrointestinal and squamous mucosae unifies the non-intestinal mucosal tissues and distinguishes them from intestinal mucosae. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses show that GPR25 is induced on innate lymphocytes before emigration to the periphery, and is imprinted in secondary lymphoid tissues on activated B and T cells responding to immune challenge. GPR25 characterizes B and T tissue resident memory cells and regulatory T lymphocytes in non-intestinal mucosal tissues and lungs in humans and mediates lymphocyte homing to barrier epithelia of the airways, oral cavity, stomach, and biliary and genitourinary tracts in mouse models. GPR25 is also expressed by T cells in cerebrospinal fluid and CXCL17 by neurons, suggesting a role in central nervous system (CNS) immune regulation. We reveal widespread imprinting of GPR25 on regulatory T cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to population genetics evidence that GPR25 is protective in autoimmunity3,4. Our results define a GPR25–CXCL17 chemoaffinity axis with the potential to integrate immunity and tolerance at non-intestinal mucosae and the CNS. GPR25 and its ligand define the core chemoaffinity axis GPR25–CXCL17 of the integrated extraintestinal mucosal immune system, regulating how immune responses disseminate to non-intestinal barrier tissues and with implications for understanding and manipulating immunity and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The taste system controls many insect behaviours, yet little is known about how tastants are encoded in mosquitoes or how they regulate critical behaviours. Here we examine how taste stimuli are encoded by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes—a highly invasive disease vector—and how these cues influence biting, feeding and egg laying. We find that neurons of the labellum, the major taste organ of the head, differentially encode a wide variety of human and other cues. We identify three functional classes of taste sensilla with an expansive coding capacity. In addition to excitatory responses, we identify prevalent inhibitory responses, which are predictive of biting behaviour. Certain bitter compounds suppress physiological and behavioural responses to sugar, suggesting their use as potent stop signals against appetitive cues. Complex cues, including human sweat, nectar and egg-laying site water, elicit distinct response profiles from the neuronal repertoire. We identify key tastants on human skin and in sweat that synergistically promote biting behaviours. Transcriptomic profiling identifies taste receptors that could be targeted to disrupt behaviours. Our study sheds light on key features of the taste system that suggest new ways of manipulating chemosensory function and controlling mosquito vectors. Taste neurons of the mosquito Aedes albopictus regulate biting, feeding and egg-laying behaviours by responding to taste cues in human sweat, nectar and egg-laying sites via excitation or inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution in South Asia is a health emergency, responsible for 2 million deaths every year1. Crop residue burning accounts for 40–60% of peak pollution during the winter harvest months2,3. Despite being illegal, this practice remains widespread4,5. Any solution to curb the problem necessitates government action at scale. Here we study whether leveraging the incentives of bureaucrats tasked with controlling burning can mitigate this phenomenon. Using a decade of wind, fire and health data from satellites and surveys from the Demographic and Health Surveys Program, we show that crop burning responds to bureaucrat incentives: fires increase by 15% when wind is most likely to direct pollution to neighbouring jurisdictions, and decrease by 14.5% when it pollutes their own. These effects intensify with stronger bureaucratic incentives and capacity. We also find that bureaucrat action against burning deters future polluters, further reducing fires by 13%. Finally, using an atmospheric model, we estimate that one log increase in in utero exposure to pollution from burning raises child mortality by 30–36 deaths per 1,000 births, underscoring the importance of bureaucrat action. Contrary to the growing beliefs that the problem of crop burning is intractable6,7, these findings highlight specific ways in which existing bureaucrats, when properly incentivized, can improve environmental management and public health outcomes. Around 1.8–2.7 deaths per 1,000 births (4.4–6.6% of the average child mortality) could be prevented in Pakistan and India if bureaucrats control crop burning across all areas of their jurisdiction as they do in places where fires would pollute their own district.",

Selection for immunity to pathogens has driven the evolution of sophisticated immunity mechanisms throughout biology, including in bacterial defence against bacteriophages3. Here we characterize the widely distributed anti-phage defence system CmdTAC, which provides robust defence against infection by the T-even family of phages4. Our results support a model in which CmdC detects infection by sensing viral capsid proteins, ultimately leading to the activation of a toxic ADP-ribosyltransferase effector protein, CmdT. We show that newly synthesized capsid protein triggers dissociation of the chaperone CmdC from the CmdTAC complex, leading to destabilization and degradation of the antitoxin CmdA, with consequent liberation of the CmdT ADP-ribosyltransferase. Notably, CmdT does not target a protein, DNA or structured RNA, the known targets of other ADP-ribosyltransferases. Instead, CmdT modifies the N6 position of adenine in GA dinucleotides within single-stranded RNAs, leading to arrest of mRNA translation and inhibition of viral replication. Our work reveals a novel mechanism of anti-viral defence and a previously unknown but broadly distributed class of ADP-ribosyltransferases that target mRNA. The bacterial anti-phage toxin–antitoxin–chaperone defence system CmdTAC senses capsid proteins via CmdC, enabling dissociation from the CmdTAC complex of the RNA ADP-ribosyltransferase CmdT, which targets single-stranded RNAs, inhibiting viral replication.",

Here we use the tunicate, Ciona, to explore the evolutionary origins of neural crest since this invertebrate chordate is among the closest living relatives of vertebrates2–4. Previous studies identified two potential neural crest cell types in Ciona, sensory pigment cells and bipolar tail neurons5,6. Recent findings suggest that  bipolar tail neurons are homologous to cranial sensory ganglia rather than derivatives of neural crest7,8. Here we show that the pigment cell lineage also produces neural progenitor cells that form regions of the juvenile nervous system following metamorphosis. Neural progenitors are also a major derivative of neural crest in vertebrates, suggesting that the last common ancestor of tunicates and vertebrates contained a multipotent progenitor population at the neural plate border. It would therefore appear that a key property of neural crest, multipotentiality, preceded the emergence of vertebrates. In the tunicate Ciona, we show that pigment cell lineage also produces neural progenitor cells that form regions of the juvenile nervous system after metamorphosis, suggesting that neural crest cell multipotency precedes the emergence of vertebrates.",

Here, by combining time-resolved imaging and transcriptomic profiling, we show that single cells of the ichthyosporean Chromosphaera perkinsii—a close relative that diverged from animals about 1 billion years ago3,4—undergo symmetry breaking and develop through cleavage divisions to produce a prolonged multicellular colony with distinct co-existing cell types. Our findings about the autonomous and palintomic developmental program of C. perkinsii hint that such multicellular development either is much older than previously thought or evolved convergently in ichthyosporeans. The ichthyosporean Chromosphaera perkinsii develops via symmetry breaking and cleavage divisions, and it forms spatially organized colonies with distinct cell types.",

    "abstract": "Rising carbon dioxide emissions are provoking ocean warming and acidification1,2, altering plankton habitats and threatening calcifying organisms3, such as the planktonic foraminifera (PF). Whether the PF can cope with these unprecedented rates of environmental change, through lateral migrations and vertical displacements, is unresolved. Here we show, using data collected over the course of a century as FORCIS4 global census counts, that the PF are displaying evident poleward migratory behaviours, increasing their diversity at mid- to high latitudes and, for some species, descending in the water column. Overall foraminiferal abundances have decreased by 24.2 ± 0.1% over the past eight decades. Beyond lateral migrations5, our study has uncovered intricate vertical migration patterns among foraminiferal species, presenting a nuanced understanding of their adaptive strategies. In the temperature and calcite saturation states projected for 2050 and 2100, low-latitude foraminiferal species will face physicochemical environments that surpass their current ecological tolerances. These species may replace higher-latitude species through poleward shifts, which would reduce low-latitude foraminiferal diversity. Our insights into the adaptation of foraminifera during the Anthropocene suggest that migration will not be enough to ensure survival. This underscores the urgent need for us to understand how the interplay of climate change, ocean acidification and other stressors will impact the survivability of large parts of the marine realm. Low-latitude planktonic foraminifera are coping with rapid ocean warming, acidification and nutrient shifts by migrating to deeper water-column depths or polewards, displacing higher-latitude species and reducing low-latitude diversity, ultimately being unable to adapt fast enough to survive in situ.",

Trapped polar molecules have been proposed as a promising quantum computing platform, offering scalability and single-particle addressability while still leveraging inherent complexity and strong couplings of molecules1–5. Recent progress in the single quantum state preparation and coherence of the hyperfine-rotational states of individually trapped molecules allows them to serve as promising qubits6–11, with intermolecular dipolar interactions creating entanglement12,13. However, universal two-qubit gates have not been demonstrated with molecules. Here we harness intrinsic molecular resources to implement a two-qubit iSWAP gate using individually trapped X1Σ+ NaCs molecules. By allowing the molecules to interact for 664 μs at a distance of 1.9 μm, we create a maximally entangled Bell state with a fidelity of 94(3)% in trials in which both molecules are present. Using motion–rotation coupling, we measure residual excitation of the lowest few motional states along the axial trapping direction and find them to be the primary source of decoherence. Finally, we identify two non-interacting hyperfine states within the ground rotational level in which we encode a qubit. The interaction is toggled by transferring between interacting and non-interacting states to realize an iSWAP gate. We verify the gate performance by measuring its logical truth table. Intrinsic molecular resources are used to implement a two-qubit iSWAP gate using individually trapped X1Σ+ NaCs molecules.",

    "abstract": "Making adaptive decisions in complex environments requires appropriately identifying sources of error1,2. The frontal cortex is critical for adaptive decisions, but its neurons show mixed selectivity to task features3 and their uncertainty estimates4, raising the question of how errors are attributed to their most likely causes. Here, by recording neural responses from tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) performing a hierarchical decision task with rule reversals, we find that the mediodorsal thalamus independently represents cueing and rule uncertainty. This enables the relevant thalamic population to drive prefrontal reconfiguration following a reversal by appropriately attributing errors to an environmental change. Mechanistic dissection of behavioural switching revealed a transthalamic pathway for cingulate cortical error monitoring5,6 to reconfigure prefrontal executive control7. Overall, our work highlights a potential role for the thalamus in demixing cortical signals while providing a low-dimensional pathway for cortico-cortical communication. By examining neural responses from tree shrews performing hierarchical decision tasks with rule reversals, the authors identify a thalamocortical mechanism for regulating cognitive flexibility.",

    "abstract": "The intestine is characterized by an environment in which host requirements for nutrient and water absorption are consequently paired with the requirements to establish tolerance to the outside environment. To better understand how the intestine functions in health and disease, large efforts have been made to characterize the identity and composition of cells from different intestinal regions1–8. However, the robustness, nature of adaptability and extent of resilience of the transcriptional landscape and cellular underpinning of the intestine in space are still poorly understood. Here we generated an integrated resource of the spatial and cellular landscape of the murine intestine in the steady and perturbed states. Leveraging these data, we demonstrated that the spatial landscape of the intestine was robust to the influence of the microbiota and was adaptable in a spatially restricted manner. Deploying a model of spatiotemporal acute inflammation, we demonstrated that both robust and adaptable features of the landscape were resilient. Moreover, highlighting the physiological relevance and value of our dataset, we identified a region of the middle colon characterized by an immune-driven multicellular spatial adaptation of structural cells to the microbiota. Our results demonstrate that intestinal regionalization is characterized by robust and resilient structural cell states and that the intestine can adapt to environmental stress in a spatially controlled manner through the crosstalk between immunity and structural cell homeostasis. Intestinal regionalization is characterized by robust and resilient structural cell states and the intestine can adapt to environmental stress in a spatially controlled manner through crosstalk between immunity and structural cell homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The observed temperature record, which combines sea surface temperatures with near-surface air temperatures over land, is crucial for understanding climate variability and change1–4. However, early records of global mean surface temperature are uncertain owing to changes in measurement technology and practice, partial documentation5–8, and incomplete spatial coverage9. Here we show that existing estimates of ocean temperatures in the early twentieth century (1900–1930) are too cold, based on independent statistical reconstructions of the global mean surface temperature from either ocean or land data. The ocean-based reconstruction is on average about 0.26 °C colder than the land-based one, despite very high agreement in all other periods. The ocean cold anomaly is unforced, and internal variability in climate models cannot explain the observed land–ocean discrepancy. Several lines of evidence based on attribution, timescale analysis, coastal grid cells and palaeoclimate data support the argument of a substantial cold bias in the observed global sea-surface-temperature record in the early twentieth century. Although estimates of global warming since the mid-nineteenth century are not affected, correcting the ocean cold bias would result in a more modest early-twentieth-century warming trend10, a lower estimate of decadal-scale variability inferred from the instrumental record3, and better agreement between simulated and observed warming than existing datasets suggest2. Independent statistical reconstructions of the global mean surface temperature from either ocean or land data show that existing estimates of early-twentieth-century ocean surface temperatures are too cold.",

    "abstract": "Quantum scars refer to eigenstates with enhanced probability density along unstable classical periodic orbits. First predicted 40 years ago1, scars are special eigenstates that counterintuitively defy ergodicity in quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic2,3. Despite the importance and long history of scars, their direct visualization in quantum systems remains an open field4–10. Here we demonstrate that, by using an in situ graphene quantum dot (GQD) creation and a wavefunction mapping technique11,12, quantum scars are imaged for Dirac electrons with nanometre spatial resolution and millielectronvolt energy resolution with a scanning tunnelling microscope. Specifically, we find enhanced probability densities in the form of lemniscate ∞-shaped and streak-like patterns within our stadium-shaped GQDs. Both features show equal energy interval recurrence, consistent with predictions for relativistic quantum scars13,14. By combining classical and quantum simulations, we demonstrate that the observed patterns correspond to two unstable periodic orbits that exist in our stadium-shaped GQD, thus proving that they are both quantum scars. In addition to providing unequivocal visual evidence of quantum scarring, our work offers insight into the quantum–classical correspondence in relativistic chaotic quantum systems and paves the way to experimental investigation of other recently proposed scarring species such as perturbation-induced scars15–17, chiral scars18,19 and antiscarring20. Using a graphene quantum dot creation and a wavefunction mapping technique, quantum scars are directly visualized for Dirac electrons with a scanning tunnelling microscope.",

    "abstract": "During reproduction, multiple species such as insects and all mammals undergo extensive physiological and morphological adaptions to ensure health and survival of the mother and optimal development of the offspring. Here we report that the intestinal epithelium undergoes expansion during pregnancy and lactation in mammals. This enlargement of the intestinal surface area results in a novel geometry of expanded villi. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κΒ (RANK, encoded by TNFRSF11A) and its ligand RANKL were identified as a molecular pathway involved in this villous expansion of the small intestine in vivo in mice and in intestinal mouse and human organoids. Mechanistically, RANK–RANKL protects gut epithelial cells from cell death and controls the intestinal stem cell niche through BMP receptor signalling, resulting in the elongation of villi and a prominent increase in the intestinal surface. As a transgenerational consequence, babies born to female mice that lack Rank in the intestinal epithelium show reduced weight and develop glucose intolerance after metabolic stress. Whereas gut epithelial remodelling in pregnancy/lactation is reversible, constitutive expression of an active form of RANK is sufficient to drive intestinal expansion followed by loss of villi and stem cells, and prevents the formation of Apcmin-driven small intestinal stem cell tumours. These data identify RANK–RANKL as a pathway that drives intestinal epithelial expansion in pregnancy/lactation, one of the most elusive and fundamental tissue remodelling events in mammalian life history and evolution. The RANK–RANKL pathway drives intestinal epithelial expansion in pregnancy and lactation.",

    "abstract": "The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) has a crucial role in maintaining cell membrane stability and integrity by connecting the intracellular cytoskeleton with the surrounding extracellular matrix1–3. Dysfunction of dystrophin and its associated proteins results in muscular dystrophy, a disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration4,5. Despite the important roles of the DGC in physiology and pathology, its structural details remain largely unknown, hindering a comprehensive understanding of its assembly and function. Here we isolated the native DGC from mouse skeletal muscle and obtained its high-resolution structure. Our findings unveil a markedly divergent structure from the previous model of DGC assembly. Specifically, on the extracellular side, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycans co-fold to form a specialized, extracellular tower-like structure, which has a central role in complex assembly by providing binding sites for α-sarcoglycan and dystroglycan. In the transmembrane region, sarcoglycans and sarcospan flank and stabilize the single transmembrane helix of dystroglycan, rather than forming a subcomplex as previously proposed6–8. On the intracellular side, sarcoglycans and dystroglycan engage in assembly with the dystrophin–dystrobrevin subcomplex through extensive interaction with the ZZ domain of dystrophin. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of the structural linkage across the cell membrane and provide a foundation for the molecular interpretation of many muscular dystrophy-related mutations. A structural study of native dystrophin glycoprotein complex from mouse skeletal muscle reveals an extended tower-like architecture that provides multiple binding sites on both sides of the membrane for signalling and effector molecules, reshaping our understanding of how the complex is assembled.",

    "abstract": "Much of the human genome is transcribed into RNAs1, many of which contain structural elements that are important for their function. Such RNA molecules—including those that are structured and well-folded2—are conformationally heterogeneous and flexible, which is a prerequisite for function3,4, but this limits the applicability of methods such as NMR, crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy for structure elucidation. Moreover, owing to the lack of a large RNA structure database, and no clear correlation between sequence and structure, approaches such as AlphaFold5 for protein structure prediction do not apply to RNA. Therefore, determining the structures of heterogeneous RNAs remains an unmet challenge. Here we report holistic RNA structure determination method using atomic force microscopy, unsupervised machine learning and deep neural networks (HORNET), a novel method for determining three-dimensional topological structures of RNA using atomic force microscopy images of individual molecules in solution. Owing to the high signal-to-noise ratio of atomic force microscopy, this method is ideal for capturing structures of large RNA molecules in distinct conformations. In addition to six benchmark cases, we demonstrate the utility of HORNET by determining multiple heterogeneous structures of RNase P RNA and the HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) RNA. Thus, our method addresses one of the major challenges in determining heterogeneous structures of large and flexible RNA molecules, and contributes to the fundamental understanding of RNA structural biology. HORNET, a method that uses unsupervised machine learning and deep neural networks to analyse atomic force microscopy data enables structural determination of RNA molecules in multiple conformations.",

    "abstract": "Massive-data connectivity has driven the need for efficient, directed communications through beamforming arrays1–10. Delay elements are critical in any beamforming signal chain. However, these elements impose fundamental limits on size, channel capacity, power efficiency and effective isotropic radiated power11. Although passive phase shifters do not consume DC power, they suffer from narrow bandwidth, poor phase resolution and low power-handling capacity. They introduce a beam squint, in which different frequency components experience different time delays, blurring signals so that they cannot be resolved. This severely limits the data rate of the wireless link, that is, its channel capacity. Although true time delay (TTD) elements12 solve this problem and service a broad bandwidth, they comprise wavelength-scale transmission lines, making them prohibitively area-inefficient for modern semiconductor processes. Here we address this long-standing problem by introducing a quasi-true time delay (Q-TTD) that miniaturizes TTD elements and breaks fundamental channel-capacity limits of these wireless links. We demonstrate this mechanism for a microwave device implemented in a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Key to shrinking the footprint is a reflective-type phase-shifting structure with 3D variable TTD reflectors within a sub-wavelength footprint. This achieves ultra-broadband phase tuning by using them to vary the length of the waveguide’s path to ground. They produce a delay-to-area ratio that yields a substantially higher on-chip channel capacity compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. This component, when integrated in arrays, enables high-resolution imaging and low-squint beamforming for wideband communication, on-chip radar and other applications. A quasi-true time delay is demonstrated for a microwave device implemented in a CMOS technology to miniaturize true-time-delay components of beam-steering systems, addressing the fundamental channel-capacity limitations and increasing data transmission in wireless communications.",

    "abstract": "Biogenic monoamines—vital transmitters orchestrating neurological, endocrinal and immunological functions1–5—are stored in secretory vesicles by vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) for controlled quantal release6,7. Harnessing proton antiport, VMATs enrich monoamines around 10,000-fold and sequester neurotoxicants to protect neurons8–10. VMATs are targeted by an arsenal of therapeutic drugs and imaging agents to treat and monitor neurodegenerative disorders, hypertension and drug addiction1,8,11–16. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these actions remain unclear. Here we report eight cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VMAT1 in unbound form and in complex with four monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and histamine), the Parkinsonism-inducing MPP+, the psychostimulant amphetamine and the antihypertensive drug reserpine. Reserpine binding captures a cytoplasmic-open conformation, whereas the other structures show a lumenal-open conformation stabilized by extensive gating interactions. The favoured transition to this lumenal-open state contributes to monoamine accumulation, while protonation facilitates the cytoplasmic-open transition and concurrently prevents monoamine binding to avoid unintended depletion. Monoamines and neurotoxicants share a binding pocket that possesses polar sites for specificity and a wrist-and-fist shape for versatility. Variations in this pocket explain substrate preferences across the SLC18 family. Overall, these structural insights and supporting functional studies elucidate the mechanism of vesicular monoamine transport and provide the basis to develop therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases and substance abuse. Monoamines and neurotoxicants share a binding pocket in VMAT1 featuring polar sites for specificity and a wrist-and-fist shape for versatility, and monoamine enrichment in storage vesicles arises from dominant import via favoured lumenal-open transition of VMAT1 and protonation-precluded binding during its cytoplasmic-open transition.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR system is an adaptive immune system found in prokaryotes that defends host cells against the invasion of foreign DNA1. As part of the ongoing struggle between phages and the bacterial immune system, the CRISPR system has evolved into various types, each with distinct functionalities2. Type II Cas9 is the most extensively studied of these systems and has diverse subtypes. It remains uncertain whether members of this family can evolve additional mechanisms to counter viral invasions3,4. Here we identify 2,062 complete Cas9 loci, predict the structures of their associated proteins and reveal three structural growth trajectories for type II-C Cas9. We found that novel associated genes (NAGs) tended to be present within the loci of larger II-C Cas9s. Further investigation revealed that CbCas9 from Chryseobacterium species contains a novel β-REC2 domain, and forms a heterotetrameric complex with an NAG-encoded CRISPR–Cas-system-promoting (pro-CRISPR) protein of II-C Cas9 (PcrIIC1). The CbCas9–PcrIIC1 complex exhibits enhanced DNA binding and cleavage activity, broader compatibility for protospacer adjacent motif sequences, increased tolerance for mismatches and improved anti-phage immunity, compared with stand-alone CbCas9. Overall, our work sheds light on the diversity and ‘growth evolutionary’ trajectories of II-C Cas9 proteins at the structural level, and identifies many NAGs—such as PcrIIC1, which serves as a pro-CRISPR factor to enhance CRISPR-mediated immunity. Comprehensive analyses of Cas9 proteins shed light on the evolution of the CRISPR–Cas9 system, and identify a pro-CRISPR accessory protein in bacteria that boosts CRISPR-mediated immunity by enhancing the DNA binding and cleavage activity of Cas9.",

    "abstract": "Stable composite objects, such as hadrons, nuclei, atoms, molecules and superconducting pairs, formed by attractive forces are ubiquitous in nature. By contrast, composite objects stabilized by means of repulsive forces were long thought to be theoretical constructions owing to their fragility in naturally occurring systems. Surprisingly, the formation of bound atom pairs by strong repulsive interactions has been demonstrated experimentally in optical lattices1. Despite this success, repulsively bound particle pairs were believed to have no analogue in condensed matter owing to strong decay channels. Here we present spectroscopic signatures of repulsively bound three-magnon states and bound magnon pairs in the Ising-like chain antiferromagnet BaCo2V2O8. In large transverse fields, below the quantum critical point, we identify repulsively bound magnon states by comparing terahertz spectroscopy measurements to theoretical results for the Heisenberg–Ising chain antiferromagnet, a paradigmatic quantum many-body model2–5. Our experimental results show that these high-energy, repulsively bound magnon states are well separated from continua, exhibit notable dynamical responses and, despite dissipation, are sufficiently long-lived to be identified. As the transport properties in spin chains can be altered by magnon bound states, we envision that such states could serve as resources for magnonics-based quantum information processing technologies6–8. Comparison of terahertz spectroscopy measurements with theoretical results for the Heisenberg–Ising chain antiferromagnet demonstrates the existence of repulsively bound magnons in large transverse fields below the quantum critical point.",

Although the fractional charge of quasiparticles has been demonstrated for nearly three decades3–5, the first convincing evidence of their anyonic quantum statistics has only recently been obtained6,7 and, so far, the so-called scaling dimension that determines the propagation dynamics of the quasiparticles remains elusive. In particular, although the nonlinearity of the tunnelling quasiparticle current should reveal their scaling dimension, the measurements fail to match theory, arguably because this observable is not robust to non-universal complications8–12. Here we expose the scaling dimension from the thermal noise to shot noise crossover and observe an agreement with expectations. Measurements are fitted to the predicted finite-temperature expression involving both the scaling dimension of the quasiparticles and their charge12,13, in contrast to previous charge investigations focusing on the high-bias shot-noise regime14. A systematic analysis, repeated on several constrictions and experimental conditions, consistently matches the theoretical scaling dimensions for the fractional quasiparticles emerging at filling factors ν = 1/3, 2/5 and 2/3. This establishes a central property of fractional quantum Hall anyons and demonstrates a powerful and complementary window into exotic quasiparticles. The scaling dimension of fractional quantum Hall anyons shows agreement with expectations following examination of thermal-to-shot-noise crossover measurements by fitting to the predicted finite-temperature expression involving both the scaling dimension of quasiparticles and their charge.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus of almost all massive galaxies contains a supermassive black hole (BH)1. The feedback from the accretion of these BHs is often considered to have crucial roles in establishing the quiescence of massive galaxies2–14, although some recent studies show that even galaxies hosting the most active BHs do not exhibit a reduction in their molecular gas reservoirs or star formation rates15–17. Therefore, the influence of BHs on galaxy star formation remains highly debated and lacks direct evidence. Here, based on a large sample of nearby galaxies with measurements of masses of both BHs and atomic hydrogen (HI), the main component of the interstellar medium18, we show that the HI gas mass to stellar masses ratio (μHI = MHI/M⋆) is more strongly correlated with BH masses (MBH) than with any other galaxy parameters, including stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and bulge masses. Moreover, once the μHI–MBH correlation is considered, μHI loses dependence on other galactic parameters, demonstrating that MBH serves as the primary driver of μHI. These findings provide important evidence for how the accumulated energy from BH accretion regulates the cool gas content in galaxies, by ejecting interstellar medium gas and/or suppressing gas cooling from the circumgalactic medium. Supermassive black holes regulate the amount of atomic hydrogen in galaxies and the atomic hydrogen gas mass to stellar masses ratio is more strongly correlated with black hole masses.",

    "abstract": "The unimolecular heterolysis of covalent σ-bonds is integral to many chemical transformations, including SN1-, E1- and 1,2-migration reactions. To a first approximation, the unequal redistribution of electron density during bond heterolysis is governed by the difference in polarity of the two departing bonding partners1–3. This means that if a σ-bond consists of two identical groups (that is, symmetric σ-bonds), its unimolecular fission from the S0, S1, or T1 states only occurs homolytically after thermal or photochemical activation1–7. To force symmetric σ-bonds into heterolytic manifolds, co-activation by bimolecular noncovalent interactions is necessary4. These tactics are only applicable to σ-bond constituents susceptible to such polarizing effects, and often suffer from inefficient chemoselectivity in polyfunctional molecules. Here we report the net heterolysis of symmetric and homopolar σ-bonds (that is, those with similar electronegativity and equal leaving group ability3) by means of stimulated doublet–doublet electron transfer (SDET). As exemplified by Se–Se and C–Se σ-bonds, symmetric and homopolar bonds initially undergo thermal homolysis, followed by photochemically SDET, eventually leading to net heterolysis. Two key factors make this process feasible and synthetically valuable: (1) photoexcitation probably occurs in only one of the incipient radical pair members, thus leading to coincidental symmetry breaking8 and consequently net heterolysis even of symmetric σ-bonds. (2) If non-identical radicals are formed, each radical may be excited at different wavelengths, thus rendering the net heterolysis highly chemospecific and orthogonal to conventional heterolyses. This feature is demonstrated in a series of atypical SN1 reactions, in which selenides show SDET-induced nucleofugalities3 rivalling those of more electronegative halides or diazoniums. Net heterolysis of symmetric and homopolar σ-bonds by stimulated doublet–doublet electron transfer is reported in a series of atypical SN1 reactions, in which selenides show SDET-induced nucleofugalities rivalling those of more electronegative halides or diazoniums.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome predisposes individuals to haematological abnormalities, such as increased number of erythrocytes and leukaemia in a process that is initiated before birth and is not entirely understood1–3. Here, to understand dysregulated haematopoiesis in Down syndrome, we integrated single-cell transcriptomics of over 1.1 million cells with chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomics datasets using human fetal liver and bone marrow samples from 3 fetuses with disomy and 15 fetuses with trisomy. We found that differences in gene expression in Down syndrome were dependent on both cell type and environment. Furthermore, we found multiple lines of evidence that haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in Down syndrome are ‘primed’ to differentiate. We subsequently established a Down syndrome-specific map linking non-coding elements to genes in disomic and trisomic HSCs using 10X multiome data. By integrating this map with genetic variants associated with blood cell counts, we discovered that trisomy restructured regulatory interactions to dysregulate enhancer activity and gene expression critical to erythroid lineage differentiation. Furthermore, as mutations in Down syndrome display a signature of oxidative stress4,5, we validated both increased mitochondrial mass and oxidative stress in Down syndrome, and observed that these mutations preferentially fell into regulatory regions of expressed genes in HSCs. Together, our single-cell, multi-omic resource provides a high-resolution molecular map of fetal haematopoiesis in Down syndrome and indicates significant regulatory restructuring giving rise to co-occurring haematological conditions. Using single-cell and multi-omics data of fetal blood, a high-resolution molecular map of dysregulated haematopoiesis in Down syndrome is provided.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between translation and mRNA decay is widespread in human cells1–3. In quality-control pathways, exonucleolytic degradation of mRNA associated with translating ribosomes is mediated largely by the cytoplasmic exosome4–9, which includes the exoribonuclease complex EXO10 and the helicase complex SKI238 (refs. 10–16). The helicase can extract mRNA from the ribosome and is expected to transfer it to the exoribonuclease core through a bridging factor, HBS1L3 (also known as SKI7), but the mechanisms of this molecular handover remain unclear7,17,18. Here we reveal how human EXO10 is recruited by HBS1L3 (SKI7) to an active ribosome-bound SKI238 complex. We show that rather than a sequential handover, a direct physical coupling mechanism takes place, which culminates in the formation of a cytoplasmic exosome–ribosome supercomplex. Capturing the structure during active decay reveals a continuous path in which an RNA substrate threads from the 80S ribosome through the SKI2 helicase into the exoribonuclease active site of the cytoplasmic exosome complex. The SKI3 subunit of the complex directly binds to HBS1L3 (SKI7) and also engages a surface of the 40S subunit, establishing a recognition platform in collided disomes. Exosome and ribosome thus work together as a single structural and functional unit in co-translational mRNA decay, coordinating their activities in a transient supercomplex. The structure of a human exosome–ribosome supercomplex reveals the mechanisms behind the formation of active cytoplasmic exosomes and their role in co-translational RNA decay.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic innate immune systems use pattern recognition receptors to sense infection by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which then triggers an immune response. Bacteria have similarly evolved immunity proteins that sense certain components of their viral predators, known as bacteriophages1–6. Although different immunity proteins can recognize different phage-encoded triggers, individual bacterial immunity proteins have been found to sense only a single trigger during infection, suggesting a one-to-one relationship between bacterial pattern recognition receptors and their ligands7–11. Here we demonstrate that the antiphage defence protein CapRelSJ46 in Escherichia coli can directly bind and sense two completely unrelated and structurally different proteins using the same sensory domain, with overlapping but distinct interfaces. Our results highlight the notable versatility of an immune sensory domain, which may be a common property of antiphage defence systems that enables them to keep pace with their rapidly evolving viral predators. We found that Bas11 phages harbour both trigger proteins that are sensed by CapRelSJ46 during infection, and we demonstrate that such phages can fully evade CapRelSJ46 defence only when both triggers are mutated. Our work shows how a bacterial immune system that senses more than one trigger can help prevent phages from easily escaping detection, and it may allow the detection of a broader range of phages. More generally, our findings illustrate unexpected multifactorial sensing by bacterial defence systems and complex coevolutionary relationships between them and their phage-encoded triggers. The antiphage defence protein CapRelSJ46 in Escherichia coli can directly bind and sense two completely unrelated and structurally different proteins using the same sensory domain, with overlapping but distinct interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Anurans are characterized by a biphasic life cycle, with an aquatic larval (tadpole) stage followed by an adult (frog) stage, both connected through the metamorphic period in which drastic morphological and physiological changes occur1. Extant tadpoles exhibit great morphological diversity and ecological relevance2, but their absence in the pre-Cretaceous fossil record (older than 145 million years) makes their origins and early evolution enigmatic. This contrasts with the postmetamorphic anuran fossil record that dates back to the Early Jurassic and with closely related species in the Late Triassic (around 217–213 million years ago (Ma))3. Here we report a late-stage tadpole of the stem-anuran Notobatrachus degiustoi from the Middle Jurassic of Patagonia (around 168–161 Ma). This finding has dual importance because it represents the oldest-known tadpole and, to our knowledge, the first stem-anuran larva. Its exquisite preservation, including soft tissues, shows features associated with the filter-feeding mechanism characteristic of extant tadpoles4,5. Notably, both N. degiustoi tadpole and adult reached a large size, demonstrating that tadpole gigantism occurred among stem-anurans. This new discovery reveals that a biphasic life cycle, with filter-feeding tadpoles inhabiting aquatic ephemeral environments, was already present in the early evolutionary history of stem-anurans and has remained stable for at least 161 million years. We report a late-stage tadpole of the stem-anuran Notobatrachus degiustoi from the Middle Jurassic of Patagonia, a finding that has dual importance because it represents the oldest-known tadpole and describes an exquisitely preserved stem-anuran larva.",

    "abstract": "The dosage of X-linked genes is accurately regulated with the development of fetal germ cells (FGCs)1,2. How aberrant dosage of X-linked genes impairs FGC development in humans remains poorly understood. FGCs of patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS), who have an extra X chromosome, provide natural models for addressing this issue3. Here we demonstrate that most human FGCs in KS are arrested at an early stage, characterized by the upregulation of genes related to pluripotency, the WNT pathway and the TGF-β pathway, along with the downregulation of genes involved in FGC differentiation. The limited KS FGCs that are capable of reaching the late stage remain relatively naive. X chromosomes are not inactivated and the dosage of X-linked genes is excessive in KS FGCs. X-linked genes dominate the differentially expressed genes and are enriched in critical biological processes associated with the developmental delay of KS FGCs. Moreover, aberrant interactions between Sertoli cells and FGCs disrupt the migration of late FGCs to the basement membrane in KS. Notably, inhibition of the TGF-β pathway improves the differentiation of KS FGCs. Our findings elucidate how the extra X chromosome impairs the development of male FGCs and reveal the initial molecular events preceding germ cell loss in KS. In Klinefelter syndrome, gene dysregulation due to the extra X chromosome leads to delayed development of fetal germ cells (FGCs), and aberrant interactions between Sertoli cells and FGCs disrupt the migration of late FGCs to the basement membrane.",

    "abstract": "A dearth of Mesozoic-aged, three-dimensional fossils hinders understanding of the origin of the distinctive skull and brain of modern (crown) birds1. Here we report Navaornis hestiae gen. et sp. nov., an exquisitely preserved fossil species from the Late Cretaceous of Brazil. The skull of Navaornis is toothless and large-eyed, with a vaulted cranium closely resembling the condition in crown birds; however, phylogenetic analyses recover Navaornis in Enantiornithes, a highly diverse clade of Mesozoic stem birds. Despite an overall geometry quantitatively indistinguishable from crown birds, the skull of Navaornis retains numerous plesiomorphies including a maxilla-dominated rostrum, an akinetic palate, a diapsid temporal configuration, a small cerebellum and a weakly expanded telencephalon. These archaic neurocranial traits are combined with a crown bird-like degree of brain flexion and a bony labyrinth comparable in shape to those of many crown birds but substantially larger. Altogether, the emergent cranial geometry of Navaornis shows an unprecedented degree of similarity between crown birds and enantiornithines, groups last sharing a common ancestor more than 130 million years ago2. Navaornis provides long-sought insight into the detailed cranial and endocranial morphology of stem birds phylogenetically crownward of Archaeopteryx, clarifying the pattern and timing by which the distinctive neuroanatomy of living birds was assembled. The exceptionally preserved skull of a starling-sized fossil bird from 80 million years ago allows reconstruction of the brain, enabling detailed endocranial description of an archaic bird that is evolutionarily intermediate between Archaeopteryx and living birds.",

    "abstract": "The half-filled lowest Landau level is a fascinating platform for researching interacting topological phases. A celebrated example is the composite Fermi liquid, a non-Fermi liquid formed by composite fermions in strong magnetic fields1–10. Its zero-field counterpart is predicted in a twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2)11,12—a recently discovered fractional Chern insulator exhibiting the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect13–16. Although transport measurements at ν = −1/2 show signatures consistent with a zero-field composite Fermi liquid14, new probes are crucial to investigate the state and its elementary excitations. Here, by using the unique valley properties of tMoTe2, we report optical signatures of a zero-field composite Fermi liquid. We measured the degree of circular polarization (ρ) of trion photoluminescence versus hole doping and electric field. We found that, within the phase space showing robust ferromagnetism, ρ is near unity for Fermi liquid states. However, ρ is quenched at both integer and fractional Chern insulators, and in a hole doping range near ν = −1/2. Temperature, optical excitation power and electric-field-dependence measurements demonstrate that the quenching of ρ is a direct consequence of an energy gap (pseudogap) for electronic excitations of the Chern insulators (composite Fermi liquid): because the local spin-polarized excitations necessary to form trions are strongly suppressed, trion formation at the corresponding filling factors relies on optically generated unpolarized itinerant holes. Our work highlights a new excitonic probe of zero-field fractional Chern insulator physics, unique to tMoTe2. Using the unique valley properties of a twisted MoTe2 bilayer, measurements of the degree of circular polarization of trion photoluminescence reveal optical signatures of a zero-field composite Fermi liquid.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of genomic integrity in rapidly proliferating cells is a substantial challenge during embryonic development1–3. Although numerous cell-intrinsic mechanisms have been revealed4–7, little is known about genome-protective effects and influences of developmental tissue microenvironments on tissue-forming cells. Here we show that fetal liver hepatocytes provide protection to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) genomes. Lineage tracing and depletion in mice demonstrated that delayed hepatocyte development in early fetal livers increased the chromosomal instability of newly colonizing HSPCs. In addition, HSPCs developed tolerance to genotoxins in hepatocyte-conditioned medium, suggesting that hepatocytes protect the HSPC genome in a paracrine manner. Proteomic analyses demonstrated the enrichment of fetuin-A in hepatocyte-conditioned medium but not in early fetal livers. Fetuin-A activates a Toll-like receptor pathway to prevent pathogenic R-loop accumulation in HSPCs undergoing DNA replication and gene transcription in the fetal liver. Numerous haematopoietic regulatory genes frequently involved in leukaemogenic mutations are associated with R-loop-enriched regions. In Fetua-knockout mice, HSPCs showed increased genome instability and susceptibility to malignancy induction. Moreover, low concentrations of fetuin-A correlated with the oncogenesis of childhood leukaemia. Therefore, we uncover a mechanism operating in developmental tissues that offers tissue-forming cell genome protection and is implicated in developmental-related diseases. A mechanism is uncovered that results in fetal hepatocytes having a paracrine role in providing genome protection to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.",

    "abstract": "Most birds can navigate seamlessly between aerial and terrestrial environments. Whereas the forelimbs evolved into wings primarily for flight, the hindlimbs serve diverse functions such as walking, hopping and leaping, and jumping take-off for transitions into flight1. These capabilities have inspired engineers to aim for similar multimodality in aerial robots, expanding their range of applications across diverse environments. However, challenges remain in reproducing multimodal locomotion, across gaits with distinct kinematics and propulsive characteristics, such as walking and jumping, while preserving lightweight mass for flight. This trade-off between mechanical complexity and versatility2 limits most existing aerial robots to only one additional locomotor mode3–5. Here we overcome the complexity–versatility trade-off with RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for multiple ENvironments), which uses its bird-inspired multifunctional legs to jump rapidly into flight, walk on the ground, and hop over obstacles and gaps similar to the multimodal locomotion of birds. We show that jumping for take-off contributes substantially to the initial flight take-off speed6–9 and, remarkably, that it is more energy efficient than taking off without the jump. Our analysis suggests an important trade-off in mass distribution between legs and body among birds adapted for different locomotor strategies, with greater investment in leg mass among terrestrial birds with multimodal gait demands. Multifunctional robot legs expand the opportunities to deploy traditional fixed-wing aircraft in complex terrains through autonomous take-offs and multimodal gaits. A bird-inspired robot that can jump into flight, walk on the ground and hop over obstacles shows that jumping for take-off is more energy efficient than taking off without the jump.",

    "abstract": "Tailored light–matter interactions in the strong coupling regime enable the manipulation and control of quantum systems with up to unit efficiency1,2, with applications ranging from quantum information to photochemistry3–7. Although strong light–matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation8, comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states9,10. However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, because of the lack of pulse-shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach reveals a strong dressing of the ionization continuum, otherwise elusive to experimental observables. The latter is exploited to achieve control of the total ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and soft X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to soft X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time. Ultrafast quantum control of helium atoms is obtained by shaping the extreme ultraviolet pulses generated by a seeded free-electron laser.",

Its dysfunction is related to cancer and neurodegenerative disease3,4. Despite its importance, how TRiC works in the cell remains unclear. Here we structurally analysed the architecture, conformational dynamics and spatial organization of the chaperonin TRiC in human cells using cryo-electron tomography. We resolved distinctive open, closed, substrate-bound and prefoldin-associated states of TRiC, and reconstructed its duty cycle in situ. The substrate-bound open and symmetrically closed TRiC states were equally abundant. Closed TRiC containing substrate forms distinctive clusters, indicative of spatial organization. Translation inhibition did not fundamentally change the distribution of duty cycle intermediates, but reduced substrate binding for all states as well as cluster formation. From our in-cell structures, we identified the programmed cell death protein 5 (PDCD5) as an interactor that specifically binds to almost all open but not closed TRiC, in a position that is compatible with both substrate and prefoldin binding. Our data support a model in which TRiC functions at near full occupancy to fold newly synthesized proteins inside cells. Defining the TRiC cycle and function inside cells lays the foundation to understand its dysfunction during cancer and neurodegeneration.

    "abstract": "The formation of the vertebrate body involves the coordinated production of trunk tissues from progenitors located in the posterior of the embryo. Although in vitro models using pluripotent stem cells replicate aspects of this process1–10, they lack crucial components, most notably the notochord—a defining feature of chordates that patterns surrounding tissues11. Consequently, cell types dependent on notochord signals are absent from current models of human trunk formation. Here we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of chick embryos to map molecularly distinct progenitor populations and their spatial organization. Guided by this map, we investigated how differentiating human pluripotent stem cells develop a stereotypical spatial organization of trunk cell types. We found that YAP inactivation in conjunction with FGF-mediated MAPK signalling facilitated WNT pathway activation and induced expression of TBXT (also known as BRA). In addition, timely inhibition of WNT-induced NODAL and BMP signalling regulated the proportions of different tissue types, including notochordal cells. This enabled us to create a three-dimensional model of human trunk development that undergoes morphogenetic movements, producing elongated structures with a notochord and ventral neural and mesodermal tissues. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying vertebrate notochord formation and establish a more comprehensive in vitro model of human trunk development. This paves the way for future studies of tissue patterning in a physiologically relevant environment. Through analysis of developing chick embryos and in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells, a study develops a method to generate a model of the human trunk with a notochord.",

Modern hydrographic data reveal that the STG extends to a depth of about 1 km in the Northwest Atlantic, with its maximum depth defined by the base of the subtropical thermocline. Despite the likelihood of greater wind stress curl and surface buoyancy loss during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)3, previous work suggests minimal change in the depth of the glacial STG4. Here we show a sharp glacial water mass boundary between 33° N and 36° N extending down to between 2.0 and 2.5 km—approximately 1 km deeper than today. Our findings arise from benthic foraminiferal δ18O profiles from sediment cores in two depth transects at Cape Hatteras (36–39° N) and Blake Outer Ridge (29–34° N) in the Northwest Atlantic. This result suggests that the STG, including the Gulf Stream, was deeper and stronger during the LGM than at present, which we attribute to increased glacial wind stress curl, as supported by climate model simulations, as well as greater glacial production of denser subtropical mode waters (STMWs). Our data suggest (1) that subtropical waters probably contributed to the geochemical signature of what is conventionally identified as Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW)5–7 and (2) the STG helped sustain continued buoyancy loss, water mass conversion and northwards meridional heat transport (MHT) in the glacial North Atlantic. Analysis of benthic foraminiferal δ18O profiles from sediment cores in two depth transects in the Northwest Atlantic suggests that the subtropical gyre was deeper and stronger during the Last Glacial Maximum compared with today.",

    "abstract": "The oxygen fugacity (fO2) of convecting upper mantle recorded by ridge peridotites varies by more than four orders of magnitude1–3. Although much attention has been given to mechanisms that drive variations in mantle fO2 between tectonic settings1,3,4 and to comparisons of fO2 between modern rocks and ancient-mantle-derived rocks5–10, comparatively little has been done to understand the origins of the high variability in fO2 recorded by peridotites from modern mid-ocean ridge settings. Here we report the petrography and geochemistry of peridotites from the Gakkel Ridge and East Pacific Rise (EPR), including 16 new high-precision determinations of fO2. Refractory peridotites from the Gakkel Ridge record fO2 more than four orders of magnitude below the mantle average. With thermodynamic and mineral partitioning modelling, we show that excursions to ultralow fO2 can be produced by large degrees of melting at high potential temperature (Tp), beginning in the garnet field and continuing into the spinel field—conditions met during the generation of ancient komatiites but not modern basalts. This does not mean that ambient convecting upper mantle had a lower ferric to ferrous ratio in Archaean times than today nor that modern melting in the garnet field at hotspots produce reduced magmas. Instead, it implies that rafts of ancient, refractory, ultrareduced mantle continue to circulate in the modern mantle while contributing little to modern ridge volcanism. Analysis of peridotites reveals ultralow oxygen fugacity, suggesting that rafts of ancient, ultrareduced mantle were generated by deep melting at high temperatures and continue to circulate in the modern mantle, although they contribute little to modern ridge volcanism.",

    "abstract": "Massive stars are predominantly born in stellar associations or clusters1. Their radiation fields, stellar winds and supernovae strongly impact their local environment. In the first few million years of a cluster’s life, massive stars are dynamically ejected and run away from the cluster at high speed2. However, the production rate of dynamically ejected runaways is poorly constrained. Here we report on a sample of 55 massive runaway stars ejected from the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. An astrometric analysis of Gaia data3–5 reveals two channels of dynamically ejected runaways. The first channel ejects massive stars in all directions and is consistent with dynamical interactions during and after the birth of R136. The second channel launches stars in a preferred direction and may be related to a cluster interaction. We found that 23–33% of the most luminous stars initially born in R136 are runaways. Model predictions2,6,7 have significantly underestimated the dynamical escape fraction of massive stars. Consequently, their role in shaping and heating the interstellar and galactic media and their role in driving galactic outflows are far more important than previously thought8,9. An astrometric analysis of Gaia data identified two waves of massive runaway stars that have been dynamically ejected from the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.",

Here we used single-molecule analysis to demonstrate two-step double exchange of the two H2A–H2B dimers in a canonical yeast nucleosome with Htz1–H2B dimers, and showed that double exchange can be processive without release of the nucleosome from the SWR1 complex. Further analysis showed that bound nucleosomes flip between two states, with each presenting a different face, and hence histone dimer, to SWR1. The bound dwell time is longer when an H2A–H2B dimer is presented for exchange than when presented with an Htz1–H2B dimer. A hexasome intermediate in the reaction is bound to the SWR1 complex in a single orientation with the ‘empty’ site presented for dimer insertion. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed different populations of complexes showing nucleosomes caught ‘flipping’ between different conformations without release, each placing a different dimer into position for exchange, with the Swc2 subunit having a key role in this process. Together, the data reveal a processive mechanism for double dimer exchange that explains how SWR1 can ‘proofread’ the dimer identities within nucleosomes. Nucleosome flipping mediates a proofreading and processive mechanism of histone exchange driven by the chromatin remodeller SWR1.",

    "abstract": "Climate change affects marine organisms, causing migrations, biomass reduction and extinctions1,2. However, the abilities of marine species to adapt to these changes remain poorly constrained on both geological and anthropogenic timescales. Here we combine the fossil record and a global trait-based plankton model to study optimal temperatures of marine calcifying zooplankton (foraminifera, Rhizaria) through time. The results show that spinose foraminifera with algal symbionts acclimatized to deglacial warming at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 19–21 thousand years ago, ka), whereas foraminifera without symbionts (non-spinose or spinose) kept the same thermal preference and migrated polewards. However, when forcing the trait-based plankton model with rapid transient warming over the coming century (1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C relative to pre-industrial baseline), the model suggests that the acclimatization capacities of all ecogroups are limited and insufficient to track warming rates. Therefore, foraminifera are projected to migrate polewards and reduce their global carbon biomass by 5.7–15.1% (depending on the warming) by 2100 relative to 1900–1950. Our study highlights the different challenges posed by anthropogenic and geological warming for marine plankton and their ecosystem functions. Data from the fossil record, together with computational modelling, are used to assess the response of foraminifera (marine zooplankton) to temperature changes through time and to predict how well they will adjust to future climate-change-induced ocean warming.",

    "abstract": "Cross-electrophile coupling reactions have evolved into a major strategy for rapidly assembling important organic molecules1. Two readily accessible electrophiles are coupled to form new C–C bonds, providing a key advantage over traditional cross-coupling strategies that require the preformation of reactive organometallic species. Yet, the formation of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds that form the core of nearly all organic compounds remains highly challenging with current approaches, calling for the design of innovative new strategies. Here we report a distinct, transition-metal-free platform to form such bonds without the need for activating or stabilizing groups on the coupling partners. The reaction is enabled by an unusual single-electron transfer in a frustrated ion pair, and it can couple fragments containing functional groups that would be challenging in related transition-metal-catalysed processes. Moreover, we could further leverage this new mechanistic manifold in the design of other reactions, showing the broad potential of this type of reactivity. We anticipate that our results will provide a framework for further exploration of this reactivity pattern to tackle challenging problems in organic synthesis. A transition-metal-free platform enables the formation of challenging C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds in organic compounds via single-electron transfer, facilitating the coupling of functionalized fragments and expanding possibilities for efficient organic synthesis and reaction design.",

    "abstract": "The last giant impact on Earth is thought to have formed the Moon1. The timing of this event can be determined by dating the different rocks assumed to have crystallized from the lunar magma ocean (LMO). This has led to a wide range of estimates for the age of the Moon between 4.35 and 4.51 billion years ago (Ga), depending on whether ages for lunar whole-rock samples2–4 or individual zircon grains5–7 are used. Here we argue that the frequent occurrence of approximately 4.35-Ga ages among lunar rocks and a spike in zircon ages at about the same time8 is indicative of a remelting event driven by the Moon’s orbital evolution rather than the original crystallization of the LMO. We show that during passage through the Laplace plane transition9, the Moon experienced sufficient tidal heating and melting to reset the formation ages of most lunar samples, while retaining an earlier frozen-in shape10 and rare, earlier-formed zircons. This paradigm reconciles existing discrepancies in estimates for the crystallization time of the LMO, and permits formation of the Moon within a few tens of million years of Solar System formation, consistent with dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation11. Remelting of the Moon also explains the lower number of lunar impact basins than expected12,13, and allows metal from planetesimals accreted to the Moon after its formation to be removed to the lunar core, explaining the apparent deficit of such materials in the Moon compared with Earth14. Lunar rock and zircon ages were reset by a remelting event driven by the Moon’s orbital evolution, reconciling existing discrepancies in estimates for the formation time of the Moon and the crystallization time of its magma ocean.",

    "abstract": "Predators have a key role in structuring ecosystems1–4. However, predator loss is accelerating globally4–6, and predator mass-mortality events7 (MMEs)—rapid large-scale die-offs—are now emblematic of the Anthropocene epoch6. Owing to their rare and unpredictable nature7, we lack an understanding of how MMEs immediately impact ecosystems. Past predator-removal studies2,3 may be insufficient to understand the ecological consequences of MMEs because, in nature, dead predators decompose in situ and generate a resource pulse8, which could alter ensuing ecosystem dynamics by temporarily enhancing productivity. Here we experimentally induce MMEs in tritrophic, freshwater lake food webs and report ecological dynamics that are distinct from predator losses2,3 or resource pulses9 alone, but that can be predicted from theory8. MMEs led to the proliferation of diverse consumer and producer communities resulting from weakened top-down predator control1–3 and stronger bottom-up effects through predator decomposition8. In contrast to predator removals alone, enhanced primary production after MMEs dampened the consumer community response. As a consequence, MMEs generated biomass dynamics that were most similar to those of undisturbed systems, indicating that they may be cryptic disturbances in nature. These biomass dynamics led to trophic decoupling, whereby the indirect beneficial effects of predators on primary producers are lost and later materialize as direct bottom-up effects that stimulate primary production amid intensified herbivory. These results reveal ecological signatures of MMEs and demonstrate the feasibility of forecasting novel ecological dynamics arising with intensifying global change. Predator mass-mortality events lead to the proliferation of diverse consumer and producer communities resulting from weakened top-down predator control and stronger bottom-up effects through predator decomposition.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to unveil the structure of the local interstellar medium and its recent star-formation history have spanned the past 70 years (refs. 1–6). Recent studies using precise data from space astrometry missions have revealed nearby, newly formed star clusters with connected origins7–12. Nonetheless, mapping young clusters across the entire sky back to their natal regions has been hindered by a lack of clusters with precise radial-velocity data. Here we show that 155 out of 272 (57%) high-quality young clusters13,14 within 1 kiloparsec of the Sun arise from three distinct spatial volumes. This conclusion is based on the analysis of data from the third Gaia release15 and other large-scale spectroscopic surveys. At present, dispersed throughout the solar neighbourhood, their past positions more than 30 million years ago reveal that these families of clusters each formed in one of three compact, massive star-forming complexes. One of these families includes all of the young clusters near the Sun—the Taurus and Scorpius–Centaurus star-forming complexes16,17. We estimate that more than 200 supernovae were produced from these families and argue that these clustered supernovae produced both the Local Bubble18 and the largest nearby supershell GSH 238+00+09 (ref. 19), both of which are clearly visible in modern three-dimensional dust maps20–22. Analysis of data from Gaia Data Release 3 and other large spectroscopic surveys shows that nearly 60% of high-quality young clusters within 1 kpc of the Sun originated from just three distinct star-forming complexes.",

    "abstract": "Current hypotheses of early tetrapod evolution posit close ecological and biogeographic ties to the extensive coal-producing wetlands of the Carboniferous palaeoequator with rapid replacement of archaic tetrapod groups by relatives of modern amniotes and lissamphibians in the late Carboniferous (about 307 million years ago). These hypotheses draw on a tetrapod fossil record that is almost entirely restricted to palaeoequatorial Pangea (Laurussia)1,2. Here we describe a new giant stem tetrapod, Gaiasia jennyae, from high-palaeolatitude (about 55° S) early Permian-aged (about 280 million years ago) deposits in Namibia that challenges this scenario. Gaiasia is represented by several large, semi-articulated skeletons characterized by a weakly ossified skull with a loosely articulated palate dominated by a broad diamond-shaped parasphenoid, a posteriorly projecting occiput, and enlarged, interlocking dentary and coronoid fangs. Phylogenetic analysis resolves Gaiasia within the tetrapod stem group as the sister taxon of the Carboniferous Colosteidae from Euramerica. Gaiasia is larger than all previously described digited stem tetrapods and provides evidence that continental tetrapods were well established in the cold-temperate latitudes of Gondwana during the final phases of the Carboniferous–Permian deglaciation. This points to a more global distribution of continental tetrapods during the Carboniferous–Permian transition and indicates that previous hypotheses of global tetrapod faunal turnover and dispersal at this time2,3 must be reconsidered. A study describes a new giant stem tetrapod, Gaiasia jennyae, from high-palaeolatitude early Permian-aged deposits in Namibia that challenges current hypotheses of early tetrapod evolution.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule function is modulated by the tubulin code, diverse posttranslational modifications that are altered dynamically by writer and eraser enzymes1. Glutamylation—the addition of branched (isopeptide-linked) glutamate chains—is the most evolutionarily widespread tubulin modification2. It is introduced by tubulin tyrosine ligase-like enzymes and erased by carboxypeptidases of the cytosolic carboxypeptidase (CCP) family1. Glutamylation homeostasis, achieved through the balance of writers and erasers, is critical for normal cell function3–9, and mutations in CCPs lead to human disease10–13. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the glutamylation eraser CCP5 in complex with the microtubule, and X-ray structures in complex with transition-state analogues. Combined with NMR analysis, these analyses show that CCP5 deforms the tubulin main chain into a unique turn that enables lock-and-key recognition of the branch glutamate in a cationic pocket that is unique to CCP family proteins. CCP5 binding of the sequences flanking the branch point primarily through peptide backbone atoms enables processing of diverse tubulin isotypes and non-tubulin substrates. Unexpectedly, CCP5 exhibits inefficient processing of an abundant β-tubulin isotype in the brain. This work provides an atomistic view into glutamate branch recognition and resolution, and sheds light on homeostasis of the tubulin glutamylation syntax. Cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray structures of the glutamylation eraser CCP5 in complexes with glutamylated microtubules and tubulin tails show that the substrate backbone adopts a bent conformation that presents the branch glutamate to a substrate-binding pocket on CCP5.",

    "abstract": "Many powerful tests of the standard model of particle physics and searches for new physics with precision atomic spectroscopy are hindered by our lack of knowledge of nuclear properties. Ideally, these properties may be derived from precise measurements of the most sensitive and theoretically best-understood observables, often found in hydrogen-like systems. Although these measurements are abundant for the electric properties of nuclei, they are scarce for the magnetic properties, and precise experimental results are limited to the lightest of nuclei1–4. Here we focus on 9Be, which offers the unique possibility to use comparisons between different charge states available for high-precision spectroscopy in Penning traps to test theoretical calculations typically obscured by nuclear structure. In particular, we perform high-precision spectroscopy of the 1s hyperfine and Zeeman structure in hydrogen-like 9Be3+. We determine the effective Zemach radius with an uncertainty of 500 ppm, and the bare nuclear magnetic moment with an uncertainty of 0.6 parts per billion— uncertainties unmatched beyond hydrogen. Moreover, we compare our measurements with the measurements conducted on the three-electron charge state 9Be+ (ref. 5), which enables testing the calculation of multi-electron diamagnetic shielding effects of the nuclear magnetic moment at the parts per billion level. Furthermore, we test the quantum electrodynamics methods used for the calculation of the hyperfine splitting. Our results serve as a crucial benchmark for transferring high-precision results of nuclear magnetic properties across different electronic configurations. A high-precision measurement of the shielding effects of multiple electrons on the nuclear magnetic moment is made possible by spectroscopy of hydrogen-like 9Be3+, which overcomes limitations from the nuclear structure.",

    "abstract": "The periosteum is the layer of cells that covers nearly the entire surface of every bone. Upon infection, injury or malignancy the bone surface undergoes new growth—the periosteal reaction—but the mechanism and physiological role of this process remain unknown1,2. Here we show that the periosteal reaction protects against cancer invasion into the bone. Histological analyses of human lesions of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) show that periosteal thickening occurs in proximity to the tumour. We developed a genetically dissectible mouse model of HNSCC and demonstrate that inducible depletion of periosteal cells accelerates cancerous invasion of the bone. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that expression of the gene encoding the protease inhibitor TIMP1 is markedly increased in the periosteum at the pre-invasive stage. This increase is due to upregulation of HIF1α expression in the tumour microenvironment, and increased TIMP1 inactivates matrix-degrading proteases, promoting periosteal thickening to inhibit cancer invasion. Genetic deletion of Timp1 impairs periosteal expansion, exacerbating bone invasion and decreasing survival in tumour-bearing mice. Together, these data show that the periosteal reaction may act as a functional stromal barrier against tumour progression, representing a unique example of tissue immunity mediated by stromal cells. Experiments in mouse models and histology of human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas show that TIMP1-mediated periosteal thickening in proximity to tumours acts as a barrier to cancer invasion of the bone.",

    "abstract": "The ribonuclease FttA (also known as aCPSF and aCPSF1) mediates factor-dependent transcription termination in archaea1–3. Here we report the structure of a Thermococcus kodakarensis transcription pre-termination complex comprising FttA, Spt4, Spt5 and a transcription elongation complex (TEC). The structure shows that FttA interacts with the TEC in a manner that enables RNA to proceed directly from the TEC RNA-exit channel to the FttA catalytic centre and that enables endonucleolytic cleavage of RNA by FttA, followed by 5′→3′ exonucleolytic cleavage of RNA by FttA and concomitant 5′→3′ translocation of FttA on RNA, to apply mechanical force to the TEC and trigger termination. The structure further reveals that Spt5 bridges FttA and the TEC, explaining how Spt5 stimulates FttA-dependent termination. The results reveal functional analogy between bacterial and archaeal factor-dependent termination, functional homology between archaeal and eukaryotic factor-dependent termination, and fundamental mechanistic similarities in factor-dependent termination in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Thermococcus kodakarensis transcription pre-termination complex suggest a mechanism by which the archaeal termination factor FttA applies mechanical force to a transcription elongation complex to trigger termination, and reveal similarities in factor-dependent termination in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "A central feature of meiosis is the pairing of homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes (‘homologues’) along their lengths1–3. Recognition between homologues and their juxtaposition in space is mediated by axis-associated recombination complexes. Also, pairing must occur without entanglements among unrelated chromosomes. Here we examine homologue juxtaposition in real time by four-dimensional fluorescence imaging of tagged chromosomal loci at high spatio-temporal resolution in budding yeast. We discover that corresponding loci come together from a substantial distance (1.8 µm) and complete pairing in a very short time, about 6 min (thus, rapid homologue juxtaposition or RHJ). Homologue loci first move rapidly together (in 30 s, at speeds of roughly 60 nm s−1) into an intermediate stage corresponding to canonical 400 nm axis coalignment. After a short pause, crossover/non-crossover differentiation (crossover interference) mediates a second short, rapid transition that ultimately gives close pairing of axes at 100 nm by means of synaptonemal complex formation. Furthermore, RHJ (1) occurs after chromosomes acquire prophase chromosome organization, (2) is nearly synchronous over thirds of chromosome lengths, but (3) is asynchronous throughout the genome. Finally, cytoskeleton-mediated movement is important for the timing and distance of RHJ onset and for ensuring its normal progression. General implications for local and global aspects of pairing are discussed. Homologue juxtaposition during meiosis is examined in real time by imaging of tagged chromosomal loci at high resolution in budding yeast, showing that corresponding loci come together and complete pairing in a very short time.",

    "abstract": "Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N) deposition affect plant communities in numerous ways1–11. Nitrogen deposition causes local biodiversity loss globally12–14, but whether, and if so how, rising CO2 concentrations amplify or dampen those losses remains unclear and is almost entirely unstudied. We addressed this knowledge gap with an open-air experiment in which 108 grassland plots were grown for 24 years under different CO2 and N regimes. We initially found that adding N reduced plant species richness less at elevated than at ambient CO2. Over time, however, this interaction reversed, and elevated CO2 amplified losses in diversity from enriched N, tripling reductions in species richness from N addition over the last eight years of the study. These interactions resulted from temporal changes in the drivers of diversity, especially light availability, that were in turn driven by CO2 and N inputs and associated changes in plant biomass. This mechanism is likely to be similar in many grasslands, because additions of the plant resources CO2 and N are likely to increase the abundance of the dominant species. If rising CO2 generally exacerbates the widespread negative impacts of N deposition on plant diversity, this bodes poorly for the conservation of grassland biodiversity worldwide. A long-term experiment in grassland communities finds that, over 24 years, enriching nitrogen caused increasingly greater diversity loss when carbon dioxide levels were increased, raising further concerns over the impacts of global environmental change on biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "The brain processes an array of stimuli, enabling the selection of appropriate behavioural responses, but the neural pathways linking interoceptive inputs to outputs for feeding are poorly understood1–3. Here we delineate a subcortical circuit in which brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) directly connect interoceptive inputs to motor centres, controlling food consumption and jaw movements. VMHBDNF neuron inhibition increases food intake by gating motor sequences of feeding through projections to premotor areas of the jaw. When food is unavailable, VMHBDNF inhibition elicits consummatory behaviours directed at inanimate objects such as wooden blocks, and inhibition of perimesencephalic trigeminal area (pMe5) projections evokes rhythmic jaw movements. The activity of these neurons is decreased during food consumption and increases when food is in proximity but not consumed. Activity is also increased in obese animals and after leptin treatment. VMHBDNF neurons receive monosynaptic inputs from both agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and proopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc), and constitutive VMHBDNF activation blocks the orexigenic effect of AgRP activation. These data indicate an Arc → VMHBDNF → pMe5 circuit that senses the energy state of an animal and regulates consummatory behaviours in a state-dependent manner. A subcortical circuit that regulates food consumption in mice is described, involving neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that are directly linked to motor centres that regulate feeding and jaw movements.",

    "abstract": "The ability of stony corals to thrive in the oligotrophic (low-nutrient, low-productivity) surface waters of the tropical ocean is commonly attributed to their symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates1,2. The evolutionary history of this symbiosis might clarify its organismal and environmental roles3, but its prevalence through time, and across taxa, morphologies and oceanic settings, is currently unclear4–6. Here we report measurements of the nitrogen isotope (15N/14N) ratio of coral-bound organic matter (CB-δ15N) in samples from Mid-Devonian reefs (Givetian, around 385 million years ago), which represent a constraint on the evolution of coral photosymbiosis. Colonial tabulate and fasciculate (dendroid) rugose corals have low CB-δ15N values (2.51 ± 0.97‰) in comparison with co-occurring solitary and (pseudo)colonial (cerioid or phaceloid) rugose corals (5.52 ± 1.63‰). The average of the isotopic difference per deposit (3.01 ± 0.58‰) is statistically indistinguishable from that observed between modern symbiont-barren and symbiont-bearing corals (3.38 ± 1.05‰). On the basis of this evidence, we infer that Mid-Devonian tabulate and some fasciculate (dendroid) rugose corals hosted active photosymbionts, while solitary and some (pseudo)colonial (cerioid or phaceloid) rugose corals did not. The low CB-δ15N values of the Devonian tabulate and fasciculate rugose corals relative to the modern range suggest that Mid-Devonian reefs formed in biogeochemical regimes analogous to the modern oligotrophic subtropical gyres. Widespread oligotrophy during the Devonian may have promoted coral photosymbiosis, the occurrence of which may explain why Devonian reefs were the most productive reef ecosystems of the Phanerozoic. Nitrogen isotope evidence of Mid-Devonian photosymbiotic associations in certain types of corals suggests that autotrophic and heterotrophic corals co-existed on extinct reefs, as today, but in warmer oceans, indicating the current warming rate, not temperature, is causing coral bleaching.",

    "abstract": "Radioactive nuclei with lifetimes on the order of millions of years can reveal the formation history of the Sun and active nucleosynthesis occurring at the time and place of its birth1,2. Among such nuclei whose decay signatures are found in the oldest meteorites, 205Pb is a powerful example, as it is produced exclusively by slow neutron captures (the s process), with most being synthesized in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars3–5. However, making accurate abundance predictions for 205Pb has so far been impossible because the weak decay rates of 205Pb and 205Tl are very uncertain at stellar temperatures6,7. To constrain these decay rates, we measured for the first time the bound-state β− decay of fully ionized 205Tl81+, an exotic decay mode that only occurs in highly charged ions. The measured half-life is 4.7 times longer than the previous theoretical estimate8 and our 10% experimental uncertainty has eliminated the main nuclear-physics limitation. With new, experimentally backed decay rates, we used AGB stellar models to calculate 205Pb yields. Propagating those yields with basic galactic chemical evolution (GCE) and comparing with the 205Pb/204Pb ratio from meteorites9–11, we determined the isolation time of solar material inside its parent molecular cloud. We find positive isolation times that are consistent with the other s-process short-lived radioactive nuclei found in the early Solar System. Our results reaffirm the site of the Sun’s birth as a long-lived, giant molecular cloud and support the use of the 205Pb–205Tl decay system as a chronometer in the early Solar System. Measurement of the bound-state β− decay of 205Tl81+ gives a new, longer half-life, allowing for the calculation of accurate stellar 205Pb yields and the isolation time of the early Solar System.",

    "abstract": "Motor skill repertoire can be stably retained over long periods, but the neural mechanism that underlies stable memory storage remains poorly understood1–8. Moreover, it is unknown how existing motor memories are maintained as new motor skills are continuously acquired. Here we tracked neural representation of learned actions throughout a significant portion of the lifespan of a mouse and show that learned actions are stably retained in combination with context, which protects existing memories from erasure during new motor learning. We established a continual learning paradigm in which mice learned to perform directional licking in different task contexts while we tracked motor cortex activity for up to six months using two-photon imaging. Within the same task context, activity driving directional licking was stable over time with little representational drift. When learning new task contexts, new preparatory activity emerged to drive the same licking actions. Learning created parallel new motor memories instead of modifying existing representations. Re-learning to make the same actions in the previous task context re-activated the previous preparatory activity, even months later. Continual learning of new task contexts kept creating new preparatory activity patterns. Context-specific memories, as we observed in the motor system, may provide a solution for stable memory storage throughout continual learning. Long-term tracking of learned actions in mouse motor cortex shows that learned actions are retained with their context, and learning new tasks creates new memories, which do not overwrite or modify existing representations.",

    "abstract": "The response of breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies substantially, even when tumours belong to the same molecular or histological subtype1. Here we identify the oestrous cycle as an important contributor to this heterogeneity. In three mouse models of breast cancer, we show reduced responses to NAC when treatment is initiated during the dioestrus stage, when compared with initiation during the oestrus stage. Similar findings were observed in retrospective premenopausal cohorts of human patients. Mechanistically, the dioestrus stage exhibits systemic and localized changes, including (1) an increased number of cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition linked to chemoresistance2–4 and (2) decreased tumour vessel diameter, suggesting potential constraints to drug sensitivity and delivery. In addition, an elevated presence of macrophages, previously associated with chemoresistance induction5, characterizes the dioestrus phase. Whereas NAC disrupts the oestrous cycle, this elevated macrophage prevalence persists and depletion of macrophages mitigates the reduced therapy response observed when initiating treatment during dioestrus. Our data collectively demonstrate the oestrous cycle as a crucial infradian rhythm determining chemosensitivity, warranting future clinical studies to exploit optimal treatment initiation timing for enhanced chemotherapy outcomes. In three mouse models of breast cancer, we show reduced responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy when treatment is initiated during the dioestrus stage, when compared with initiation during the oestrus stage.",

    "abstract": "Asteroid discoveries are essential for planetary-defence efforts aiming to prevent impacts with Earth1, including the more frequent2 megaton explosions from decametre impactors3–6. Although large asteroids (≥100 kilometres) have remained in the main belt since their formation7, small asteroids are commonly transported to the near-Earth object (NEO) population8,9. However, owing to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size–frequency distribution (SFD)—which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth—varies substantially among models10–14. Here we report 138 detections of some of the smallest asteroids (≳10 metres) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST’s infrared capabilities covering the emission peaks of the asteroids15 and synthetic tracking techniques16–18. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the distances and phase angles of the objects using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes through radiometric techniques. Their SFD shows a break at about 100 metres (debiased cumulative slopes of q = −2.66 ± 0.60 and −0.97 ± 0.14 for diameters smaller and larger than roughly 100 metres, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from several asteroid families—most probably Nysa, Polana and Massalia—according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through further long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decametre-scale asteroids across the sky, examining individual asteroid families19 and the source regions of meteorites13,14 ‘in situ’. Combining the infrared capabilities of JWST and synthetic tracking techniques, the detection of some of the smallest asteroids ever observed in the main belt is reported; their large abundance reveals a population driven by collisional cascade.",

    "abstract": "The automated synthesis of small organic molecules from modular building blocks has the potential to transform our capacity to create medicines and materials1–3. Disruptive acceleration of this molecule-building strategy broadly unlocks its functional potential and requires the integration of many new assembly chemistries. Although recent advances in high-throughput chemistry4–6 can speed up the development of appropriate synthetic methods, for example, in selecting appropriate chemical reaction conditions from the vast range of potential options, equivalent high-throughput analytical methods are needed. Here we report a streamlined approach for the rapid, quantitative analysis of chemical reactions by mass spectrometry. The intrinsic fragmentation features of chemical building blocks generalize the analyses of chemical reactions, allowing sub-second readouts of reaction outcomes. Central to this advance was identifying that starting material fragmentation patterns function as universal barcodes for downstream product analysis by mass spectrometry. Combining these features with acoustic droplet ejection mass spectrometry7,8 we could eliminate slow chromatographic steps and continuously evaluate chemical reactions in multiplexed formats. This enabled the assignment of reaction conditions to molecules derived from ultrahigh-throughput chemical synthesis experiments. More generally, these results indicate that fragmentation features inherent to chemical synthesis can empower rapid data-rich experimentation. Mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns define analytical barcodes for the rapid, quantitative analysis of high-throughput chemical synthesis experiments.",

The continuing Fagradalsfjall and Sundhnúkur fires on Iceland’s Reykjanes Peninsula, beginning in 2021, enable such an approach5,6. Earliest lavas of this volcanic episode have been interpreted to exclusively reflect a change from shallow to deeper mantle source processes7. Here we show using osmium (Os) isotopes that the 2021 Fagradalsfjall lavas are both fractionally crystallized and strongly crustally contaminated, probably by mid-ocean-ridge gabbros and older basalts underlying the Reykjanes Peninsula. Earliest eruptive products (187Os/188Os ≤ 0.188, platinum (Pt)/iridium (Ir) ≤ 76) are highly anomalous for Icelandic lavas or global oceanic basalts and Os isotope ratios remain elevated throughout the 2021 eruption, indicating a continued but diluted presence of contaminants. The 2022 lavas show no evidence for contamination (187Os/188Os = 0.131, Pt/Ir = 30), being typical of Icelandic basalts (0.132 ± 0.007). Initiation of the Fagradalsfjall Fires in 2021 involved pre-eruptive stalling, fractional crystallization and crustal assimilation of earliest lavas. An established magmatic conduit system in 2022 enabled efficient magma transit to the surface without crustal assimilation. Using osmium isotopes, the 2021 Fagradalsfjall lavas in Iceland are shown to be both fractionally crystallized and strongly crustally contaminated, probably by mid-ocean-ridge gabbros and older basalts underlying the Reykjanes Peninsula.",

    "abstract": "The Cambrian radiation of euarthropods can be attributed to an adaptable body plan. Sophisticated brains and specialized feeding appendages, which are elaborations of serially repeated organ systems and jointed appendages, underpin the dominance of Euarthropoda in a broad suite of ecological settings. The origin of the euarthropod body plan from a grade of vermiform taxa with hydrostatic lobopodous appendages (‘lobopodian worms’)1,2 is founded on data from Burgess Shale-type fossils. However, the compaction associated with such preservation obscures internal anatomy3–6. Phosphatized microfossils provide a complementary three-dimensional perspective on early crown group euarthropods7, but few lobopodians8,9. Here we describe the internal and external anatomy of a three-dimensionally preserved euarthropod larva with lobopods, midgut glands and a sophisticated head. The architecture of the nervous system informs the early configuration of the euarthropod brain and its associated appendages and sensory organs, clarifying homologies across Panarthropoda. The deep evolutionary position of Youti yuanshi gen. et sp. nov. informs the sequence of character acquisition during arthropod evolution, demonstrating a deep origin of sophisticated haemolymph circulatory systems, and illuminating the internal anatomical changes that propelled the rise and diversification of this enduringly successful group. Youti yuanshi is a euarthropod species newly described from a fossilized larva from Yunnan Province, China dating approximately to late Atdabanian stage, Cambrian period, and provides insights into the evolution of arthropods.",

    "abstract": "After injury, mammalian spinal cords develop scars to confine the lesion and prevent further damage. However, excessive scarring can hinder neural regeneration and functional recovery1,2. These competing actions underscore the importance of developing therapeutic strategies to dynamically modulate scar progression. Previous research on scarring has primarily focused on astrocytes, but recent evidence has suggested that ependymal cells also participate. Ependymal cells normally form the epithelial layer encasing the central canal, but they undergo massive proliferation and differentiation into astroglia following certain injuries, becoming a core scar component3–7. However, the mechanisms regulating ependymal proliferation in vivo remain unclear. Here we uncover an endogenous κ-opioid signalling pathway that controls ependymal proliferation. Specifically, we detect expression of the κ-opioid receptor, OPRK1, in a functionally under-characterized cell type known as cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neuron (CSF-cN). We also discover a neighbouring cell population that expresses the cognate ligand prodynorphin (PDYN). Whereas κ-opioids are typically considered inhibitory, they excite CSF-cNs to inhibit ependymal proliferation. Systemic administration of a κ-antagonist enhances ependymal proliferation in uninjured spinal cords in a CSF-cN-dependent manner. Moreover, a κ-agonist impairs ependymal proliferation, scar formation and motor function following injury. Together, our data suggest a paracrine signalling pathway in which PDYN+ cells tonically release κ-opioids to stimulate CSF-cNs and suppress ependymal proliferation, revealing an endogenous mechanism and potential pharmacological strategy for modulating scarring after spinal cord injury. Paracrine κ-opioid signalling among cells surrounding the spinal cord central canal modulates scar formation after injury.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of the load-bearing dentary–squamosal jaw joint was a key step in mammalian evolution1–5. Although this innovation has received decades of study, questions remain over when and how frequently a mammalian-like skull–jaw contact evolved, hindered by a paucity of three-dimensional data spanning the non-mammaliaform cynodont–mammaliaform transition. New discoveries of derived non-mammaliaform probainognathian cynodonts from South America have much to offer to this discussion. Here, to address this issue, we used micro-computed-tomography scanning to reconstruct the jaw joint anatomy of three key probainognathian cynodonts: Brasilodon quadrangularis, the sister taxon to Mammaliaformes6–8, the tritheledontid-related Riograndia guaibensis9 and the tritylodontid Oligokyphus major. We find homoplastic evolution in the jaw joint in the approach to mammaliaforms, with ictidosaurs (Riograndia plus tritheledontids) independently evolving a dentary–squamosal contact approximately 17 million years before this character first appears in mammaliaforms of the Late Triassic period10–12. Brasilodon, contrary to previous descriptions6–8, lacks an incipient dentary condyle and squamosal glenoid and the jaws articulate solely using a plesiomorphic quadrate–articular joint. We postulate that the jaw joint underwent marked evolutionary changes in probainognathian cynodonts. Some probainognathian clades independently acquired ‘double’ craniomandibular contacts, with mammaliaforms attaining a fully independent dentary–squamosal articulation with a conspicuous dentary condyle and squamosal glenoid in the Late Triassic. The dentary–squamosal contact, which is traditionally considered to be a typical mammalian feature, therefore evolved more than once and is more evolutionary labile than previously considered. The dentary–squamosal contact, traditionally considered to be a typical mammalian feature, evolved more than once and is more evolutionary labile than previously considered.",

    "abstract": "The western boundary currents are characterized by narrow, intense ocean jets and are among the most energetic phenomena in the world ocean. The importance of the western boundary currents to the mean climate is well established: they transport vast quantities of heat from the subtropics to the midlatitudes1, and they govern the structure of the climatological mean surface winds2–6, precipitation4–6 and extratropical storm tracks7–13. Their importance to climate variability is much less clear, as the tropospheric response to extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability is generally modest relative to the internal variability in the midlatitude atmosphere12–14. Here we exploit novel local analyses based on high-spatial-resolution data to demonstrate that SST variability in the western boundary currents has a more robust signature in climate variability than has been indicated in previous work. Our results indicate that warm SST anomalies in the major boundary currents of both hemispheres are associated with a distinct signature of locally enhanced precipitation and rising motion anomalies that extend throughout the depth of the troposphere. The tropospheric signature closely mirrors that of ocean dynamical processes in the boundary currents. Thus, the findings indicate a distinct and robust pathway through which extratropical ocean dynamical processes influence local climate variability. The observational relationships are also reproducible in Earth system model simulations but only when the simulations are run at high spatial resolution. Analyses based on high-spatial-resolution data demonstrate that sea surface temperature variability in the western boundary currents has a more robust signature in local climate variability than previously indicated.",

Yet, despite this region having a large influence on the subsequent development of Europe and Asia, questions remain regarding its hunter-gatherer past and its formation of expansionist mobile steppe societies3–5. Here we present new genome-wide data for 131 individuals from 38 archaeological sites spanning 6,000 years. We find a strong genetic differentiation between populations north and south of the Caucasus mountains during the Mesolithic, with Eastern hunter-gatherer ancestry4,6 in the north, and a distinct Caucasus hunter-gatherer ancestry7 with increasing East Anatolian farmer admixture in the south. During the subsequent Eneolithic period, we observe the formation of the characteristic West Eurasian steppe ancestry and heightened interaction between the mountain and steppe regions, facilitated by technological developments of the Maykop cultural complex8. By contrast, the peak of pastoralist activities and territorial expansions during the Early and Middle Bronze Age is characterized by long-term genetic stability. The Late Bronze Age marks another period of gene flow from multiple distinct sources that coincides with a decline of steppe cultures, followed by a transformation and absorption of the steppe ancestry into highland populations. A study presents archaeogenomic data for 131 individuals from 38 sites spanning 6,000 years, and details the demographic processes of the Caucasus and the surrounding steppe zone throughout the Bronze Age.",

    "abstract": "Transposases drive chromosomal rearrangements and the dissemination of drug-resistance genes and toxins1–3. Although some transposases act alone, many rely on dedicated AAA+ ATPase subunits that regulate site selectivity and catalytic function through poorly understood mechanisms. Using IS21 as a model transposase system, we show how an ATPase regulator uses nucleotide-controlled assembly and DNA deformation to enable structure-based site selectivity, transposase recruitment, and activation and integration. Solution and cryogenic electron microscopy studies show that the IstB ATPase self-assembles into an autoinhibited pentamer of dimers that tightly curves target DNA into a half-coil. Two of these decamers dimerize, which stabilizes the target nucleic acid into a kinked S-shaped configuration that engages the IstA transposase at the interface between the two IstB oligomers to form an approximately 1 MDa transpososome complex. Specific interactions stimulate regulator ATPase activity and trigger a large conformational change on the transposase that positions the catalytic site to perform DNA strand transfer. These studies help explain how AAA+ ATPase regulators—which are used by classical transposition systems such as Tn7, Mu and CRISPR-associated elements—can remodel their substrate DNA and cognate transposases to promote function. Solution and cryogenic electron microscopy studies using IS21 as a model transposase system show how AAA+ ATPases induce structural changes to prime target DNA and activate their associated transposases.",

    "abstract": "Numerous correlated many-body phases, both conventional and exotic, have been reported in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)1–24. However, the dynamics associated with these correlated states, crucial for understanding the underlying physics, remain unexplored. Here we combine exciton sensing and optical pump–probe spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of isospin orders in MATBG with WSe2 substrate across the entire flat band, achieving sub-picosecond resolution. We observe remarkably slow isospin dynamics in a broad filling range around ν = 2 and between ν = −3 and −2, with lifetimes of up to 300 ps that decouple from the much faster cooling of electronic temperature (about 10 ps). This non-thermal behaviour demonstrates the presence of abnormally long-lived modes in the isospin degrees of freedom. This observation, not anticipated by theory, implies the existence of long-range propagating collective modes, strong isospin fluctuations and memory effects and is probably associated with an intervalley coherent or incommensurate Kekulé spiral ground state. We further demonstrate non-equilibrium control of the isospin orders previously found around integer fillings. Specifically, through ultrafast manipulation, it can be transiently shifted away from integer fillings. Our study demonstrates a unique probe of collective excitations in MATBG and paves the way for actively controlling non-equilibrium phenomena in moiré systems. A combination of exciton sensing and optical pump–probe spectroscopy is used to investigate the dynamics of isospin orders in MATBG with WSe2 substrate across the entire flat band, achieving sub-picosecond resolution.",

    "abstract": "Parasitoid wasps are exceptionally diverse and use specialized adaptations capable of manipulating the physiology and behaviour of host organisms1. In more than two centuries since the first records of Drosophila-parasitizing wasps, nearly 200 described and provisional parasitoid species of drosophilids have been identified2. These include endoparasitoids and ectoparasitoids, as well as species attacking larval and pupal hosts3. Despite a deep history of research attention and remarkable biodiversity, a wasp species that attacks and develops inside the adult stage of a fly host has not been described previously. Here we report the discovery of a wasp species that infects the adult stage of fruit flies in the genus Drosophila, including one of the most deeply studied model organisms in biology, Drosophila melanogaster. Notably, this wasp can be easily collected from backyard fly baits and has a broad geographic distribution throughout the eastern USA. We document its life history and unique host interactions, including egg-laying into and larval emergence from adult flies, and provide protocols to raise wasps from wild-caught host flies. Our results emphasize the need for ongoing research investment in insect biodiversity and systematics. As parasitoid research continues to uncover unusual biology and supports fundamental mechanistic insights into immunity4, metabolism5, ecology6, evolution7–9 and behaviour10–12, we anticipate that this wasp’s association with the laboratory model organism, D. melanogaster, will provide new research opportunities across the life sciences. A study reports the discovery of a parasitoid wasp species that uses the adult stage of Drosophila fruit flies as its host.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between planets and stellar winds can lead to atmospheric loss and is, thus, important for the evolution of planetary atmospheres1. The planets in our Solar System typically interact with the solar wind, whose velocity is at a large angle to the embedded stellar magnetic field. For planets without an intrinsic magnetic field, this interaction creates an induced magnetosphere and a bow shock in front of the planet2. However, when the angle between the solar wind velocity and the solar wind magnetic field (cone angle) is small, the interaction is very different3. Here we show that when the cone angle is small at Mars, the induced magnetosphere degenerates. There is no shock on the dayside, only weak flank shocks. A cross-flow plume appears and the ambipolar field drives planetary ions upstream. Hybrid simulations with a 4° cone angle show agreement with observations by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission4 and Mars Express5. Degenerate, induced magnetospheres are complex and not yet explored objects. It remains to be studied what the secondary effects are on processes like atmospheric loss through ion escape. When the cone angle between the solar wind velocity and the solar wind magnetic field is small at Mars, the induced magnetosphere degenerates.",

    "abstract": "Reputations are critical to human societies, as individuals are treated differently based on their social standing1,2. For instance, those who garner a good reputation by helping others are more likely to be rewarded by third parties3–5. Achieving widespread cooperation in this way requires that reputations accurately reflect behaviour6 and that individuals agree about each other’s standings7. With few exceptions8–10, theoretical work has assumed that information is limited, which hinders consensus7,11 unless there are mechanisms to enforce agreement, such as empathy12, gossip13–15 or public institutions16. Such mechanisms face challenges in a world where empathy, effective communication and institutional trust are compromised17–19. However, information about others is now abundant and readily available, particularly through social media. Here we demonstrate that assigning private reputations by aggregating several observations of an individual can accurately capture behaviour, foster emergent agreement without enforcement mechanisms and maintain cooperation, provided individuals exhibit some tolerance for bad actions. This finding holds for both first- and second-order norms of judgement and is robust even when norms vary within a population. When the aggregation rule itself can evolve, selection indeed favours the use of several observations and tolerant judgements. Nonetheless, even when information is freely accessible, individuals do not typically evolve to use all of it. This method of assessing reputations—‘look twice, forgive once’, in a nutshell—is simple enough to have arisen early in human culture and powerful enough to persist as a fundamental component of social heuristics. In an information-abundant landscape, people can accurately judge the reputations of others by researching only a fraction of the available information while forgiving some instances of bad behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a newly discovered class of extragalactic radio transients characterized by their high energy and short duration (from microseconds to milliseconds)1. The physical origin of these FRBs remains unknown and is a subject of ongoing research, with magnetars emerging as leading candidates2,3. Previous studies have used various methodologies to address the problem of FRB origin, including demographic analyses of FRB host galaxies and their local environments4–6, assessments of FRB rate evolution with redshift7–9 and searches for proposed multi-messenger FRB counterparts10. However, these studies are susceptible to substantial biases stemming from unaccounted radio and optical selection effects. Here we present empirical evidence for a substantial selection bias against detecting FRBs in galaxies with large inclination angles (edge-on) using a sample of hosts identified for FRBs discovered by untargeted surveys. This inclination-related bias probably leads to a significant underestimation (by about a factor of two) of the FRB rates reported in the literature and disfavours globular clusters as the dominant origin of FRB sources, as previously speculated6. These conclusions have important implications for FRB progenitor models and targeted FRB follow-up strategies. We further investigate the impact of this bias on the relative rate of FRBs in different host environments. Our analysis suggests that scattering in FRB hosts is probably responsible for the observed bias11,12. However, a larger sample of localized FRBs is required to robustly quantify the contribution of scattering to the inclination-related selection bias. The chances of detecting fast radio bursts from a galaxy may be affected by its inclination angle, showing a potential selection bias in determining the sources of the bursts.",

    "abstract": "Most stars in today’s Universe reside within spheroids, which are bulges of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies1,2. Their formation is still an unsolved problem3–5. Infrared/submillimetre-bright galaxies at high redshifts6 have long been suspected to be related to spheroid formation7–12. Proving this connection has been hampered so far by heavy dust obscuration when focusing on their stellar emission13–15 or by methodologies and limited signal-to-noise ratios when looking at submillimetre wavelengths16,17. Here we show that spheroids are directly generated by star formation within the cores of highly luminous starburst galaxies in the distant Universe. This follows from the ALMA submillimetre surface brightness profiles, which deviate substantially from those of exponential disks, and from the skewed-high axis-ratio distribution. Most of these galaxies are fully triaxial rather than flat disks: the ratio of the shortest to the longest of their three axes is half, on average, and increases with spatial compactness. These observations, supported by simulations, reveal a cosmologically relevant pathway for in situ spheroid formation through starbursts that is probably preferentially triggered by interactions (and mergers) acting on galaxies fed by non-coplanar gas accretion streams. Deep ALMA archival observations of submillimetre-bright galaxies at high redshifts show that spheroidal bulges formed much earlier than expected and are directly generated by star formation within the cores of highly luminous starburst galaxies.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting leading to premature mortality1,2. Discovery of the DMD gene encoding dystrophin both revealed the cause of DMD and helped identify a family of at least ten dystrophin-associated proteins at the muscle cell membrane, collectively forming the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC)3–9. The DGC links the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, but, despite its importance, its molecular architecture has remained elusive. Here we determined the native cryo-electron microscopy structure of rabbit DGC and conducted biochemical analyses to reveal its intricate molecular configuration. An unexpected β-helix comprising β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan forms an extracellular platform that interacts with α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan and α-sarcoglycan, allowing α-dystroglycan to contact the extracellular matrix. In the membrane, sarcospan anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, while in the cytoplasm, β-dystroglycan’s juxtamembrane fragment binds dystrophin’s ZZ domain. Through these interactions, the DGC links laminin 2 to intracellular actin. Additionally, dystrophin’s WW domain, along with its EF-hand 1 domain, interacts with α-dystrobrevin. A disease-causing mutation mapping to the WW domain weakens this interaction, as confirmed by deletion of the WW domain in biochemical assays. Our findings rationalize more than 110 mutations affecting single residues associated with various muscular dystrophy subtypes and contribute to ongoing therapeutic developments, including protein restoration, upregulation of compensatory genes and gene replacement. The detailed structure of the native dystrophin–glycoprotein complex provides mechanistic insights into mutations underlying muscular dystrophy.",

    "abstract": "Human treponemal infections are caused by a family of closely related Treponema pallidum that give rise to the diseases yaws, bejel, pinta and, most notably, syphilis1. Debates on a common origin for these pathogens and the history of syphilis itself have weighed evidence for the ‘Columbian hypothesis’2, which argues for an American origin, against that for the ‘pre-Columbian hypothesis’3, which argues for the presence of the disease in Eurasia in the Medieval period and possibly earlier. Although molecular data has provided a genetic basis for distinction of the typed subspecies4, deep evolution of the complex has remained unresolved owing to limitations in the conclusions that can be drawn from the sparse palaeogenomic data that are currently available. Here we explore this evolutionary history through analyses of five pre- and peri-contact ancient treponemal genomes from the Americas that represent ancient relatives of the T. pallidum subsp. pallidum (syphilis), T. pallidum subsp. pertenue (yaws) and T. pallidum subsp. endemicum (bejel) lineages. Our data indicate unexplored diversity and an emergence of T. pallidum that post-dates human occupation in the Americas. Together, these results support an American origin for all T. pallidum characterized at the genomic level, both modern and ancient. Analyses of five treponemal genomes representing ancient relatives of Treponema pallidum suggest that this pathogen originated in the Americas.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of a complex molecule begins from an initial design stage1–4 in which possible routes are triaged by strategy and feasibility, on the basis of analogy to similar reactions2,3. However, as molecular complexity increases, predictability decreases5; inevitably, even experienced chemists resort to trial and error to identify viable intermediates en route to the target molecule. We encountered such a problem in the synthesis of picrotoxane sesquiterpenes in which pattern-recognition methods anticipated success, but small variations in structure led to failure. Here, to solve this problem but avoid tedious guess-and-check experimentation, we built a virtual library of elusive late-stage intermediate analogues that were triaged by reactivity and altered the synthesis pathway. The efficiency of this method led to concise routes to 25 naturally occurring picrotoxanes. Costly density-functional-theory transition-state calculations were replaced with faster reactant parameterizations to increase scalability and, in this case, inform the mechanism. This approach can serve as an add-on search to human or computer-assisted synthesis planning applicable to high-complexity targets and/or steps with little representation in the literature or reaction databases. Concise routes to 25 naturally occurring picrotoxanes were devised using a virtual library of intermediate analogues triaged by reactivity; this approach can overcome challenges in the use of computers for synthesis design.",

    "abstract": "Planetary magnetic fields provide a window into the otherwise largely inaccessible dynamics of a planet’s deep interior. In particular, interaction between fluid flow in electrically conducting interior regions and the magnetic field there gives rise to observable secular variation (time dependency) of the externally observed magnetic field. Secular variation of Jupiter’s field has recently been revealed1–3 and been shown to arise, in part, from an axisymmetric, equatorial jet2. Whether this jet is time dependent has not previously been addressed, yet it is of critical importance for understanding the dynamics of the planet’s interior. If steady, it would probably be a manifestation of deep dynamo convective flow (and jets are anticipated as part of that flow4–9) but if time dependent on a timescale much shorter than the convective turnover timescale of several hundred years, it would probably have a different origin. Here we show that the jet has a wavelike fluctuation with a period of roughly 4 years, strongly suggestive of the presence of a torsional oscillation10 (a cylindrically symmetric oscillating flow about the rotation axis) or a localized Alfvén wave in Jupiter’s metallic hydrogen interior. This opens a pathway towards revealing otherwise hidden aspects of the magnetic field within the metallic hydrogen region and hence constraining the dynamo that generates Jupiter’s magnetic field. An axisymmetric, equatorial jet in Jupiter’s interior has a wavelike fluctuation with a 4-year period, revealing hidden aspects of the magnetic field within the metallic hydrogen region and constraining the dynamo that generates the magnetic field.",

    "abstract": "Entanglement has evolved from an enigmatic concept of quantum physics to a key ingredient of quantum technology. It explains correlations between measurement outcomes that contradict classical physics and has been widely explored with small sets of individual qubits. Multi-partite entangled states build up in gate-based quantum-computing protocols and—from a broader perspective—were proposed as the main resource for measurement-based quantum-information processing1,2. The latter requires the ex-ante generation of a multi-qubit entangled state described by a graph3–6. Small graph states such as Bell or linear cluster states have been produced with photons7–16, but the proposed quantum-computing and quantum-networking applications require fusion of such states into larger and more powerful states in a programmable fashion17–21. Here we achieve this goal by using an optical resonator22 containing two individually addressable atoms23,24. Ring25 and tree26 graph states with up to eight qubits, with the names reflecting the entanglement topology, are efficiently fused from the photonic states emitted by the individual atoms. The fusion process itself uses a cavity-assisted gate between the two atoms. Our technique is, in principle, scalable to even larger numbers of qubits and is the decisive step towards, for instance, a memory-less quantum repeater in a future quantum internet27–29. Using an optical resonator containing two individually addressable atoms in a single cavity, fusion of deterministically generated photonic graph states to create ring and tree graph states with up to eight qubits is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "The basal plane of graphene can function as a selective barrier that is permeable to protons1,2 but impermeable to all ions3,4 and gases5,6, stimulating its use in applications such as membranes1,2,7,8, catalysis9,10 and isotope separation11,12. Protons can chemically adsorb on graphene and hydrogenate it13,14, inducing a conductor–insulator transition that has been explored intensively in graphene electronic devices13–17. However, both processes face energy barriers1,12,18 and various strategies have been proposed to accelerate proton transport, for example by introducing vacancies4,7,8, incorporating catalytic metals1,19 or chemically functionalizing the lattice18,20. But these techniques can compromise other properties, such as ion selectivity21,22 or mechanical stability23. Here we show that independent control of the electric field, E, at around 1 V nm−1, and charge-carrier density, n, at around 1 × 1014 cm−2, in double-gated graphene allows the decoupling of proton transport from lattice hydrogenation and can thereby accelerate proton transport such that it approaches the limiting electrolyte current for our devices. Proton transport and hydrogenation can be driven selectively with precision and robustness, enabling proton-based logic and memory graphene devices that have on–off ratios spanning orders of magnitude. Our results show that field effects can accelerate and decouple electrochemical processes in double-gated 2D crystals and demonstrate the possibility of mapping such processes as a function of E and n, which is a new technique for the study of 2D electrode–electrolyte interfaces. Independent control of the electric field and charge-carrier density in double-gated graphene allows the decoupling of proton transport and lattice hydrogenation, enabling both accelerated proton transport and proton-based logic operations.",

    "abstract": "Low-latitude (LL) oceans account for up to half of global net primary production and export1–5. It has been argued that the Southern Ocean dominates LL primary production and export6, with implications for the response of global primary production and export to climate change7. Here we applied observational analyses and sensitivity studies to an individual model to show, instead, that 72% of LL primary production and 55% of export is controlled by local mesopelagic macronutrient cycling. A total of 34% of the LL export is sustained by preformed macronutrients supplied from the Southern Ocean via a deeper overturning cell, with a shallow preformed northward supply, crossing 30° S through subpolar and thermocline water masses, sustaining only 7% of the LL export. Analyses of five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, run under both high-emissions low-mitigation (shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP5-8.5)) and low-emissions high-mitigation (SSP1-2.6) climate scenarios for 1850–2300, revealed significant across-model disparities in their projections of not only the amplitude, but also the sign, of LL primary production. Under the stronger SSP5-8.5 forcing, with more substantial upper-ocean warming, the CMIP6 models that account for temperature-dependent remineralization promoted enhanced LL mesopelagic nutrient retention under warming, with this providing a first-order contribution to stabilizing or increasing, rather than decreasing, LL production under high emissions and low mitigation. This underscores the importance of a mechanistic understanding of mesopelagic remineralization and its sensitivity to ocean warming for predicting future ecosystem changes. To facilitate more accurate long-term projections of primary production and export over oceanic low latitudes (LLs), we identified the first-order importance of the temperature dependence of remineralization of the LL nutrient reservoir, with this serving to enhance LL mesopelagic retention under warming.",

    "abstract": "Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) are historical intervals of global-scale ocean deoxygenation associated with hyperthermal climate states and biological crises1,2. Massive volcanic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions frequently associated with these events are thought to be a common driver of ocean deoxygenation through several climate-warming-related mechanisms1,3,4. The Early Cretaceous OAE1a is one of the most intense ocean deoxygenation events, persisting for more than 1 Myr (refs. 5,6). However, existing records of marine chemistry and climate across OAE1a are insufficient to fully resolve the timing and dynamics of the underlying processes, thus obscuring cause-and-effect relationships between climate forcing and ocean oxygenation states. Here we show that rapid ocean deoxygenation during OAE1a is linked to volcanic CO2 emissions and the crossing of an associated climate threshold, after which the sluggish pace of the silicate-weathering feedback and climate recovery delayed reoxygenation for >1 Myr. At the end of OAE1a, recrossing this threshold allowed for ocean reoxygenation. Following OAE1a, however, the Earth system remained sufficiently warm such that orbitally forced climate dynamics led to continued cyclic ocean deoxygenation on approximately 100-kyr timescales for another 1 Myr. Our results thus imply a tight coupling between volcanism, weathering and ocean oxygen content that is characterized by a climate threshold. Rapid ocean deoxygenation during the Early Cretaceous OAE1a is shown to provide evidence for a strong link between volcanic CO2 emissions, weathering and ocean oxygen content that is characterized by a climate threshold.",

    "abstract": "The transport of energy through convection is important during many stages of stellar evolution1,2, and is best studied in our Sun3 or giant evolved stars4. Features that are attributed to convection are found on the surface of massive red supergiant stars5–8. Also for lower-mass evolved stars, indications of convection are found9–13, but convective timescales and sizes remain poorly constrained. Models indicate that convective motions are crucial to produce strong winds that return the products of stellar nucleosynthesis into the interstellar medium14. Here we report a series of reconstructed interferometric images of the surface of the evolved giant star R Doradus. The images reveal a stellar disk with prominent small-scale features that provide the structure and motions of convection on the stellar surface. We find that the dominant structure size of the features on the stellar disk is 0.72 ± 0.05 astronomical units. We measure the velocity of the surface motions to vary between −18 and +20 km s−1, which means that the convective timescale is approximately one month. This indicates a possible difference between the convection properties of low-mass and high-mass evolved stars. Presenting a series of interferometric images of R Doradus, this study reveals prominent convective structures on the surface of this giant evolved star that have a timescale of about one month.",

    "abstract": "The movement of large amounts of nutrients by migrating animals has ecological benefits for recipient food webs1,2 that may be offset by co-transported contaminants3,4. Salmon spawning migrations are archetypal of this process, carrying marine-derived materials to inland ecosystems where they stimulate local productivity but also enhance contaminant exposure5–7. Pacific salmon abundance and biomass are higher now than in the last century, reflecting substantial shifts in community structure8 that probably altered nutrient versus contaminant delivery. Here we combined nutrient and contaminant concentrations with 40 years of annual Pacific salmon returns to quantify how changes in community structure influenced marine to freshwater inputs to western North America. Salmon transported tonnes of nutrients and kilograms of contaminants to freshwaters annually. Higher salmon returns (1976–2015) increased salmon-derived nutrient and contaminant inputs by 30% and 20%, respectively. These increases were dominated by pink salmon, which are short-lived, feed lower in marine food webs than other salmon species, and had the highest nutrient-to-contaminant ratios. As a result, the delivery of nutrients increased at a greater rate than the delivery of contaminants, and salmon inputs became more ecologically beneficial over time. Even still, contaminant loadings may represent exposure concerns for some salmon predators. The Pacific salmon example demonstrates how long-term environmental changes interact with nutrient and contaminant movement across large spatial scales and provides a model for exploring similar patterns with other migratory species9. Pacific salmon transport of nutrients and contaminants to freshwaters increased by 30% and 20%, respectively, between 1976 and 2015, an increase dominated by pink salmon, which had the highest nutrient-to-contaminant ratios.",

    "abstract": "A key concept proposed by Landau to explain superfluid liquid helium is the elementary excitation of quantum particles called rotons1–8. The irregular arrangement of atoms in a liquid leads to the aperiodic dispersion of rotons, which played a pivotal role in understanding fractional quantum Hall liquids (magneto-rotons)9,10 and the supersolidity of Bose–Einstein condensates11–13. Even for a two-dimensional electron or dipole liquid, in the absence of a magnetic field, the repulsive interactions have been predicted to form a roton minimum14–19, which can be used to trace the transition to Wigner crystals20–24 and superconductivity25–27, although this has not yet been observed. Here, we report the observation of such electronic rotons in a two-dimensional dipole liquid of alkali-metal ions donating electrons to surface layers of black phosphorus. Our data reveal the striking aperiodic dispersion of rotons, which is characterized by a local minimum of energy at finite momentum. As the density of dipoles decreases so that interactions dominate over the kinetic energy, the roton gap reduces to 0, as in a crystal, signalling Wigner crystallization. Our model shows the importance of short-range order arising from repulsion between dipoles, which can be viewed as the formation of Wigner crystallites (bubbles or stripes) floating in the sea of a Fermi liquid. Our results reveal that the primary origin of electronic rotons (and the pseudogap) is strong correlations. Electronic rotons and Wigner crystallites have been observed experimentally and numerically in a two-dimensional dipole liquid.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic inheritance of silent chromatin domains is fundamental to cellular memory during embryogenesis, but it must overcome the dilution of repressive histone modifications during DNA replication1. One such modification, histone H2A lysine 119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119Ub), needs to be re-established by the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) E3 ligase to restore the silent Polycomb domain2,3. However, the exact mechanism behind this restoration remains unknown. Here, combining cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and functional approaches, we characterize the read–write mechanism of the non-canonical PRC1-containing RYBP (ncPRC1RYBP). This mechanism, which functions as a positive-feedback loop in epigenetic regulation4,5, emphasizes the pivotal role of ncPRC1RYBP in restoring H2AK119Ub. We observe an asymmetrical binding of ncPRC1RYBP to H2AK119Ub nucleosomes, guided in part by the N-terminal zinc-finger domain of RYBP binding to residual H2AK119Ub on nascent chromatin. This recognition positions the RING domains of RING1B and BMI1 on the unmodified nucleosome side, enabling recruitment of the E2 enzyme to ubiquitinate H2AK119 within the same nucleosome (intra-nucleosome read–write) or across nucleosomes (inter-nucleosome read–write). Collectively, our findings provide key structural and mechanistic insights into the dynamic interplay of epigenetic regulation, highlighting the significance of ncPRC1RYBP in H2AK119Ub restoration to sustain repressive chromatin domains. Cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical studies elucidate the read–write mechanisms of non-canonical PRC1-containing RYBP in histone H2A lysine 119 monoubiquitination and their roles in maintaining epigenetic inheritance.",

    "abstract": "The role of the vertebrate retina in early vision is generally described by the efficient coding hypothesis1,2, which predicts that the retina reduces the redundancy inherent in natural scenes3 by discarding spatiotemporal correlations while preserving stimulus information4. It is unclear, however, whether the predicted decorrelation and redundancy reduction in the activity of ganglion cells, the retina’s output neurons, hold under gaze shifts, which dominate the dynamics of the natural visual input5. We show here that species-specific gaze patterns in natural stimuli can drive correlated spiking responses both in and across distinct types of ganglion cells in marmoset as well as mouse retina. These concerted responses disrupt redundancy reduction to signal fixation periods with locally high spatial contrast. Model-based analyses of ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli show that the observed response correlations follow from nonlinear pooling of ganglion cell inputs. Our results indicate cell-type-specific deviations from efficient coding in retinal processing of natural gaze shifts. Species-specific gaze shifts with natural stimuli drive correlated spiking in retinal ganglion cells.",

Until now, characterization techniques that map the distribution of grains, their orientation and the presence of defects have been limited to surface investigations, to spatial resolutions of a few hundred nanometres or to systems of thickness around 100 nm, thus requiring destructive sample preparation for measurements and preventing the study of system-representative volumes or the investigation of materials under operational conditions7–15. Here we present X-ray linear dichroic orientation tomography (XL-DOT), a quantitative, non-invasive technique that allows for an intragranular and intergranular characterization of extended polycrystalline and non-crystalline16 materials in three dimensions. We present the detailed characterization of a polycrystalline sample of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), a key catalyst in the production of sulfuric acid17. We determine the nanoscale composition, microstructure and crystal orientation throughout the polycrystalline sample with 73 nm spatial resolution. We identify and characterize grains, as well as twist, tilt and twin grain boundaries. We further observe the creation and annihilation of topological defects promoted by the presence of volume crystallographic defects. The non-destructive and spectroscopic nature of our method opens the door to operando combined chemical and microstructural investigations11,18 of functional materials, including energy, mechanical and quantum materials. A new non-destructive spectroscopic method, ptychographic X-ray linear dichroic orientation tomography, is described, allowing the intragranular and intergranular characterization of extended polycrystalline and non-crystalline materials in three dimensions with nanoscale spatial resolution.",

    "abstract": "RNA conformational diversity has fundamental biological roles1–5, but direct visualization of its full conformational space in solution has not been possible using traditional biophysical techniques. Using solution atomic force microscopy, a deep neural network and statistical analyses, we show that the ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA adopts heterogeneous conformations consisting of a conformationally invariant core and highly flexible peripheral structural elements that sample a broad conformational space, with amplitudes as large as 20–60 Å in a multitude of directions, with very low net energy cost. Increasing Mg2+ drives compaction and enhances enzymatic activity, probably by narrowing the conformational space. Moreover, analyses of the correlations and anticorrelations between spatial flexibility and sequence conservation suggest that the functional roles of both the structure and dynamics of key regions are embedded in the primary sequence. These findings reveal the structure–dynamics basis for the embodiment of both enzymatic precision and substrate promiscuity in the RNA component of the RNase P. Mapping the conformational space of the RNase P RNA demonstrates a new general approach to studying RNA structure and dynamics. Using a deep neural network and statistical analyses of atomic force microscopy images of individual RNA molecules enables the mapping of RNA conformational space in solution.",

This interest has been motivated by prospects of finding new physics, including topologically protected quasiparticles7–9, but also extends into metrology and device applications10–13. So far it has proven challenging to achieve detectable supercurrents through quantum Hall conductors2,3,6. Here we show that domain walls in minimally twisted bilayer graphene14–18 support exceptionally robust proximity superconductivity in the quantum Hall regime, allowing Josephson junctions to operate in fields close to the upper critical field of superconducting electrodes. The critical current is found to be non-oscillatory and practically unchanging over the entire range of quantizing fields, with its value being limited by the quantum conductance of ballistic, strictly one-dimensional, electronic channels residing within the domain walls. The system described is unique in its ability to support Andreev bound states at quantizing fields and offers many interesting directions for further exploration.

    "abstract": "HFC-23 is a potent greenhouse gas, predominantly emitted as an undesired by-product during the synthesis and processing of HCFC-22 (ref. 1). Previously, the Clean Development Mechanism and national efforts called for the implementation of abatement technology for reducing HFC-23 emissions2,3. Nevertheless, between 2015 and 2019, a divergence was found between the global emissions derived from atmospheric observations and those expected from reported abatement1,2. Primarily, this points to insufficient implementation of abatement strategies2,4, calling for independent verification of the emissions at the individual chemical facility level. Here we use regional atmospheric observations and a new, deliberately released tracer to quantify the HFC-23 emissions from an HCFC-22 and fluoropolymer production facility, which is equipped with waste gas destruction technology. We find that our inferred HFC-23/HCFC-22 emission factor of 0.19% (0.13–0.24%) broadly fits within the emission factor considered practicable for abatement projects5,6. Extrapolation to global HCFC-22 production underscores that the operation of appropriate destruction technology has the potential to reduce global HFC-23 emissions by at least 84% (69–100%) (14 (12–16) Gg yr−1). This reduction is equivalent to 17% CO2 emissions from aviation in 2019 (ref. 7). We also demonstrate co-destruction of PFC-318, another by-product and greenhouse gas. Our findings show the importance of the 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which obligates parties to destroy HFC-23 emissions from facilities manufacturing hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons “to the extent practicable” from 2020 onwards8. Fulfilment of current abatement technology at the factory level could reduce HFC-23 emissions by approximately 84%.",

    "abstract": "The quantum-mechanical nuclear-shell structure determines the stability and limits of the existence of the heaviest nuclides with large proton numbers Z ≳ 100 (refs. 1–3). Shell effects also affect the sizes and shapes of atomic nuclei, as shown by laser spectroscopy studies in lighter nuclides4. However, experimental information on the charge radii and the nuclear moments of the heavy actinide elements, which link the heaviest naturally abundant nuclides with artificially produced superheavy elements, is sparse5. Here we present laser spectroscopy measurements along the fermium (Z = 100) isotopic chain and an extension of data in the nobelium isotopic chain (Z = 102) across a key region. Multiple production schemes and different advanced techniques were applied to determine the isotope shifts in atomic transitions, from which changes in the nuclear mean-square charge radii were extracted. A range of nuclear models based on energy density functionals reproduce well the observed smooth evolution of the nuclear size. Both the remarkable consistency of model prediction and the similarity of predictions for different isotopes suggest a transition to a regime in which shell effects have a diminished effect on the size compared with lighter nuclei. Laser spectroscopy measurements of the fermium isotopic chain show a smooth trend in the nuclear size of heavy actinide elements, and diminishing shell effects on the size evolution compared with lighter nuclei.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the mammalian ultradian sleep rhythm—the alternation of rapid-eye-movement (REM) and slow-wave (SW) states—are not well understood but probably depend, at least in part, on circuits in the brainstem1–6. Here, we use perturbation experiments to probe this ultradian rhythm in sleeping lizards (Pogona vitticeps)7–9 and test the hypothesis that it originates in a central pattern generator10,11—circuits that are typically susceptible to phase-dependent reset and entrainment by external stimuli12. Using light pulses, we find that Pogona’s ultradian rhythm8 can be reset in a phase-dependent manner, with a critical transition from phase delay to phase advance in the middle of SW. The ultradian rhythm frequency can be decreased or increased, within limits, by entrainment with light pulses. During entrainment, Pogona REM (REMP) can be shortened but not lengthened, whereas SW can be dilated more flexibly. In awake animals, a few alternating light/dark epochs matching natural REMP and SW durations entrain a sleep-like brain rhythm, suggesting the transient activation of an ultradian rhythm generator. In sleeping animals, a light pulse delivered to a single eye causes an immediate ultradian rhythm reset, but only of the contralateral hemisphere; both sides resynchronize spontaneously, indicating that sleep is controlled by paired rhythm-generating circuits linked by functional excitation. Our results indicate that central pattern generators of a type usually known to control motor rhythms may also organize the ultradian sleep rhythm in a vertebrate. Central pattern generators of a type usually known to control motor rhythms may also organize vertebrate ultradian sleep rhythm.",

    "abstract": "Since Hampé’s classic developmental experiments in the mid-twentieth century1,2, the reduced avian fibula has sparked sustained curiosity3–6. The fibula transformed throughout dinosaur evolution from a columnar structure into its splint-like avian form, a change long thought to be of little biomechanical consequence3,6. Here we integrated comparative three-dimensional kinematic analyses with transitional morphologies from the fossil record to refute this assumption and show that the reduced fibula serves a crucial function in enabling extreme knee long-axis rotation (LAR). Extreme LAR is fundamental to avian locomotion and is regularly exploited by living birds to execute complex terrestrial manoeuvres7. We infer that the evolution of this capacity was preceded by restriction of the knee to hinge-like motion in early theropod dinosaurs, driven by the origin of a mid-shank articulation8 that precluded ancestral patterns of tibiofibular motion. Freeing of the fibula from the ankle joint later enabled mobilization of this initially static articulation and, in doing so, established a novel pattern of tibiofibular kinematics essential to the extreme levels of LAR retained by modern birds. Fibular reduction thus ushered in a transition to LAR-dominated three-dimensional limb control, profoundly altering the course of theropod locomotor evolution. Using three-dimensional kinematic analyses, fibular reduction is shown to have a functional evolutionary adaptative role in birds to enable knee long-axis rotation.",

    "abstract": "Exploring new strategies to manipulate the order parameter of magnetic materials by electrical means is of great importance not only for advancing our understanding of fundamental magnetism but also for unlocking potential applications. A well-established concept uses gate voltages to control magnetic properties by modulating the carrier population in a capacitor structure1–5. Here we show that, in Pt/Al/Fe/GaAs(001) multilayers, the application of an in-plane charge current in Pt leads to a shift in the ferromagnetic resonance field depending on the microwave frequency when the Fe film is sufficiently thin. The experimental observation is interpreted as a current-induced modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ΔHA of Fe. We show that (1) ΔHA decreases with increasing Fe film thickness and is connected to the damping-like torque; and (2) ΔHA depends not only on the polarity of charge current but also on the magnetization direction, that is, ΔHA has an opposite sign when the magnetization direction is reversed. The symmetry of the modification is consistent with a current-induced spin6–8 and/or orbit9–13 accumulation, which, respectively, act on the spin and/or orbit component of the magnetization. In this study, as Pt is regarded as a typical spin current source6,14, the spin current can play a dominant part. The control of magnetism by a spin current results from the modified exchange splitting of the majority and minority spin bands, providing functionality that was previously unknown and could be useful in advanced spintronic devices. Signatures of magnetism control by the flow of angular momentum are observed in Pt/Al/Fe/GaAs(001) multilayers by the application of an in-plane charge current in Pt.",
