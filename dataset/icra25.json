    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a revolution across many research fields. In robotics, the integration of common-sense knowledge from LLMs into task and motion planning has drastically advanced the field by unlocking unprecedented levels of context awareness. Despite their vast collection of knowledge, large language models may generate infeasible plans due to hallucinations or missing domain information. To address these challenges and improve plan feasibility and computational efficiency, we introduce DELTA, a novel LLM-informed task planning approach. By using scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, DELTA achieves rapid generation of precise planning problem descriptions. To enhance planning performance, DELTA decomposes long-term task goals with LLMs into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals, enabling automated task planners to efficiently solve complex problems. In our extensive evaluation, we show that DELTA enables an efficient and fully automatic task planning pipeline, achieving higher planning success rates and significantly shorter planning times compared to the state of the art."

    "abstract": "Robot navigation methods allow mobile robots to operate in applications such as warehouses or hospitals. While the environment in which the robot operates imposes requirements on its navigation behavior, most existing methods do not allow the end-user to configure the robot's behavior and priorities, possibly leading to undesirable behavior (e.g., fast driving in a hospital). We propose a novel approach to adapt robot motion behavior based on natural language instructions provided by the end-user. Our zero-shot method uses an existing Visual Language Model to interpret a user text query or an image of the environment. This information is used to generate the cost function and reconfigure the parameters of a Model Predictive Controller, translating the user's instruction to the robot's motion behavior. This allows our method to safely and effectively navigate in dynamic and challenging environments. We extensively evaluate our method's individual components and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a ground robot in simulation and real-world experiments, and across a variety of environments and user specifications."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities in natural language processing, sparking interest in applying LLMs to task planning problems in robotics. Most studies focused on task planning for clear natural language commands that specify target objects and their locations. However, for more user-friendly task execution, it is crucial for robots to autonomously plan and carry out tasks based on abstract natural language commands that may not explicitly mention target objects or locations, such as ‘Put the food ingredients in the same place.’ In this study, we propose an LLM-based autonomous task planning framework that generates task plans for abstract natural language commands. This framework consists of two phases: an environment recognition phase and a task planning phase. In the environment recognition phase, a large vision-language model generates a hierarchical scene graph that captures the relationships between objects and spaces in the environment surrounding a robot agent. During the task planning phase, an LLM uses the scene graph and the abstract user command to formulate a plan for the given task. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the AI2THOR simulation environment, demonstrating its superior performance in task execution when handling abstract commands."

    "abstract": "In robot task planning, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in generating complex and long-horizon action sequences. However, it is observed that LLMs often produce responses that sound plausible but are not accurate. To address these problems, existing methods typically employ predefined error sets or external knowledge sources, requiring human efforts and computation resources. Recently, self-correction approaches have emerged, where LLM generates and refines plans, identifying errors by itself. Despite their effectiveness, they are more prone to failures in correction due to insufficient reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel self-corrective planning of tasks with inverse prompting, named InversePrompt, which contains reasoning steps to provide interpretable groundings for feedback. It generates the inverse actions corresponding to generated actions and verifies if these inverse actions can restore the system to its original state, thereby explicitly validating the logical flow of the generated plans. The results on benchmark datasets show an average 16.3% higher success rate over existing LLM-based task planning methods. Our approach offers clearer justifications for feedback in real-world environments, resulting in more successful task completion than existing self-correction approaches across various scenarios."

To address this, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians updated through the network to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering."

    "abstract": "The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints."

The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising approach for real-time dense 3D reconstruction. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems struggle to balance hardware simplicity, speed, and map quality. Most systems excel in one or two of the aforementioned aspects but rarely achieve all. A key issue is the difficulty of initializing 3D Gaussians while concurrently conducting SLAM. To address these challenges, we present Monocular GSO (MGSO), a novel real-time SLAM system that integrates photometric SLAM with 3DGS. Photometric SLAM provides dense structured point clouds for 3DGS initialization, accelerating optimization and producing more efficient maps with fewer Gaussians. As a result, experiments show that our system generates reconstructions with a balance of quality, memory efficiency, and speed that outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our system achieves all results using RGB inputs. We evaluate the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and EuRoC datasets against current live dense reconstruction systems. Not only do we surpass contemporary systems, but experiments also show that we maintain our performance on laptop hardware, making it a practical solution for robotics, A/R, and other real-time applications."

However, previous GS-based methods primarily target indoor scenes and rely on RGB-D sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, hence underperforming in outdoor scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a RGB-only gaussian splatting SLAM method for unbounded outdoor scenes—OpenGS-SLAM. Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network to generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared to commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene geometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then, we propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous optimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing system tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper for the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap mapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8% of previous 3DGS methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

    "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in intelligent robots, aiming to achieve globally consistent geometric structures and providing data support for robotic manipulation. Due to the limited view of measurement devices, it is necessary to collect point clouds from multiple views to construct a complete model. Previous multi-view registration methods rely on sufficient overlap and registering all pairs of point clouds, resulting in slow convergence and high cumulative errors. To solve these challenges, we present a multi-view registration method based on the point-to-plane model and pose graph. We introduce a robust kernel into the objective function to diminish registration errors caused by mismatched points. Additionally, an enhanced Euclidean clustering method is proposed for extracting object point clouds. Subsequently, by establishing pose constraints on non-adjacent frames of point clouds, the cumulative error is reduced, achieving global optimization based on the pose graph. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to overlap ratios, successfully registering point clouds with overlap ratio exceeding 30%. In comparison to other techniques, our method can reduce the E(R) of multi-view registration by 13.54% and E(t) by 18.72%, effectively reducing the cumulative error."

LiDAR odometry systems are usually based on some form of point cloud registration to compute the ego-motion of a mobile robot. Yet, few of today's LiDAR odometry systems consider domain-specific knowledge or the kinematic model of the mobile platform during the point cloud alignment. In this paper, we present Kinematic-ICP, a LiDAR odometry system that focuses on wheeled mobile robots equipped with a 3D LiDAR and moving on a planar surface, which is a common assumption for warehouses, offices, hospitals, etc. Our approach introduces kinematic constraints within the optimization of a traditional point-to-point iterative closest point scheme. In this way, the resulting motion follows the kinematic constraints of the platform, effectively exploiting the robot's wheel odometry and the 3D LiDAR observations. We dynamically adjust the influence of LiDAR measurements and wheel odometry in our optimization scheme, allowing the system to handle degenerate scenarios such as feature-poor corridors. We evaluate our approach on robots operating in large-scale warehouse environments, but also outdoors. The experiments show that our approach achieves top performances and is more accurate than wheel odometry and common LiDAR odometry systems. Kinematic-ICP has been recently deployed in the Dexory fleet of robots operating in warehouses worldwide at their customers' sites, showing that our method can run in the real world alongside a complete navigation stack."

To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process. We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods."

Existing methods primarily delve into only one task using extra inputs or specialized sensors, neglecting the valuable interactions among tasks and the subsequent refinement process, leading to suboptimal and blurry predictions. To address these issues, we propose a monocular framework, which is the first to excel in both segmentation and depth estimation of transparent objects, with only a single-image input. Specifically, we devise a novel semantic and geometric fusion module, effectively integrating the multi-scale information between tasks. In addition, drawing inspiration from human perception of objects, we further incorporate an iterative strategy, which progressively refines initial features for clearer results. Experiments on two challenging synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art monocular, stereo, and multi-view methods by a large margin of about 38.8%-46.2% with only a single RGB input.

    "abstract": "Modeling and controlling legged robot locomotion on terrains with densely distributed large rocks and boulders are fundamentally challenging. Unlike traditional methods which often consider these rocks and boulders as obstacles and attempt to find a clear path to circumvent them, in this study we aim to develop methods for robots to actively utilize interaction forces with these \"obstacles\" for locomotion and navigation. To do so, we studied the locomotion of a quadrupedal robot as it traversed a simplified obstacle field, and discovered that with different gaits, the robot could passively converge to distinct orientations. A compositional return map explained this observed passive convergence, and enabled theoretical prediction of the steady-state orientation angles for any given quadrupedal gait. We experimentally demonstrated that with these predictions, a legged robot could effectively generate desired shape of trajectories amongst large, slippery obstacles, simply by switching between different gaits. Our study offered a novel method for robots to exploit traditionally-considered \"obstacles\" to achieve agile movements on challenging terrains."

To ameliorate the limitations, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning-based Active Transporter Riding method (RL-ATR), inspired by humans' utilization of personal transporters, including Segways. The RL-ATR features a transporter riding policy and two state estimators. The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the RL-ATR. This riding ability could broaden the locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding the operational range and efficiency."

Inspired by introspective learning, we propose Progressive Adversarial Self-Imitation Skill Transition (PASIST), a novel method that eliminates the need for complete expert datasets. PASIST autonomously explores and selects high-quality trajectories based on predefined target poses instead of demonstrations, leveraging the Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL) framework. To further enhance learning, We develop a skill selection module to mitigate mode collapse by balancing the weights of skills with varying levels of difficulty. Through these methods, PASIST is able to reproduce skills corresponding to the target pose while achieving smooth and natural transitions between them. Evaluations on both simulation platforms and the Solo 8 robot confirm the effectiveness of PASIST, offering an efficient alternative to expert-driven learning."

    "abstract": "A core strength of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for quadrupedal locomotion has been its ability to enforce constraints and provide interpretability of the sequence of commands over the horizon. However, despite being able to plan, MPC struggles to scale with task complexity, often failing to achieve robust behavior on rapidly changing surfaces. On the other hand, model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have outperformed MPC on multiple terrains, showing emergent motions but inherently lack any ability to handle constraints or perform planning. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that integrates proprioceptive planning with RL, allowing for agile and safe locomotion behaviors through the horizon. Inspired by MPC, we incorporate an internal model that includes a velocity estimator and a Dreamer module. During training, the framework learns an expert policy and an internal model that are co-dependent, facilitating exploration for improved locomotion behaviors. During deployment, the Dreamer module solves an infinite-horizon MPC problem, adapting actions and velocity commands to respect the constraints. We validate the robustness of our training framework through ablation studies on internal model components and demonstrate improved robustness to training noise. Finally, we evaluate our approach across multi-terrain scenarios in both simulation and hardware."

However, integrating an arm with a mobile base significantly increases the system’s complexity, making precise end-effector control challenging. Existing model-based approaches are often constrained by their modeling assumptions, leading to limited robustness. Meanwhile, recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations restrict the arm’s workspace to be in front of the robot or track only the position to obtain decent tracking accuracy. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a large workspace on rough, unstructured terrains. Our proposed method involves a terrain-aware sampling strategy for the robot’s initial configuration and end-effector pose commands, as well as a game-based curriculum to extend the robot’s operating range. We validate our approach on the ANYmal quadrupedal robot with a six DoF robotic arm. Through our experiments, we show that the learned controller achieves precise command tracking over a large workspace and adapts across varying terrains such as stairs and slopes. On deployment, it achieves a pose-tracking error of 2.64 cm and 3.64◦, outperforming existing competitive baselines."

The Sparse Autoencoder preserves the characteristics of the data while reducing its dimensionality. Better classification efficiency of the developed method is demonstrated compared to other representative methods.

A major challenge in achieving this is the inherent imbalance caused by the sparsity of error-related potential (ErrP) events in streaming electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which often leads models to learn irrelevant features and perform poorly. Thus, while Deep learning-based ErrP detection has seen considerable advancements, the variability in individual user reaction times introduces labelling errors, complicating model adaptation to new subjects. Moreover, most deep learning methods are developed and validated on discrete, offline experiments using pre-defined windows, which fail to translate effectively to continuous, real-time HRI. Addressing these challenges is crucial to improving the robustness and adaptability of real-time ErrP detection in practical HRI applications. Here, we develop a causal EEG conformer framework, combining a Convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a transformer with causal attention for real-time prediction of ErrP signals during HRI. We evaluated our ErrP model in a pseudo-online environment in both inter-session and inter-subject cross-validation settings for exoskeleton assistive robotics. Our model demonstrated superior performance in decoding accuracy and efficiency, showcasing better generalization for real-world dynamic HRI applications."

The proposed controller learns a robust policy capable of handling diverse failure scenarios across different actuator configurations. Moreover, we introduce a transfer learning mechanism that shares a part of the control policy across various underwater robots with different actuators, thus improving learning efficiency and generalization across platforms. To validate our approach, we conduct simulations on three different types of underwater robots: a hovering-type AUV, a torpedo shaped AUV, and a turtle-shaped robot (U-CAT). Additionally, real-world experiments are performed, successfully transferring the learned policy from simulation to a physical U-CAT in a controlled environment. Our RL-based controller demonstrates superior performance in terms of stability and success rate compared to a baseline controller, achieving an 85.7 percent success rate in real-world tests compared to 57.1 percent with a baseline controller.

The common approach to AUV control is a combination of passive stabilization with added buoyancy on top and weights on the bottom, and a PID controller tuned for simple and smooth motion primitives. However, the approach comes at the cost of sluggish controls and often the need to re-tune controllers with configuration changes. In this paper, we propose a fast (trainable in minutes), reinforcement learning-based approach for full 6 degree of freedom (DOF) control of a thruster-driven AUVs, taking 6-DOF command-conditioned inputs direct to thruster outputs. We present a new, highly parallelized simulator for underwater vehicle dynamics. We demonstrate this approach through zero-shot sim-to-real (with no tuning) transfer onto a real AUV that produces comparable results to hand-tuned PID controllers.

Prior work relies strongly on global information about the environment, such as a precise map of the city and in-situ wind measurements at various locations, to run expensive computational fluid dynamics solvers to predict the entire wind flow field. In contrast, this paper introduces a new method to estimate the wind flow field in a region around the robot in real time, utilizing on-board range measurements to sense nearby buildings and sparse wind measurements to infer windspeed and direction. We propose that this information sufficiently characterizes the structure of the wind flow field in the local region of interest. To that end, we introduce a deep learning-based approach to predict local flow fields from range measurements. Our results indicate that a neural network trained on numerous simulated winds through small randomized maps is capable of reconstructing local wind flows while generalizing to larger environments with over 200 buildings. This contribution empowers computationally-constrained aerial robots to reason about the structure of local wind flow fields, thereby enabling new planning, control, and estimation strategies in windy urban environments without textit{a priori} knowledge of the map."

We explore a purely data-driven method to master this flight skill in simulation, where a neural network directly maps pixels and proprioception to continuous low-level control commands. This learned policy enables whole-body control through gaps with different geometries demanding sharp attitude changes (e.g., near-vertical roll angle). The policy is achieved by successive model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and online observation space distillation. The RL policy receives (virtual) point clouds of the gaps' edges for scalable simulation and is then distilled into the high-dimensional pixel space. However, this flight skill is fundamentally expensive to learn by exploring in RL due to restricted feasible solution space. We propose to reset the agent as states on the trajectories by a model-based trajectory optimizer to alleviate this problem. The presented training pipeline is compared with baseline methods, and ablation studies are conducted to identify the key ingredients of the method. The immediate next step is to scale up the variation of gap sizes and geometries in anticipation of emergent policies and demonstrate the sim-to-real transformation."

However, these agents fail in unseen track configurations, always requiring complete retraining when presented with new track layouts. This work aims to develop RL agents that generalize effectively to novel track configurations without retraining. The naive solution of training directly on a diverse set of track layouts can overburden the agent, resulting in suboptimal policy learning as the increased complexity of the environment impairs the agent’s ability to learn to fly. To enhance the generalizability of the RL agent, we propose an adaptive environment-shaping framework that dynamically adjusts the training environment based on the agent’s performance. We achieve this by leveraging a secondary RL policy to design environments that strike a balance between being challenging and achievable, allowing the agent to adapt and improve progressively. Using our adaptive environment shaping, one single racing policy efficiently learns to race in diverse and challenging tracks. Experimental results validated in both simulation and the real world show that our method enables drones to successfully fly complex and unseen race tracks, outperforming existing environment-shaping techniques."

However, optical flow estimation on tiny robots is challenging due to limited onboard sensing and computation capabilities. In this paper, we propose EdgeFlowNet, a high-speed, low-latency dense optical flow approach for tiny autonomous mobile robots by harnessing the power of edge computing. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by deploying EdgeFlowNet on a tiny quadrotor to perform static obstacle avoidance, flight through unknown gaps and dynamic obstacle dodging. EdgeFlowNet is about 20X faster than the previous state-of-the-art approaches while improving accuracy by over 20% and using only 1.08W of power enabling advanced autonomy on palm-sized tiny mobile robots."

    "abstract": "Distributed multi-robot coordination is critical to achieving reliable robotic missions that exploit the collective capability of swarm robots. In particular, the consensus and formation control problems have been extensively studied, resulting in distributed controllers that enable robots to rely only on information from themselves and their immediate neighbors. However, these algorithms are usually designed for specific objectives (e.g., cooperative object transportation, environmental coverage, etc.), requiring the controllers to be re-designed for domain variations. Therefore, we propose a new parametric framework inspired by gravitational fields that allow simultaneous coordination of robots at multiple levels, enabling generalization and domain adaptation. Our approach is built on top of a connectivity-preserving formation controller, with need-based and task-based ad hoc coordination at private, local, and global layers of a swarm robot team. We demonstrate the remarkable potential of our framework through extensive simulations and real-world swarm robot experiments in three representative multi-robot tasks involving tight coordination: 1) robot-initiated rendezvous at different coordination layers, 2) coordinated boundary tracking and coverage of environmental processes, and 3) accommodating task executions and motion control while satisfying the coordination laws."

First, we derive a unified parametric representation for both open and closed curves. Then, a leader-follower formation controller is designed to drive agents to form the desired parametric curves using the curve coefficients as feedbacks. We consider directed communications and constant input disturbances rejection in the controller design. Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis proves the asymptotic stability of the proposed controller. The convergence of the orientations of agents to some constant values is also guaranteed. The method has the potential to be extended to deal with various real-world applications, such as object enclosing. Detailed numerical simulations and experimental studies are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method."

Specifically, we decompose the robots' maneuvers into two independent components, i.e., interception and enclosing, which are parameterized by two independent virtual coordinates. Treating these two virtual coordinates as dimensions of an abstract manifold, we derive the corresponding singularity-free guiding vector field (GVF), which, along with a distributed coordination mechanism based on the consensus theory, guides robots to achieve various motions (i.e., versatile maneuvering), including (a) formation tracking, (b) target enclosing, and (c) circumnavigation. Additional motion parameters can generate more complex cooperative robot motions. Based on GVFs, we design a controller for a nonholonomic robot model. Besides the theoretical results, extensive simulations and experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the approach."

Robot teams often need to maintain specific formations, such as wedge formations, to enhance visibility, positioning, and efficiency during fast movement. However, complex environments such as narrow corridors challenge rigid team formations, which makes effective formation control difficult in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Adaptive Formation with Oscillation Reduction (AFOR) approach to improve coordinated multi-robot navigation. We develop AFOR under the theoretical framework of hierarchical learning and integrate a spring-damper model with hierarchical learning to enable both team coordination and individual robot control. At the upper level, a graph neural network facilitates formation adaptation and information sharing among the robots. At the lower level, reinforcement learning enables each robot to navigate and avoid obstacles while maintaining the formations. We conducted extensive experiments using Gazebo in the Robot Operating System (ROS), a high-fidelity Unity3D simulator with ROS, and real robot teams. Results demonstrate that AFOR enables smooth navigation with formation adaptation in complex scenarios and outperforms previous methods.

    "abstract": "In multi-robot exploration, a team of mobile robot is tasked with efficiently mapping an unknown environments. While most exploration planners assume omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem, requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive evaluation shows that MARVEL’s learned policies exhibit effective coordinated behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL’s generalizability in large-scale environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware."

    "abstract": "Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) are increasingly deployed for hazardous tasks in urban environments. Among many tasks, search and rescue remains challenging as it deals with exploration in an unknown indoor constrained environment. For example, without global knowledge of the map of a building floor, it is not advantageous to choose one path over another at a corridor junction. Also, if the assigned frontiers are far from the robot, backtracking along a corridor will cost more than moving forward. Since exploration along corridors is similar to solving a maze, this paper examines classical maze-solving algorithms that are known to be computationally fast and lightweight, such as the Right Hand Rule (RHR), Random Mouse (RM), and more. The authors have identified two gaps that need to be addressed before these algorithms can be applied to physical MRS. Firstly, these algorithms are not designed for the cooperation of multiple agents in exploration. Secondly, they are often applied to only a low-fidelity simulation environment, which requires some work to make these algorithms transferable to work in the commonly used occupancy grid map environment. In this paper, the authors introduced RACE, a fast and lightweight collective urban exploration and search algorithm based on a modified and condensed version of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. The proposed solution is successfully verified in a low-fidelity simulation, evaluated against other exploration and search algorithms like RHR and RM. An innovative approach of RACE Simulation to Physical implementation is presented and a physical system evaluation is performed to evaluate RACE against a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree algorithm. Finally, the proposed solution is further verified with a physical experiment, which a quadrupedal robot is assigned to explore part of a floor of SUTD, spanning approximately (55m x 40m). RACE also showed potential in handling challenging close-loop and dead-end environments."

We also incorporate informative path planning to determine the best path to collect samples along while en route to collecting the desired sample. We achieve this in a decentralized manner by decoupling the process into two stages: the first stage uses our spatiotemporal mixture of Gaussian Processes (STMGP) model to determine the most informative sampling location via a mutual information lower bound heuristic and the second stage plans an informative path to collect the desired sample and other additional informative samples via submodular function optimization. Moreover, we effectively leverage peer-to-peer communication to enable coordination. Simulation results on real-world spatiotemporal data are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Haptic feedback enhances user interaction with systems by adding the sense of touch, thereby improving immersion and realism in applications like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), video games, education, and robotic surgery. To address the challenges in mechanically actuated haptic feedback devices such as limited mobility, mechanical wear, and complex mechanical structures, several research sought to develop electromagnetic haptic feedback systems. However, they also suffer from the rapid decay of magnetic force with distance, thus restricting their workspace size and application potential. In this paper, we propose a novel electromagnetic haptic feedback device that is actuated by magnetic torque instead of magnetic force. By controlling the magnetic torque, which decays with distance only at a third-order rate, our device achieves a large workspace—a 200-mm-diameter hemisphere—while still delivering perceptible real-time haptic feedback within the hemisphere. While using the device, the user wears a lightweight haptic thimble housing a permanent magnet on their finger, which enables 2 degree-of-freedom (DoF) haptic feedback. A 13-coil electromagnet array serves as the source of the magnetic field. A mathematical model is proposed to determine the currents in the electromagnet array to generate the desired amount of haptic feedback torque. We conducted two experiments to prove the viability of the device. A haptic feedback accuracy experiment was conducted and validated the device's ability to generate sufficient torque within a large workspace. A user evaluation experiment showed that the device achieved an overall accuracy of 77.86% in a virtual enclosure exploration task, indicating its effectiveness and usability in haptic feedback applications."

Six combinations of haptic and shared control strategies are evaluated during a safe 3D navigation scenario in a cluttered environment. 18 participants are asked to steer two spherical magnetic microrobots among obstacles to reach a predefined goal, under different conditions. For each condition, participants are provided with different obstacle avoidance and navigation guidance cues. Results show that providing assistance in avoiding obstacles guarantees safer performance, regardless if the assistance is autonomous or delivered through a haptic repulsive force. Moreover, autonomous obstacle avoidance also reduces the completion time by 30% compared to haptic obstacle avoidance and no obstacle avoidance cases, although haptic feedback is preferred by the users. Finally, providing haptic guidance towards the target improves by the 65% the positioning accuracy of the microrobots with respect to not providing this guidance."

    "abstract": "Legged locomotion over various terrains is challenging and requires precise perception of the robot and its surroundings from both proprioception and vision. However, learning directly from high-dimensional visual input is often data-inefficient and intricate. To address this issue, traditional methods attempt to learn a teacher policy with access to privileged information first and then learn a student policy to imitate the teacher's behavior with visual input. Despite some progress, this imitation framework prevents the student policy from achieving optimal performance due to the information gap between inputs. Furthermore, the learning process is unnatural since animals intuitively learn to traverse different terrains based on their understanding of the world without privileged knowledge. Inspired by this natural ability, we propose a simple yet effective method, World Model-based Perception (WMP), which builds a world model of the environment and learns a policy based on the world model. We illustrate that though completely trained in simulation, the world model can make accurate predictions of real-world trajectories, thus providing informative signals for the policy controller. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that WMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in traversability and robustness.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of Velocity Vector Control (VVC) for fixed-wing UAVs using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the presence of imperfect demonstrations. The multi-objective and long-horizon nature of VVC introduces significant spatial and temporal complexities, complicating RL's exploration. While demonstration-based RL methods can help mitigate exploration challenges, their effectiveness is often limited by the quality of the provided demonstrations. To tackle this, we propose V-Pilot, a novel approach that integrates: (1) a controller equipped with a control law model to reduce action oscillation, thus alleviating temporal exploration issues, and (2) a VVC-specific training workflow for iterative policy refinement and demonstration quality improvement. This framework is designed to enhance the performance of demonstration-based RL under imperfect demonstrations. We evaluate V-Pilot on the fixed-wing UAV RL environment, FlyCraft. Experimental results demonstrate that V-Pilot outperforms PID and Behavioral Cloning across multiple performance metrics."

    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "Expressive robotic behavior is essential for the widespread acceptance of robots in social environments. Recent advancements in learned legged locomotion controllers have enabled more dynamic and versatile robot behaviors. However, determining the optimal behavior for interactions with different users across varied scenarios remains a challenge. Current methods either rely on natural language input, which is efficient but low-resolution, or learn from human preferences, which, although high-resolution, is sample inefficient. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages priors generated by pre-trained LLMs alongside the precision of preference learning. Our method, termed Language-Guided Preference Learning (LGPL), uses LLMs to generate initial behavior samples, which are then refined through preference-based feedback to learn behaviors that closely align with human expectations. Our core insight is that LLMs can guide the sampling process for preference learning, leading to a substantial improvement in sample efficiency. We demonstrate that LGPL can quickly learn accurate and expressive behaviors with as few as four queries, outperforming both purely language-parameterized models and traditional preference learning approaches.

    "abstract": "A hybrid exoskeleton is a class of wearable robotic technology that simultaneously uses a powered exoskeleton and functional electrical stimulation (FES) to generate assistive joint torques for people with impaired mobility due to neurological disorders such as spinal cord injury (SCI). The hybrid assistive technology benefits from FES that actively elicits force from paralyzed muscles via their neural excitation, leading to muscle strengthening. The main technical barrier to realizing the hybrid technology is to attain stable coordination between FES and the exoskeleton despite the quick onset of FES-induced muscle fatigue, which causes a rapid decline in the muscle force. Current methods to measure the induced fatigue lack direct muscle state measurements and may be ineffective at capturing the muscle force decay due to FES. Instead, ultrasound (US) imaging accurately quantifies FES-related muscle contractility and fatigue due to the direct visualization of muscle fibers. In this paper, we use real-time US imaging-derived muscle strain changes as biomarkers of FES-induced fatigue in an optimal controller that modulates exoskeleton assistance and FES dosage. To demonstrate that real-time US imaging is a promising muscle-machine interface technology that can optimize shared control in a hybrid exoskeleton, we perform experiments involving continuous seated knee extension and over-ground walking tasks on two participants with SCI and four participants without disabilities. Furthermore, this work helps design a novel and unprecedented robotic gait technology with the capability to impart FES-associated therapeutic benefits while assisting the gait of neurologically impaired individuals, including those with SCI, stroke, multiple sclerosis, etc."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel semi-passive knee exoskeleton designed to provide running assistance. It incorporates an energy-efficient clutch mechanism activated by a mini servomotor which engages and disengages the spring that supports the leg during running. The exoskeleton extracts energy during the running phase when the muscles are acting as brakes (negative power), stores it in the spring, and then returns this energy during the positive power phase (when the muscles are acting as motors). The exoskeleton controller implements an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor to estimate the shank orientation that determines when to engage and disengage the spring. Two experiments designed to probe the functionality of the exoskeleton were conducted to evaluate its control performance and actuation, and the exoskeleton's biomechanical impact on three subjects. The findings showed that the control mechanism could be engaged and disengaged in real time. The maximum moment created on the knee muscles was 17 Nm, although the device could supply 28 Nm. The ratio of the consumed servo energy consumption to the subjects’ saved energy was 1:160 (0.1W input to 16W saved). This study thus paves the way for the development of lightweight, inexpensive exoskeletons that can contribute to their greater availability for a broader range of individuals."

Model-based control strategies are conventional methods that can help discover the principles of complex tensegrity systems. The high dimensions and non-linearity of the BATE pose challenges for physical modelling and require unique model-based control strategies. In this study, we propose a modelling method that considers interaction force and explore the trajectory tracking performance and robustness of the ankle exoskeleton under three power-assisted control methods: position control, force control, and hybrid force-position contorl. The experimental results suggest that the PC method offers superior tracking performance and robustness compared to the other two methods. This method can be used for early rehabilitation training to improve flexibility. The control concept emphasizes its advantages over current wearable exoskeletons and introduces new ideas for high-performance exoskeletons."

    "abstract": "Self-balancing lower limb rehabilitation exoskeletons (SLLREs) allow individuals with lower limb dysfunction to walk without the use of crutches. Stable and human-like walking motions are crucial for SLLREs because achieving a close imitation of healthy human walking is a key goal in rehabilitation therapy. Existing SLLREs can realize stable walking but lack human-like features. This paper designs a walking motion generator based on hierarchical optimization to generate a human-like walking motion with variable hip height, heel-strike, toe-off, and knee-stretched features. This hierarchically optimized human-like walking motion generator consists of a knee-stretched optimizer and an optimization-based stabilizing filter. Specifically, the knee-stretched optimizer realizes the stretched knee feature by optimizing the hip trajectory with varying heights. And the stabilizing filter realizes stable walking by optimizing the hip trajectory in the sagittal plane direction.To validate the effectiveness of the proposed human-like walking motion generator, walking experiments were conducted on SLLRE AutoLEE-G3 both in a simulation environment and the real world. The experimental results show that the human-like walking motions look more natural and reduce the required torque for the knee joint compared with knee-bent walking."

    "abstract": "This letter presents a novel cable-driven exosuit intended for head-neck support and movement assistance. Mobility limitations in the head-neck, such as dropped head syndrome, can result from various neurological disorders. Current solutions, ranging from static neck collars to rigid-link robotic neck exoskeletons, are unsatisfactory. Neck collars are the most used clinically but fail to restore head-neck motion. Rigid-link neck exoskeletons can enable head movement but are bulky and restrictive. In this letter, we present the design of this exosuit, an analysis of its ability to balance the gravitational moment of the head in simulation, and the results of a user study comparing its kinematic performance to a state-of-the-art rigid-link neck exoskeleton. The exosuit is able to support the head across its full range of motion according to simulation results. It fits users of different sizes and participants exhibited more natural head-neck movement wearing the exosuit as compared to wearing the rigid-link exoskeleton. The exosuit allowed more head rotations than the rigid-link neck exoskeleton and required less compensatory torso movement for three daily tasks (looking for traffic, drinking from a bottle, and picking up an object from the floor). Its absolute range of motion was also much larger than the one allowed by the rigid-link neck exoskeleton. These results demonstrate the kinematic benefits of a cable-driven neck exosuit and provide justification for studying the use of such an exosuit for head-neck movement assistance in patient groups."

In this paper, a Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curve based Reduced-Order-Model (ROM) relying on the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature is investigated for the modeling and the control of SCM. This allows, first, reducing the dimension of the SCM kinematics based on the PH parametric curves with a predefined length and second, developing the shape kinematics control from its control polygon. The use of the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature allows to move independently the PH curve control points, while preserving PH features of length and minimum curve energy. These features are important to control in real-time the shape of the SCM. The proposed approach has been validated numerically and experimentally, carried out on a bio-inspired Soft continuum Elephant Trunk Robot."

To this end, we propose a novel approach to navigate cluttered spaces effectively for a single-segment long TDCR which is the simplest topology from a mechanical point of view. Our key insight is that by leveraging contact with the environment we can achieve multiple curvatures without mechanical alterations to the robot. Specifically, we propose a search-based motion planner for a single-segment TDCR. This planner, guided by a specially designed heuristic, discretizes the configuration space and employs a best-first search. The heuristic, crucial for efficient navigation, provides an effective cost-to-go estimation while respecting the kinematic constraints of the TDCR and environmental interactions. We empirically demonstrate the efficiency of our planner-testing over 525 queries in environments with both convex and non-convex obstacles, our planner is demonstrated to have a success rate of about 80% while baselines were not able to obtain a success rate higher than 30%. The difference is attributed to our novel heuristic which is shown to significantly reduce the required search space."

Current models either oversimplify the dynamics by assuming quasi-static conditions or overcomplicate them, making real-time application challenging. Additionally, many existing models neglect the critical coupling between the robot's body and actuator dynamics, a factor essential for accurate control. In this paper, we propose a new, minimal dynamics model for CDCRs that strikes a balance between simplicity and accuracy. Our model captures the essential dynamics of both the robot and its actuators, providing a practical tool for control design. We also establish connections between our model and those used for other robotic systems, enabling the transfer of well-established control strategies to CDCRs.

Consequently, even with a single set of drive units, the ACR can operate in multiple modes, enabling variable motion performance and workspace adaptability, effectively reducing the number of motors. The ACR's stiffness also varies with the locking state of its SLJs, and no motor drive is required to maintain its shape when all SLJs are self-locking.

Tensegrity robots have demonstrated diverse locomotion modes offering versatile solutions for navigation in complex environments. Recent efforts in bio-inspired robotics have led to designs mimicking the movement of natural organisms, such as earthworms.

This paper introduces a novel tensegrity robot, \"Tensiworm,\" inspired by the peristaltic locomotion of an earthworm.

The robot can travel a distance equal to its body length in approximately ten cycles with an average speed of 10.01 mm per minute. Furthermore, the use of thinner, flexible structural members broadens possibilities for development of millimeter-scale tensegrity robots, which hold significant potential for biomedical applications, including in-vivo testing and targeted drug delivery."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel Experience Forest algorithm designed for multi-object grasping (MOG). Different from single-object grasping, for MOG, the hand poses a few steps before the end of grasping play important roles in the success of MOG. But similar to single-object grasping, the hand poses that are far away from the end grasping pose are not as relevant. Therefore, the proposed approach invented the Experience Forest structure to organize the finger movement sequences collected in naive MOG approaches with a set of trees instead of a single tree. The algorithm propagates success or failure results in the trials from end-pose nodes only to the nodes representing several preceding hand poses. When using the trees to generate a grasping sequence, the algorithm generates a finger-movement policy that follows a MOG synergy at the beginning and then transits to a tree in the Experience Forest and then employs a breadth-first search to achieve a more reliable solution. Tested on various objects using a UR5e robotic arm and Barrett hand in both simulated and real environments, the strategy significantly boosts efficiency in object transfer tasks by up to 60%, marking a 10% improvement over our previous methods."

The epistemic uncertainty, which represents the OOD recognition, is often addressed by ensembles with multiple forward paths, limiting real-time application. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware approach for 6-DoF grasp detection using evidential learning to comprehensively capture both uncertainties in real-world robotic grasping. As a key contribution, we introduce vMF-Contact, a novel architecture for learning hierarchical contact grasp representations with probabilistic modeling of directional uncertainty as von Mises–Fisher (vMF) distribution. To achieve this, we analyze the theoretical formulation of the second-order objective on the posterior parametrization, providing formal guarantees for the model's ability to quantify uncertainty and improve grasp prediction performance. Moreover, we enhance feature expressiveness by applying partial point reconstructions as an auxiliary task, improving the comprehension of uncertainty quantification as well as the generalization to unseen objects. In the real-world experiments, our method demonstrates a significant improvement by 39% in the overall clearance rate compared to the baselines.

For deriving in-hand manipulation policies, reinforcement learning has recently shown great success.

Finding stable grasps that also promote the desired in-hand manipulation goal is an open problem. In this work, we propose a method for bridging this gap by leveraging the critic network of a reinforcement learning agent trained for in-hand manipulation to score and select initial grasps. Our experiments show that this method significantly increases the success rate of in-hand manipulation without requiring additional training.

While increasing k improves localisation robustness, it also linearly increases computational cost and runtime, creating a significant bottleneck. This paper investigates the relationship between global and local descriptors, showing that greater similarity between the global descriptors of query and database images increases the proportion of feature matches. Low similarity queries significantly benefit from increasing k, while high similarity queries rapidly experience diminishing returns. Building on these observations, we propose an adaptive strategy that adjusts k based on the similarity between the query's global descriptor and those in the database, effectively mitigating the feature-matching bottleneck. Our approach reduces computational costs and processing time without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on three indoor and outdoor datasets show that AIR-HLoc reduces feature matching time by up to 30% while preserving state-of-the-art accuracy.

However, existing NeRF-based approaches either lack geometric constraints or require extensive storage for feature matching, limiting their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and novel visual localization approach based on the neural implicit map with complementary features. Specifically, to enforce geometric constraints and reduce storage requirements, we implicitly learn a 3D keypoint descriptor field, avoiding the need to explicitly store point-wise features. To further address the semantic ambiguity of descriptors, we introduce additional semantic contextual feature fields, which enhance the quality and reliability of 2D-3D correspondences. Besides, we propose descriptor similarity distribution alignment to minimize the domain gap between 2D and 3D feature spaces during matching. Finally, we construct the matching graph using both complementary descriptors and contextual features to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondences for 6-DoF pose estimation. Compared with the recent NeRF-based approach, our method achieves a 3x faster training speed and a 45x reduction in model storage. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms or is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art NeRF-based visual localization methods."

Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions.

Such a formulation can well explore the DVS's advantages, as its event-triggered feature matches the nature of SCNN while the neuromorphic hardware enables efficient, low-power execution, making the system highly suitable for real-time embedded applications. Comparative analysis with traditional ARcode-based pose recognition methods reveals that our innovative approach demonstrates significant advantages in recognition speed and energy efficiency. The whole system is deployed on mobile robots and evaluated in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Research in visual perception has shown that the human visual system utilizes high-level feedback information to guide lower-level processing, enabling adaptation to signals of varying characteristics. Inspired by this, we propose the Feedback multi-Level feature EXtractor (Flex) to dynamically adjust feature selection in object detection based on image-wise and instance-level feedback information. This is particularly beneficial for applications such as aerial object detection, UAV-based target recognition and autonomous vehicle navigation, where global image quality issues like sensor degradation, foggy, or rainy conditions can impact detection performance. Flex adapts to variations in image quality, refining the feature extraction process to improve robustness against these challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that Flex consistently enhances a range of state-of-the-art methods on challenging aerial object detection datasets, including DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, and HRSC2016. Furthermore, additional experiments on MS COCO confirm the module's effectiveness in general object detection tasks. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that the improvements are strongly correlated with image quality, aligning with our original motivation to address global image quality issues in real-world scenarios."

While existing methods predominantly operate on RGB images, we propose a novel network that directly processes raw images, bypassing the need for the Image Signal Processor (ISP). This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations. This work represents the first attempt to develop a keypoint detection and feature description network specifically for raw images, offering a more efficient solution for resource-constrained environments."

In essence, we present a maximum entropy formulation and show how, under certain assumptions, this allows delayed decision-making to improve safety.

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction facilitates effective planning and decision-making, while constrained trajectory prediction integrates regulation into prediction. Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints."

Of the total compute time, a small fraction of it consumes GPU resources, enabling uninterrupted training. The safety layer is minimally invasive, correcting robot actions only when they are unsafe. To showcase the safety filter, we also introduce SplatBridge, an open-source software package built with ROS for real-time GSplat mapping for robots. We demonstrate the safety and robustness of our pipeline first in simulation, where our method is 20-50x faster, safer, and less conservative than competing methods based on neural radiance fields.

While recent research on autonomous exploration have achieved much progress, there are still limitations, e.g., existing methods relying on greedy heuristics or optimal path planning are often hindered by repetitive paths and high computational demands.To address such limitations, we propose a novel exploration framework that utilizes the global topology information of observed environment to improve exploration efficiency while reducing computational overhead.Specifically, global information is utilized based on a skeletal topological graph representation of the environment geometry. We first propose an incremental skeleton extraction method based on wavefront propagation, based on which we then design an approach to generate a lightweight topological graph that can effectively capture the environment's structural characteristics. Building upon this, we introduce a finite state machine that leverages the topological structure to efficiently plan coverage paths, which can substantially mitigate the back-and-forth maneuvers (BFMs) problem.

Existing coverage approaches reduce coverage time by covering along the minimum number of coverage lines (straight-line paths). However, recomputing such paths online can be computationally expensive resulting in robot stoppages that increase coverage time. A naive alternative is greedy detour replanning, i.e., replanning with minimum deviation from the initial path, which is efficient to compute but may result in unnecessary detours. In this work, we propose an anytime coverage replanning approach named OARP-Replan that performs near-optimal replans to an interrupted coverage path within a given time budget. We do this by solving linear relaxations of integer linear programs (ILPs) to identify sections of the interrupted path that can be optimally replanned within the time budget. We validate OARP-Replan in simulation and perform comparisons against a greedy detour replanner and other state-of-the-art coverage planners.

In this article, we introduce LeTac-MPC, a learning-based model predictive control (MPC) for tactile-reactive grasping. Our approach enables the gripper to grasp objects with different physical properties on dynamic and force-interactive tasks. We utilize a vision-based tactile sensor, GelSight (Yuan et al. 2017), which is capable of perceiving high-resolution tactile feedback that contains information on the physical properties and states of the grasped object. LeTac-MPC incorporates a differentiable MPC layer designed to model the embeddings extracted by a neural network from tactile feedback. This design facilitates convergent and robust grasping control at a frequency of 25 Hz. We propose a fully automated data collection pipeline and collect a dataset only using standardized blocks with different physical properties. However, our trained controller can generalize to daily objects with different sizes, shapes, materials, and textures. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. We compare LeTac-MPC with two purely model-based tactile-reactive controllers (MPC and PD) and open-loop grasping.

However, existing methods typically require the simultaneous acquisition of visual and tactile data, making it difficult to utilize low-cost, unpaired visual-tactile datasets. Moreover, these methods often rely on tactile sensors to provide input data for reinforcement learning (RL) during the physical deployment of robotic dexterous hands, which highly increases deployment costs. To address these challenges, we propose UpViTaL, an unpaired visual- tactile self-supervised representation learning method for RL- based robot dexterous manipulation. Specifically, we collect low-cost unpaired visual and tactile datasets for manipulation skill learning using a camera and tactile gloves on three robot manipulation tasks. The temporal tactile self-supervised representation learning module of UpViTaL is used to explore efficient tactile representations from time-series tactile data. In parallel, the visual pretraining module of UpViTaL helps to extract efficient visual representations from visual data. In addition, we fuse unpaired visual-tactile representations through an RL reward mechanism, which does not require robotic dexterous hands tactile sensors for practical deployment. We validate our approach on three dexterous robot manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that UpViTaL can efficiently learn robot manipulation skills. Compared to existing approaches for visual pretraining, our method significantly improves the success rate by more than 30%."

However, humans might be intimidated by the autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots due to perceived risks and a lack of trust. This paper proposed a trust-preserved shared autonomy strategy that allows robots to seamlessly adjust their autonomy level, striving to optimize team performance and enhance their acceptance among human collaborators. By enhancing the relational event modeling framework with Bayesian learning techniques, this paper enables dynamic inference of human trust based solely on time-stamped relational events communicated within human-robot teams. Adopting a longitudinal perspective on trust development and calibration in human-robot teams, the proposed trust-preserved shared autonomy strategy warrants robots to actively establish, maintain, and repair human trust, rather than merely passively adapting to it. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through a user study on a human-robot collaborative search and rescue scenario. The objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate its merits on both task execution and user acceptability over the baseline approach that does not consider the preservation of trust."

Denial caused greater discomfort than apology or compensation across both violation types. Dispositional trust influenced repair strategies effectiveness, particularly in willingness to engage and re-engage.

Furthermore, the Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Decision Trees classifiers exhibit consistently better performance in measuring the person's trust in the robot partner.

In the context of robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair strategies impact human trust. In this task, humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually control it while handling a secondary task. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long explanations, apology and promise, and denial. Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at preventing trust loss. We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems."

Therefore, a single grasp may not be sufficient for the entire path, and the object may need to be regrasped. Additionally, geometric data for objects from a sensor are usually available in the form of point clouds. The problem of computing grasps and regrasps from point-cloud representation of objects for complex manipulation tasks is a key problem in endowing robots with manipulation capabilities beyond pick-and-place. In this paper, we formalize the problem of grasping/regrasping for complex manipulation tasks with objects represented by (partial) point clouds and present an algorithm to solve it. We represent a complex manipulation task as a sequence of constant screw motions. Using a manipulation plan skeleton as a sequence of constant screw motions, we use a grasp metric to find graspable regions on the object for every constant screw segment. The overlap of the graspable regions for contiguous screws are then used to determine when and how many times the object needs to be regrasped. We present experimental results on point cloud data collected from RGB-D sensors to illustrate our approach."

    "paper_url": "",
    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "Robots powered by large language model (LLM) demonstrate significant research and application potential by effectively interpreting scene information to respond to human commands. However, when robots rely on static scene information during task execution, they face difficulties in adapting to changes in the environment, posing a major challenge for dynamic scene perception. To address the above issues, we propose an innovative interaction-driven approach to enhance robots' ability to perceive dynamic scene information. This approach consists of two contributions, the observation point selection module and the dynamic scene maintenance module. Specifically, first, the robot uses the 3D scene graph (3DSG) containing assets and objects to perceive static scene information through the LLM planner. Next, the best observation point for each asset is obtained through the observation point selection module. Then, with the help of the best observation point, the dynamic scene maintenance module interacts with the asset-related objects to dynamically update all the object node information related to the asset node. This approach enables robots to maintain dynamic scene information, enhancing their adaptability in unpredictable environments and improving task reliability.We evaluated our method using the iTHOR and RoboTHOR datasets within the AI2-THOR simulator and in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively and accurately maintains robots' perception of dynamic scene information."

    "abstract": "Planning a kinodynamically feasible path for a tractor-trailer vehicle is challenging for both search-based and learning-based methods due to the vehicle’s unique kinematics and complex obstacles. These factors increase the likelihood of infeasible paths and exacerbate long-horizon issues. We introduce ME-PATS: a framework that mutually enhances the search-based planner and the learning-based agent for tractor-trailer systems. The search-based planner provides successful trajectories to help the learning-based agent update its policy, while the agent improves the planner’s efficiency through direct path simulation. Additionally, we propose two approaches to apply our framework to more challenging tasks: designing obstacle-aware networks to enhance the learning-based agent’s capabilities, and combining the planner’s paths with the trained agent’s simulated paths through multi-segment integration.

    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "The recent introduction of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of robotics by enabling contextual reasoning and intuitive human-robot interaction in domains as varied as manipulation, locomotion, and self-driving vehicles. When viewed as a stand-alone technology, LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, wherein malicious prompters elicit harmful text by bypassing LLM safety guardrails. To assess the risks of deploying LLMs in robotics, in this paper, we introduce RoboPAIR, the first algorithm designed to jailbreak LLM-controlled robots. Unlike existing, textual attacks on LLM chatbots, RoboPAIR elicits harmful physical actions from LLM-controlled robots, a phenomenon we experimentally demonstrate in three scenarios: (i) a white-box setting, wherein the attacker has full access to the NVIDIA Dolphins self-driving LLM, (ii) a gray-box setting, wherein the attacker has partial access to a Clearpath Robotics Jackal UGV robot equipped with a GPT-4o planner, and (iii) a black-box setting, wherein the attacker has only query access to the GPT-3.5-integrated Unitree Robotics Go2 robot dog. In each scenario and across three new datasets of harmful robotic actions, we demonstrate that RoboPAIR, as well as several static baselines, finds jailbreaks quickly and effectively, often achieving 100% attack success rates. Our results reveal, for the first time, that the risks of jailbroken LLMs extend far beyond text generation, given the distinct possibility that jailbroken robots could cause physical damage in the real world. Indeed, our results on the Unitree Go2 represent the first successful jailbreak of a deployed commercial robotic system. Addressing this emerging vulnerability is critical for ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs in robotics. Additional media is available at: https://robopair.org."

Learning contact-rich skills involving tool use from internet data sources has typically been challenging due to the lack of physical information such as contact existence, location, areas, and force in this data. Prior works have generally used internet data and foundation models trained on this data to generate low-level robot behavior. We hypothesize that these data and models may be better suited to selecting among a set of basic robot behaviors to perform these contact-rich skills. We explore three methods of template selection: querying large language models, comparing video of robot execution to retrieved human video using features from a pretrained video encoder common in prior work, and performing the same comparison using features from an optic flow encoder trained on internet data. Our results show that LLMs are surprisingly capable template selectors despite their lack of visual information, optical flow encoding significantly outperforms video encoders trained with an order of magnitude more data, and important synergies exist between various forms of internet data for template selection. By exploiting these synergies, we create a template selector using multiple forms of internet data that achieves a 79% success rate on a set of 16 different cooking skills involving tool-use."

To enhance the validity of LLM-generated plans, visual demonstrations and online videos have been widely employed to guide the planning process. However, for manipulation tasks involving subtle movements but rich contact interactions, visual perception alone may be insufficient for the LLM to fully interpret the demonstration. Additionally, visual data provides limited information on force-related parameters and conditions, which are crucial for effective execution on real robots. In this paper, we introduce an in-context learning framework that incorporates tactile and force-torque information from human demonstrations to enhance the LLM's ability to generate plans for new task scenarios. We propose a bootstrapped reasoning pipeline that sequentially integrates each modality into a comprehensive task plan. This task plan is then used as a reference for planning in new task configurations. Real-world experiments on two different sequential manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving LLMs' understanding of multi-modal demonstrations and enhancing the overall planning performance."

LTLDoG leverages a satisfaction value function on LTLf and guides the sampling steps using its gradient field. This value function can also be trained to generalize to new instructions not observed during training, enabling flexible test-time adaptability. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation illustrate that the method is able to generate trajectories that satisfy formulae that specify obstacle avoidance and visitation sequences."

We build DARE upon an attention-based encoder and a diffusion model, and introduce ground truth optimal demonstrations for training to learn better patterns for exploration. The trained planner can reason about the partial belief to recognize the potential structure in unknown areas and consider these areas during path planning. Our experiments demonstrate that DARE achieves on-par performance with both conventional and learning-based state-of-the-art exploration planners, as well as good generalizability in both simulations and real-life scenarios."

    "abstract": "Visual navigation, a fundamental challenge in mobile robotics, demands versatile policies to handle diverse environments. Classical methods leverage geometric solutions to minimize specific costs, offering adaptability to new scenarios but are prone to system errors due to their multi-modular design and reliance on hand-crafted rules. Learning-based methods, while achieving high planning success rates, face difficulties in generalizing to unseen environments beyond the training data and often require extensive training. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of learning-based methods and classical approaches for RGB-only visual navigation. Our method first trains a conditional diffusion model on diverse path-RGB observation pairs. During inference, it integrates the gradients of differentiable scene-specific and task-level costs, guiding the diffusion model to generate valid paths that meet the constraints. This approach alleviates the need for retraining, offering a plug-and-play solution. Extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor settings, across simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate zero-shot transfer capability of our approach, achieving higher success rates and fewer collisions compared to baseline methods.

Existing reinforcement learning methods cannot be directly transferred to new environments, as they typically rely on extensive mapping and exploration, leading to time-consuming and inefficient.

By integrating a large vision-language model with a diffusion network, our approach named NavigateDiff constructs a visual predictor that continuously predicts the agent's potential observations in the next step which can assist robots generate robust actions. Furthermore, to adapt the temporal property of navigation, we introduce temporal historical information to ensure that the predicted image is aligned with the navigation scene. We then carefully designed an information fusion framework that embeds the predicted future frames as guidance into goal-reaching policy to solve downstream image navigation tasks. This approach enhances navigation control and generalization across both simulated and real-world environments. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our method, showcasing its potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of robotic navigation in diverse settings.

However, these techniques often struggle to adapt behavior to new preferences or changes in the environment. To address these limitations, we propose Fine-tuning Diffusion Policy with Human Preference (FDPP). FDPP learns a reward function through preference-based learning. This reward is then used to fine-tune the pre-trained policy with reinforcement learning (RL), resulting in alignment of pre-trained policy with new human preferences while still solving the original task. Our experiments across various robotic tasks and preferences demonstrate that FDPP effectively customizes policy behavior without compromising performance. Additionally, we show that incorporating Kullback–Leibler (KL) regularization during fine-tuning prevents over-fitting and helps maintain the competencies of the initial policy."

    "abstract": "Advances in robot learning have enabled robots to generate skills for a variety of tasks. Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient, struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast, agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning, achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis. In simulated air hockey, we achieved a 25.4% increase in block rate, while in table tennis, we achieved a 17.3% increase in success rate compared to imitation learning baselines."

    "abstract": "This work presents a high-level navigation framework for bipedal robot that accounts for terrain uncertainty in footstep planning and motion control. Given a terrain map estimated via Gaussian Process (GP) model with nonstationary kernel, we leverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct tighter coverage guarantee intervals containing the true terrain elevations. We also formulate a soft CP constraint to ensure safe foot height changes between successive footfalls with probabilistic guarantee. Additionally, we model the CP coverage intervals as a bounded disturbance model which are incorporated into linear inverted pendulum plus flywheel (LIP) model. Given the LIP model with bounded disturbances arising from uncertain terrain, we formulate a flywheel torque control law using Control Contraction Metrics (CCMs). We then design a Robust Control Invariant (RCI) Tube around the desired Center of Mass (CoM) phase-space trajectory, defining a region in which the system states can be stabilized by the flywheel torque control law. This ensures the maintenance of a constant CoM height (or constant surface slope) despite terrain uncertainty. The overall framework results in an uncertainty-informed Model Predictive Controller (MPC) provides probabilistic safety guarantees, enabling robust locomotion across uncertain environments. This approach enhances the robot’s ability to navigate complex, unstructured terrains while maintaining stability in real-world deployment."

    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion/flow policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories for robotic control. However, they are slow because they sample a trajectory of trajectories—a diffusion/flow trajectory of robot trajectories. They discard intermediate robot trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. In this work, we propose a novel framework that simplifies diffusion/flow policies by treating robot trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm starts from the current robot configuration, and incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of robot configurations that constitute a single trajectory. This enables computed actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, for significantly faster and reactive policies. It is well-suited for receding horizon control where we can adaptively generate only as many actions as are executed on the robot, and no more. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We show that training flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories reduces distribution shift and improves imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior diffusion/flow policies on imitation learning benchmarks while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor control loops."

We conducted a pilot user study with 12 participants, where a robot approached the participant from the front or side using one of five cue strategies. Subjective ratings (comfort, trust, clarity, predictability, and proxemics) and objective measures (hesitation, passing time) were collected. Results indicate that trajectory cues led to the highest perceived comfort and clarity, while sudden stops and no cues caused more confusion and hesitation.

Studies on human-machine teams demonstrate that human perceptions of a machine teammate are critical in governing the machine's performance. Consequently, it is essential to identify the factors that contribute to positive human perceptions in human-machine teams. Here, we present a mixed factorial design to assess human perceptions of a MEDEVAC robot in a simulated evacuation scenario. Participants were assigned to the role of casualty (CAS) or bystander (BYS) and subjected to three within-subjects conditions based on the MEDEVAC robot's operating mode: autonomous-slow (AS), autonomous-fast (AF), and teleoperation (TO). During each trial, a MEDEVAC robot navigated an 11-meter path, acquiring a casualty and transporting them to an ambulance exchange point while avoiding an idle bystander. Following each trial, subjects completed a questionnaire measuring their emotional states, perceived safety, and social compatibility with the robot. Results indicate a consistent main effect of operating mode on reported emotional states and perceived safety. Pairwise analyses suggest that the employment of the AF operating mode negatively impacted perceptions along these dimensions. There were no persistent differences between CAS and BYS responses."

Less attention has been paid to settings where mobile robots and humans share the space. This paper introduces a new robot-centered directional framework of human safety. It is particularly useful for evaluating mobile robots as they operate in environments populated by multiple humans. The framework integrates several key metrics, such as each human's relative distance, speed, and orientation. The core novelty lies in the framework's flexibility to accommodate different application requirements while allowing for both the robot-centered and external observer points of view. We instantiate the framework by using RGB-D based vision integrated with a deep learning-based human detection pipeline to yield a proxemics-guided generalized safety index (GSI) that instantaneously assesses human safety. We extensively validate GSI's capability of producing appropriate and fine-grained safety measures in real-world experimental scenarios and demonstrate its superior efficacy against extant safety models."

However, it would be more natural if the device could infer intent implicitly. Prior work has explored intent prediction using different sensor modalities, such as electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and inertial measurement units (IMUs). Some vision-based approaches rely on external cameras to analyze human action from a third person perspective. While these methods can provide useful insights, they either focus only on body signals without considering environmental context or require external cameras that are impractical for wearable robotics. In contrast, first-person vision offers a direct perspective of how users interact with their surroundings, yet it remains underexplored in intent inference research. We propose a hybrid approach that utilizes a Bayesian network to probabilistically fuse first-person visual context with body motion data to understand human intent. Unlike some prior work that uses computer vision only for perception, our approach reasons about the contextual affordances of objects in environment and integrates it with human motion to improve both prediction accuracy and explainability.

    "abstract": "This study presents a robotic ultrasound imaging system designed to enhance diagnostic image quality through arc-based scanning trajectories and 3D reconstruction. Building on prior work in robotic linear ultrasound for musculoskeletal imaging, we introduce an arc scanning approach that aligns more perpendicularly to curved anatomical surfaces—such as finger joints—thereby improving bone and soft tissue visualization. Our integrated system combines a GE Vivid E95 ultrasound scanner with a Universal Robots UR3 robotic arm to perform automated B-mode, Color Flow Mapping (CFM), and photoacoustic scans. The scanning procedure consists of initial alignment, trajectory execution, motion compensation, and volume reconstruction, with interpolation based on proximity-weighted pixels from the nearest planes. We conducted phantom, volunteer, and patient studies to evaluate performance. Quantitative results from phantom scans demonstrated that the arc scan offers sharper boundary contrast. In both volunteer and patient cases, arc scans consistently produced more continuous and symmetric bone surfaces with uniform soft tissue appearance in B-mode imaging. However, CFM scans revealed fewer motion artifacts and clearer vascular signals in linear trajectories, suggesting arc-induced mechanical wave artifacts. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of each trajectory, motivating future work on hybrid scanning that integrates both linear and arc paths for optimized diagnostics."

While Vietoris-Rips complexes offer computational efficiency and Cˇech complexes capture topological features more accurately, combining these tools within a Discrete Morse Theory framework allows for simplification and identification of critical points in the configuration space without changing the topology of the structure. A central motivation for this work is the search for a simplicial complex that balances the topological accuracy of Cech complexes with the lower computational demands of Vietoris-Rips complexes. While creating such a complex is a challenging task, this trade-off drives the development of more efficient and accurate representations of space for robotics. Additionally, this research addresses the difficulty of identifying local minima and maxima in higher-dimensional settings, extending the utility of Discrete Morse Theory. Building on these ideas, we explore hybrid approaches involving Delaunay-Cˇech filtrations and Discrete Gradient Vector Fields to create more adaptive topological representations."

The tensegrity robot, constructed from a synergistic assembly of rigid rods and elastic cables, is designed for high-impact tolerance and shape morphing. To accurately capture both the global pose and internal shape of the robot in real time, our approach fuses high-frequency inertial measurements from onboard IMUs with precise cable length data from motor encoders. An optimization-based shape reconstruction algorithm—enforced by rigorous geometric and chirality constraints—is employed to estimate the endcap positions in the body frame, overcoming the complexities inherent in its continuously deforming configuration. To further enhance the estimator's robustness, the forward kinematics from shape reconstruction is integrated into a contact-aided Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework. This filter leverages detected endcap-ground contact events to correct state estimates via forward kinematics, ensuring improved accuracy even in scenarios with camera occlusions or degraded environmental conditions. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the proposed framework, achieving an average drift of approximately 4.2% while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for onboard autonomous operations.

While terrain dynamics are often modeled using physics-based approaches like Bekker models, such methods are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time use. Moreover, streaming data may contain rare or regime-specific events critical for effective modeling and control. This work addresses the challenge of updating Koopman operator-based models in real time without overwhelming memory and computational resources. Rather than storing all incoming data or discarding potentially useful samples, we propose a batch update method that selectively incorporates only informative datasets. Novelty in dynamics is detected using the Grassmannian distance between subspaces, enabling efficient identification of meaningful regime shifts. Our approach significantly reduces data volume and computational load while preserving model accuracy. Additionally, it includes basis function learning to optimize the Koopman representation. The framework is validated on simulated systems, demonstrating effective online learning, reduced model complexity, and improved prediction and control performance in off-road environments."

The existing methods mainly focused on the development of model-based frameworks (e.g. Finite element analysis) and the use of force sensing to build a shape prediction model. However, these models are either computationally expensive or susceptible to the changes of tool configurations and tissue properties. To overcome this problem, we present an entirely data-driven method for soft-tissue surface prediction during robot palpation. We implement a multi-layer perceptron model to learn the complex relationship between the tool’s configuration (position and orientation) and the resulting surface deformation. Given a robot configuration and a local surface geometry around the contact center, the model can predict 3D displacement vectors of the pre-deform surfaces. We conducted simulation experiments to evaluate the model performance based on the various palpation angles between -40◦ and +40◦ and different tool penetration depths from 0.3 mm to 1.9 mm. The results show an average root mean square error of approximately 0.01 mm and an average maximum error less than 0.03 mm. This can demonstrate the feasibility of using a generic multi-layer perceptron model to learn the tool-tissue physics and shows potential applications of fast surface inference and deformation prediction during robot palpation."

To overcome this, we propose a novel approach that constructs and utilizes databases of solutions for smaller sub-problems. By focusing on interactions between fewer robots, our method reduces the required database size compared to one that captures the full MRMP problem, enabling efficient handling of more complex scenarios. We validate our approach with experiments on mobile and manipulator robots, showing significant improvements in scalability and efficiency. Our method improves over its previous version with up to 40% faster planning and over existing experience-based methods with a 342× faster database construction and 2× faster planning. Our contributions include a rapidly constructed database for low-dimensional MRMP problems, a framework for applying these solutions to larger problems, and experimental validation with up to 32 mobile and 16 manipulator robots."

    "abstract": "Mobility assistance is one of the major supports for elderly and differently abled communities. Since wheelchairs are primarily used in human-centered areas, there is a significant risk of accidents caused by the wheelchair itself and by other pedestrians in the vicinity. To address this serious issue, this work proposes utilizing spherical camera data for environmental perception. However, incorporating spherical data may introduce additional challenges to the topic. The use of omnidirectional cameras is currently very limited for navigational purposes and for scene understanding. However, the equirectangular transformation of spherical data can help understand the surrounding environment. Moreover, these images offer better insight into the direction of a pedestrian's motion and the distance. The study proposes an architecture to extract spatial connections between the wheelchair and nearby pedestrians by identifying visual features and tracking the subjects' movements relative to the wheelchair. This method can easily detect when a pedestrian is approaching a wheelchair or passing nearby without entering a danger zone, and the proposed architecture was able to achieve over 95% accuracy at an average processing frame rate of 15 FPS. Thus, this demonstrates the potential of spherical image data, which can be further enhanced to make intelligent decisions by electric wheelchairs and reduce cognitive load on the user to make their life more comfortable."

However, noisy IMU measurements hinder accurate gravity compensation, which is critical for precise odometry. This paper presents a fully SO(3)-equivariant neural network framework for IMU-only odometry, designed to improve generalization across varying IMU mount orientations and mitigate challenges in gravity compensation. By representing IMU data in the Lie algebra and leveraging the symmetry properties of the rotation Lie group, the proposed method enforces 3D rotational symmetry within the feature space, leading to accurate state estimation in general unseen trajectories. Experimental results on diverse human motion datasets further demonstrate that our approach is more robust to gravitational perturbation on the IMU measurement, effectively reducing drift accumulation over the sequences. It remains robust under arbitrary IMU installation orientations, outperforming existing methods that rely on data augmentation or frame canonicalization. These improvements are achieved with a more compact network architecture, reducing computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The results of this work enable reliable inertial position and orientation tracking in mobile robotics applications that have dynamic yaw direction motion with limited sensing capabilities."

Tactile sensing can address this, but existing methods typically involve high integration complexity or compromise gripper compliance. There is a clear need for developing sensorized compliant grippers without sacrificing simplicity. We address this by embedding 3D-printed air channels within Fin-Ray fingers. These channels act as force and slip sensors, providing precise, real-time feedback while remaining simple to fabricate and integrate. Our system estimates grip force with a RMSE under 0.2 N and incorporates an analytical slip detector using second-order spectral features of tactile vibrations. We evaluate the system on an autonomous grasp-and-lift task using 31 objects spanning categories of fragile, slippery, and ordinary. Across 310 trials, our slip detector achieved 0.93 accuracy and 1.0 precision. Our system achieved 91.9% overall success and 98.6% on fragile objects. In contrast, a on-off strategy caused breakage of 84.6% of fragile objects, while a naive initial 0.25 N grip force yielded only 1.25% success on ordinary objects. These results demonstrate that our design combines accurate, real-time tactile feedback with the inherent compliance of the Fin-Ray structure, enabling reliable manipulation of delicate and diverse objects."

We propose a novel algorithm to achieve safe and scalable control for multiple agents under limited actuation. Specifically, our approach includes: (i) learning a decentralized neural Integral Control Barrier function (neural ICBF) for scalable, input-constrained control, (ii) embedding a lightweight decentralized Model Predictive Control-based Integral Control Barrier Function (MPC-ICBF) into the neural network policy to ensure safety while maintaining scalability, and (iii) introducing a novel method to minimize deadlocks based on gradient-based optimization techniques from machine learning to address local minima in deadlocks.

The prediction module predicts the trajectories of the targets, which do not overlap with static and dynamic obstacles. Then the trajectory planner outputs a trajectory, ensuring various conditions such as occlusion and collision avoidance, the visibility of all targets within a camera image and dynamical limits. We fully test the proposed tracker in simulations and hardware experiments under challenging scenarios, including dual-target following, environments with dozens of dynamic obstacles and complex indoor and outdoor spaces."

    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "Accurate and robust localization and mapping are essential components for most autonomous robots. In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU."

    "abstract": "We present the first algorithm to efficiently compute certifiably optimal solutions to range-aided simultaneous localization and mapping (RA-SLAM) problems. Robotic navigation systems increasingly incorporate point-to-point ranging sensors, leading to state estimation problems in the form of RA-SLAM. However, the RA-SLAM problem is significantly more difficult to solve than traditional pose-graph SLAM: ranging sensor models introduce non-convexity and single range measurements do not uniquely determine the transform between the involved sensors. As a result, RA-SLAM inference is sensitive to initial estimates yet lacks reliable initialization techniques. Our approach, certifiably correct RA-SLAM (CORA), leverages a novel quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) formulation of RA-SLAM to relax the RA-SLAM problem to a semidefinite program (SDP). CORA solves the SDP efficiently using the Riemannian Staircase methodology; the SDP solution provides both (i) a lower bound on the RA-SLAM problem's optimal value, and (ii) an approximate solution of the RA-SLAM problem, which can be subsequently refined using local optimization. CORA applies to problems with arbitrary pose-pose, pose-landmark, and ranging measurements and, due to using convex relaxation, is insensitive to initialization. We evaluate CORA on several real-world problems. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches, CORA is able to obtain high-quality solutions on all problems despite being initialized with random values. Additionally, we study the tightness of the SDP relaxation with respect to important problem parameters: the number of (i) robots, (ii) landmarks, and (iii) range measurements. These experiments demonstrate that the SDP relaxation is often tight and reveal relationships between graph connectivity and the tightness of the SDP relaxation."

We start modeling the SLAM problem with a Bayesian batch estimator, and then split it into two submodules, localization and mapping, of different scales and processing rates, however, can thus run concurrently. The estimation consistency is taken into account in decoupling the two submodules so that when loop closure occurs the localization accuracy can seamlessly benefit from the mapping result via online global optimization, which distinguishes our solution from the others. To this end, we design the corresponding front-end and back-end to consistently solve localization and mapping in parallel, especially the hybrid robocentric and world-centric formulations are used for modeling the respective problems. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using both the synthetic data generated for Monte-Carlo simulations and diverse real datasets acquired in highly-dynamic, long-term, and large-scale SLAM scenarios. Simulation results validate the significantly improved consistency and accuracy by applying our method. Experimental results show the better (competitive at least) performance against a state-of-the-art method, while being capable of processing a huge amount of measurements in building large-scale maps without blocking the high-accuracy real-time localization outputs."

The main contribution compared to prior CDPR pose estimation EKF methods is that the L-EKF framework does not require an iterative forward kinematics algorithm to be solved each time step, reducing the computation time of the EKF. Moreover, the L-EKF is amenable to the inclusion of colored measurement noise, which provides a more realistic quantification of the kinematic uncertainty present in the cable-length measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the L-EKF is computationally more efficient than previous forward-kinematics-based EKF methods, as well as the moderate improvement in pose estimation provided by the colored noise model."

While category-level pose estimation based on RGBD data has achieved good performance in recent years, estimating poses solely from RGB images remains a significant challenge. Existing RGB-based category-level methods primarily focus on recovering object point clouds from RGB images, and pose prediction is not performed end-to-end by a network. This paper presents a Category-level and Instance-level Pose Estimation Network (CIPE), which models pose estimation as a set prediction problem and enables direct pose regression from RGB images. To further enhance the network's ability to learn object poses, first, a novel learnable rotation representation that redefines rotation learning within Euclidean space is introduced to facilitate rotation regression. Additionally, we propose a prior-query fusion strategy that utilizes a pre-trained point cloud feature extraction network to integrate categorical object features with bounding boxes, thereby improving the incorporation of category information. Experimental results demonstrate that CIPE significantly outperforms existing RGB-based methods on both category-level and instance-level datasets.

To address this, we introduce MonoLDP, a novel system that leverages monocular cameras for depth estimation, mutual pose estimation, and visible light communication in indoor environments, providing an integrated framework to overcome these limitations. MonoLDP features a two-stage network: (1) a depth estimation module that infers depth from monocular images, and (2) a depth-guided 3D object recognition network for agent-relative localization and pose estimation. We created a custom dataset to validate the accuracy of MonoLDP. On our indoor dataset, MonoLDP outperforms the baseline by 43.39% in 3D detection and 42.39% in bird’s-eye view detection, with an average localization error of 0.104m and an orientation error of 1.66 degrees. Moreover, the depth estimation network demonstrates excellent performance on the NYU v2 dataset. Additionally, the system achieves a communication rate of 1.2 Kbps with a bit error rate below 10^(-2) at a distance of up to 4 meters using LED arrays.

Additionally, 3D sensor-based approaches, particularly point cloud registration (PCR), face challenges such as initial pose errors, high-latency inference, and difficulties in object identification based purely on geometric features. To address these limitations, we propose LCSPose, a LiDAR-camera fusion-based 6-DoF pose estimation method that is marker-free, accurate, efficient, and scalable. Our approach integrates three key modules: (1) a semantic-geometric segmentation module for spreader segmentation and outlier removal, (2) a spatial consistency template sampling module based on Spatial Consistency Score (SC-Score) for reliable template selection across varying distances, and (3) a multi-view coarse-to-fine pose refinement module which incorporates multi-view PCA alignment for robust initial posture prior estimation and iterative pose refinement strategy for long-range registration.

The workpieces in bin-picking are typically textureless and randomly stacked in a bin, which poses a significant challenge to 6D pose estimation. Existing solutions are typically learning-based methods, which require object-specific training. Their efficiency of practical deployment for novel workpieces is highly limited by data collection and model retraining. Zero-shot 6D pose estimation is a potential approach to address the issue of deployment efficiency. Nevertheless, existing zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods are designed to leverage feature matching to establish point-to-point correspondences for pose estimation, which is less effective for workpieces with textureless appearances and ambiguous local regions. In this paper, we propose ZeroBP, a zero-shot pose estimation framework designed specifically for the bin-picking task. ZeroBP learns Position-Aware Correspondence (PAC) between the scene instance and its CAD model, leveraging both local features and global positions to resolve the mismatch issue caused by ambiguous regions with similar shapes and appearances. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that ZeroBP outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot pose estimation methods, achieving an improvement of 9.1% in average recall of correct poses."

However, conventional approaches rely on the accuracy of the modeling equations and are not adaptable to changes in the magnet's properties, which can occur due to factors like non-uniformity in the marker material or temperature fluctuations within the PMM. These constraints make it challenging to apply the PMM across diverse medical techniques. In this work, we introduce a novel two-stage PMM localization scheme, called Virtual Frame Rotation (VFR), designed to address this issue. VFR employs an approach that virtually rotates the observation frame of the hall sensors' output vector and checks the symmetry of the magnetic field in the rotated frame. This approach allows for robust pose estimation of the condition with variance in magnetic properties, as verified by comparing its localization performance with the conventional approach in the simulation and the real-world environments with temperature variance conditions. Based on these characteristics, VFR can expand the scope of medical applications that involve changes in the properties of magnetic markers, such as the in-body localization of magnetic macro particles for hyperthermia treatment."

However, existing computational methods struggle to accurately and efficiently analyze the highly dynamic, complex, and fine structures of sperm flagella, especially when portions of the flagellum become invisible due to three-dimensional out-of-focus beating. This paper proposes an automated high-throughput tool for quantitative analysis of sperm flagellar beating. The core innovation is continuous convolution (CConv), which adaptively captures the irregular, time-varying patterns of sperm flagella while ensuring continuity in segmentation outputs, even in the presence of locally invisible regions caused by out-of-focus motion. CConv can be integrated into various neural network architectures as a plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating CConv consistently improves the accuracy and continuity of flagella segmentation across different networks. Furthermore, utilizing a curvature-based approach, we quantified key flagellar beating parameters, including length, amplitude, frequency, and wavelength. Applying the high-throughput tool on 1200 sperm revealed that sperm from fertile donors had significantly higher flagellar beating frequency than sperm from infertile patients. The proposed automated tool unlocks high-throughput, quantitative analysis of sperm flagellar beating, showing the potential for applications in reproductive biology and engineering research."

Biologists attribute this to a chain of segmental neuron clusters (ganglia) within insect nervous systems, which act as distributed, self-organizing sensorimotor control units. Inspired by the neural structure of the Carausius morosus, the common stick insect, this research introduces the Distributed Neural Locomotion Controller (D-NLC), a modular control framework utilizing local proprioceptive feedback to modulate joint-level Central Pattern Generator (CPG) signals to produce emergent locomotive behaviors. We implemented this framework using a modular legged robot with distributed joint-level embedded computing units and assessed its performance and behavior under various experimental settings. Based on real-world experiments, we observe an overall 31.3% average increase in curvilinear motion performance under external (terrain) and internal (amputation) disturbances compared to a centralized predefined gait controller. This difference is statistically significant (P<<0.05) for larger perturbations but not for single-leg amputations. Experiments with perturbation-induced leg stance duration and leg-phase-difference analysis further validated our hypothesis regarding D-NLC's role in the robust perceptive locomotion and self-emergent gait adaptation against complex unforeseen perturbations. This proposed control framework does not require any numerical optimization or weight training processes, which are time-consuming and computationally expensive. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first bio-inspired neural controller deployed on a distributed embedded system."

We propose a hierarchical-MPC-based scheme that analyzes and detects instability in the prediction window and quickly recovers through adapting gait frequency. Our approach integrates a high-level nonlinear MPC, a posture-aware gait frequency adaptation planner, and a low-level convex locomotion MPC. The planners predict the center of mass (CoM) state trajectories that can be assessed for precursors of potential instability and posture deviation. In simulation, we demonstrate improved maximum recoverable impulse by 131% on average compared with baseline approaches. In hardware experiments, a 125 ms advancement in recovery stepping timing/reflex has been observed with the proposed approach.

    "abstract": "Aerial humanoid robots can enhance the efficiency and safety of rescue operations in disaster scenarios. The control of such complex machines presents many challenges, for instance, the control of the different locomotion strategies and the stabilization of the transition maneuvers. In this article, we present an online nonlinear Model Predictive Controller and the relative prediction model to stabilize walking and flying trajectories. The controller uses a reduced model to generate feasible base link references, thrust profiles, and contact forces while dealing with different locomotion strategies and transition maneuvers. The control algorithm is tested in a simulated environment using our aerial humanoid robot iRonCub under the effect of external disturbances. The proposed control strategy demonstrates to effectively stabilize the desired trajectories while keeping the problem still treatable online."

    "abstract": "Humanoid robots offer significant advantages for search and rescue tasks, thanks to their capability to traverse rough terrains and perform transportation tasks. In this study, we present a task and motion planning framework for search and rescue operations using a heterogeneous robot team composed of humanoids and aerial robots. We propose a terrain-aware Model Predictive Controller (MPC) that incorporates terrain elevation gradients learned using Gaussian processes (GP). This terrain-aware MPC generates safe navigation paths for the bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain while minimizing terrain slopes, and it directs the quadrotors to perform aerial search and mapping tasks. The rescue subjects' locations are estimated by a target belief GP, which is updated online during the map exploration. A high-level planner for task allocation is designed by encoding the navigation tasks using syntactically cosafe Linear Temporal Logic (scLTL), and a consensus-based algorithm is designed for task assignment of individual robots. We evaluate the efficacy of our planning framework in simulation in an uncertain environment with various terrains and random rescue subject placements."

A common way of achieving this is linear model predictive control (LMPC), where a quadratic programming (QP) problem is formulated over a finite horizon with a quadratic cost and linear constraints obtained by linearizing the equations of motion and solved on the fly. However, the model linearization may lead to model inaccuracies. In this paper, we use the Koopman operator to create a linear model of the quadrupedal system in high dimensional space which preserves the nonlinearity of the equations of motion. Then using LMPC, we demonstrate high fidelity tracking and disturbance rejection on a quadrupedal robot. This is the first work that uses the Koopman operator theory for LMPC of quadrupedal locomotion."

This paper presents a real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that addresses both body and foot avoidance for dynamic bipedal robots. Our contribution is two-fold: we introduce (1) a novel formulation for adjusting step timing to facilitate faster body avoidance and (2) a novel 3D foot-avoidance formulation that implicitly selects swing trajectories and footholds that either steps over or navigate around obstacles with awareness of Center of Mass (COM) dynamics. We achieve body avoidance by applying a half-space relaxation of the safe region but introduce a switching heuristic based on tracking error to detect a need to change foot-timing schedules. To enable foot avoidance and viable landing footholds on all sides of foot-level obstacles, we decompose the non-convex safe region on the ground into several convex polygons and use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming to determine the optimal candidate. We found that introducing a soft minimum-travel-distance constraint is effective in preventing the MPC from being trapped in local minima that can stall half-space relaxation methods behind obstacles. We demonstrated the proposed algorithms on multibody simulations on the bipedal robot platforms, Cassie and Digit, as well as hardware experiments on Digit."

Active vision, leveraging strategic camera movements and adaptive imaging parameters, holds great potential for addressing critical challenges such as achieving high accuracy in precise manipulation, ensuring low latency for rapid responsiveness, and overcoming occlusions and illumination variations in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a novel, cost-effective, and easily deployable active vision system designed to enhance visual perception for robotic applications. Integrated with a novel hybrid software setup, the system utilizes ArUco markers to achieve high-accuracy, low-latency performance, boasting sub-millimeter and sub-degree accuracy at 200 Hz with a latency of less than 15 ms. Additionally, a new measurement and evaluation procedure is presented, offering benchmarking for marker-based object detection systems that for the first time includes rotation measurements as well. The benchmarking results for the proposed system indicate that achieving the desired performance levels necessitates specialized active vision measurement strategies. For instance, to ensure high positional accuracy, the system needs precise object centering, while high rotational accuracy requires accounting for lateral or rotational offsets."

    "abstract": "Interactable objects are ubiquitous in our daily lives. Recent advances in 3D generative models make it possible to automate the modeling of these objects, benefiting a range of applications from 3D printing to the creation of robot simulation environments. However, while significant progress has been made in modeling 3D shapes and appearances, modeling object physics, particularly for interactable objects, remains challenging due to the physical constraints imposed by inter-part motions. In this paper, we tackle the problem of physically plausible part completion for interactable objects, aiming to generate 3D parts that not only fit precisely into the object but also allow smooth part motions. To this end, we propose a diffusion-based part generation model that utilizes geometric conditioning through classifier-free guidance and formulates physical constraints as a set of stability and mobility losses to guide the sampling process. Additionally, we demonstrate the generation of dependent parts, paving the way toward sequential part generation for objects with complex part-whole hierarchies. Experimentally, we introduce a new metric for measuring physical plausibility based on motion success rates. Our model outperforms existing baselines over shape and physical metrics, especially those that do not adequately model physical constraints. We also demonstrate our applications in 3D printing, robot manipulation, and sequential part generation, showing our strength in realistic tasks with the demand for high physical plausibility."

However, existing methods often struggle with unknown objects and require retraining, limiting their practicality. Traditional 3D point-pair feature methods, while training-free, perform poorly with textured symmetric objects. We propose a generalizable approach for zero-shot 6D pose estimation without retraining. Our method consists of two steps: generating CAD-based templates through real-time rendering for coarse pose estimation, and refining poses using semantic point-pair features aligned with the camera viewpoint. We conducted experiments on seven core datasets from the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation (BOP) challenge, and the results are publicly available on the BOP website. Integration into a robotic grasping system further highlights its high precision and fast execution, making it idealfor applications such as bin-picking."

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D pose estimation of grasped objects is an important prerequisite for robots to perform assembly or in-hand manipulation tasks, but object occlusion by the robot's own hand greatly increases the difficulty of this perceptual task. Here, we propose that combining visual information and proprioception with binary, low-resolution tactile contact measurements from across the interior surface of an articulated robotic hand can mitigate this issue. The visuo-tactile object-pose-estimation problem is formulated probabilistically in a factor graph. The pose of the object is optimized to align with the three kinds of measurements using a robust cost function to reduce the influence of visual or tactile outlier readings. The advantages of the proposed approach are first demonstrated in simulation: a custom 15-DoF robot hand with one binary tactile sensor per link grasps 17 YCB objects while observed by an RGB-D camera. This low-resolution in-hand tactile sensing significantly improves object-pose estimates under high occlusion and also high visual noise. We also show these benefits through grasping tests with a preliminary real version of our tactile hand, obtaining reasonable visuo-tactile estimates of object pose at approximately 13.3 Hz on average."

    "abstract": "Accurate 6D object pose estimation is crucial in industrial automation, particularly in robotic bin picking, where objects are often textureless, reflective, and arranged in cluttered environments. Multi-view pose estimation methods offer significant advantages over single-view methods by providing more comprehensive information, effectively handling occlusions and lack of features, and resolving depth ambiguities. However, current multi-view methods often rely on late-stage information fusion, limiting their ability to fully exploit complementary multi-view data. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance multi-view 6D pose estimation by introducing a Feature Exchange Transformer (FET) for early-stage feature fusion. This approach leverages self-attention and epipolar cross-attention mechanisms to enable multi-layer feature aggregation across views. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy for an efficient feature exchange at multiple network layers. Our method, implemented on top of EpiSurfEmb, enhances the utilization of multi-view information, leading to significant improvements in pose estimation accuracy and robustness, especially in challenging bin-picking scenarios. We evaluate our approach on the ROBI dataset, demonstrating that it outperforms both the baseline EpiSurfEmb and other state-of-the-art multi-view pose estimation methods"

This paper introduces FitnessAgent, a unified agent framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional systems that rely on pre-trained neural networks or fixed rule-based criteria, FitnessAgent can assess any exercise without prior training, adapting evaluation metrics based on expert knowledge and user-specific requirements. The system breaks down fitness evaluation tasks into combinations of metrics, each calculated using measurable operators such as angles, distances, and positions. By leveraging a set of primitive, exercise-agnostic operators, a large language model (LLM)-based planner dynamically selects and combines these operators for each task. The open-set capability of FitnessAgent is validated through experiments on both the widely-used Functional Movement Screen dataset and a newly collected isometric pose dataset. Results highlight the system's flexibility in handling new movements and its ability to adapt to personalized evaluation criteria without the need for code or algorithm modifications. FitnessAgent offers a scalable and personalized solution for fitness evaluation, making it well-suited for robotic applications that require adaptability to diverse user needs."

Although the majority of these problems may be solved with individually tailored traditional computer vision algorithms, developing and running a suite of these algorithms is challenging and resource demanding. Therefore, our proposed solution capitalizes on a single underlying implementation that need only be extended by adding queries. We validate our approach using a custom dataset of over 1,300 annotated images from various locations around Barcelona, reporting performance across different urban navigation tasks.

Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small drones. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors (<100 g). We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking."

Unlike unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, where the agent individual is able to move freely, IAPs connect UAV agents with mechanical joints, such as spherical joints, and form a rigid central platform, limiting the degree of freedom (DOF) of agents. Traditional methods, which rely on forming loop closures, object detection, or range sensors, suffer from degeneration or inefficiency due to the restricted relative motion between agents. In this paper, we present a centralized multi-agent localization system that fuses the internal kinematic constraints of IAPs and odometry measurements, using only visual-inertial suits for ego-motion estimation for agents and an additional 9-DOF Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) attached to the central platform for posture estimation. A general formulation for kinematic constraints is derived without requiring knowledge about detailed kinematic parameters. A sliding-window optimization-based state estimator is constructed to estimate the relative transformation between agents. Our proposed approach is validated in our collected dataset. The results show that the proposed method reduces the global localization drift by 27.15% and relative localization error by 53.4% in the translation part and 36.99% in the rotation part compared to the baseline."

During execution, such an action is handled by a provided human-designed or learned closed-loop behavior. Execution combines offline planned motions and online behaviors till reaching the task goal. Failures of behaviors are fed back as constraints to find new plans. Forty real-robot trials and motivating demonstrations are performed to evaluate the proposed framework and compare against state-of-the-art. Results show faster execution time, less number of actions, and more success in problems where diverse gaps arise. The experiment data is shared for researchers to simulate these settings. The work shows promise in expanding the applicable class of realistic partially grounded problems that robots can address."

    "abstract": "Task and motion planning (TAMP) frameworks address long and complex planning problems by integrating high-level task planners with low-level motion planners. However, existing TAMP methods rely heavily on the manual design of planning domains that specify the preconditions and postconditions of all high-level actions. This paper proposes a method to automate planning domain inference from a handful of test-time trajectory demonstrations, reducing the reliance on human design. Our approach incorporates a deep learning-based estimator that predicts the appropriate components of a domain for a new task and a search algorithm that refines this prediction, reducing the size and ensuring the utility of the inferred domain. Our method can generate new domains from minimal demonstrations at test time, enabling robots to handle complex tasks more efficiently. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms behavior cloning baselines, which directly imitate planner behavior, in terms of planning performance and generalization across a variety of tasks. Additionally, our method reduces computational costs and data amount requirements at test time for inferring new planning domains."

In domestic settings, aligning task planning with user reminders poses significant challenges due to the limited quantity, diversity, and multimodal nature of the reminders. To address these challenges, AlignBot employs a fine-tuned LLaVA-7B model, functioning as an adapter for GPT-4o. This adapter model internalizes diverse forms of user reminders-such as personalized preferences, corrective guidance, and contextual assistance-into structured that prompt GPT-4o in generating customized task plans. Additionally, AlignBot integrates a dynamic retrieval mechanism that selects task-relevant historical successes as prompts for GPT-4o, further enhancing task planning accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of AlignBot, experiments are conducted in real-world household environments, which are constructed within the laboratory to replicate typical household settings. A multimodal dataset with over 1,500 entries derived from volunteer reminders is used for training and evaluation. The results demonstrate that AlignBot significantly improves customized task planning, outperforming existing LLM- and VLM-powered planners by interpreting and aligning with user reminders, achieving 86.8% success rate compared to the vanilla GPT-4o baseline at 21.6%, reflecting a 65% improvement and over four times greater effectiveness.

Synthesized with Dynamic Network Flows, Logic Network Flows render a tighter convex relaxation compared to Logic Trees derived from these STL specifications. Our formulation is evaluated on several multi-robot motion planning case studies. Empirical results demonstrate that our formulation outperforms Logic Tree formulation in terms of computation time for several planning problems.

The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new cooperative estimator called STT-R (Spatial-Temporal Triangulation with bearing Rate), which is designed under the framework of distributed recursive least squares.

It is shown that the proposed STT-R algorithm can effectively generate more accurate estimations and effectively reduce the lag in velocity estimation, enabling tracking of more maneuverable targets."

Traditional methods using cameras or LiDARs heavily rely on overlapping Fields of View (FoV) between robots, which is highly demanding in practical applications and may hinder collaboration efficiency. To accommodate this issue, we propose Anchorless UWB-Assisted Relative Pose Estimation (AURPE), a novel approach that leverages ultra-wideband (UWB) technology in an anchorless setup to achieve multi-robot RPE without requiring overlapping FoVs or external infrastructure. AURPE first estimates the initial relative poses between robots using inter-robot UWB ranging combined with a Bayesian framework and constrained optimization. During robot operation, AURPE continuously refines the relative poses by integrating UWB measurements with LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and employs a consensus voting mechanism to identify the most reliable pose estimates. Additionally, a pose graph-based back-end optimization is incorporated to enhance the accuracy of both initial and real-time relative pose. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that AURPE achieves accurate RPE even in non-overlapping scenarios where traditional methods fail. Compared to state-of-the-art point cloud registration methods, AURPE shows superior performance in both accuracy and robustness, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance cooperative tasks in multi-robot systems operating in complex environments."

Our algorithm takes the form of a Kalman filter and performs recognition of the agent's intended waypoint at high frequency. The approach is robust to uncertainties in dynamics and observations. Moreover, it does not require the agent to reach the next waypoint to perform recognition, which saves valuable time.

Recent research has often focused on the scalability of the number of robots or the complexity of the environment.

However, this approach fails to adequately capture the kinematic and dynamic constraints of real-world vehicles, particularly those equipped with Ackermann steering in warehousing applications. This paper presents a novel MAPF algorithm that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with a lattice planner. RL provides strong generalization capabilities while maintaining computational efficiency. By incorporating lattice planner trajectories into the action space of the RL framework, agents are capable of generating smooth and feasible paths that respect the kinematic and dynamic constraints. In addition, we adopt a decentralized training and execution framework, where a network of shared value functions enables efficient cooperation among agents during decision-making. Simulation results and real-world experiments in different scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of success rate, average speed, extra distance of trajectory, and computing time."

In this paper, we address this gap by considering the control-constrained dynamic model of MARS and proposing a robust and efficient self-reconstruction algorithm that maximizes the controllability margin at each intermediate stage. Specifically, we develop algorithms to compute optimal, controllable disassembly and assembly sequences, enabling robust self-reconfiguration. Finally, we validate our method in several challenging fault-tolerant self-reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both controllability and trajectory tracking while reducing the number of assembly steps.

When conventional global positioning infrastructure such as GPS is unavailable, the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology on each agent provides a practical means to measure inter-agent range, eliminating the need for external hardware installations, due to UWB’s precise range measurements and robust communi- cation capabilities. However, when only a single UWB device per agent is used, the relative pose between the agents can be unobservable, resulting in a complex solution space with multiple possible RPs. In this paper, a novel method is proposed based on an Unscented Particle Filter (UPF) that fuses single UWB ranges with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed decentralized method solves the multi-modal solution in 3D (4-DoF) for the RP when it is unobservable. Moreover, a pseudo-state is introduced to correct for rotational drift of the agents. Through simulations and experiments involving two robots, the proposed solution was shown to be competitive, but less computationally expensive. Additionally, the proposed solution provides all possible relative poses from the first measurement. The code and link to the video are available https://github.com/y2d2/UPF_RPE."

Many real-world objects such as car headlights or any quickly moving foreground objects generate event blob data. The proposed algorithm uses a nearest neighbour classifier with a dynamic threshold criteria for data association coupled with an extended Kalman filter to track the event blob state. Our algorithm achieves highly accurate blob tracking, velocity estimation, and shape estimation even under challenging lighting conditions and high-speed motions (> 11000 pixels/s). The microsecond time resolution achieved means that the filter output can be used to derive secondary information such as time-to-contact or range estimation, that will enable applications to real-world problems such as collision avoidance in autonomous driving."

    "abstract": "The task of vision-based 3D occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct 3D geometry and estimate its semantic classes from 2D color images, where the 2D-to-3D view transformation is an indispensable step. Most previous methods conduct forward projection, such as BEVPooling and VoxelPooling, both of which map the 2D image features into 3D grids. However, the current grid representing features within a certain height range usually introduces many confusing features that belong to other height ranges. To address this challenge, we present Deep Height Decoupling (DHD), a novel framework that incorporates explicit height prior to filter out the confusing features. Specifically, DHD first predicts height maps via explicit supervision. Based on the height distribution statistics, DHD designs Mask Guided Height Sampling (MGHS) to adaptively decouple the height map into multiple binary masks. MGHS projects the 2D image features into multiple subspaces, where each grid contains features within reasonable height ranges. Finally, a Synergistic Feature Aggregation (SFA) module is deployed to enhance the feature representation through channel and spatial affinities, enabling further occupancy refinement. On the popular Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance even with minimal input frames. Source code is released at https://github.com/yanzq95/DHD."

    "abstract": "Recognizing objects in the 3D world is a significant challenge for robotics. Due to the lack of high-quality 3D data, directly training a general-purpose segmentation model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) have revolutionized the 2D computer vision field with outstanding performance, making the use of VFM to assist 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted methods do not effectively address the 2D-3D inconsistency problem or adequately provide corresponding semantic information for 3D instance objects. To address these two issues, this paper introduces a novel framework for 3D zero-shot instance segmentation called RE0. For the given 3D point clouds and multi-view RGB-D images with poses, we leverage the 3D geometric information, projection relationships, and CLIP semantic features. Specifically, we utilize CropFormer to extract mask information from multi-view posed images, combined with projection relationships to assign point-level labels to each point in the point cloud, and achieve instance- level consistency through inter-frame information interaction. Then, we employ projection relationships again to assign CLIP semantic features to the point cloud and achieve aggregation of small-scale point clouds. Notably, RE0 does not require any additional training and can be implemented by supporting only one inference of CropFormer and one inference of CLIP. Experiments on ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ show that our method achieves higher quality segmentation than the previous zero-shot methods. Our codes and demos are available at https://recognizeeverything.github.io/, with only one RTX 3090 GPU required."

Contemporary methods in visual place recognition employ convolutional neural networks and utilize every region within the image for the place recognition task. However, the presence of dynamic and distracting elements in the image can impact the effectiveness of the place recognition process. Therefore, it is meaningful to focus on the task-relevant regions of the image for improved recognition. In this paper, we present PlaceFormer, a novel transformer-based approach for visual place recognition. PlaceFormer uses patch tokens from the transformer to create global image descriptors, which are then used for image retrieval. To re-rank the retrieved images, PlaceFormer merges the patch tokens from the transformer to form multi-scale patches. Utilizing the transformer's self-attention mechanism, it selects patches that correspond to task-relevant areas in an image. These selected patches undergo geometric verification, generating similarity scores across different patch sizes. Subsequently, the spatial scores from each patch size are fused to produce a final similarity score. This score is then used to re-rank the images initially retrieved using global image descriptors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PlaceFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring less time and memory."

In this paper, we introduce an efficient and scalable approach for active semantic mapping in horticultural environments, employing a mobile robot manipulator equipped with an RGB-D camera. Our method leverages probabilistic semantic maps to detect semantic targets, generate candidate viewpoints, and compute the corresponding information gain. We present an efficient ray-casting strategy and a novel information utility function that accounts for both semantics and occlusions. The proposed approach reduces total runtime by 8% compared to previous baselines. Furthermore, our information metric surpasses other metrics in reducing multiclass entropy and improving surface coverage, particularly in the presence of segmentation noise. Real-world experiments validate our method's effectiveness but also reveal challenges such as depth sensor noise and varying environmental conditions, requiring further research."

    "abstract": "Ground terrain perception has become the primary visual task for the robust navigation of intelligent systems in unstructured outdoor environments. However, complex terrain poses a significant challenge to vision-based perception. This work introduces a novel estimation task using RGB images to facilitate low-cost terrain perception in extracting surface roughness information. The proposed task presents both semantic-aware and edge-aware roughness descriptors at the pixel level instead of a single value for a given image. To promote the research on the proposed novel terrain roughness estimation task, we introduce a multimodal synthetic dataset for terrain perception in outdoor scenes, containing multiple terrain categories, diverse viewpoints, different lighting and weather conditions, as well as semantic and roughness annotations. Additionally, inspired by computer graphics, we introduce TRENet, a roughness estimation architecture to model the intrinsic correlation of depth-normal-roughness. We also perform ablation studies on the effect of each component and diverse types of inputs. Extensive evaluations and comparisons demonstrate that our method can effectively predict pixel-wise terrain surface roughness with high accuracy."

To determine the leopards’ IDs, we propose an effective automated algorithm, that consists of segmenting leopard bodies from images, scoring similarity between image pairs, and clustering followed by verification. To perform clustering, we employ a modified ternary search that uses a novel adaptive k-medoids++ clustering algorithm. The best clustering is determined using an expanded definition of the silhouette score. A new post-clustering verification procedure is used to further improve the quality of a clustering. The algorithm was evaluated using the Panthera dataset that consists of 677 individual leopards taken from 1555 images, and resulted in a clustering with an adjusted mutual information score of 0.958 as compared to 0.864 using a baseline k-medoids++ clustering algorithm."

    "abstract": "Autonomous robot navigation in off-road environments requires a comprehensive understanding of the terrain geometry and traversability. The degraded perceptual conditions and sparse geometric information at longer ranges make the problem challenging especially when driving at high speeds. Furthermore, the sensing-to-mapping latency and the look-ahead map range can limit the maximum speed of the vehicle. Building on top of the recent work RoadRunner, in this work, we address the challenge of long-range (±100m) traversability estimation. Our RoadRunner (M&M) is an end-to-end learning-based framework that directly predicts the traversability and elevation maps at multiple ranges (±50m, ±100m) and resolutions (0.2m, 0.8m) taking as input multiple images and a LiDAR voxel map. Our method is trained in a self-supervised manner by leveraging the dense supervision signal generated by fusing predictions from an existing traversability estimation stack (X-Racer) in hindsight and satellite Digital Elevation Maps. RoadRunner M&M achieves a significant improvement of up to 50% for elevation mapping and 30% for traversability estimation over RoadRunner, and is able to predict in 30% more regions compared to X-Racer while achieving real-time performance. Experiments on various out-of-distribution datasets also demonstrate that our data-driven approach starts to generalize to novel unstructured environments. We integrate our proposed framework in closed-loop with the path planner to demonstrate autonomous high-speed off-road robotic navigation in challenging real-world environments.

    "abstract": "Rip currents are a major hazard on beaches worldwide, and their strong, offshore-directed currents can place even experienced beachgoers at risk of drowning. While it is intuitive to consider developing an automated rip current detection system to assist lifeguards in protecting beachgoers, rip current detection is in its infancy due to the lack of high-quality large-scale annotated rip current datasets. Also, the collection and annotation of rip current images require expert knowledge, which makes it more difficult to build datasets. So, this paper proposes a GAN-based rip current data augmentation method, RipGAN, to improve the performance of rip current detectors by increasing representative training data. To create new training images, RipGAN, has two branches. One is a texture generator that enriches the pattern and texture details of waves, making the image more realistic. The other is a rip generator based on FFFM-Unet. FFFM (Fast Fourier Fusion Module) uses Fast Fourier convolution to fuse the features from the low and the high layers, so as to further optimise the generated image. Furthermore, we trained Yolov8, YOLOv10, DINO and RT-DETR as rip current detectors to prove the effectiveness of RipGAN. The detectors' mAP 50:95 improved by 2.67% on the test set and AP 50 by 4.93% on real-scene videos, outperforming other data augmentation methods. Besides, abundant ablation studies have been conducted to further evaluate each component of RipGAN."

Recent approaches incorporate images into the completion pipeline, introducing geometric clues and global constraints. However, their fusion processes often fail to reconstruct detailed parts and maintain global consistency simultaneously. Except for images, text is another important clue for recognizing the target’s characteristics. Thus, in this work, we propose to combine multiple modalities including points, images and texts for point cloud completion. Specifically, inspired by recently pre-trained large language models, we generate the description texts for images by Visual Question Answering (VQA) models and introduce Visual-Textual Embedding (VTE) models to extract joint features of image-text pairs. Furthermore, we describe the edge geometric patterns by multi-scale edge convolution to guide the refinement of shapes in local areas. Then we adopt cross attention mechanism to effectively fuse multi-modal features and refine the coarse shape. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet-ViPC benchmark demonstrate our method’s superior performance over previous uni-modal and cross-modal methods."

    "abstract": "The 3D weakly-supervised visual grounding task aims to localize oriented 3D boxes in point clouds based on natural language descriptions without requiring annotations to guide model learning. This setting presents two primary challenges: category-level ambiguity and instance-level complexity. Category-level ambiguity arises from representing objects of fine-grained categories in a highly sparse point cloud format, making category distinction challenging. Instance-level complexity stems from multiple instances of the same category coexisting in a scene, leading to distractions during grounding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised grounding approach that explicitly differentiates between categories and instances. In the category-level branch, we utilize extensive category knowledge from a pre-trained external detector to align object proposal features with sentence-level category features, thereby enhancing category awareness. In the instance-level branch, we utilize spatial relationship descriptions from language queries to refine object proposal features, ensuring clear differentiation among objects. These designs enable our model to accurately identify target-category objects while distinguishing instances within the same category. Compared to previous methods, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely used benchmarks: Nr3D, Sr3D, and ScanRef."

Existing studies focused more on online surgical phase recognition, by leveraging preceding frames to predict the current frame. Despite great progress, they formulated the task as a series of frame-wise classification, which resulted in a lack of global context of the entire procedure and incoherent predictions. Moreover, besides online analysis, accurate offline surgical phase recognition is also in significant clinical need for retrospective analysis, and existing online algorithms do not fully analyze the entire video, thereby limiting accuracy in offline analysis. To overcome these challenges and enhance both online and offline inference capabilities, we propose a universal Surgical Phase Localization Network, named SurgPLAN++, with the principle of temporal detection. To ensure a global understanding of the surgical procedure, we devise a phase localization strategy for SurgPLAN++ to predict phase segments across the entire video through phase proposals. For online analysis, to generate high-quality phase proposals, SurgPLAN++ incorporates a data augmentation strategy to extend the streaming video into a pseudo-complete video through mirroring, center-duplication, and down-sampling. For offline analysis, SurgPLAN++ capitalizes on its global phase prediction framework to continuously refine preceding predictions during each online inference step, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of phase recognition. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, and our SurgPLAN++ achieves remarkable performance in both online and offline modes, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Experiments show that our framework achieves compression rates of 40x to 80x while maintaining high accuracy for downstream applications. our method significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of accuracy when the compression rate exceeds 70x. Fur thermore, in situations of reduced communication bandwidth, our adaptive bitrate control strategy demonstrates significant QoE improvements."

The interface provides remote operators with a contextual 3D scene understanding that is updated according to bandwidth availability. Evaluation of the SHARC framework through controlled lab experiments demonstrates that SHARC-VR enables novice operators to complete manipulation tasks in framerate-limited conditions (i.e., 0.1–0.5 frames per second) faster than expert pilots using a conventional topside controller. For both novice and expert users, the SHARC-VR interface also increases the task completion rate and improves sampling precision.

Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches."

Our approach takes into account that the ground agent may have limited and sometimes obstructed view. Our formulation encourages Generative Communication (GC) between an assistive overhead agent with a global view containing the target object and the ground agent with an obfuscated view; both equipped with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for vision-to-language translation. In this assisted setup, the embodied agents communicate environmental information before the ground agent executes actions towards a target. Despite the overhead agent having a global view with the target, we note a drop in performance (-13% in OSR and -13% in SPL) of a fully cooperative assistance scheme over an unassisted baseline. In contrast, a selective assistance scheme where the ground agent retains its independent exploratory behaviour shows a 10% OSR and 7.65% SPL improvement. To explain navigation performance, we analyze the GC for unique traits, quantifying the presence of hallucination and cooperation. Specifically, we identify the novel linguistic trait of preemptive hallucination in our embodied setting, where the overhead agent assumes that the ground agent has executed an action in the dialogue when it is yet to move, and note its strong correlation with navigation performance. We conduct real-world experiments and present some qualitative examples where we mitigate hallucinations via prompt finetuning to improve ObjectNav performance."

For example, in a search and rescue mission, a legged robot could climb over debris, crawl through gaps, and navigate out of dead ends. However, the robot’s controller needs to respond intelligently to such varied obstacles, and this requires handling unexpected and unusual scenarios successfully. This presents an open challenge to current learning methods, which often struggle with generalization to the long tail of unexpected situations without heavy human supervision. To address this issue, we investigate how to leverage the broad knowledge about the structure of the world and commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to aid legged robots in handling difficult, ambiguous situations. We propose a system, VLM-Predictive Control (VLM-PC), combining two key components that we find to be crucial for eliciting on-the-fly, adaptive behavior selection with VLMs: (1) in-context adaptation over previous robot interactions and (2) planning multiple skills into the future and replanning. We evaluate VLM-PC on several challenging real-world obstacle courses, involving dead ends and climbing and crawling, on a Go1 quadruped robot. Our experiments show that by reasoning over the history of interactions and future plans, VLMs enable the robot to autonomously perceive, navigate, and act in a wide range of complex scenarios that would otherwise require environment- specific engineering or human guidance."

We train diffusion model conditioned on 3D point clouds of task-relevant objects to predict the robot's end-effector trajectories, enabling it to complete the tasks. During inference we incorporate cost optimization into denoising steps to guide the generated trajectory to be collision free. We leverage open-set segmentation to obtain the 3D point clouds of related objects and use a large language model to identify the target objects and possible obstacles by interpreting the user's natural language instructions. To effectively guide the conditional diffusion model using time-independent cost function, we proposed a novel guided generation mechanism based on the estimated clean trajectories. In simulation, we showed that diffusion policy based on the object-centric 3D representation achieves a much higher success rate (68.7%) compared to baselines with simple 2D (39.3%) and 3D scene (43.6%) representations, across 21 challenging RLBench tasks with only 40 demonstrations.

We address the challenge of a mobile pursuer keeping a mobile evader within its field of view (FoV) despite line-of-sight obstructions. The signed distance function (SDF) of the FoV is used to formulate visibility as a control barrier function (CBF) constraint on the pursuer's control inputs. Similarly, obstacle avoidance is formulated as a CBF constraint based on the SDF of the obstacle set. While the visibility and safety CBFs are Lipschitz continuous, they are not differentiable everywhere, necessitating the use of generalized gradients. To achieve non-myopic pursuit, we generate reference control trajectories leading to evader visibility using a sampling-based kinodynamic planner. The pursuer then tracks this reference via convex optimization under the CBF constraints. We validate our approach in CARLA simulations and real-world robot experiments, demonstrating successful visibility maintenance using only onboard sensing, even under severe occlusions and dynamic evader movements."

Existing perception-informed local planners that operate in dynamic environments rely on emergent or empirical robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of dynamic obstacles. In addition to this, the obstacle tracking that is performed in these existent planners is often achieved with respect to a global inertial frame, subjecting such tracking estimates to transformation errors from odometry drift. The proposed local planner, dynamic gap, shifts the tracking paradigm to modeling how the free space, represented as gaps, evolves over time. Gap crossing and closing conditions are developed to aid in determining the feasibility of passage through gaps, and a breadth of simulation benchmarking is performed against other navigation planners in the literature where the proposed dynamic gap planner achieves the highest success rate out of all planners tested in all environments."

    "abstract": "Safe motion planning algorithms are necessary for deploying autonomous robots in unstructured environments. Motion plans must be safe to ensure that the robot does not harm humans or damage any nearby objects. Generating these motion plans in real-time is also important to ensure that the robot can adapt to sudden changes in its environment. Many trajectory optimization methods introduce heuristics that balance safety and real-time performance, potentially increasing the risk of the robot colliding with its environment. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing Conformalized Reachable Sets for Obstacle Avoidance With Spheres (CROWS). CROWS is a novel real-time, receding-horizon trajectory planner that generates probablistically-safe motion plans. Offline, CROWS learns a novel neural network-based representation of a sphere-based reachable set that overapproximates the swept volume of the robot's motion. CROWS then uses conformal prediction to compute a confidence bound that provides a probabilistic safety guarantee on the learned reachable set. At runtime, CROWS performs trajectory optimization to select a trajectory that is probabilstically-guaranteed to be collision-free. We demonstrate that CROWS outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art methods in solving challenging motion planning tasks in cluttered environments while remaining collision-free.

    "abstract": "The safety-critical nature of autonomous vehicle(AV) operation necessitates development of task-relevant algorithms that can reason about safety at the system level and not just at the component level. To reason about the impact of a perception failure on the entire system performance, such task-relevant algorithms must contend with various challenges: complexity of AV stacks, high uncertainty in the operating environments, and the need for real-time performance. To overcome these challenges, in this work, we introduce a Q-network called SPARQ (abbreviation for Safety evaluation for Perception And Recovery Q-network) that evaluates the safety of a plan generated by a planning algorithm, accounting for perception failures that the planning process may have overlooked. This Q-network can be queried during system runtime to assess whether a proposed plan is safe for execution or poses potential safety risks. If a violation is detected, the network can then recommend a corrective plan while accounting for the perceptual failure. We validate our algorithm using the NuPlan-Vegas dataset, demonstrating its ability to handle cases where a perception failure compromises a proposed plan, while the corrective plan remains safe. We observe an overall accuracy and recall of 90% while sustaining a frequency of 42HZ on the unseen testing dataset. We compare our performance to a popular reachability based baseline and analysed some interesting properties of our approach in improving the safety properties of an AV pipeline."

These systems are particularly advantageous when metal or electronic components are impractical or when there are constraints on the control system volume or weight. This paper introduces a novel individual membrane valve that functions as a set-reset latch and can reduce the number of valves required for some pneumatic or microfluidic logic systems. An application of pneumatic logic systems in soft robotics is the access to multiple tethered pneumatic elements through a reduced number of pneumatic lines. To this end, this paper proposes two pneumatic logic systems capable of selecting among multiple distributed sets of pneumatic elements and operating the elements of the set simultaneously and independently through the different pneumatic lines. The selection is achieved via a sequence of pressure pulses applied on the same lines used afterwards for operation. Two prototypes of these pneumatic logic systems were built and successfully demonstrated, consisting primarily of set-reset membrane valves and powered by binary high/low pressure sources. The first prototype features a hierarchical network with four lines and five sets of three pneumatic elements each; the second prototype features a non-hierarchical network with five lines and twelve sets of four pneumatic elements each."

    "abstract": "Immediate removal of hazardous gases is critical for ensuring safety. Traditional methods, such as portable ventilation equipment, are difficult to use when hazardous gases are released in inaccessible environments. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism that integrates an inflatable helical structure into a soft growing robot. The proposed mechanism is capable of performing suction through its inner channel after navigating complex environments, while maintaining the inherent advantages of the soft growing robot as it grows. The mechanism operates in two phases: a growing phase, in which the robot extends by eversion, and a suction phase, in which suction is performed through the inner channel of the robot. Experiments and demonstrations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism. The experimental results confirmed the ability to maintain the passageway shape of the inner channel during suction operations and provided a design guideline. The demonstration validated that the mechanism can effectively navigate inaccessible environments and perform suction to remove hazardous gases."

    "abstract": "With the increasing use of wireless technologies in robotics for communication, sensing, and localization, the potential benefits of how robotics can complement and enhance wireless systems remain underexplored. This paper explores a novel application of the existing inflatable robots for wireless communication systems by forming a shape-programming, reflective waveguide that enhances the received signal quality for wireless devices. Our primary target is enhancing Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP WANs) – where 10-year battery-powered client devices (e.g. energy meters or smart home sensors) connect to cellular-like powered base stations to deliver data. Devices in these networks often experience significant seasonal variability in battery life – even simple obstructions between the device and base station (e.g. due to construction) can shave off years of battery life. We propose MetaMorph, a programmable robotic reflector attached to base stations that enhances signal quality from client devices by enhancing received signal energy with controlled reflections. We investigate the design of the reflector, and our experiments show the ability to improve the signal quality for LP-WAN(LoRa) communication systems demonstrating signal quality and battery-benefits. To our best knowledge, MetaMorph is the first paper to explore how flexible robotics can serve as virtuous reflectors for wireless communication systems."

    "abstract": "We present the Magnetic Origami Reprogramming and Folding System (MORF), a magnetically reprogrammable system capable of precise shape control, repeated transformations, and adaptive functionality for robotic applications. Unlike current self-folding systems, which often lack re-programmability or lose rigidity after folding, MORF generates stiff structures over multiple folding cycles without degradation in performance. The ability to reconfigure and maintain structural stability is crucial for tasks such as reconfigurable tooling. The system utilizes a thermoplastic layer sandwiched within a thin magnetically responsive laminate sheet, enabling structures to self-fold in response to a combination of external magnetic field and heating. We demonstrate that the resulting folded structures can bear loads over 40 times their own weight and can undergo up to 50 cycles of repeated transformations without losing structural integrity. We showcase these strengths in a reconfigurable tool for unscrewing and screwing bolts and screws of various sizes, allowing the tool to adapt its shape to different bolt sizes while withstanding the mechanical stresses involved. This capability highlights the system’s potential for task-varying, load-bearing applications in robotics, where both versatility and durability are essential."

By adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides insights that could aid in future development of controllers for selecting leg stiffness."

This research explores the limitations of relying only on soft robot compliance for contact-based tasks. Our goal is to generate adaptive motion for contact-based tasks by exploiting the compliance of the soft links. We compare contact-based tasks for the inflatable robot with and without a learning model. This shows improved performance when soft robot compliance is augmented with imitation learning. The combination of soft robot compliance and the machine learning model's adaptability shows the potential for collaborative robots to interact with humans and their surroundings safely."

By considering human and UAS as co-workers, we use Petri Nets to abstractly model evolution of shared tasks assigned to human and UAS co-workers. Particularly, the Petri Nets’ “places” represent work stations; therefore, the Petri Nets’ transitions can formally specify displacements between the work stations. The paper’s first objective is to incorporate uncertainty regarding the intentions of human co-workers into motion planning for UAS, when UAS closely interacts with human co-workers. To this end, the proposed Petri Nets model uses “conflict” constructs to represent situations at which UAS deals with incomplete knowledge about human co-worker intention. The paper’s second objective is then to plan the motion of the UAS in a resilient and safe manner, in the presence of non-cooperative human co-workers. In order to achieve this objective, UAS equipped with onboard perception and decision-making capabilities are able to, through real-time processing of in-situ observation, predict human intention, quantify human distraction, and apply a non-stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to safely plan UAS motion in the presence of uncertainty. Given the current and next UAS waypoints, the paper applies Potryagin’s minimal principle to plan the desired trajectory of the UAS and uses feedback linearaztion method for trajectory tracking control."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent coordination is crucial for reliable multi-robot navigation in shared spaces such as automated warehouses. In regions of dense robot traffic, local coordination methods may fail to find a deadlock-free solution. In these scenarios, it is appropriate to let a central unit generate a global schedule that decides the passing order of robots. However, the runtime of such centralized coordination methods increases significantly with the problem scale. In this paper, we propose to leverage Graph Neural Network Variational Autoencoders (GNN-VAE) to solve the multi-agent coordination problem faster than through centralized optimization at scale.\tWe formulate the coordination problem as a graph problem and collect ground truth data using a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) solver. During training, our learning framework encodes good quality solutions of the graph problem into a latent space. At inference time, solution samples are decoded from the sampled latent variables, and the lowest-cost sample is selected for coordination. By construction, our GNN-VAE framework returns solutions that always respect the constraints of the considered coordination problem. Numerical results show that our approach trained on small-scale problems can achieve high-quality solutions even for large-scale problems with 250 robots, being much faster than other baselines."

However, when operating across the air and water, such as grasping marine products from the water, the visual information collected by the camera will be disturbed by ripples and bubbles on the water surface, resulting in low grasping efficiency. Therefore, we introduce a grasping strategy based on single-visual mapping for multi-step (SVMMS) operations, which is suitable for cross-medium operations involving stacked objects. Specifically, we design a multifunctional integrated network model based on Deep Q-learning, which extracts visual features from the scene to detect stacked objects and outputs their hierarchical relationships effectively. Moreover, we quantify the potential relationship between motion logic during action execution and changes in RGB-D information to help the robot achieve efficient and collision-free operations. Our approach also incorporates a time-series design with prioritized experience replay to optimize the action sequence globally. Additionally, we propose a novel sim2real method by combining domain randomization to address the difference in object sizes between the simulation and the real world. Extensive experiments in both simulation and physical environments show that SVMMS-Grasp significantly outperforms existing methods regarding task success rate, stability, and operational efficiency."

    "abstract": "When agents must execute multiple tasks at spatially distinct locations, it is common to formulate and solve a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the order of locations (targets) that requires the smallest travel cost. Approaching such task sequencing problems as a TSP is restrictive, as it requires that unique locations be specified for each task. In reality a set of acceptable locations might be available. The Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP) is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem in which the agent needs only visit a spherical neighborhood surrounding each target, and can thus address this task sequencing problem when any location in a sphere is acceptable. Prior work has developed a branch-and-bound approach that finds globally optimal solutions to instances of the CETSP by solving a sequence of Second-Order Cone Programs (SOCP). We demonstrate it is possible to eliminate 2/3 of the variables and 1/2 of the constraints in these SOCPs, show how to reuse computation and memory allocation across multiple SOCPs in the sequence, and propose a strategy to warm-start the SOCPs using solutions obtained earlier in the sequence. Collectively, these three changes halve the time required to solve 210 random CETSP instances to optimality. We also obtained improved lower bounds on 73 instances from the literature, including solving one instance to optimality for the first time."

To address these issues, we propose a decoupled training neural solver (DTNS) based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which is a novel approach that decouples the optimization of encoder and decoder, enhancing the model's ability to handle dynamic changes. Our method involves training under an Fore-Reveal condition first where the information of all customers nodes are known in advance to obtain optimized encoder and initialization for decoder and then fine-tuning the decoder in dynamic scenarios where dynamic customers are revealed over time. This training paradigm results in a flexible and globally optimized routing policy. Experimental results demonstrate that DTNS efficiently adapts to new customer requests in dynamic scenario, outperforming existing methods in dynamic routing environments."

But the majority of existing literature restricts drone launch and retrieve operations (LARO) to stationary truck, and potential drone route collisions are mostly ignored. This leads to inability to fully exploit the capability of drones. We address these gaps and introduce a new variant of multi-drone-truck collaborative delivery. However, the scheduling for drones and truck faces high-dimensional solution space and complex constraints, making it almost impossible for centralized solving. To this end, we develop a hierarchical solution framework that decomposes the complete problem into two levels of subproblem. The upper solver centrally allocates tasks and schedules when drones to launch, while the lower solver, based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), plans paths for each drone agent in a decentralized but cooperative manner. In addition, we validate the effectiveness of our method by benchmarking it against three state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating its superiority in terms of both efficiency and collision avoidance."

Deploying unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) as mobile recharging stations offers a practical solution, extending UAVs’ operational range.

In this paper, we present a risk-aware deep reinforcement learning (Ra-DRL) framework with a multi-head attention mechanism within an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to solve this cooperative routing problem for a UAV-UGV team. Our model minimizes mission time while accounting for the stochastic fuel consumption of the UAV, influenced by environmental factors like wind velocity, ensuring adherence to a risk threshold to avoid mid-mission energy depletion. Extensive evaluations on various problem sizes show that our method significantly outperforms nearest-neighbor heuristics in both solution quality and risk management. We validate the Ra-DRL policy in a Gazebo-ROS SITL environment with a PX4-based custom UAV and Clearpath Husky UGV. The results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our policy, making it highly effective for mission planning in dynamic, uncertain scenarios."

In this paper, we address the problem of ego-motion estimation using a single automotive radar sensor. We propose a simple, yet effective, heuristic-based method to extract the ground plane from single radar scans and perform ground plane matching between consecutive scans.

To fully explore the potential of 4D radar, we introduce a learning-based odometry framework, enabling robust ego-motion estimation from finite and uncertain geometry information. First, for sparse radar points, we propose a local completion to supplement missing structures and provide denser guideline for aligning two frames. Then, a context-aware association with a hierarchical structure flexibly matches points of different scales aided by feature similarity, and improves local matching consistency through correlation balancing. Finally, we present a window-based optimizer that uses historical priors to establish a coupling state estimation and correct errors of inter-frame matching. The superiority of our algorithm is confirmed on View-of-Delft dataset, achieving around a 50% performance improvement over previous approaches and delivering accuracy on par with LiDAR odometry.

We benchmark the radar system's closed-loop path-tracking performance and compare it to its 3D LiDAR counterpart. 11.8 km of autonomous driving was completed without interventions using only radar and gyro for navigation. RT&R was evaluated on four different routes with progressively less structured scene geometry. RT&R achieved lateral path-tracking root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 5.6 cm, 7.5 cm, and 12.1 cm as the routes became more challenging. These RMSE values are less than half of the width of one tire (24 cm) on our robot testing platform. These same routes have worst-case errors of 21.7 cm, 24.0 cm, and 43.8 cm.

In this work we integrate radial speed measurements from a FMCW radar sensor, using a radial speed factor, to provide linear velocity updates into a sliding–window state estimator for fusion with LiDAR pose and IMU measurements. We demonstrate that this augmentation increases the robustness of the state estimator to challenging conditions present in the environment and the negative effects they can pose to vulnerable exteroceptive modalities.

Based on the relationship between pose graph reliability and graph topology, we formulate a SLAM-aware path planning problem over the prior graph, which finds a fast exploration path enhanced with the globally informative loop-closing actions to stabilize the SLAM pose graph. A greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, in which we derive theoretical thresholds that significantly prune non-optimal loop-closing actions without affecting the potential informative ones. Furthermore, we incorporate the proposed planner into a hierarchical exploration framework, with flexible features including path replanning, and online prior graph update that adds additional information to the prior graph. Simulation and real-world experiments indicate that the proposed method can reliably achieve higher mapping accuracy than compared methods when exploring environments with rich topologies, while maintaining comparable exploration efficiency.

A utility function considering unknown area size, travel distance, and sequence similarity is used, and the simulated annealing algorithm generates a subregion sequence for global guidance. Within each subregion, a linear acceleration model helps select target points.

In this work, we focus on structured indoor environments, which often exhibit predictable, repeating patterns.

More recent deep learning-based methods predict unknown regions of the map for information gain computation, but these approaches are often sensitive to the predicted map quality or fail to account for sensor coverage. To overcome these issues, our key insight is to jointly reason over what the robot can observe and its uncertainty to calculate probabilistic information gain. We introduce MapEx, a new exploration framework that uses predicted maps to form probabilistic sensor model for information gain estimation. MapEx generates multiple predicted maps based on observed information, and takes into consideration both the computed variances of predicted maps and estimated visible area to estimate the information gain of a given viewpoint.

    "abstract": "We present a novel formulation of ergodic trajectory optimization that can be specified over general domains using kernel maximum mean discrepancy. Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain"

    "abstract": "Robotic search and rescue, exploration, and inspection require trajectory planning across a variety of domains. A popular approach to trajectory planning for these types of missions is ergodic search, which biases a trajectory to spend time in parts of the exploration domain that are believed to contain more information. Most prior work on ergodic search has been limited to searching simple surfaces, like a 2D Euclidean plane or a sphere, as they rely on projecting functions defined on the exploration domain onto analytically obtained Fourier basis functions. In this paper, we extend ergodic search to any surface that can be approximated by a triangle mesh. The basis functions are approximated through finite element methods on a triangle mesh of the domain. We formally prove that this approximation converges to the continuous case as the mesh approximation converges to the true domain. We demonstrate that on domains where analytical basis functions are available (plane, sphere), the proposed method obtains equivalent results, and while on other domains (torus, bunny, wind turbine), the approach is versatile enough to still search effectively. Lastly, we also compare with an existing ergodic search technique that can handle complex domains and show that our method results in a higher quality exploration."

FALCON effectively harnesses the full potential of online generated coverage paths in enhancing exploration efficiency. The framework begins with an incremental connectivity-aware space decomposition and connectivity graph construction. Subsequently, a hierarchical planner generates a coverage path spanning the entire unexplored space, serving as a global guidance. Then, a local planner optimizes the frontier visitation order, consciously incorporating the intention of the global guidance. For fair and comprehensive benchmark experiments, we introduce a lightweight exploration planner evaluation environment that allows for comparing exploration planners across a variety of testing scenarios using an identical quadrotor simulator. Extensive benchmark experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the significant performance of FALCON. Real-world experiments conducted fully onboard further validate FALCON’s practical capability in complex and challenging environments."

    "abstract": "The world population is increasing and will, by 2050, nearly double its demand for food, feed, fuel, and fiber. Be sides environmental challenges, labor shortage also poses crucial challenges to the agricultural production system. Automation of manual tasks in crop production can potentially increase efficiency but also lead to a change in agricultural practices for more effective usage of available land. In this paper, we address the problem of robotic fruit harvesting in challenging real-world scenarios such as vertical farms, where robotic sensing and acting need to cope with a cluttered environment. Robotic fruit harvesting is typically done by directly detecting a grasp point in the sensor reading, which can lie on the fruit itself or on its peduncle depending on crop harvesting requirements. However, grasp point detection is not always possible as the ideal grasp point may be hidden behind leaves or other fruits. Our approach exploits shape completion techniques allowing us to estimate the complete 3D shape of a target fruit together with its pose even under strong occlusions. In this way, we can estimate a grasp point even when the fruit is only partially visible. We evaluate our approach on a real robotic manipulator operating in a vertical farm growing different fruit species and employing different harvesting tools. Our experiments show that, on average, our proposed pipeline increases the success rate by 18.5 percentage points, in terms of end-effector positioning, compared to the most competitive baseline among the ones reported in this work, that does not rely on shape completion."

Given the complex, nonlinear, anisotropic material properties of the mushrooms in combination with the multiple failure-mode modalities involved, we design a simulation framework around the PyBullet rigid-body physics engine by utilizing first-order approximations of the equivalent continuum mechanics models. By exploiting the computational efficiency of the aforementioned simulation framework, we directly apply the MPPI control framework to generate offline optimal mushroom uprooting motion primitives, defining a set of cost objectives for an optimal and within-constraint harvesting plan. We show that with this planning strategy, the ``root-bending'' action emerges autonomously for the single mushroom case as an optimal uprooting maneuver, which corresponds well to empirical knowledge obtained by expert pickers.

Obstacles such as crops and tall grass, which are deformable, must be identified as safely traversable, compared to rigid obstacles. To address this, we propose a new traversability analysis method based on a 3D spectral map reconstructed using a LIDAR and a multispectral camera. This approach enables the robot to distinguish between safe and unsafe collisions with deformable obstacles. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of multispectral metrics for vegetation detection and incorporate these metrics into an augmented environmental map.

We propose an imitation learning-based viewpoint planning approach to actively adjust camera viewpoint and capture unobstructed images of the target crop. Traditional viewpoint planners and existing learning-based methods, depend on manually designed evaluation metrics or reward functions, often struggle to generalize to complex, unseen scenarios. Our method employs the Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT) algorithm to learn effective camera motion policies from expert demonstrations. This enables continuous six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) viewpoint adjustments that are smoother, more precise and reveal occluded targets. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, featuring agricultural scenarios and a 6-DoF collaborative robot arm equipped with an RGB-D camera, demonstrate our method's superior success rate and efficiency, especially in complex occlusion conditions, as well as its ability to generalize across different crops without reprogramming. This study advances robotic harvesting by providing a practical “learn from demonstration” (LfD) solution to occlusion challenges, ultimately enhancing autonomous harvesting performance and productivity."

Our proposed approach utilizes a pair of nonholonomic robots connected by a deformable tube to efficiently manipulate objects of irregular shapes toward target locations. To autonomously perform this task, we develop a local integrated planning and control strategy that solves the problem in two steps (viz. enveloping and transport) based on the model predictive control (MPC) framework. The deformable underactuated system is simplified by a linear kinematic model. The enveloping problem is formulated as the minimization of multiple criteria that represent the enclosing error of the object by the variable morphology system. The transport problem is tackled by formulating the non-prehensile dragging action as an inequality constraint specified by the body frame of the deformable system. Reactive obstacle avoidance is ensured by a maximum margin-based term that utilizes the system's geometry and the feedback proximity to the environment. To validate the performance of the proposed methodology, we report a detailed experimental study with vision-guided robotic prototypes conducting multiple autonomous object transport tasks."

To address these problems, we propose the Implicit Physics-aware (IPA) policy, designed to facilitate effective soft tool use across various environmental configurations. The IPA policy conducts system identification to implicitly identify physics information and predict goal-conditioned, one-shot actions accordingly.

The key idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints---e.g., \"right shoulder\", \"left sleeve\", etc.---a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be effectively extracted from depth images and are sufficient to represent a broad range of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP leverages semantic keypoints to bridge LLM-powered task planning and low-level action execution in a two-level hierarchy. Extensive simulation experiments show that CLASP outperforms baseline methods across diverse clothes types in both seen and unseen tasks. Further, experiments with a Kinova dual-arm system on four distinct tasks---folding, flattening, hanging, and placing---confirm CLASP's performance on a real robot."

In the context of datacenters, the automation of networking tasks often involves the manipulation of optical transceivers within densely packed cable configurations. Such environments are characterized by an abundance of delicate, overlapping, and intersecting cables, leading to frequent occlusions. This paper introduces an innovative system designed for the manipulation of optical transceivers in environments cluttered by cables. Our integrated approach combines advanced 3D scene understanding with a heuristic-based pushing policy to effectively manipulate optical transceivers amidst clutter. The system's perception component utilizes image segmentation and 3D reconstruction to accurately model the transceivers and surrounding cables. Meanwhile, the planning aspect employs a search algorithm with task-specific heuristics, to navigate the gripper, displace obstructing cables, and safely achieve a precise pre-grasp position in front of the target transceiver. We have conducted extensive evaluations of our methodology in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its high success rates, robustness, and proficiency in addressing the unique challenges posed by cable-occluded environments within datacenters."

This problem is relevant to many real-world domains, including warehouse automation and construction. These domains give rise to instances involving a combination of geometric, kinematic, and physics constraints, which make planning particularly challenging. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions like the use of holonomic mobile robots or dexterous manipulators capable of unconstrained overhand reaching. Our key insight is we can empower even a constrained mobile pusher to tackle complex rearrangement tasks by enabling it to modify the environment to its favor in a constraint-aware fashion. To this end, we describe a Push-Traversability graph, whose vertices represent poses that the pusher can push objects from and edges represent optimal, kinematically feasible, and stable push-rearrangements of objects. Based on this graph, we develop ReloPush, a planning framework that leverages Dubins curves and standard graph search techniques to generate an efficient sequence of object rearrangements to be executed by the pusher. We evaluate ReloPush across a series of challenging scenarios, involving the rearrangement of densely cluttered workspaces with up to eight objects by a 1tenth mobile robot pusher. ReloPush exhibits orders of magnitude faster runtimes and significantly more robust execution in the real world, evidenced in lower execution times and fewer losses of object contact, compared to two baselines lacking our proposed graph structure."

We then engage in practice, where we try to emulate the expert and ensure that our actions produce similar effects on our environment. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Combining IMitation and Emulation for Motion Refinement (CIMER) -- a two-stage framework to learn dexterous prehensile manipulation skills from state-only observations. CIMER's first stage involves imitation: simultaneously encode the complex interdependent motions of the robot hand and the object in a structured dynamical system. This results in a reactive motion generation policy that provides a reasonable motion prior, but lacks the ability to reason about contact effects due to the lack of action labels. The second stage involves emulation: learn a motion refinement policy via reinforcement that adjusts the robot hand's motion prior such that the desired object motion is reenacted. CIMER is both task-agnostic (no task-specific reward design or shaping) and intervention-free (no additional teleoperated or labeled demonstrations). Detailed experiments with prehensile dexterity reveal that i) imitation alone is insufficient, but adding emulation drastically improves performance, ii) CIMER outperforms existing methods in terms of sample efficiency and the ability to generate realistic and stable motions, iii) CIMER can either zero-shot generalize or learn to adapt to novel objects from the YCB dataset, even outperforming expert policies trained with action labels in most cases.

Yet, without the guidance of expert demonstrations, many tasks are difficult and time-consuming to plan using the dynamics models. Therefore, we take the best of both model learning and imitation learning, and propose neural dynamics augmented imitation learning that covers a large scene configurations with few-shot demonstrations.

    "abstract": "Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a widely used technique for skill acquisition in robotics. However, demonstrations of the same skill may exhibit significant variances, or learning systems may attempt to acquire different means of the same skill simultaneously, making it challenging to encode these motions into movement primitives. To address these challenges, we propose an LfD framework, namely the Conditional Neural Expert Processes (CNEP), that learns to assign demonstrations from different modes to distinct expert networks utilizing the inherent information within the latent space to match experts with the encoded representations. CNEP does not require supervision on which mode the trajectories belong to. We compare the performance of CNEP against widely used and powerful LfD methods such as Gaussian Mixture Models, Probabilistic Movement Primitives, and Stable Movement Primitives and show that our method outperforms these baselines on multimodal trajectory datasets. The results reveal enhanced modeling performance for movement primitives, leading to the synthesis of trajectories that more accurately reflect those demonstrated by experts, particularly when the skill demonstrations include intersection points from various trajectories. We evaluated the CNEP model on two real-robot tasks, namely obstacle avoidance and pick-and-place tasks, that require the robot to learn multi-modal motion trajectories and execute the correct primitives given target environment conditions. We also showed that our system is capable of on-the-fly adaptation to environmental changes via an online conditioning mechanism. Lastly, we believe that CNEP offers improved explainability and interpretability by autonomously finding discrete behavior primitives and providing probability values about its expert selection decisions."

We present PRIME (PRimitive-based IMitation with data Efficiency), a behavior primitive-based framework designed for improving the data efficiency of imitation learning. PRIME scaffolds robot tasks by decomposing task demonstrations into primitive sequences, followed by learning a high-level control policy to sequence primitives through imitation learning.

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) radars have attracted significant attention from both academia and industry due to their capability to operate in extreme weather conditions. However, they face challenges in terms of sparsity and noise interference, which hinder their application in the field of micro aerial vehicle (MAV) autonomous navigation. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to dense and accurate mmWave radar point cloud construction via cross-modal learning. Specifically, we introduce diffusion models, which possess state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, to predict LiDAR-like point clouds from paired raw radar data. We also incorporate the most recent diffusion model inference accelerating techniques to ensure that the proposed method can be implemented on MAVs. We validate the proposed method through extensive benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and generalization ability.

    "abstract": "Constructing high-definition (HD) maps is a crucial requirement for enabling autonomous driving. In recent years, several map segmentation algorithms have been developed to address this need, leveraging advancements in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) perception. However, existing models still encounter challenges in producing realistic and consistent semantic map layouts. One prominent issue is the limited utilization of structured priors inherent in map segmentation masks. In light of this, we propose DiffMap, a novel approach specifically designed to model the structured priors of map segmentation masks using latent diffusion model. By incorporating this technique, the performance of existing semantic segmentation methods can be significantly enhanced and certain structural errors present in the segmentation outputs can be effectively rectified. Notably, the proposed module can be seamlessly integrated into any map segmentation model, thereby augmenting its capability to accurately delineate semantic information. Furthermore, through extensive visualization analysis, our model demonstrates superior proficiency in generating results that more accurately reflect real-world map layouts, further validating its efficacy in improving the quality of the generated maps."

Prior approaches have difficulties in recovering fine-grained details and true colors of the scene under extremely low-light environments due to near-to-zero SNR. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown significant progress towards general domain image generation. In this paper, we propose to leverage the pre-trained latent diffusion model to perform the neural ISP for enhancing extremely low-light images. Specifically, to tailor the pre-trained latent diffusion model to operate on the RAW domain, we train a set of lightweight taming modules to inject the RAW information into the diffusion denoising process via modulating the intermediate features of UNet. We further observe different roles of UNet denoising and decoder reconstruction in the latent diffusion model, which inspires us to decompose the low-light image enhancement task into latent-space low-frequency content generation and decoding-phase high-frequency detail maintenance. Through extensive experiments on representative datasets, we demonstrate our simple design not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative evaluations but also shows significant superiority in visual comparisons over strong baselines, which highlight the effectiveness of powerful generative priors for neural ISP under extremely low-light environments."

Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation models to compare pixels between the original and synthesized images in a learned feature space and detect semantically meaningful edits. Our diffusion-based analysis-by-synthesis method enables accurate anomaly detections for off-road navigation."

Through our extensive hardware experiments, we show that the approach demonstrates high robustness against unknown objects of different masses, materials, sizes, and shapes.

Additionally, robotic systems are typically assumed to follow basic rigid-body dynamics. However, several examples in nature illustrate how changes in physical material properties yield functional advantages. In this paper, we explore how physical materials (non-rigid bodies) affect the functional performance of a hopping robot. In doing so, we address the practical question of how to model and simulate material properties. Through these simulations we demonstrate that material gradients in the leg of a single-limb hopper provide functional advantages compared to homogeneous designs. For example, when considering incline ramp hopping, a material gradient with increasing density provides a 35% reduction in tracking error and a 23% reduction in power consumption compared to homogeneous stainless steel. By providing bio-inspiration to the rigid limbs in a robotic system, we seek to show that future fabrication of robots should look to leverage the material anisotropies of moduli and density found in nature. This would allow for reduced vibrations in the system and would provide offsets of joint torques and vibrations while protecting their structural integrity against reduced fatigue and wear. This simulation system could inspire future intelligent material gradients of custom-fabricated robotic locomotive devices."

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25−78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework."

However, they still face mobility challenges including steep slopes and unstable soil that can entrap vehicles, as demonstrated by NASA’s Spirit rover. Vehicles on Earth can depend on a human operator or rescue vehicle to tow them out of an entrapment, but remote rovers cannot, limiting their route to highly conservative path selections. To increase rover mobility on slopes and unstable soils, we present a resettable anchor launcher for independent self-rescue. The device launches a tethered land anchor away from the rover and then uses a winch to tow the rover up a hill or out of an entrapment. This paper presents the design of the launcher and its integration into a half-meter-long rover mobility platform with field testing at the NASA Glenn Research Center SLOPE Lab. We demonstrate repeatable launching and winching to help the rover climb a 17° slope of loose GRC-1 Lunar regolith simulant that it otherwise could not climb. Our work presents an alternative method to increase rover mobility, especially up slopes, and enables independent rover rescue, which could eventually increase mission duration and reduce risk of entrapment during extraterrestrial exploration."

Robotic assembly is critical to reduce required crew time and risk, while modularity ensures that solutions are versatile and adaptive to complex mission concepts. NASA’s Automated Reconfigurable Mission Adaptive Digital Assembly Systems (ARMADAS) project demonstrated that robots with relatively low cost, size, and degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) can be used for large-scale modular lattice structure assembly. This is possible by using the structural modules for robotic systems metrology and error mitigation. Robots with reduced complexity may lead to advantages in initial and maintenance cost, offering an alternative to large, complex, and expensive robots. In this paper, we describe the Structure Omni-directional Foldable Explorer (SOF-E), a robot with significantly lower mass and DoF compared to the previous ARMADAS robot architecture. Although SOF-E is a five DoF robot with only two or three control states per actuator, it is capable of transporting and placing structural modules by collaborating with other instances of itself. We discuss the mechanical design and architecture of SOF-E, including analysis of energy usage during each operation. Experiments demonstrate that during locomotion and module transport tasks, SOF-E requires significantly lower energy than the previous cargo transport robot architecture, the Scaling Omni-directional Lattice Locomoting Explorer (SOLL-E). The cost of transport metric is used to compare the energy efficiency of the operation."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Quarry-Bot, a Reconfigurable Cable-Suspended Robot developed to support the NASA Artemis program’s efforts in preparing for the long-term colonization of the Moon and Mars. Quarry-Bot autonomously clears debris on the lunar surface, a key step in site preparation for future habitats and infrastructure. The system utilizes active control strategies, combined with the Moon’s lower gravity, to perform underhand rock tosses as a scalable approach to extraterrestrial site preparation. Its reconfigurable structure, including motorized anchor points and a lightweight tripod design, adjusts cable tensions to generate swing motions for debris displacement. The system is driven by two Dynamixel MX-106 motors for movement and steering, along with a NEMA 17 stepper motor for cable adjustments. A decentralized control system, managed by Raspberry Pi units, coordinates these components. Simulations and experiments conducted under both Earth and lunar gravity conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies in achieving rock throws. Quarry-Bot reaches swing angles and projects rocks over distances that may support lunar site clearing and overall engineering purposes. The paper concludes by discussing potential areas for further system refinement, including adjustments for different terrain conditions and im- proved actuation strategies for lunar missions."

    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "Sandy environments present challenges for robotic space rovers and systems due to reduced traction, limiting mobility and tugging force. This paper presents an anchoring method that utilizes a winching system to create a sand mound in front of a mobile agent dragged through the media. The proposed controller is designed to consistently achieve real-time capture of close-to-maximal lateral sand mound resistive force, even when applied to varied uneven terrains, like holes or waves. Notably, tugging is non-reversible, so suitable peaks should be captured before breakdown and without necessarily knowing the global optimum a priori. The controller logic tracks both tugging force and agent pitch gradients to detect terrain conditions and peak force trends. Results show that the controller captures an average 92% of the maximum forces, within the previously winched workspace tested, across three different granular media with four varying structured terrain features. The controller achieves higher resistive force peaks on terrains with geometric features, as opposed to flat sand. We conclude that sand mounding through tugging is a viable means to generate robotic resistive forces for unknown sandy terrains, a simple yet effective anchoring mechanism."

It enables vehicles to recognize road markings at the pixel-level, and facilitates subsequent path planning, localization, and map construction tasks. Current techniques mainly focus on normal driving scenes (i.e., clear daytime), and the performance would decrease significantly for adverse weather conditions. This work proposes RMSeg-UDA: an unsupervised domain adaptive road marking segmentation framework. By combining schedule self- training and class-conditioned adversarial training, the network utilizes both labeled normal data and unlabeled data from other domains to train a road marking segmentation model. For the evaluation on adverse conditions, a new image dataset, RLMD- AC, is established with rainy and nighttime driving scenes. The experiments conducted using both public and our datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

    "abstract": "Point cloud semantic segmentation is crucial in various applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality, aiming to assign labels to each point in a cloud to reflect spatial relationships and boundaries. While previous methods primarily focus on geometric features, they often overlook the auxiliary role of color information, especially in scenes where geometric structures are less distinct. In this paper, we propose the Color Point Cloud Enhancement (CPCE) method to effectively leverage color information for improved 3D scene understanding. CPCE introduces a color information enhancement module with multi-scale consistency, enriching point features throughout the encoder stages. Additionally, we develop a novel contrastive learning module that uses relative color coordinates for point cloud serialization, allowing for the capture of positive and negative samples from distant points with similar color textures. Furthermore, we design a contrastive learning module tailored for scenes with weak geometric structures, enhancing feature representation through color-augmented contrast. Our method achieved a 78.1% mIoU on the ScanNet dataset, outperforming existing models trained on a single dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of CPCE in scenarios where traditional methods struggle, particularly in enhancing segmentation accuracy by utilizing color as a critical feature."

Featuring an efficient encoder-decoder architecture, our model significantly reduces parameter count and floating point operations (FLOPs) compared to current methods. We further enhance performance through a self-supervised pretraining approach that employs a novel, task-oriented masking strategy, thereby improving feature extraction. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that UltraFastCrackSeg achieves state-of-the-art Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 scores while maintaining a compact model size and high inference speed. Evaluations on a low-power CPU device confirm its capability to achieve up to 80 frames per second (FPS) with ONNX runtime optimization, making it highly suitable for real-time, on-site applications. These findings establish UltraFastCrackSeg as a robust and efficient solution for practical crack detection tasks."

We leverage descriptive image features from such a model to train two lightweight network heads for semantic segmentation and object boundary detection, using very few annotated training samples. We then merge their predictions via a novel fusion module that yields panoptic maps based on normalized cut. To further enhance the performance, we utilize self-training on unlabeled images selected by a feature-driven similarity scheme. We underline the relevance of our approach by employing PASTEL to important robot perception use cases from autonomous driving and agricultural robotics. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PASTEL significantly outperforms previous methods for label-efficient segmentation even when using fewer annotations.

    "abstract": "Learning control policies using deep reinforcement learning has shown great success for a variety of applications, including robotics and automated driving. A key area limiting the adaptation of RL in the real world is the lack of trust in the decision-making process of such policies. Therefore, explainability is a requirement of any RL agent operating in the real world. In this work, we propose a family of control policies that are explainable-by-design regarding individual observation components on object-based scene representations. By estimating diagonal squashed Gaussian and categorical mixture distributions on sub-spaces of the decomposed observations, we develop stochastic policies with easy-to-read explanations of the decision-making process. Our design is generally applicable to any RL algorithm using stochastic policies. We showcase the explainability on an extensive suite of single- and multi-agent simulations, set- and sequence-based high-level scenes, and discrete and continuous action spaces, with performance at least on-par or better compared to standard policy architectures. In additional experiments, we analyze the robustness of our approach to its single additional hyper-parameter and examine its potential for very low computational requirements with tiny policies."

This capability is critical as MLLMs become more integrated with collaborative robotic systems. In scenarios where a target object is surrounded by similar objects (distractors), robots must deliver clear, spatially-aware instructions to guide humans effectively. We refer to this challenge as contextual object localization and disambiguation, which imposes stricter constraints than conventional 3D dense captioning, especially regarding ensuring target exclusivity. In response, we propose simple yet effective techniques to enhance the model's ability to localize and disambiguate target objects.

However, the opaque nature of the black-box neural network models employed by MARL algorithms has impeded their widespread adoption due to concerns over interpretability, debugging, and user trust.To address these limitations, we propose an interpretable MAPF framework that emulates a group of n path-finding agents optimized through reinforcement learning (RL) using behavior trees (BTs), where n is the number of agents in path-finding scenarios. Expert behavior datasets consisting of state-action trajectories from MARL algorithms are generated, and a knowledge distillation approach is employed to reduce the size of the datasets and extract implicit rules.Additionally, a principled rules factorization technique based on Boolean algebra theory is utilized to prune the behavior rules and create more compact BTs representations.The proposed framework is evaluated on randomly generated MAPF scenarios and demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BTs generation methods. This paper advances the field of interpretable AI by enabling the extraction of understandable decision-making processes from complex reinforcement learning models in multi-agent systems."

Legible robot arm motion is crucial in tasks like these in order to avoid possible collisions, improve the workflow and help ensure the safety of the person. Prior work in this area, however, focuses on solutions that are tested only in uncluttered environments and there are not many results taken from cluttered environments. In this research we present a measure for clutteredness based on an entropic measure of the environment, and a novel motion planner based on potential fields. Both our measure and the planner were tested in a cluttered environment meant to represent a more typical tool-sorting task for which the person would collaborate with a robot. The in-person validation study with Baxter robots shows a significant improvement in legibility of our proposed legible motion planner compared to the current state-of-the-art legible motion planner in cluttered environments. Further, the results show a significant difference in the performance of the planners in cluttered and uncluttered environments, and the need to further explore legible motion in cluttered environments. We argue that the inconsistency of our results in cluttered environments with those obtained from uncluttered environments points out several important issues with the current research performed in the area of legible motion planners."

Unknown Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS), which aims to identify all objects in unknown categories and backgrounds, has become a key capability for various robotic tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose QuBER (Quadruple Boundary Error Refinement), a novel error-informed refinement approach for high-quality UOIS. QuBER first estimates quadruple boundary errors—true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative pixels—at the instance boundaries of the initial segmentation. It then refines the segmentation using an error-guided fusion mechanism, effectively correcting both fine-grained and instance-level segmentation errors. Extensive evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that QuBER outperforms state-of-the-art methods and consistently improves various UOIS methods while maintaining a fast inference time of less than 0.1 seconds. Furthermore, we show that QuBER improves the success rate of grasping target objects in cluttered environments.

Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object grounding with simple (bare) queries, but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene graph representation with metric and semantic edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to construct 3D object-centric map and an advanced raycasting algorithm with a 2D vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On the Replica and ScanNet datasets, we have demonstrated that BBQ takes a leading place in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation compared to other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On challenging Sr3D+, Nr3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling objects grounding by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The combination of our design choices and software implementation has resulted in significant data processing speed in experiments on the robot on-board computer.

For the most common depth cameras and LiDAR sensors, the distinctive optical attributes inherent in both transparent and reflective objects pose a significant challenge. To address this problem, this study proposes a lightweight joint boundary detection and semantic segmentation network named LBSNet. LBSNet aims to enhance the perception of transparent and reflective objects in complex and dynamic environments, using RGB images only. It leverages the synergy between boundary detection and semantic segmentation through feature fusion and a multitask learning mechanism. The encoder consists of two paths: one captures category-aware semantic information, while the other discerns boundaries from multi-scale features. The gated channel adaptive (GCA) module enhances boundary features by learning channel parameters. The dynamic adaptive feature fusion (DAFF) module dynamically adjusts semantic and boundary information through cross-feature fusion. These methods effectively capture the distinctive characteristics of transparent and reflective objects, such as light refraction, boundary blurring and low contrast. Experimental results show that LBSNet achieves higher accuracy and faster processing speed on multiple public datasets compared with existing methods.

    "abstract": "Capturing stationary aerial objects on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is challenging due to quasiperiodic and fast floating-base motions caused by wave-induced disturbances. It is hard to (1) maintain high motion prediction accuracy due to the stochastic nature of these disturbances and (2) perform object capture through real-time tracking due to the limited active torque. We introduce confidence analysis in predictive capture. To address the inaccuracy predictions, we calculate a real-time confidence tube to evaluate the prediction quality. To overcome tracking difficulties, we plan a trajectory to capture the object at a future moment while maximizing the confidence of the capture position on the predicted trajectory. All calculations are completed within 0.2 seconds to ensure a timely response. We validate our approach through experiments, where we simulate disturbances by executing real USV motions using a servo platform. The results demonstrate that our method achieves an 80% success rate."

    "abstract": "Water caustics are commonly observed in seafloor imaging data from shallow-water areas. Traditional methods that remove caustic patterns from images often rely on 2D filtering or pre-training on an annotated dataset, hindering the performance when generalizing to real-world seafloor data with 3D structures. In this paper, we present a novel method Recurrent Gaussian Splatting (RecGS), which takes advantage of today’s photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), to separate caustics from seafloor imagery. With a sequence of images taken by an underwater robot, we build 3DGS recurrently and decompose the caustic with low-pass filtering in each iteration. In the experiments, we analyze and compare with different methods, including joint optimization, 2D filtering, and deep learning approaches. The results show that our proposed RecGS paradigm can effectively separate the caustic from the seafloor, improving the visual appearance, and can be potentially applied on more problems with inconsistent illumination."

    "abstract": "Learning-based methods, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), hold great promise for streamlining deployment, enhancing performance, and achieving generalization in the control of autonomous multirotor aerial vehicles. Deep RL has been able to control complex systems with impressive fidelity and agility in simulation but the simulation-to-reality transfer often brings a hard-to-bridge reality gap. Moreover, RL is commonly plagued by prohibitively long training times. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic-based architecture coupled with a highly reliable RL-based training paradigm for end-to-end quadrotor control. We show how curriculum learning and a highly optimized simulator enhance sample complexity and lead to fast training times. To precisely discuss the challenges related to low-level/end-to-end multirotor control, we also introduce a taxonomy that classifies the existing levels of control abstractions as well as non-linearities and domain parameters. Our framework enables Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) transfer for direct RPM control after only 18 seconds of training on a consumer-grade laptop as well as its deployment on microcontrollers to control a multirotor under real-time guarantees. Finally, our solution exhibits competitive performance in trajectory tracking, as demonstrated through various experimental comparisons with existing state-of-the-art control solutions using a real Crazyflie nano quadrotor. We open source the code including a very fast multirotor dynamics simulator that can simulate about 5 months of flight per second on a laptop GPU. The fast training times and deployment to a cheap, off-the-shelf quadrotor lower the barriers to entry and help democratize the research and development of these systems."

Given the significant challenges in automatically detecting defects of varying intensity and size within complex infrastructure, along with the tendency of lightweight models to lose detail and fail to fully capture features during the defect extraction process, we propose the CUPID_Block, a multi-level information fusion block to construct the backbone, featuring the CUPID_Conv module equipped with our proposed CCA (CrissCross Attention). Furthermore, CUPID features an auxiliary training branch that assimilates lower feature maps, helping to recover details lost in deeper convolutional layers. To verify the effectiveness of CUPID and to address the lack of a suitable dataset in the community, we establish a multi-scenario infrastructure defect dataset, CUBIT2024, to conduct extensive experiments. Finally, to assess the efficiency and adaptability of CUPID in UAV for online infrastructure inspection, we design a compact autonomous drone, CU-Astro, where the proposed CUPID is deployed on the Jetson Orin NX computer onboard to evaluate the speed and power consumption of the inference."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes the ProxFly, a residual deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based controller for close proximity quadcopter flight. Specifically, we design a residual module on top of a cascaded controller (denoted as basic controller) to generate high-level control commands, which compensate for external disturbances and thrust loss caused by downwash effects from other quadcopters. First, our method takes only the ego state and controllers' commands as inputs and does not rely on any communication between quadcopters, thereby reducing the bandwidth requirement. Through domain randomization, our method relaxes the requirement for accurate system identification and fine-tuned controller parameters, allowing it to adapt to changing system models. Meanwhile, our method not only reduces the proportion of unexplainable signals from the black box in control commands but also enables the RL training to skip the time-consuming exploration from scratch via guidance from the basic controller. We validate the effectiveness of the residual module in the simulation with different proximities. Moreover, we conduct the real close proximity flight test to compare ProxFly with the basic controller and an advanced model-based controller with complex aerodynamic compensation. Finally, we show that ProxFly can be used for challenging quadcopter mid-air docking, where two quadcopters fly in extreme proximity, and strong airflow significantly disrupts flight. However, our method can stabilize the quadcopter in this case and accomplish docking. The resources are available at https://github.com/ruiqizhang99/ProxFly."

The aerial agent needs to not only understand tactically evolving maneuvers of fighter jets from a long-term perspective but also react to rapidly changing aerodynamics of aircraft from a short-term viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce TempFuser, a novel long short-term temporal fusion transformer architecture that can learn agile, tactical, and acrobatic flight maneuvers in complex dogfight problems. Our approach integrates two distinct temporal transition embeddings into a transformer-based network to comprehensively capture both the long-term tactics and short-term agility of aerial agents. By incorporating these perspectives, our policy network generates end-to-end flight commands that secure dominant positions over the long term and effectively outmaneuver agile opponents. After training in a high-fidelity flight simulator, our model successfully learns to execute strategic maneuvers, outperforming baseline policy models against various types of opponent aircraft. Notably, our model exhibits human-like acrobatic maneuvers even when facing adversaries with superior specifications, all without relying on prior knowledge. Moreover, it demonstrates robust pursuit performance in challenging supersonic and low-altitude situations. Demo videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/tempfuser."

    "abstract": "This paper presents modular reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for the low-level control of a quadrotor, enabling direct control of yawing motion. While traditional monolithic RL approaches have demonstrated success in real-world autonomous flight, they often struggle to precisely control both the translational and yawing motions due to their distinct dynamic characteristics and strong coupling. Moreover, training a large-scale monolithic network typically demands a wealth of training data for broad generalization. To address these issues, we decompose the quadrotor dynamics into translational and yawing subsystems and assign dedicated modular RL agents for each. This design significantly improves performance, as each RL agent is trained for its specific purpose, and they are integrated in a synergistic way. It further enhances robustness, as potential failures within one module have minimal impact on the other, promoting fault tolerance. These improvements are illustrated by flight experiments achieved via zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. It is shown that the proposed modular policies substantially enhance training efficiency, tracking performance, and adaptability to real-world conditions."

    "abstract": "Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly becoming a popular control structure in robotics due to their modularity, reactivity, and robustness. In terms of BT generation methods, BT planning shows promise for generating reliable BTs. However, the scalability of BT planning is often constrained by prolonged planning times in complex scenarios, largely due to a lack of domain knowledge. In contrast, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated task reasoning capabilities across various domains, though the correctness and safety of their planning remain uncertain. This paper proposes integrating BT planning with LLM reasoning, introducing Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning (HBTP)—a reliable and efficient framework for BT generation. The key idea in HBTP is to leverage LLMs for task-specific reasoning to generate a heuristic path, which BT planning can then follow to expand efficiently. We first introduce the heuristic BT expansion process, along with two heuristic variants designed for optimal planning and satisficing planning, respectively. Then, we propose methods to address the inaccuracies of LLM reasoning, including action space pruning and reflective feedback, to further enhance both reasoning accuracy and planning efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the theoretical bounds of HBTP, and results from four datasets confirm its practical effectiveness in everyday service robot applications."

    "abstract": "As robots become increasingly capable, users will want to describe high-level missions and have robots infer the relevant details. Because pre-built maps are difficult to obtain in many realistic settings, accomplishing such missions will require the robot to map and plan online. While many semantic planning methods operate online, they are typically designed for well specified missions such as object search or exploration. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful contextual reasoning abilities over a range of robotic tasks described in natural language. However, existing LLM-enabled planners typically do not consider online planning or complex missions; rather, relevant subtasks and semantics are provided by a pre-built map or a user. We address these limitations via SPINE, an online planner for missions with incomplete mission specifications provided in natural language. The planner uses an LLM to reason about subtasks implied by the mission specification and then realizes these subtasks in a receding horizon framework. Tasks are automatically validated for safety and refined online with new map observations. We evaluate SPINE in simulation and real-world settings with missions that require multiple steps of semantic reasoning and exploration in cluttered outdoor environments of over 20,000 square meters. Compared to baselines that use existing LLM-enabled planning approaches, our method is over twice as efficient in terms of time and distance, requires less user interactions, and does not require a full map.

CLIER performs multi-modal reasoning and action planning and generates a sequence of primitive actions that can be executed by a robot manipulator. Our method operates in a closed loop, responding to changes in the environment. Our approach is developed with the use of MuBle simulation environment and tested in 10 interactive benchmark scenarios.

Task planning under these constraints is essential for enabling autonomous robot operation in domains that require adherence to domain-specific knowledge. Current methods for generating robot goals and plans rely on common sense knowledge encoded in large language models. However, these models lack grounding of robot plans to domain-specific knowledge and are not easily transferable between multiple sites or customers with different compliance needs. In this work, we present SayComply, which enables grounding robotic task planning with operational compliance using retrieval-based language models. We design a hierarchical database of operational, environment, and robot embodiment manuals and procedures to enable efficient retrieval of the relevant context under the limited context length of the LLMs. We then design a task planner using a tree-based retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique to generate robot tasks that follow user instructions while simultaneously complying with the domain knowledge in the database. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through simulations and hardware experiments in real-world scenarios that require precise context retrieval across various types of context, outperforming the standard RAG method. Our approach bridges the gap in deploying robots that consistently adhere to operational protocols, offering a scalable and edge-deployable solution for ensuring compliance across varied and complex real-world environments."

    "abstract": "This study proposes LiP-LLM: integrating linear programming and dependency graph with large language models (LLMs) for multi-robot task planning. In order for multiple robots to perform tasks more efficiently, it is necessary to manage the precedence dependencies between tasks. Although multi-robot decentralized and centralized task planners using LLMs have been proposed, none of these studies focus on precedence dependencies from the perspective of task efficiency or leverage traditional optimization methods. It addresses key challenges in managing dependencies between skills and optimizing task allocation. LiP-LLM consists of three steps: skill list generation and dependency graph generation by LLMs, and task allocation using linear programming. The LLMs are utilized to generate a comprehensive list of skills and to construct a dependency graph that maps the relationships and sequential constraints among these skills. To ensure the feasibility and efficiency of skill execution, the skill list is generated by calculated likelihood, and linear programming is used to optimally allocate tasks to each robot. Experimental evaluations in simulated environments demonstrate that this method outperforms existing task planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in executing complex, multi-robot tasks. The results indicate the potential of combining LLMs with optimization techniques to enhance the capabilities of multi-robot systems in executing coordinated tasks accurately and efficiently. In an environment with two robots, a maximum success rate difference of 0.82 is observed in the language instruction group with a change in the object name."

In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime.

We conduct a simulation to confirm that the magnetic flux generated from a solenoid forms a closed-loop magnetic path without magnetic saturation or leakage in the proposed haptic dial. The resistive torque of the proposed haptic dial varied from 8 N·mm to 47 N·mm as the input current changed from 0 to 300 mA, thus indicating that the proposed haptic dial can create a variety of haptic sensations in a tiny size (diameter: 20 mm; height:20 mm)."

    "abstract": "Robots have surpassed humans in terms of strength and precision, yet humans retain an unparalleled ability for decision-making in the face of unpredictable disturbances. This article aims to combine the strengths of both entities within a singular task: human motion guidance under strict geometric constraints, particularly adhering to predetermined paths. To tackle this challenge, a modular haptic guidance law is proposed that takes the human-applied wrench as an input. Using an auxiliary variable called phase, the generated desired motion is guaranteed to consistently adhere to the constraint path. It is demonstrated how the guidance policy can be generalized into physically interpretable terms, adjustable either prior to initiating the task or dynamically while the task is in progress. Additionally, an illustrative guidance adaptation policy is showcased that takes into account the human's manipulability. Leveraging passivity analysis, potential sources of instability are pinpointed, and subsequently, overall system stability is ensured by incorporating an augmented virtual energy tank. Lastly, a comprehensive set of experiments, including a 20-participant user study, explores various aspects of the approach in practice, encompassing both technical and usability consideration."

In a previous work, we introduced the Wearable-Fabric Yielding Display (W-FYD), which uses an elastic thin fabric as the interaction surface with the finger, allowing the delivery of softness-related cues both in active and passive exploration mode, together with sliding stimuli. The device was proven effective, but the current design faces form factor issues related to the dimensions and weight of the device, due to the actuation strategy of the lifting mechanism in the passive mode. To tackle this issue, we propose a miniaturized version of the system, named the W-FYD AIR, which allows reducing the overall dimensions of the device, from 100 × 60 × 36 mm to 78 × 45 × 37 mm, and its weight, from 100 g to 54 g, by exploiting pneumatically-actuated chambers for the lifting mechanism. Through careful sizing of each component and a process of characterization and identification, we demonstrated that the new system attained the same characteristics and functionality as the original one."

    "abstract": "With the rise of stochastic generative models in robot policy learning, end-to-end visuomotor policies are increasingly successful at solving complex tasks by learning from human demonstrations. Nevertheless, since real-world evaluation costs afford users only a small number of policy rollouts, it remains a challenge to accurately gauge the performance of such policies. This is exacerbated by distribution shifts causing unpredictable changes in performance during deployment. To rigorously evaluate behavior cloning policies, we present a framework that provides a tight lower-bound on robot performance in an arbitrary environment, using a minimal number of experimental policy rollouts. Notably, by applying the standard stochastic ordering to robot performance distributions, we provide a worst-case bound on the entire distribution of performance (via bounds on the cumulative distribution function) for a given task. We build upon established statistical results to ensure that the bounds hold with a user-specified confidence level and tightness, and are constructed from as few policy rollouts as possible. In experiments we evaluate policies for visuomotor manipulation in both simulation and hardware. Specifically, we (i) empirically validate the guarantees of the bounds in simulated manipulation settings, (ii) find the degree to which a learned policy deployed on hardware generalizes to new real-world environments, and (iii) rigorously compare two policies tested in out-of-distribution settings. Our experimental data, code, and implementation of confidence bounds are open-source."

However, variations in vision-aware language vocabulary data used for open-vocabulary learning can lead to unfair and unreliable evaluations. Recent evaluation methods have attempted to address this issue by incorporating object properties or adding locations and characteristics to the captions. Nevertheless, since these properties and locations depend on the specific details of the images instead of classes, detectors can not make accurate predictions without precise descriptions provided through human annotation. This paper introduces 3F-OVD , a novel task that extends supervised fine-grained object detection to the open-vocabulary setting. Our task is intuitive and challenging, requiring a deep understanding of fine-grained captions and careful attention to fine-grained details in images in order to accurately detect fine-grained objects . Additionally, due to the scarcity of qualified fine-grained object detection datasets, we have created a new dataset, NEU-171K , tailored for both supervised and open-vocabulary settings. We benchmark state-of-the-art object detectors on our dataset for both settings. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective post-processing technique.

Existing works can be categorized into two groups: those focusing on accuracy, predicting a single future motion, and those generating diverse predictions based on observations. The former group fails to address the uncertainty and multi-modal nature of human motion, while the latter group often produces motion sequences that deviate too far from the ground truth or become unrealistic within historical contexts. To tackle these issues, we propose TransFusion, an innovative and practical diffusion-based model for 3D human motion prediction which can generate samples that are more likely to happen while maintaining a certain level of diversity. Our model leverages Transformer as the backbone with long skip connections between shallow and deep layers. Additionally, we employ the discrete cosine transform to model motion sequences in the frequency space, thereby improving performance. In contrast to prior diffusion-based models that utilize extra modules like cross-attention and adaptive layer normalization to condition the prediction on past observed motion, we treat all inputs, including conditions, as tokens to create a more practical and effective model compared to existing approaches. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of our human motion prediction model.

Higher-level tasks, such as understanding the interactions and social activities among individuals, are also crucial. Progress towards models that can fully understand scenes involving multiple people is hindered by a lack of sufficient annotated data for such high-level tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce Social-MAE, a simple yet effective transformer-based masked autoencoder framework for multi-person human motion data. The framework uses masked modeling to pre-train the encoder to reconstruct masked human joint trajectories, enabling it to learn generalizable representations of motion in human crowded scenes. Social-MAE comprises a transformer as the MAE encoder and a lighter-weight transformer as the MAE decoder which operates on multi-person joints’ trajectory. After the reconstruction task, the MAE decoder is replaced with a task-specific decoder and the model is fine-tuned end-to-end for a variety of high-level social tasks. Our proposed model combined with our pre-training approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on various high-level social tasks, including multi-person pose forecasting, social grouping, and social action understanding. These improvements are demonstrated across four popular multi-person datasets encompassing both human 2D and 3D body pose."

Traditional methods often rely on maintaining a significant distance between the robot and the human, which limits interaction and responsiveness.

Nonetheless, it presents challenges in accurately interpreting human walking intentions due to a restricted observational field. In our paper, we introduce an innovative Depth-Temporal Attention Network that takes lower-limb depth images and robot motor signals as input, to accurately predict human walking intentions. This network leverages a depth attention module to capture essential spatial features and integrates a temporal attention mechanism to analyze movement dynamics. To enhance generalization, we use a domain adversarial module that focuses on shared features across diverse walking data, ensuring consistent performance across users. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive average intention prediction accuracy of 91.09%, significantly surpassing baseline models by 12.59% to 23.66%. Additionally, an ablation study reveals that the depth-attention module substantially improves the model's understanding of depth features, resulting in an 11.44% increase in accuracy. With this high prediction accuracy, smooth front-following is achieved at close-proximity."

Benefiting from their distinct advantages, such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, event cameras have been applied to address 3D reconstruction, important for robotic mapping. Recently, neural rendering techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have been shown successful in 3D reconstruction. However, it still remains under-explored how to develop an effective event-based 3DGS pipeline. In particular, as 3DGS typically depends on high-quality initialization and dense multiview constraints, a potential problem appears for the 3DGS optimization with events given its inherent sparse property. To this end, we propose a novel event-based 3DGS framework, named textbf{Elite-EvGS}. Our key idea is to distill the prior knowledge from the off-the-shelf event-to-video (E2V) models to effectively reconstruct 3D scenes from events in a coarse-to-fine optimization manner. Specifically, to address the complexity of 3DGS initialization from events, we introduce a novel textit{warm-up initialization strategy} that optimizes a coarse 3DGS from the frames generated by E2V models and then incorporates events to refine the details. Then, we propose a textit{progressive event supervision strategy} that employs the window-slicing operation to progressively reduce the number of events used for supervision. This subtly relives the temporal randomness of the event frames, benefiting the optimization of local textural and global structural details. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that Elite-EvGS can reconstruct 3D scenes with better textural and structural details. Meanwhile, our method yields plausible performance on the captured real-world data, including diverse challenging conditions, such as fast motion and low light scenes.

    "abstract": "Flexible continuum manipulators are valued for minimally invasive surgery, offering access to confined spaces through nonlinear paths. However, cable-driven manipulators face control difficulties due to hysteresis from cabling effects such as friction, elongation, and coupling. These effects are difficult to model due to nonlinearity and the difficulties become even more evident when dealing with long and coupled, multi-segmented manipulator. This paper proposes a data-driven approach based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to capture these nonlinear and previous states-dependent characteristics of cable actuation. We collect physical joint configurations according to command joint configurations using RGBD sensing and 7 fiducial markers to model the hysteresis of the proposed manipulator. Result on a study comparing the estimation performance of four DNN models show that the Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) demonstrates the highest predictive capability. Leveraging trained TCNs, we build a control algorithm to compensate for hysteresis. Tracking tests in task space using unseen trajectories show that the proposed control algorithm reduces the average position and orientation error by 61.39% (from 13.7mm to 5.29 mm) and 64.04% (from 31.17° to 11.21°), respectively. This result implies that the proposed calibrated controller effectively reaches the desired configurations by estimating the hysteresis of the manipulator. Applying this method in real surgical scenarios has the potential to enhance control precision and improve surgical performance."

    "abstract": "Hysteresis in the tendons driving continuum robots is frequently regarded as a nuisance and a problem that is best avoided. Some prior work seeks to ameliorate the effects of hysteresis through the selection of materials. Others propose models of hysteresis to compensate for their effects. In this work, we present an empirically validated model of hysteresis in tendon-driven continuum robots. We demonstrate that hysteresis contributes to the stability of these robots by mitigating undesirable tensions in robot's backbone. As a result, a model-based approach to hysteresis can be used not just for compensation of a nuisance, but to enhance the utility of continuum robots in safety critical applications such as medical robots."

    "abstract": "We present a low-cost method to automate tension calibration for tendon-driven continuum robots (TDCRs), particularly those lacking tension sensing. Our method utilizes Hall effect sensors to localize the robot’s tip with respect to the one-dimensional trajectory it follows under individual tendon actuation. We propose two workflows for robots with and without a static model, making the method generalizable to other tendon-driven soft robots. We demonstrate our method’s ability to repeatably tension the tendons through associated tendon displacements. The calibration approach’s measured repeatability (±0.03 mm) is also benchmarked against manual calibration on a TDCR prototype, and its accuracy in achieving target tensions is assessed ((0.06±0.20) N). We further investigate how tension calibration impacts open-loop tracking accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of our method to enhance motion consistency in open-loop control and teleoperation."

    "abstract": "A neural network-based framework is developed and experimentally demonstrated for the problem of estimating the shape of a soft continuum arm (SCA) from noisy measurements of the pose at a finite number of locations along the length of the arm. The neural network takes as input these measurements and produces as output a finite-dimensional approximation of the strain, which is further used to reconstruct the infinite-dimensional smooth posture. This problem is important for various soft robotic applications. It is challenging due to the flexible aspects that lead to the infinite-dimensional reconstruction problem for the continuous posture and strains. Because of this, past solutions to this problem are computationally intensive. The proposed fast smooth reconstruction method is shown to be five orders of magnitude faster while having comparable accuracy. The framework is evaluated on two testbeds: a simulated octopus muscular arm and a physical BR2 pneumatic soft manipulator."

In this paper, we introduce GraspSAM, an innovative extension of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) designed for prompt-driven and category-agnostic grasp detection. Unlike previous methods, which are often limited by small-scale training data, GraspSAM leverages SAM’s large-scale training and prompt-based segmentation capabilities to efficiently support both target-object and category-agnostic grasping. By utilizing adapters, learnable token embeddings, and a lightweight modified decoder, GraspSAM requires minimal fine-tuning to integrate object segmentation and grasp prediction into a unified framework. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including Jacquard, Grasp-Anything, and Grasp-Anything++. Extensive experiments demonstrate GraspSAM’s flexibility in handling different types of prompts (such as points, boxes, and language), highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in real-world robotic applications.

Existing methods either rely on costly manual TOG annotations or only extract coarse grasping positions or regions from human demonstrations, limiting their practicality in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce RTAGrasp, a Retrieval, Transfer, and Alignment framework inspired by human grasping strategies. Specifically, our approach first effortlessly constructs a robot memory from human grasping demonstration videos, extracting both TOG position and direction constraints. Then, given a task instruction and a visual observation of the target object, RTAGrasp retrieves the most similar human grasping experience from its memory and leverages semantic matching capabilities of vision foundation models to transfer the TOG constraints to the target object in a training-free manner. Finally, RTAGrasp aligns the transferred TOG constraints with the robot's action for execution. Evaluations on the public TOG benchmark, TaskGrasp dataset, show the competitive performance of RTAGrasp on both seen and unseen object categories compared to existing baseline methods. Real-world experiments further validate its effectiveness on a robotic arm. Our code, appendix, and video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/rtagrasp/home."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method."

State-of-the-art task-based robot grasp synthesis methods fits over-approximated 3D bounding boxes that fails to isolate graspable regions even if they exist. While deep learning or geometrical shape decomposition methods can offer improved approximations, they lack guarantees for the graspability of segmented regions, require prior knowledge of the object, and/or demand large annotated datasets for fine-tuning. In this paper, we overcome these limitations to introduce ITSI. ITSI is a complete, task-oriented grasp synthesis approach that functions independently of object-specific knowledge. ITSI (Iterative Slicing) effectively segments multiple graspable regions that conform to the constraints of robot grippers thereby enabling compatibility with any object a robot seeks to grasp and any robot gripper size. Our extensive real-world and simulation experiments on diverse object datasets demonstrates how ITSI dramatically increases the number of discoverable robot grasps by up to 44% when compared to the state-of-the-art. We also expand ITSI's capabilities beyond task-based robot grasp synthesis to highlight its performance in human affordance segmentation outperforming fully supervised deep learning methods by 1%."

We achieve this difficult task by shifting visual detection from global to local states and operating grasp planning from static to dynamic states.

To address the challenges of GPS signal interruptions or low illumination, Thermal Geo-localization (TG) employs aerial thermal imagery to align with reference satellite maps to accurately determine the UAV's location. However, existing TG methods lack uncertainty measurement in their outputs, compromising system robustness in the presence of textureless or corrupted thermal images, self-similar or outdated satellite maps, geometric noises, or thermal images exceeding satellite maps. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents UASTHN, a novel approach for Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in Deep Homography Estimation (DHE) tasks for TG applications. Specifically, we introduce a novel Crop-based Test-Time Augmentation (CropTTA) strategy, which leverages the homography consensus of cropped image views to effectively measure data uncertainty. This approach is complemented by Deep Ensembles (DE) employed for model uncertainty, offering comparable performance with improved efficiency and seamless integration with any DHE model. Extensive experiments across multiple DHE models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CropTTA in TG applications. Analysis of detected failure cases underscores the improved reliability of CropTTA under challenging conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of combining CropTTA and DE for a comprehensive assessment of both data and model uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Vision sensors are extensively used for localizing a robot's pose, particularly in environments where global localization tools such as GPS or motion capture systems are unavailable. In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller."

    "abstract": "LiDAR-based loop closure detection is a crucial part of realizing robust SLAM algorithms for intelligent vehicles with LiDAR sensors. Existing methods often reduce the keypoint dimension to encode the global descriptor, which sacrifices the freedom of loop detection and correction. Based on the 6-DOF rigid transformation property of spatial triangles, we propose an algorithm for extracting and describing 3D keypoints from high-resolution spinning LiDAR intensity images to encode triangle descriptors, termed intensity triangle descriptor (ITD). In comparison to the direct extraction of keypoints from the point cloud, the use of image-derived feature points provides additional photometric texture information and better handles uneven spatial density of the point cloud, which is advantageous in unstructured and geometrically degraded scenes. To enhance the stability of keypoints, the spatial positions of multi-frame image feature points are registered to a keyframe by an odometer for voxel downsampling and non-maximum suppression, with the objective of reducing unstable feature points. For high discrimination, the neighbor image patches of each vertex (keypoint) are aggregated to estimate a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as the keypoint signature. An efficient two-stage loop closure detection method is then proposed for ITD, consisting of candidate retrieval based on triangle side lengths and vertex GMMs, followed by geometric verification of matched descriptor pairs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the STheReO, FusionPortable, and our self-collected datasets."

The inherent invariance of a triangle to rigid transformations inspires us to design triangle-based descriptors. We first extract distinct 3D key points from both LiDAR and camera measurements and organize them into triplets to form triangles. By utilizing the lengths of the sides of these triangles, we can create triangle descriptors, enabling the rapid retrieval of similar triangles from a database. By encoding the geometric and visual details at the triangle vertices into binary descriptors, we augment the triangle descriptors with richer local information. This enrichment process empowers our descriptors to reject mismatched triangle pairs. Consequently, the remaining matched triangle pairs yield accurate loop closure place indices and relative poses. In our experiments, we conduct a thorough comparison of our proposed method with several SOTA methods across public and self-collected datasets. The results demonstrate that our method exhibits superior performance in place recognition and overcomes the limitations associated with unimodal methods like BTC, RING++, ORB-DBoW2, and NetVLAD. Additionally, we performed a time cost benchmark experiment and the result indicates that our method’s time consumption is reasonable, compared with baseline methods.

    "abstract": "We would like a robot to navigate to a goal location while minimizing state uncertainty. To aid the robot in this endeavor, maps provide a prior belief over the location of objects and regions of interest. To localize itself within the map, a robot identifies mapped landmarks using its sensors. However, as the time between map creation and robot deployment increases, portions of the map can become stale, and landmarks, once believed to be permanent, may disappear. We refer to the propensity of a landmark to disappear as landmark evanescence. Reasoning about landmark evanescence during path planning, and the associated impact on localization accuracy, requires analyzing the presence or absence of each landmark, leading to an exponential number of possible outcomes of a given motion plan. To address this complexity, we develop BRULE, an extension of the Belief Roadmap. During planning, we replace the belief over future robot poses with a Gaussian mixture which is able to capture the effects of landmark evanescence. Furthermore, we show that belief updates can be made efficient, and that maintaining a random subset of mixture components is sufficient to find high quality solutions. We demonstrate performance in simulated and real-world experiments. Software is available at https://bit.ly/BRULE."

Our approach relegates the computationally intensive estimation of collision probabilities via sampling at the training step, allowing for fast neural network inference of the constraints during planning. In extensive experiments, we show that Deep Collision Probability Fields can produce reasonably accurate collision probabilities (up to 10^{-3}) for planning and that our approach can be easily plugged into standard path planning approaches to plan safe paths on 2-D maps containing uncertain static and dynamic obstacles.

Traditionally, and especially for asymptotically optimal sampling-based motion planners, the most expensive operations are local motion validation and querying the nearest neighbours of a configuration. Recent advances have significantly reduced the cost of motion validation by using single instruction/multiple data (SIMD) parallelism to improve solution times for satisficing motion planning problems. These advances have not yet been applied to asymptotically optimal motion planning. This paper presents Fully Connected Informed Trees (FCIT*), the first fully connected, informed, anytime almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) algorithm. FCIT* exploits the radically reduced cost of edge evaluation via SIMD parallelism to build and search fully connected graphs. This removes the need for nearest-neighbours structures, which are a dominant cost for many sampling-based motion planners, and allows it to find initial solutions faster than state-of-the-art ASAO (VAMP, OMPL) and satisficing (OMPL) algorithms on the MotionBenchMaker dataset while converging towards optimal plans in an anytime manner."

Traditional methods such as PRM* and RRT* have asymptotic guarantees, but often struggle in practice with complex black-box objective/constraint functions, especially in compute-limited situations. Continuous Belief Tree Search (CBTS) addresses these limitations by maintaining local estimates of the objective function in order to sample new nodes from continuous space, often giving high-quality solutions more quickly. However, CBTS requires careful tuning of a control duration parameter, which introduces a tradeoff between compute time and path cost/feasibility. In environments with complex costs and constraints, there may be no single control duration that gives good paths in short compute time. This paper proposes Trust Region CBTS (TR-CBTS), an extension of CBTS with an adaptive control duration parameter inspired by trust region methods. TR-CBTS adjusts control duration based on information from recently sampled candidate nodes, allowing longer control duration where possible to speed up compute time, and shortening control duration when precise navigation in environments with complex, unknown constraint and objective functions. We show TR-CBTS outperforms existing comparable planners for a realistic robotic path planning application in autonomous ship routing."

An inaccurate estimate can be detrimental in critical situations, e.g., locating a person in distress. However the true information gained can only be calculated post hoc, i.e., after the observation is realized. We present an approach to estimate the discrepancy between the estimated information gain (which is the expectation over putative future observations while neglecting correlations among them) and the true information gain. The key idea is to analyze the mathematical relationship between active perception and the estimation error of the information gain in a game-theoretic setting. Using this, we develop an online estimation approach that achieves sub-linear regret (in the number of time-steps) for the estimation of the true information gain and reduces the sub-optimality of active perception systems. We demonstrate our approach for active perception using a comprehensive set of experiments on: (a) different types of environments, including a quadrotor in a photorealistic simulation, real-world robotic data, and real-world experiments with ground robots exploring indoor and outdoor scenes; (b) different types of robotic perception data; and (c) different map representations. On average, our approach reduces information gain estimation errors by 42%, increases the information gain by 7%, PSNR by 5%, and semantic accuracy (measured as the number of objects that are localized correctly) by 6%. In real-world experiments with a Jackal ground robot, our approach demonstrated complex trajectories to explore occluded regions."

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) equipped with high-quality cameras are revolutionizing the field of autonomous photography by delivering efficient and cost-effective methods for capturing dynamic visual content. As AMRs are deployed in increasingly diverse environments, the challenge of consistently producing high-quality photographic content remains. Traditional approaches often involve AMRs following a predetermined path while capturing data-intensive imagery, which can be suboptimal, especially in environments with limited connectivity or physical obstructions. These drawbacks necessitate intelligent decision-making to pinpoint optimal vantage points for image capture. Inspired by Next Best View studies, we propose a novel autonomous photography framework that enhances image quality and minimizes the number of photos needed. This framework incorporates a proposed evaluation metric that leverages ray-tracing and Gaussian process interpolation, enabling the assessment of potential visual information from the target in partially known environments. A derivative-free optimization (DFO) method is then proposed to sample candidate views and identify the optimal viewpoint. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by comparing it with existing methods and further validated through simulations and experiments with various vehicles."

This paper proposes a self-supervised semantic visual odometry method, which can complete the tasks of ego-motion estimation, depth prediction, and instance segmentation with a shared encoder. The potential dynamic regions are removed and the image reconstruction loss is rectified by instance detection results. Moreover, the instance-guided triplet loss and cross-task self-attention modules are devised to learn the geometrical relationships among pixels that are implied in instance object priors. The proposed method is validated on KITTI and ComplexUrban datasets. The experimental results show that our method has superiority to baseline models in both pose estimation and depth prediction.

We use a newly designed 3-DOF robotic gripper with variable-friction finger surfaces to perform model-free in-hand-anipulation on a set of test objects comprised of two dimensional convex prisms. We have devised a manipulation sequence based on the rotation and sliding of test objects to allow side-counting with the successful measurement of shapes and sizes with average angle and size errors of 1.64% and 6.76% respectively. In addition, we have outlined potential research directions aimed at resolving inherent limitations of proprioceptive approaches and making our algorithm generalisable to any arbitrary shape."

Recent advances in data-driven methods have shown promise, but are sensitive to the quality of training data. Combining learning with classical methods like trajectory optimization and search adds additional structure to the problem and domain knowledge in the form of constraints, which can lead to outperforming the data on which models are trained. We present Diffusion-Informed Probabilistic Contact Search (DIPS), which uses an A* search to plan a sequence of contact modes informed by a diffusion model. We train the diffusion model on a dataset of demonstrations consisting of contact modes and trajectories generated by a trajectory optimizer given those modes. In addition, we use a particle filter-inspired method to reason about variability in diffusion sampling arising from model error, estimating likelihoods of trajectories using a learned discriminator. We show that our method outperforms ablations that do not reason about variability and can plan contact sequences that outperform those found in training data across multiple tasks. We evaluate on simulated tabletop card sliding and screwdriver turning tasks, as well as the screwdriver task in hardware to show that our combined learning and planning approach transfers to the real world."

    "abstract": "Dexterous in-hand manipulation (IHM) for arbitrary objects is challenging due to the rich and subtle contact process. Variable-friction manipulation is an alternative approach to dexterity, previously demonstrating robust and versatile 2D IHM capabilities with only two single-joint fingers. However, the hard-coded manipulation methods for variable friction hands are restricted to regular polygon objects and limited target poses, as well as requiring the policy to be tailored for each object. This paper proposes an end-to-end learning-based manipulation method to achieve arbitrary object manipulation for any target pose on real hardware, with minimal engineering efforts and data collection. The method features a diffusion policy-based imitation learning method with co-training from simulation and a small amount of real-world data. With the proposed framework, arbitrary objects including polygons and non-polygons can be precisely manipulated to reach arbitrary goal poses within 2 hours of training on an A100 GPU and only 1 hour of real-world data collection. The precision is higher than previous customized object-specific policies, achieving an average success rate of 71.3% with average pose error being 2.676 mm and 1.902°.

However, bridging the sim-to-real gap for each new task requires substantial human effort, such as careful reward engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and system identification. In this work, we present a system that leverages low-level skills to address these challenges for more complex tasks. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical policy for in-hand object reorientation based on previously acquired rotation skills. This hierarchical policy learns to select which low-level skill to execute based on feedback from both the environment and the low-level skill policies themselves. Compared to learning from scratch, the hierarchical policy is more robust to out-of-distribution changes and transfers easily from simulation to real-world environments. Additionally, we propose a generalizable object pose estimator that uses proprioceptive information, low-level skill predictions, and control errors as inputs to estimate the object's pose over time. We demonstrate that our system can reorient objects, including symmetrical and textureless ones, to a desired pose."

We propose ProbHMI, which introduces invertible networks to parameterize poses in a disentangled latent space, enabling probabilistic dynamics modeling. A forecasting module then explicitly predicts future latent distributions, allowing effective uncertainty quantification. Evaluated on benchmarks, ProbHMI achieves strong performance for both deterministic and diverse prediction while validating uncertainty calibration, critical for risk-aware decision making."

However, a robot's ability to influence can also compromise the physical safety of nearby people if naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE (Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional (39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate during task execution."

Traditional compliance control strategies, such as admittance and impedance control, often lead to unpredictable robot behavior due to incidents like contact loss or unexpected external forces, which can cause significant harm to humans. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a multi-task energy-aware impedance controller for kinematically redundant robots. This controller extends the energy-aware impedance control strategy, which ensures the passivity and safety of a single task using a virtual global energy tank, to kinematically redundant robots performing multiple tasks. The proposed controller effectively regulates the power flow of all tasks performed by the robot through a single global energy tank, ensuring the safety and passivity of the tasks. Experimental results in a shared environment, where external forces are simultaneously applied to the end-effector and the third joint of the Franka Emika Panda, showed that the robot's energy and power, as well as the power of all tasks, consistently remained within predefined thresholds. Additionally, when comparing the proposed controllers with controller that do not consider null space projection in the power regulation stage and controller that do not regulate the robot's power, our approach effectively managed the robot's energy and power and the power of all tasks, ensuring passivity and enhanced safety."

The approach leverages an interleaving of planning and execution to iteratively identify these regions, which can be safely simplified if they satisfy an exact template/anchor relationship. We show that this method does not compromise the stability and feasibility properties of the system, and measure performance in simulation experiments on a quadrupedal robot executing agile behaviors over terrains of interest.

    "abstract": "The paper presents a method to stabilize dynamic gait for a legged robot with embodied compliance. Our approach introduces a unified description for rigid and compliant bodies to approximate their deformation and a formulation for deformable multibody systems. We develop the centroidal composite predictive deformed inertia (CCPDI) tensor of a deformable multibody system and show how to integrate it with the standard-of-practice model predictive controller (MPC). Simulation shows that the resultant control framework can stabilize trot stepping on a quadrupedal robot with both rigid and compliant spines under the same MPC configurations. Compared to standard MPC, the developed CCPDI-enabled MPC distributes the ground reactive forces closer to the heuristics for body balance, and it is thus more likely to stabilize the gaits of the compliant robot. A parametric study shows that our method preserves some robustness within a suitable envelope of key parameter values."

    "abstract": "Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.

    "abstract": "Designing soft robots is a complex and iterative process that demands cross-disciplinary expertise in materials science, mechanics, and control, often relying on intuition and extensive experimentation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, their capacity to learn and apply embodied design principles—crucial for creating functional robotic systems—remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces RoboCrafter-QA, a novel benchmark to evaluate whether LLMs can learn representations of soft robot designs that effectively bridge the gap between high-level task descriptions and low-level morphological and material choices. RoboCrafter-QA leverages the EvoGym simulator to generate a diverse set of soft robot design challenges, spanning robotic locomotion, manipulation, and balancing tasks. Our experiments with state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs reveal that while these models exhibit promising capabilities in learning design representations, they struggle with fine-grained distinctions between designs with subtle performance differences. We further demonstrate the practical utility of LLMs for robot design initialization. Our code and benchmark will be available to encourage the community to foster this exciting research direction."

To evaluate the framework, we design a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed using the ModalAI Seeker platform, enabling closed-loop validation in realistic scenarios.

    "abstract": "Falling is the leading cause of injury related death in older adults. Exoskeletons have the potential to augment balance to reduce fall rate, however, classical control strategies are not well suited for transient movements. Recently, a deep learning-based task-agnostic controller based on the user’s physiological state was shown to decrease metabolic cost across cyclic and non-cyclic tasks, showing this controller’s ability to generalize. However, the effectiveness of this approach for perturbation recovery has not been investigated. We anticipate that the timing of joint moment-driven exoskeleton assistance will differ for approaches that aim to augment balance. Metabolic cost-reducing approaches apply joint moment assistance that is delayed relative to the user’s joint moment, while faster-than-human assistance has proven beneficial for balance augmentation. The aim of this study is to optimize a deep learning model that predicts future joint moments, enabling faster-than-human control. We trained a series of temporal convolutional networks that used wearable IMUs (pelvis, torso, and bilateral dorsal foot, shank, thighs) to predict joint moments. We trained models that forecasted joint moments 0ms (estimation at current time), 40ms, 80ms, and 120ms into the future. We found that model R2 were above 0.8 for most forecasts, a threshold previously shown to allow for highly controllable exoskeletons. This controller shows potential to assist perturbed locomotion"

    "abstract": "Accurate localization plays a key role in swarm robotics, especially for algorithms towards modular and self-assembling robotic (MSR) systems, where knowing the shape of the self-assembled structure is often important. However, most methods for achieving localization in MSR systems rely on known offsets of robots within a lattice, and thus are not useful for free-form MSR systems. Work towards localizing in free-form systems has thus far required complex sensor arrays and extensive global coordination. In this work, we introduce a 3D localization approach for FireAntV3 robots that relies solely on local communication between robots. The robots rely on contact-based sensing using vibration to identify neighboring robots and communicate information. In the simulation-based investigation we present here, the first robot serves as an origin reference that robots localize off of as they move about the structure while executing the ReactiveBuild algorithm. The ability to localize contacts between the three spheres of the FireAntV3 robots and the discrete nature of robot locomotion provides ample information for robots to use in a gradient descent localization algorithm. With the presented method we find that the average absolute localization error across a 100 robot structure with no larger than two dock radius, demonstrating the utility of the presented approach."

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Then, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables efficient computation of this collision bound. Finally, this paper presents a method to optimize trajectories that avoid collisions in a Gaussian Splat. Experiments show that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments.

In particular, Transformer-based models such as the Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) show potential to robustly clone expert demonstrations that require fine-grained manipulation while bypassing the need for bridging the simulation-to-reality gap experienced in training RL policies. This study systematically investigates the limitations and challenges associated with using ACT-based IL for learning surgically relevant tasks on a simulated and real da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). Through a series of controlled experiments using simulated and real dVRK setups, this work evaluates the sensitivity of ACT models to environmental and architectural factors such as lighting, demonstration quality, and chunk size hyperparameter choices. Baseline accuracies of manipulation tasks are presented, along with experiments assessing model robustness under distractors and visual inconsistencies. The findings highlight the critical importance of dataset quality and lighting consistency in achieving successful behaviour cloning. While IL proves viable for certain structured tasks under controlled conditions, the study outlines clear limitations and identifies future directions to improve generalization and robustness of learned policies for real-world surgical deployment."

We explore a simple yet effective modification: replacing the standard noise with a non-standard Gaussian distribution—specifically, a Gaussian mixture—whose mode-specific mean and covariance encode desirable properties of the trajectory, such as smoothness and state conditioning. We begin by deriving a forward diffusion formulation using general, non-standard Gaussian noise. We then derive corresponding reverse denoising formulations, both for neural-network-based and model-based diffusion models. Finally, we propose a specific design for the mean and covariance structure—realized through the Gaussian mixture components—to encode trajectory priors.

Our proposed task-dependent grasp metric evaluates a grasp's ability to generate force/moment to impart the desired constant screw motion. A key distinguishing feature of our grasp metric is its ability to incorporate the manipulator and object dynamics. It also considers nonlinear friction cone constraints at the object-robot and the object-environment contact. Since our proposed quality measure is an SOCP, it can be solved optimally using interior point methods.

This work presents an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners is performed. It is shown STITCHER can generate trajectories through complex environments over long distances (tens of meters) with low computation times (milliseconds)."

In this work, we present the first learning-based traversability estimation and safe navigation framework tailored to bipedal robots operating in diverse, uneven environments. We train our transformer-based neural network to predict bipedal locomotion instability in a risk-sensitive manner, enabling safer locomotion. Based on the predicted instability, we define traversability as stability-aware command velocity—the fastest velocity that can keep instability below a user-defined limit. This velocity-based traversability is intergrated into a hierarchical planner, combining RRT* for finding time-efficient global path planning and MPC for the safe execution. We validate our method in MuJoCo simulation, demonstrating improved safety and navigation performance, with enhanced robustness across varying terrains compared to traditional baselines."

This work aims to mitigate congestion through trajectory analysis and adaptive spiral path strategies. The focus was to enhance resource collection efficiency while reducing inter-robot collisions. A data-driven method was developed using 112 simulated robot trajectories, which were analyzed to extract key movement features. These features fed into a logistic regression model that detects congestion with approximately 93% accuracy, enabling real-time behavior adjustments. Initial results demonstrate substantial improvements through the use of adaptive spiral paths, like square and circular spirals, where robots enter these paths when congestion is detected. Resource delivery rates increased by over 120%, and collision time decreased by 21%, validating the method’s effectiveness.

As a baseline, we compare against trained Action Chunking Transformers (ACT). Both methods were trained on 175 ultrasound sweeps representing approximately an hour of data acquired on a tissue mimicking phantom. The methods were then evaluated based on their ability to achieve targeted views during initial contact as well as during the middle and end of the scan. The π0 policy had a higher success rate in acquiring each of these three views. The most challenging target was the initial contact where π0 was successful 47% of the time, compared to only 7% with ACT. The success rate for π0 and ACT was 67% vs 33% and 60% vs 33% for the middle and end scan views respectively. These preliminary results show the potential value of foundational VLA models in autonomous ultrasound acquisitions, an area characterized by many highly complex tasks and where obtaining large numbers of expert demonstrations is difficult.

Demonstrations are captured in real time using a portable teaching interface equipped with GoPro camera, HTC Vive tracking and encoder-based gripper sensing, supporting physical, simulated, and real-robot teleoperation modes. Motion generation follows a two-step approach: (1) learning an initial trajectory using GMM/GMR or a diffusion policy, and (2) refining it via constrained nonlinear optimization that ensures goal accuracy and adherence to robot limits. Compared to GMM/GMR, diffusion better captures multi-modal behavior and generalizes to unseen conditions. The refinement stage significantly improves precision and constraint satisfaction. Experiments show GMM/GMR method learned unimodal behavior only, and failed on distant test cases (from demonstration). The optimization-based refinement improved success rate but didn’t guarantee success for all test cases. The diffusion model, however, learned multimodal behavior, and the refinement ensured success in all test cases, highlighting the system’s effectiveness for generalizable, high-precision robotic tasks."

This study uses a high-dimensional musculoskeletal model with a comprehensive set of skeletal muscles to simulate the transition from standing to falling. We investigate the intrinsic temporal dynamics, motor responses, and the distribution of related metrics across the human body during loss of balance. Through large-scale simulations, we identify a central stability region in front of the feet where center-of-mass trajectories converge, and demonstrate that backward and lateral leaning are associated with increased fall risk. Under fall-prone conditions, such as muscle weakness and neural control latency, we observe shorter fall durations and more consistent fall patterns. Contact analysis reveals frequent collisions at the pelvis, thigh, and head, consistent with clinical observations of hip and head injuries. These findings contribute to a more quantitative understanding of human balancing and falling, and provide insights for the design of bio-inspired control strategies and fall prevention systems."

To achieve this engineers and robotocists have focused their efforts on the design of soft or articulated multi-body tails that can oscillate or undulate at frequencies and amplitudes similar to those of the fish they seek to mimic. Such kinematic approaches do not account for the complex interaction of the efficiency of actuation, dynamic response of flexible appendages, and hydrodynamic forces. This work presents a fundamentally novel means of mechanical actuation: a fast spinning unbalanced rotor internal to the body of the robot, that transfers a periodic axial force to an otherwise passive flexible tail.\tThe net result is that the tail acts as a parametric oscillator that undergoes a 2:1 subharmonic resonance. High tail-beat frequencies are achieved with minimal input power due to this parametric resonance. The resulting robot has the lowest cost of transport amongst free swimming robots while also being fast, extremely agile and gyroscopically roll and pitch stable. The results demonstrate the importance of exploiting parametric resonances in designing efficient fish-like robots."

Building on this foundation, we explore richer probabilistic representations within the same Koopman-based framework. In particular, we introduce a Gaussian Mixture Model variant (GMMKKF), where the extended state is modeled as a mixture of Gaussians. Each component evolves under globally linear models, enabling efficient inference in systems with significant nonlinearity.

Specifically, the algorithm is responsible for placing each joint in a specific pose on its axis of motion and finding link shapes connecting them. The core idea generalizes the structure of gimbals to deal with axes of motion that do not all intersect at a point: the algorithm maintains a bounding sphere about everything generated so far such that the sphere centers on the previous axis of motion, then routes outside this sphere to place and connect to the next joint. The algorithm is enabled by abstracting mechanism thickness as a bounding radius and thus link shapes as tubes defined by their centerline paths. Since a tube cannot bend faster than its own radius, turning the link design problem into a Dubins planning problem. Proof of the algorithm provides justification for using this tubular abstraction in computational design of linkages, showing that restricting the design space in this way makes it tractable to explore but still fully kinematically expressive. The algorithm is also useful as an initialization to be further optimized for compactness or other properties. We have a preliminary approach to sequentially re-arrange joints (preserving their axes of motion) and link waypoints to minimize chain length while maintaining self-collision avoidance in the neutral configuration."

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an indispensable technology in ophthalmology for diagnosing and managing eye disease and requires patients who can sit upright and participate in imaging. To overcome these barriers, we introduce a mobile and motion-tolerant robotic OCT system that is capable of versatile use in both outpatient and inpatient clinical environments and is suitable for imaging in diverse clinical configurations. Our system includes a robot arm and a vertical lift, and is equipped with real-time nested MPPI motion planning algorithms for face and pupil movement tracking and obstacle collision avoidance during the imaging process. To enhance motion tolerance, we implement the model-free autoregressive filter-based active cancellation for eye movement. Motion cancellation aiming offsets are derived from filter predictions instead of relying on the last observed eye position. We validate the system’s workspace, dynamic tracking, and obstacle avoidance capabilities and then evaluate the effectiveness of predictive cancellation using a retinal eye phantom on a motorized stage to simulate jerk nystagmus. Predictive scan aiming stabilized repeated B-scans and retained contrast within retinal structures, which correspond to higher mean brightness, while residual motion is observed during traditional scan aiming. The combination of these results enables us to move toward clinical deployment in the near future."

However, while these approaches deliver high visual fidelity, they often fall short in preserving the geometric accuracy required for robust Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), particularly in tasks such as manipulation and autonomous driving. In this work, we introduce RKHS GS SLAM, a novel RGBD SLAM system that leverages a 3D-GS-based non-correspondence registration algorithm, augmented with a robust loop closure module and global pose optimization framework. Unlike conventional point cloud registration methods, our approach integrates covariance and feature information inherent to the 3D-GS representation, thereby preserving both visual and geometric properties even when employing a sparser mapping strategy. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets reveal that our sparse 3D-GS mapping retains most of the performance of dense mappings while reducing the number of Gaussians by 80%. Furthermore, our registration algorithm demonstrates improved tracking accuracy when compared to traditional point cloud registration and rendering-based pose optimization techniques. These results highlight the potential of 3D-GS for efficient and precise SLAM in complex robotic applications."

However, accurately modeling and controlling these robots remains a major challenge due to nonlinear fluid-structure interactions, high degrees of freedom, and the unsteady nature of underwater dynamics. To address these complexities, reduced-order models that capture the essential system dynamics offer a promising balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time control. While kinematic models have been widely used in fish-like robots, dynamic models remain relatively scarce, particularly in the context of control. In this work, we develop a reduced-order dynamic model based on a modified Chaplygin Sleigh tailored to an underactuated, internally actuated fish-like robot driven by a reaction wheel. This model serves as the basis for a control framework in which we use data-driven methods and reinforcement learning to tune control gains in order to track a planar trajectory in an efficient and optimal manner. The approach is then validated through implementation and testing on the robotic platform."

    "abstract": "Robots operating in complex human environments must balance two often conflicting objectives: agility and safety. Traditional safety guarantees, while effective at preventing collisions and unsafe behaviors, tend to restrict agile movement and can result in deadlocks in crowded, multi-agent scenarios. This poster introduces Universal Control Barrier Functions (UCBFs), a new class of control-theoretic tools designed to simultaneously ensure safety and prevent deadlocks by introducing Liveness Sets—a novel extension of traditional safety sets. The work demonstrates how UCBFs generalize classical Control Barrier Functions to provide both safety (set invariance) and liveness (ensuring progress), allowing for safe yet fluid motion in real-world dynamic environments. Preliminary simulations and hardware results on quadrupeds and other robots show that UCBFs enable agile behavior without compromising on safety. The framework is further extended to accommodate challenges such as limited actuation, lidar-only perception, decentralized multi-agent coordination, and neural approximations of control. These results underscore the versatility of UCBFs as a foundational control primitive for next-generation robotic systems deployed in cluttered, human-centric spaces."

    "abstract": "Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume, but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer and more efficient autonomous systems."

While motion capabilities and accurate localization for automated robots have rapidly developed, the challenge remains to generate efficient, smooth, comprehensive, and high-quality trajectories in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient planner for ground robots to autonomously navigate in large complex multi-layered architectural spaces. Considering that traversable regions typically include ground, slopes, and stairs, which are planar or nearly planar structures, we simplify the problem to navigation within and between complex intersecting planes. We first extract traversable planes from 3D point clouds through segmenting, merging, classifying, and connecting to build a plane-graph, which is lightweight but fully represents the traversable regions. We then build a trajectory optimization based on motion state trajectory and fully consider special constraints when crossing multi-layer planes to maximize the robot's maneuverability. We conduct experiments in simulated environments and test on a CubeTrack robot in real-world scenarios, validating the method's effectiveness and practicality."

Our team was undefeated for all seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship game 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance was the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of view (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our planned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard constraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally efficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach to trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and short-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path that avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility Graphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to be active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the states in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a large soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is formed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A modified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this trajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term planning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the robot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the control input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot inside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately 120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz."

At the framework's high level, an indirect adaptive law estimates the unknown parameters of the reduced-order (template) locomotion model under varying payloads. These estimated parameters feed into an MPC algorithm for real-time trajectory planning, incorporating a convex stability criterion within the MPC constraints to ensure the stability of the template model's estimation error. The optimal reduced-order trajectories generated by the high-level adaptive MPC (AMPC) are then passed to a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (WBC) for tracking. Extensive numerical investigations validate the framework's capabilities, showcasing the robot's proficiency in transporting unmodeled, unknown static payloads up to 109% in experiments on flat terrains and 91% on rough experimental terrains. The robot also successfully manages dynamic payloads with 73% of its mass on rough terrains. Performance comparisons with a normal MPC and an L1-MPC indicate a significant improvement. Furthermore, comprehensive hardware experiments conducted in indoor and outdoor environments confirm the method’s efficacy on rough terrains despite uncertainties such as payload variations, push disturbances, and obstacles."

However, they perform poorly in tracking and reconstruction when facing more challenging dynamic environments, such as real-world scenes involving dynamic elements. Although some NeRF-based SLAM methods have attempted to address these dynamic challenges, they rely on RGB-D inputs, and there is a lack of methods that work with pure RGB input. To address these challenges, we introduce Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3DGS-SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. For tracking, our method first acquires dynamic object masks through an optical flow estimation system, then combines them with a monocular depth estimation system to obtain merged masks and recover scale. This allows us to remove dynamic objects from non-predefined scenes, enabling dense frame-to-frame mapping. For rendering, we prune the Gaussians generated by pixels with dynamic masks, while applying a scale regularizer to avoid Gaussian artifacts. We impose additional photometric, geometric, and uncertainty losses on the proxy depth to improve rendering accuracy. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) tracking and rendering results in dynamic environments, while also being competitive with or outperforming RGB-D methods."

To address this issue, we propose SGBA, a LiDAR BA scheme that models the environment as a semantic Gaussian mixture model (GMM) without predefined feature types. This approach encodes both geometric and semantic information, offering a comprehensive and general representation adaptable to various environments. Additionally, to limit computational complexity while ensuring generalizability, we propose an adaptive semantic selection framework that selects the most informative semantic clusters for optimization by evaluating the condition number of the cost function. Lastly, we introduce a probabilistic feature association scheme that considers the entire probability density of assignments, which can manage uncertainties in measurement and initial pose estimation.

To tackle the above problems,we propose GeoRecon,which achieves geometric coherent reconstruction through keyframe 2D representation self-regression and cross-level 3D voxel fea- ture alignment.Specifically,for 2D image space,to alleviate the lack of supervision in 2D feature extraction,an image recon- struction self-supervision regression constraint is introduced on the input 2D keyframes to ensure that the extracted features can learn accurate geometric features and further voxel features. For 3D voxel features space,to achieve consistent alignment between different levels,the high-level voxel features are used to constrain low-level voxel features,and achieve alignment from coarse (i.e.,low-level)voxel features to fine (i.e.,high-level)voxel features.With the design of these two components,the proposed method effectively reconstructs the geometric structures of the scene.The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

By leveraging shallow data-driven techniques to preprocess the incoming data to highlight the LM-MAP's reflective navigational aids and then using basic geometric models for state estimation, we present a lightweight and data-efficient pipeline that can be used independently with either RGB or event cameras. We demonstrate the soundness of the pipeline and perform a quantitative comparison of the two modalities based on data collected with a photometrically accurate test bench that includes a robotic arm to simulate the target satellite's uncontrolled motion. The data has been made publicly available: https://uts-ri.github.io/rgb_event_docking_port/"

    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "The 3D perception of satellites, including both their shape and pose, is a key foundation for robotic on-orbit servicing. However, the demanding space environment—such as intense and dim illumination—presents significant challenges. Previous non-cooperative methods focus on specific geometric features like solar panel brackets or docking rings, overlooking the satellite's overall shape and increasing the risk of collisions during grasping. Additionally, satellites are often weakly textured, limiting the accuracy of 3D perception. To address these issues, we propose, for the first time, a 3D perception-based visual servo system of non-cooperative satellites. This system combines reconstruction and tracking to enhance shape perception and pose estimation accuracy in orbital conditions. Specifically, we employ an alternating iterative strategy to simultaneously reconstruct and track the satellite and introduce a novel constraint to fuse different cues under extreme conditions. Further, we develop a simulation environment platform, a dual-arm microgravity grasping system, and an online monitoring module to enhance system capabilities for on-orbit servicing. Synthetic and real-world datasets from the simulation environment are also created for experimental validation. Results show that each module of our system achieves state-of-the-art performance."

    "abstract": "This paper exploits the robotic capabilities of an orbital manipulator equipped with an actuation module at its end-effector to perform close-proximity robotic operations. The proposed control strategy enables repositioning the system’s center-of-mass by reconfiguring the manipulator configuration and using the end-effector-mounted thrusting mechanism to achieve displacement. The key advantage of the proposed method is that the plume impingement due to thruster firing of the servicer satellite in close-proximity operations towards the client is mitigated. This is achieved by regulating the internal motion of the manipulator such that the thrust firing does not occur near the space asset. The effectiveness of the controller is verified through a multibody dynamic simulation of an orbital manipulator."

    "abstract": "The Robotic Space Simulator was developed as a physical simulation for in-space manipulation tasks. It incorporates external inputs to its dynamics simulation via force/torque sensors mounted to the 2 6-DoF Stewart platforms which compose its primary structure. Each platform is augmented with an additional degree of freedom in the form of an auxiliary axis - one in translation and one in rotation. Previous work has not effectively included the additional workspace provided by these auxiliary axes. Additionally, it limited the use of external force/torque inputs to the case of platform translation only because the external forces/torques due to platform motion and gravitational force were not removed from the sensor inputs prior to inclusion in the dynamic simulation. In this work, we address each of these limitations. We develop and test two methods of auxiliary axis control: Cartesian Workspace and Joint Cost-Function, and find that both methods are an improvement over the existing system. Additionally we develop and test a method for calculating the mass properties of hardware mounted to the force/torque sensors and a dynamics compensation method for this hardware. Using this technique we are able to effectively compensate for gravitational force in different platform orientations, and achieve zero-g behavior of the system."

After the orbit injection, the overall motion control requires the individual modules to approach each other while regulating their relative shape and total formation. This kind of formation control has already been addressed for rigid body modules. However, in practical cases, each module might be a multibody (with rotors) system. To address the control problem for such a fleet of fixed-inertia multibody modules, we propose a novel dynamics formulation that is inertia-decoupled, singularity-free, and invariant of their absolute poses. We extend the passive decomposition theory for deriving new representative systems corresponding to the total momentum (locked) and relative shape variations. We exploit the dynamics to design two distinct control laws with complementary mission benefits to regulate the locked and relative motions. We also leverage the proposed formulation to design a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) framework, in which the facility reproduced the relative motions while total momentum was propagated in software. Furthermore, the proposed HIL framework and the motion control are experimentally validated."

However, the mechanism for enhancing the propulsion speed of these microorganisms remains not fully understood. This study introduces a quadriflagellated, algae-inspired, cable-driven robot that mirrors these biological locomotion mechanisms. A single DC motor actuates four multi-segmented flagella, modulating their stiffness throughout the propulsion cycle. We focus on enhancing propulsion speed, hypothesizing that strategic flexibility alterations in flagella—increased during the backward stroke and decreased during the forward stroke—significantly improve propulsion speed. Our experimental results confirm this, showing a marked improvement in propulsion speed, achieving a rate of 0.7+-0.11 cm/cycle. Additionally, we explore the impact of flagella length and number on propulsion, providing valuable insights for biomedical and microfluidic research applications."

In this paper, we developed a multi-joint biohybrid robot by using skeletal muscle tissue. To achieve this, we first developed a modular bio-actuator actuated by skeletal muscle tissues. The objective of this study was to enhance the contraction force of the actuator and establish optimal experimental conditions for creating high-performance robots. By applying continuous electrical stimulation for five days during culture of bio-actuator, we were able to increase the contraction force by more than threefold. Additionally, we determined the appropriate electric field based on the electrode distance, which enabled us to establish an optimal experimental setup. We also confirmed that connecting the actuators in series can significantly increase the moving distance. Connecting two actuators in series resulted in a total movement distance equivalent to the sum of the distances of each actuator. This finding suggests the potential to create robots with a larger operational workspace. Using these actuators, we first constructed a manipulator with a rotational joint. This research is expected to contribute not only to the development of various robots utilizing bio-actuators but also to advancements in biology technology."

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of the “traveling wave,” commonly observed in various organisms, involves a wave that propagates along the body, serving as a locomotion mechanism. Particularly, in aquatic environments, organisms such as fish and cetaceans utilize traveling waves to propel themselves through water, minimizing fluid drag and maximizing movement efficiency. Inspired by nature, robotics has extensively explored replicating such locomotion strategies. This work presents a fish robot with an innovative magnetic transmission system. The mechanism transforms the unidirectional rotation of a single motor into an oscillatory, phase-shifted movement across the modules of the kinematic chain, generating a traveling wave along the body. The robot’s design and functionality are detailed, highlighting advancements in bio-inspired robotics for underwater applications, such as efficient and non-invasive monitoring and exploration of marine ecosystems. The fish robot achieved a swimming speed of approximately 2 body lengths per second (BL/s) with a tail-beat frequency of 3.24 Hz and a minimum Cost of Transport (CoT) of 5.33 J/(kg·m). Biomimetic robotics can play a key role in sustainable aquafarming, biodiversity conservation, and animal-robot interaction research, offering the potential to minimize ecosystem disruption and advance marine science."

    "abstract": "While undulatory swimming of elongate limbless robots has been extensively studied in open hydrodynamic environments, less research has been focused on limbless locomotion in complex, cluttered aquatic environments. Motivated by the concept of mechanical intelligence, where controls for obstacle navigation can be offloaded to passive body mechanics in terrestrial limbless locomotion, we hypothesize that principles of mechanical intelligence can be extended to cluttered hydrodynamic regimes. To test this, we developed an untethered limbless robot capable of undulatory swimming on water surfaces, utilizing a bilateral cable-driven mechanism inspired by organismal muscle actuation morphology to achieve programmable anisotropic body compliance. We demonstrated through robophysical experiments that, similar to terrestrial locomotion, an appropriate level of body compliance can facilitate emergent swim through complex hydrodynamic environments under pure open-loop control. Moreover, we found that swimming performance depends on undulation frequency, with effective locomotion achieved only within a specific frequency range. This contrasts with highly damped terrestrial regimes, where inertial effects can often be neglected. Further, to enhance performance and address the challenges posed by nondeterministic obstacle distributions, we incorporated computational intelligence by developing a real-time body compliance tuning controller based on cable tension feedback. This controller improves the robot's robustness and overall speed in heterogeneous hydrodynamic environments."

Inspired by the natural lateral line system(LLS), a flowresponsive organ in fish that plays a crucial role in behaviors such as rheotaxis, this paper introduces the first Artificial Lateral Line System (ALLS)-based ambient flow classifier for robotic fish that allows robotic fish to perceive flow fields while swimming freely. To be specific, using just 5 pressure sensors and 3.5 minutes of swimming data, we trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, achieving a classification accuracy of 81.25% across 8 flow speed categories, ranging from 0.08 m/s to 0.18 m/s. A key innovation of this work is the formulation of ambient flow perception as a classification task, which not only enables the robotic fish to extract meaningful information but also enhances the robustness and generalizability of the perception framework. Extensive experiments further identify critical factors such as affecting the effectiveness of the ambient flow classifier, offering valuable insights for future development."

    "abstract": "Fish use their lateral lines to sense flows and pressure gradients, enabling them to detect nearby objects and organisms. Towards replicating this capability, we demonstrated successful leader-follower formation swimming using flow pressure sensing in our undulatory robotic fish (µBot/MUBot). The follower µBot is equipped at its head with bilateral pressure sensors to detect signals excited by both its own and the leader's movements. First, using experiments with static formations between an undulating leader and a stationary follower, we determined the formation that resulted in strong pressure variations measured by the follower. This formation was then selected as the desired formation in free swimming for obtaining an expert policy. Next, a long short-term memory neural network was used as the control policy that maps the pressure signals along with the robot motor commands and the Euler angles (measured by the onboard IMU) to the steering command. The policy was trained to imitate the expert policy using behavior cloning and Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). The results show that with merely two bilateral pressure sensors and less than one hour of training data, the follower effectively tracked the leader within distances of up to 200 mm (= 1 body length) while swimming at speeds of 155 mm/s (= 0.8 body lengths/s). This work highlights the potential of fish-inspired robots to effectively navigate fluid environments and achieve formation swimming through the use of flow pressure feedback."

Then, we express the kinematics of the fish as a propagating wave parameterized by three bending amplitudes and a wavelength, which are determined by the flow rates and phase shift of the pumps. We capture various motion patterns generated by different actuator inputs and directly measure the thrust generated by each pattern. We observe that the robotic swimmer can reproduce two different modes of propulsion, that are embodied by two distinct morphological patterns in nature: anguilliform and thunniform. When neither of modes are activated, propulsion is zero or even negative. Finally, we estimate the stationary swimming speed by towing the undulating fish, which satisfies the slip condition (with the speed of the body wave matching the swimming velocity). The analysis of a wide range of kinematic patterns in this study, including two extreme cases of anguilliform and thunniform modes, will provide insights for comprehensive understanding the mechanics of efficient swimming."

    "abstract": "Vision-based tactile sensors have recently gained prominence due to their superior resolution and ability to capture multi-dimensional contact information. However, even when sensors share the same sensing principle, variations in production factors can lead to differences in the color patterns of tactile signals. Unlike common vision tasks, vision-based tactile perception depends on tracking light variation in colorful signals, making it more susceptible to lighting conditions and thus more prone to domain gaps. In this paper, we propose an Omni-hardness perception framework that enables adaptation across various vision-based tactile sensors. Firstly, in-depth analyses of the factors influencing the generalization of hardness perception are presented. Furthermore, the light balance module and the force scale module are coupled to regulate network learning of generalized representations. Experimental results across multiple sensors demonstrate the transferability of learned representations. Additionally, downstream tasks in natural object perception, tumor detection, and grasping stability prediction, are proposed to evaluate the potential applications. The framework’s performance shows promise for advancing general tactile sensing and embodied tactile perception."

In this study, we propose a loss function with constraints of touch states and an attention mechanism for focusing on important modalities depending on the touch states. The policy model is AE-LSTM which consists of Autoencoder (AE) which compresses abundant tactile information and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which switches the motion depending on the touch states. Motion for cap-opening was chosen as a target task which consists of subtasks of sliding an object and opening its cap. As a result, the proposed method achieved the best success rates with a variety of objects for real time cap-opening manipulation.

We evaluated the effectiveness of our dataset by integrating it with several state-of-the-art methods for depth estimation and interaction pose prediction. Additionally, we proposed a novel modular framework that delivers superior and robust performance for generalizable articulated object manipulation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves the performance of depth perception and actionable interaction pose prediction in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "In various robotic applications, understanding accurate object poses for robots is essential for high-precision tasks such as factory assembly or daily insertions. Tactile sensing, which compensates for visual information, offers rich texture-based or force-based data for object pose estimation. However, previous methods for pose estimation typically overlook dynamic situations, such as slippage of grasped objects or movement of contacted objects during interactions with the environment, thus increasing the complexity of pose estimation. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method that utilizes visual and tactile sensing to estimate object poses through particle filtering. We leverage visual information to track the pose of the contacted object in real-time and estimate the pose changes of the grasped object using displacement data obtained from tactile sensors. Our experimental evaluation on 13 objects with diverse geometric shapes demonstrated the ability to estimate high-precision poses, which revealed the robot's powerful ability to cope with dynamic scenes for compelled motion of objects, proving our framework's adaptability in practical scenarios with uncertainty."

In this paper, we consider a collaborative task with a considerably long object and no prior knowledge of the object's parameters. An integrated control framework with an online object parameter estimator and a Cartesian object-aware impedance controller is proposed to realize complicated scenarios. During the transportation task, the object parameters are estimated online while a robot and human keep lifting an object. The perturbation motion is incorporated into the null space of the desired trajectory to enhance the estimator precision. An object-aware impedance controller is designed by incorporating the real-time estimation results to effectively transmit the intended human motion to the robot through the object. Experimental demonstrations of collaborative tasks, including object transportation and assembly, are implemented to show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The proposed controller was also compared to a conventional impedance controller through subjective testing and found to be more sensitive, requiring less human effort."

This allows motion planners that do not provide such guarantees to be safely tested and optimized in real-world environments. We demonstrate the versatility of Lab2Car by using it to deploy a machine learning (ML) planner and a classical planner on self-driving cars in Las Vegas. The resulting systems handle challenging scenarios, such as cut-ins, overtaking, and yielding, in complex urban environments like casino pick-up/drop-off areas. Our work paves the way for quickly deploying and evaluating candidate motion planners in realistic settings, ensuring rapid iteration and accelerating progress towards human-level autonomy."

Recent advances in open-vocabulary vision models have resulted in semantically-informed object navigation methods that allow a robot to search for an arbitrary object without prior training. However, these zero-shot methods have so far treated the environment as unknown for each consecutive query. In this paper we introduce a new benchmark for zero-shot multi-object navigation, allowing the robot to leverage information gathered from previous searches to more efficiently find new objects. To address this problem we build a reusable open-vocabulary feature map tailored for real-time object search. We further propose a probabilistic-semantic map update that mitigates common sources of errors in semantic feature extraction and leverage this semantic uncertainty for informed multi-object exploration. We evaluate our method on a set of object navigation tasks in both simulation as well as with a real robot, running in real-time on a Jetson Orin AGX. We demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both on single and multi-object navigation tasks.

We investigated the resilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial interventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversary’s goal is to delay the robot’s timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its original path. We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation, the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36%, with the most significant delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially longer alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing measurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithm’s robustness is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the operational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels, the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative routes."

It fuses the advantages of sampling-based MPC, which can cope with nonconvex costmaps through random sampling of trajectories, with the advantages of gradient-based MPC, which can generate smooth trajectories. In addition, we leverage a generalized safety-embedded MPC problem definition with a discrete barrier state (DBaS). The proposed framework has three steps: 1) a costmap builder to generate the barrier function map, 2) a seed trajectory generator to choose randomly generated trajectories to send to the optimizers, and 3) a batch trajectory optimizer to optimize each of the seed trajectories and select the best trajectory. Experiments with real-time simulations compare the effectiveness of the proposed framework, sampling-based MPC, and gradient-based MPC, which optimizes a single trajectory. The experiments also compare the application of two different control sequence sampling schemes to the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework performs gradient-based optimization but can plan a better trajectory even in complex environments by providing various initial guesses. We also show that the proposed framework can perform more accurate control actions than sampling-based MPC."

    "abstract": "Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints relying on numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In our previous work we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the safe set constraint recede along the horizon. In this paper we push that idea further. We suggest to exploit parallel computation for solving several MPC problems at the same time. Each problem instantiate the safe set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved, even using as little as 4 computational cores."

In this work we introduce methods for learning neural CBFs through a fixed, sparsely-labeled dataset collected prior to training either the CBFs or the controllers. We propose novel annotation techniques based on out-of-distribution analysis to effectively propagate the information from the limited labeled data to the unlabeled data.

    "abstract": "Safe navigation in real-time is an essential task for humanoid robots in real-world deployment. Since humanoid robots are inherently underactuated thanks to unilateral ground contacts, a path is considered safe if it is obstacle-free and respects the robot's physical limitations and underlying dynamics. Existing approaches often decouple path planning from gait control due to the significant computational challenge caused by the full-order robot dynamics. In this work, we develop a unified, safe path and gait planning framework that can be evaluated online in real-time, allowing the robot to navigate clustered environments while sustaining stable locomotion. Our approach uses the popular Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model as a template model to represent walking dynamics. It incorporates heading angles in the model to evaluate kinematic constraints essential for physically feasible gaits properly. In addition, we leverage discrete control barrier functions (DCBF) for obstacle avoidance, ensuring that the subsequent foot placement provides a safe navigation path within clustered environments. To guarantee real-time computation, we use a novel approximation of the DCBF to produce linear DCBF constraints. We validate our proposed approach in simulation using a Digit robot in randomly generated environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate safe gaits for a non-trivial humanoid robot to navigate in a clustered environment in real-time."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel monitoring framework that infers the level of collision risk for autonomous vehicles (AVs) based on their object detection performance. The framework takes two sets of predictions from different algorithms and associates their inconsistencies with the collision risk via fuzzy inference. The first set of predictions is obtained by retrieving safety-critical 2.5D objects from a depth map, and the second set comes from the ordinary AV's 3D object detector. We experimentally validate that, based on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and a depth discrepancy measure, the inconsistencies between the two sets of predictions strongly correlate to the error of the 3D object detector against ground truths. This correlation allows us to construct a fuzzy inference system and map the inconsistency measures to an AV collision risk indicator. In particular, we optimize the fuzzy inference system towards an existing offline metric that matches AV collision rates well. Lastly, we validate our monitor's capability to produce relevant risk estimates with the large-scale nuScenes dataset and demonstrate that it can safeguard an AV in closed-loop simulations."

    "abstract": "Decentralized safe control plays an important role in multi-agent systems given the scalability and robustness without reliance on a central authority. However, without an explicit global coordinator, the decentralized control methods are often prone to deadlock --- a state where the system reaches equilibrium, causing the robots to stall. In this paper, we propose a generalized decentralized framework that unifies the Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) to facilitate efficient task execution and ensure deadlock-free trajectories for the multi-agent systems. As the agents approach the deadlock-related undesirable equilibrium, the framework can detect the equilibrium and drive agents away before that happens. This is achieved by a secondary deadlock resolution design with an auxiliary CBF to prevent the multi-agent systems from converging to the undesirable equilibrium. To avoid dominating effects due to the deadlock resolution over the original task-related controllers, a deadlock indicator function using CBF-inspired risk measurement is proposed and encoded in the unified framework for the agents to adaptively determine when to activate the deadlock resolution. This allows the agents to follow their original control tasks and seamlessly unlock or deactivate deadlock resolution as necessary, effectively improving task efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and real-world experiments."

This framework utilizes the COMET inference model to reason about co-occurrence values between the target objects and known landmarks, thereby enhancing search efficiency. These co-occurrence values are integrated into a reactive temporal logic motion planning strategy, which allows the robot search for multiple objects with temporal logic constraints specified by LTL and adapt dynamically if the inferred reasoning differs from the actual object arrangement encountered during the search.

Historically, motion planners (MPs) have been evaluated with procedurally-generated simulators like CARLA. However, such synthetic benchmarks do not capture real-world multi-agent interactions. nuPlan, a recently released MP benchmark, addresses this limitation by augmenting real-world driving logs with closed-loop simulation logic, effectively turning the fixed dataset into a reactive simulator. We analyze the characteristics of nuPlan's recorded logs and find that each city has its own unique driving behaviors, suggesting that robust planners must adapt to different environments. We learn to model such unique behaviors with BehaviorNet, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) that predicts reactive agent behaviors using features derived from recently-observed agent histories; intuitively, some aggressive agents may tailgate lead vehicles, while others may not. To model such phenomena, BehaviorNet predicts the parameters of an agent's motion controller rather than directly predicting its spacetime trajectory (as most forecasters do). Finally, we present AdaptiveDriver, a model-predictive control (MPC) based planner that unrolls different world models conditioned on BehaviorNet's predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaptiveDriver achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuPlan closed-loop planning benchmark, improving over prior work by 2% on Test-14 Hard R-CLS, and generalizes even when evaluated on never-before-seen cities."

    "abstract": "Coordinated payload transport via a fleet of modular wheeled mobile robots offers flexibility for handling larger loads in indoor and outdoor environments. Biped-wheeled robots have recently emerged as a viable architecture for an independent/stand-alone wheeled mobile robot. In this work, we explore the use of two biped-wheeled robots that can leverage their mobility and maneuvarability for enhanced spatial pose control and stabilization for various payload transport tasks. However, coordinated control of multiple articulated wheeled robots for path tracking of a payload presents significant (and potentially competing) challenges, including kinematic redundancy, stability concerns, relative motion between the payload and robots, and precise motion control to achieve effective coordination. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework to develop the motion-plans for the system. In particular, this approach generates the ego robot's body twist and the follower robot's relative twist with respect to the ego robot. By formulating the action space of the follower robot as a relative twist, our approach facilitates pairwise interactions between robots. Furthermore, we use only relative pose information and the errors as states for the DRL controller, thereby making it agnostic to initial conditions and avoiding explicit dependency on absolute pose. We validate our approach through simulations conducted in Isaac Sim and on hardware using Diablo biped-wheeled robots with zero-shot transfer, demonstrating effective payload path tracking across varying parameters."

In the single-agent case, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) techniques attempt to address this issue by inferring the reward function from expert demonstrations. However, in multi-agent problems, misalignment between the learned and true objectives is exacerbated due to increased environment non-stationarity and variance that scale with multiple agents. As such, in multi-agent general-sum games, multi-agent IRL algorithms have difficulty balancing cooperative and competitive objectives. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Agent Marginal Q-Learning from Demonstrations (MAMQL), a novel sample-efficient framework for multi-agent IRL. For each agent, MAMQL learns a critic marginalized over the other agents' policies, allowing for a well-motivated use of Boltzmann policies in the multi-agent context. We identify a connection between optimal marginalized critics and single-agent soft-Q IRL, allowing us to apply a direct, simple optimization criterion from the single-agent domain. Across our experiments on three different simulated domains, MAMQL significantly outperforms previous multi-agent methods in average reward, sample efficiency, and reward recovery by often more than 2-5x.

Our framework has two main modules: Bird’s Eye View (BEV) localization and trajectory prediction. The BEV localization module estimates the position of a person using 2D human poses, enhanced by a novel directional loss for smoother sequential localizations. The trajectory prediction module predicts future motion from these estimates. We show that by jointly training both tasks with our unified framework, our method is more robust in real-world scenarios made of noisy inputs. We validate our MT network on both curated and non-curated datasets. On the curated dataset, MT achieves around 12% improvement over baseline models on BEV localization and trajectory prediction. On real-world non-curated dataset, experimental results indicate that MT maintains similar performance levels, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability."

With carefully designed heuristic functions, it offers efficient optimization capabilities, enabling rapid error reduction in rough localization estimations. Our method mitigates the dependence on complex neural network models while demonstrating improved robustness against noise and higher localization accuracy in challenging environments, as compared to neural network joint optimization strategies.

    "abstract": "Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D geometry. While stereo depth estimation can be achieved through triangulation methods, it is not as straightforward for monocular methods, which require the integration of global and local information. The Depth from Defocus (DFD) method utilizes camera lens models and parameters to recover depth information from blurred images and has been proven to perform well. However, these methods rely on All-In-Focus (AIF) images for depth estimation, which is nearly impossible to obtain in real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised framework based on 3D Gaussian splatting and Siamese networks. By learning the blur levels at different focal distances of the same scene in the focal stack, the framework predicts the defocus map and Circle of Confusion (CoC) from a single defocused image, using the defocus map as input to DepthNet for monocular depth estimation. The 3D Gaussian splatting model renders defocused images using the predicted CoC, and the differences between these and the real defocused images provide additional supervision signals for the Siamese Defocus self-supervised network. This framework has been validated on both artificially synthesized and real blurred datasets. Subsequent quantitative and visualization experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework is highly effective as a DFD method."

    "abstract": "Traditional volumetric fusion algorithms preserve the spatial structure of 3D scenes, which is beneficial for many tasks in computer vision and robotics. However, they often lack realism in terms of visualization. Emerging 3D Gaussian splatting bridges this gap, but existing Gaussian-based reconstruction methods often suffer from artifacts and inconsistencies with the underlying 3D structure, and struggle with real-time optimization, unable to provide users with immediate feedback in high quality. One of the bottlenecks arises from the massive amount of Gaussian parameters that need to be updated during optimization. Instead of using 3D Gaussian as a standalone map representation, we incorporate it into a volumetric mapping system to take advantage of geometric information and propose to use a quadtree data structure on images to drastically reduce the number of splats initialized. In this way, we simultaneously generate a compact 3D Gaussian map with fewer artifacts and a volumetric map on the fly. Our method, GSFusion, significantly enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets.

Although SFW is a more general model than the Manhattan world (MW), it is a more compact model than the mixture of Manhattan world (MMW). Leveraging the structural regularities of SFW, such as uniform inclination angle and geometric patterns of the four SDDs, we design an efficient and robust DD/vanishing point estimation method by aggregating sloping line normals on the Gaussian sphere. We further utilize the structural patterns of SFW for the 3-DoF visual compass, the rotational motion tracking from a single line and plane, which corresponds to the theoretical minimal sampling for 3-DoF rotation estimation.

    "abstract": "Monocular 360 depth estimation poses significant challenges due to the inherent distortion of the equirectangular projection (ERP). This distortion separates adjacent spherical points after their projection onto the ERP plane, especially in the polar regions, resulting in insufficient spherical relationships. To address this issue, recent methods calculate spherical neighbors within the tangent domain. However, since the tangent patch and the sphere share only one common point, spherical relationships are established only among neighbors around this common point. In this paper, we propose Spherical Fully-Connected CRFs (SF-CRFs). We start by evenly partitioning an ERP image into regular windows, where windows at the equator have broader spherical neighbors than those at the poles. To enhance spherical relationships, our SF-CRFs feature two key components. Firstly, to include sufficient spherical neighbors, we introduce a Spherical Window Transform (SWT) module. This module replicates the equator window’s spherical relationships across all other windows, leveraging the rotational invariance of the sphere. Remarkably, the transformation process is efficient, transforming all windows in a 512x1024 ERP image in just 0.038 seconds on a CPU. Secondly, we introduce a Planar-Spherical Interaction (PSI) module to calculate the SF-CRFs, which facilitates the relationships between regular and transformed windows. By integrating SF-CRFs blocks into a decoder, we propose CRF360D, a novel 360 depth estimation framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets. Our CRF360D is compatible with different perspective image-trained backbones, serving as the encoder."

As a proof of concept, three robot experiments were performed, and the results of the proposed method were compared with those of the conventional admittance control and impedance control (with friction compensation).

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional \"quotient\" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for assessing the resilience of the ICP algorithm via learning-based, worst-case attacks on lidar point clouds. For safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation, ensuring the resilience of algorithms before deployments is crucial. The ICP algorithm is the standard for lidar-based localization, but its accuracy can be greatly affected by corrupted measurements from various sources, including occlusions, adverse weather, or mechanical sensor issues. Unfortunately, the complex and iterative nature of ICP makes assessing its resilience to corruption challenging. While there have been efforts to create challenging datasets and develop simulations to evaluate the resilience of ICP, our method focuses on finding the maximum possible ICP error that can arise from corrupted measurements at a location. We demonstrate that our perturbation-based adversarial attacks can be used pre-deployment to identify locations on a map where ICP is particularly vulnerable to corruptions in the measurements. With such information, autonomous robots can take safer paths when deployed, to mitigate against their measurements being corrupted. The proposed attack outperforms baselines more than 88% of the time across a wide range of scenarios."

These services heavily rely on map-based traffic information to reduce uncertainties in recognizing lane shapes, traffic light locations, and traffic signs. Achieving this level of reliance on map information requires centimeter-level localization accuracy, which is currently only achievable with LiDAR sensors. However, LiDAR is known to be vulnerable to spoofing attacks that emit malicious lasers against LiDAR to overwrite its measurements. Once localization is compromised, the attack could lead the victim off roads or make them ignore traffic lights. Motivated by these serious safety implications, we design SLAMSpoof, the first practical LiDAR spoofing attack on localization systems for self-driving to assess the actual attack significance on autonomous vehicles. SLAMSpoof can effectively find the effective attack location based on our scan matching vulnerability score (SMVS), a point-wise metric representing the potential vulnerability to spoofing attacks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the attack, we conduct real-world experiments on ground vehicles and confirm its high capability in real-world scenarios, inducing position errors of ≥4.2 meters (more than typical lane width) for all 3 popular LiDAR-based localization algorithms. We finally discuss the potential countermeasures of this attack. Code is available at https://github.com/Keio-CSG/slamspoof"

    "paper_url": "",
    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks have been recently investigated in LiDAR perception problems for autonomous driving, where a small perturbation to the source inputs can result in incorrect predictions. However, most prior studies focus on attacks on single-frame perception modules, lacking explorations of attacks on consecutive-frame tasks, i.e. the LiDAR odometry. In this paper, we propose a gradient optimization-based adversarial attack towards deep LiDAR odometry networks. To generate point clouds consistent with real-world scenarios, we constrain adversarial points within the range of a small object, e.g. a traffic cone, and render new points to simulate real LiDAR measurements. By incorporating such adversarial points in consecutive frames, we demonstrate a significant decrease in pose estimation accuracy of current popular LiDAR odometry networks. In addition, we also evaluate traditional geometric odometry approaches and report their robustness over adversarial points. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack method and the vulnerability of deep LiDAR odometry methods against adversarial points."

    "paper_url": "",
    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's decision boundaries through small, carefully crafted perturbations that lead to significant mispredictions. In 3D vision, the high dimensionality and sparsity of data greatly expand the attack surface, making 3D vision particularly vulnerable for safety-critical robotics. To enhance 3D vision's adversarial robustness, we propose a training objective that simultaneously minimizes prediction loss and mutual information (MI) under adversarial perturbations to contain the upper bound of misprediction errors. This approach simplifies handling adversarial examples compared to conventional methods, which require explicit searching and training on adversarial samples. However, minimizing prediction loss conflicts with minimizing MI, leading to reduced robustness and catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we integrate curriculum advisors in the training setup that gradually introduce adversarial objectives to balance training and prevent models from being overwhelmed by difficult cases early in the process. The advisors also enhance robustness by encouraging training on diverse MI examples through entropy regularizers. We evaluated our method on ModelNet40 and KITTI using PointNet, DGCNN, SECOND, and PointTransformers, achieving 2--5% accuracy gains on ModelNet40 and a 5--10% mAP improvement in object detection. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nstrndrbi/Mine-N-Learn."

However, they face challenges traversing unstructured terrain such as stepped obstacles. This paper presents the design and testing of the PaTS-Wheel: a Passively-Transformable Single-part Wheel that can transform to render hooks when presented with obstacles. The passive rendering of this useful morphological feature is guided purely by the geometry of the obstacle. The energy consumption and vibrational profile of the PaTS-Wheel on flat ground is comparable to a standard wheel of the same size. In addition, our novel wheel design (with a diameter of 120 mm) was tested traversing different terrains with stepped obstacles of incremental heights. The PaTS-Wheel achieved 100 % success rate at traversing stepped obstacles 83 mm high (~ 70 % its diameter), higher than the results obtained for an equivalent wheel at 30 mm (~ 25 % its diameter) and an equivalent wheg at 73 mm (~ 61% its diameter). This achieves the design objectives of combining the energy efficiency and ride smoothness of wheels with the obstacle traversal capabilities of legged robots, all without requiring any sensors, actuators, or controllers."

This is particularly useful when the shape or position of the objects cannot be accurately determined because of sensor limitations. This gripper has multiple pins whose tips are covered by flexible balloons. The gripper can adapt to the shapes of objects in two steps: axial sliding of the pins and radial inflation of the balloons. This study focuses on the effect of the layout of pins on grasping and proposes a simulation model to quantify the characteristics of each layout. Simulations showed that the concentric layout enables stable grasping by ensuring many pins contact the object, regardless of misalignment. Experiments using a prototype gripper demonstrated a trend consistent with the simulation results, proving the validity of the simulation model."

    "abstract": "Aerial robots, especially multirotor type, have been utilized in various scenarios such as inspection, surveillance, and logistics. The most critical issue for multirotor type is the limited flight time due to the large power consumption for hovering against gravity. Inspired by nature, various research focus on the perching and grasping ability by deploying a gripper on the multirotor to grasp arboreal environments for saving energy; however, most the mechanical design for gripper restricts the approach path, which significantly limits the performance of perching and grasping. Besides, it is also challenging to design a light gripper that also offers sufficiently large grip force to hang itself. Therefore, in this work, we develop a single-actuator hand for aerial robot that enables adaptive grasping of various objects, and thus can perch from various approach directions. First, we present the design of the lightweight three-fingered hand with a pair of special two-dimensional differential plates that enables the adaptive grasping with a single actuator. In addition, we develop a unique control method for the over-actuated aerial robot equipped with this hand to perform both adaptive pendulum-like perching and detachment. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the prototype hand via load-bearing test and various object grasping tests, along with the inflight perching experiments."

To generate swing trajectories, we formulate an optimal control problem (OCP) that constrains the state of the paddle at the time of the strike. The terminal position is given by a predicted ball trajectory, and the terminal orientation and velocity of the paddle are chosen to match various possible styles of hits: loops (topspin), drives (flat), and chops (backspin). Finally, we construct a fixed-horizon model predictive controller (MPC) around this OCP to allow the hardware to quickly react to changes in the predicted ball trajectory. We validate on hardware that the system is capable of hitting balls with an average exit velocity of 11 m/s at an 88% success rate across the three swing types."

Quadruped robots, particularly those resembling dogs, have emerged as popular alternatives for traditional pets.

To address this issue, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to minimize the foot contact velocity highly related to the footstep sound. Our framework incorporates three key elements: learning varying PD gains to actively dampen and stiffen each joint, utilizing foot contact sensors, and employing curriculum learning to gradually enforce penalties on foot contact velocity. Experiments demonstrate that our learned policy achieves superior quietness compared to a RL baseline and the carefully handcrafted Sony commercial controller baselines. Furthermore, the trade-off between robustness and quietness is shown. This research contributes to developing quieter and more user-friendly robotic companions in home environments."

    "abstract": "Industrial robotic applications such as spraying, welding, and additive manufacturing frequently require fast, accurate, and uniform motion along a 3D spatial curve. To increase process throughput, some manufacturers propose a dual-arm setup to overcome the speed limitation of a single robot. Industrial robot motion is programmed through waypoints connected by motion primitives (Cartesian linear and circular paths and linear joint paths at constant Cartesian speed). The actual robot motion is affected by the blending between these motion primitives and the pose of the robot (an outstretched/near-singularity pose tends to have larger path-tracking errors). Choosing the waypoints and the speed along each motion segment to achieve the performance requirement is challenging. At present, there is no automated solution, and laborious manual tuning by robot experts is needed to approach the desired performance. In this letter, we present a systematic three-step approach to designing and programming a dual-arm system to optimize system performance. The first step is to select the relative placement between the two robots based on the specified relative motion path. The second step is to select the relative waypoints and the motion primitives. The final step is to update the waypoints iteratively based on the actual measured relative motion. Waypoint iteration is first executed in simulation and then completed using the actual robots. For performance assessment, we use the mean path speed subject to the relative position and orientation constraints and the path speed uniformity constraint. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method on two systems, a physical testbed of two ABB robots and a simulation testbed of two FANUC robots, for two challenging test curves."

This paper presents an antagonistic stiffening mechanism combining pneumatic actuation with tendon locking to achieve configuration- and stiffness control. Elongation of a soft pneumatic section, resulting from air actuation, is opposed by constraining the length of integrated tendons. These tendons can be locked in length by pneumatically activated levers at the base of each segment. Hence, tendon locking will not affect the configuration of other segments of a multi-segment manipulator. Our concept achieves a stiffness increase of up to 201.7% and a larger, more uniform radial workspace compared to the widely used pneumatic actuation concept while maintaining the low technical effort required for actuation. We also demonstrate how our actuation concept enables independent control of stiffness levels for individual segments of a multi-segment manipulator and their MR compatibility."

However, the deformation and motion of soft magnetic robots rely on both their structural design and magnetization, which complicates the guided movement and balance maintenance for aquatic environments. In this work, inspired by the flat and symmetrical body of rays, we design a soft magnetic fish-shaped robot capable of flexible motions and trajectory swimming on the water surface. This robot features the muscle made of magnetic elastomer, which connects with the acrylic skeleton and silicone film fins with a soft body. In the external magnetic field, the robot achieves hovering by flapping its fins, driven by the magnetically actuated deformation of its magnetic muscle. Besides, the robot's axial magnetization enables the rapid steering guided by a horizontal field. In experiments, the soft magnetic robot was tasked with performing a looping figure-eight trajectory movement on the water surface, guided by the field gradient generated by a dense planar electromagnetic coils' array. When moving, the onboard circuit board of the robot collected its inertial and temperature information, and sent these data to the host computer via Bluetooth in real-time for motion monitoring. Received data demonstrated that our robot performed the specified afloat swimming trajectory, exhibiting a good stability on its yaw angle during the continuous motion. The soft magnetic swimming robot shows its integrated functionalities in untethered actuation, on-robot sensing, and wireless communication, indicating a significant prospect on applications in inspection and cleaning within narrow pipelines and enclosed mechanical interior spaces."

A compact in-finger camera captures high-framerate images of the finger's deformation during contact, extracting crucial tactile data in real time. We present a volumetric discretized model of the soft finger and use the geometry constraints captured by the camera to find the optimal estimation of the deformed shape. The approach is benchmarked using a motion capture system with sparse markers and a haptic device with dense measurements. Both results show state-of-the-art accuracies, with a median error of 1.96 mm for overall body deformation, corresponding to 2.1% of the finger's length. More importantly, the state estimation is robust in both on-land and underwater environments, as we demonstrate its usage for underwater object shape sensing.

These dynamics enable the upper-level planning problem to reason about contact timing and forces, and generate entirely new contact-mode sequences online. To achieve reliable and fast numerical convergence, we devise a structure-exploiting interior-point solver for these LCP contact dynamics and a custom trajectory optimizer for the tracking problem. We demonstrate real-time solution rates for CI-MPC and the ability to generate and track non-periodic behaviours in hardware experiments on a quadrupedal robot.

Existing methods lack a comprehensive solution to accurately reconstruct real-world objects with spatial representations and their associated physics attributes. We propose a Real2Sim pipeline with a hybrid representation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the digital asset representation of robotic arms. This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and Gaussian models.

Given the digital assets, we propose a manipulable Real2Sim pipeline that standardizes coordinate systems and scales, ensuring the seamless integration of multiple components. In addition to reconstructing the robotic arm, the surrounding static background and objects can be holistically reconstructed, enabling seamless interactions between the robotic arm and its environment. We also provide datasets covering various robotic manipulation tasks and robotic arm mesh reconstructions.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for non-prehensile manipulation which incrementally adapts a physics-based dynamics model for model-predictive control (MPC). The model prediction is aligned with a few examples of robot-object interactions collected with the MPC. This is achieved by using a parallelizable rigid-body physics simulation as dynamic world model and sampling-based optimization of the model parameters. In turn, the optimized dynamics model can be used for MPC using efficient sampling-based optimization. We evaluate our few-shot adaptation approach in object pushing experiments in simulation and with a real robot."

    "abstract": "Collision detection is a critical functionality for robotics. The degree to which objects collide cannot be represented as a continuously differentiable function for any shapes other than spheres. This paper proposes a framework for handling collision detection between polyhedral shapes. We frame the signed distance between two polyhedral bodies as the optimal value of a convex optimization, and consider constraining the signed distance in a bilevel optimization problem. To avoid relying on specialized bilevel solvers, our method exploits the fact that the signed distance is the minimal point of a convex region related to the two bodies. Our method enumerates the values obtained at all extreme points of this region and lists them as constraints in the higher-level problem. We compare our formulation to existing methods in terms of accuracy and speed when solved using the same mixed complementarity problem solver. We demonstrate that our approach more reliably solves difficult collision detection problems with multiple obstacles than other methods, and is faster than existing methods in some cases."

During the procedure, the sonographer and endoscopic surgeon manage different image modalities each with its own field of view. Tacit collaboration is needed between them to visualize the right information and ensure the smooth operation of the procedure. Robotic approaches could simplify this interaction but would require robust localization tools to cope with the complex fetoscopic motion patterns. This study proposes a method for robotic ultrasound (rUS) fetoscope tracking, fusing optical tracking system (OTS) and 2D US imaging. The Kalman filter is defined to guarantee robust online registration and enhance fetoscope tracking. Real-time detection of the fetoscope tip is achieved using the You Only Look Once (YOLO v7) algorithm. Additionally, a US image-based searching strategy is proposed for situations where the optical camera is obstructed. Hybrid position-force control is employed to manipulate the US probe safely against the pregnant abdomen. Validation on a silicone phantom demonstrates accurate tracking results with a mean error below 2.59 mm and tip visibility exceeding 90% is found in most experiments. The proposed system could potentially reduce surgeon workload and training costs for FLP surgery."

    "abstract": "Navigating the ultrasound (US) probe to the standardized imaging plane (SIP) for image acquisition is a critical but operator-dependent task in conventional freehand diagnostic US. Robotic US systems (RUSS) offer the potential to enhance imaging consistency by leveraging real-time US image feedback to optimize the probe pose, thereby reducing reliance on operator expertise. However, determining the proper approach to extracting generalizable features from the US images for probe pose adjustment remains challenging. In this work, we propose a SIP navigation framework for RUSS, exemplified in the context of robotic lung ultrasound (LUS). This framework facilitates automatic probe adjustment when in proximity to the SIP. This is achieved by explicitly extracting multiple anatomical features presented in real-time LUS images and performing non-patient-specific template matching to generate probe motion towards the SIP using image-based visual servoing (IBVS). The framework is further integrated with the active-sensing end-effector (A-SEE), a customized robot end-effector that leverages patient external body geometry to maintain optimal probe alignment with the contact surface, thus preserving US signal quality throughout the navigation. The proposed approach ensures procedural interpretability and inter-patient adaptability. Validation is conducted through anatomy-mimicking phantom and in-vivo evaluations involving five human subjects."

    "abstract": "Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns the preoperative model and the intraoperative image of the same anatomy, plays an important role in enabling successful interventional navigation. To alleviate the challenge of limited field of view associated with single intraoperative image, more than one intraoperative images can be leveraged and the multi-view 2D/3D registration is thus needed. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach which consists of two stages. In the first stage, the combined loss function consisting of the differences between the predicted and ground-truth poses, and dissimilarities (e.g., normalized crosscorrelation) between the simulated and observed intraoperative images. More importantly, the additional cross-view training loss terms are formulated for both pose and image loss, to explicitly consider the cross-view constraints. In the second stage, the test-time optimization is conducted to refine the estimated poses in the coarse stage. Our method leverages the mutual constraints of multi-frame view projection poses to enhance the robustness of the multi-view 2D/3D registration approach. The proposed framework achieves an mTRE of 0.79±2.17 mm on six datasets from DeepFluoro, further advancing beyond the state-of-the-art registration algorithms on this dataset."

We proposed novel hybrid approach that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with adaptive robotic scanning. The adaptive grid-based scanning could provide initial direction estimation while the DRL-based agent could efficiently navigate to the target utilising historical data. Simulation experiments demonstrate a 95% success rate, and improved efficiency and robustness compared to conventional techniques. Real-world evaluation on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) further confirms the feasibility of the approach, achieving an 80% success rate in radiotracer detection. This method has the potential to enhance consistency, reduce operator dependency, and improve procedural accuracy in radioguided surgeries."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) probe localization relative to the examined subject is essential for freehand 3D US imaging, which offers significant clinical value due to its affordability and unrestricted field of view. However, existing methods often rely on expensive tracking systems or bulky probes, while recent US image-based deep learning methods suffer from accumulated errors during probe maneuvering. To address these challenges, this study proposes a versatile, cost-effective probe pose localization method for freehand 3D US imaging, utilizing two lightweight cameras. To eliminate accumulated errors during US scans, we introduce PoseNet, which directly predicts the probe's 6D pose relative to a preset world coordinate system based on camera observations. We first jointly train pose and camera image encoders based on pairs of 6D pose and camera observations densely sampled in simulation. This will encourage each pair of probe pose and its corresponding camera observation to share the same representation in latent space. To ensure the two encoders handle unseen images and poses effectively, we incorporate a triplet loss that enforces smaller differences in latent features between nearby poses compared to distant ones. Then, the pose decoder uses the latent representation of the camera images to predict the probe's 6D pose. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, in the real world, we use the trained image encoder and pose decoder for initial predictions, followed by an additional MLP layer to refine the estimated pose, improving accuracy. The results obtained from an arm phantom demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which notably surpasses state-of-the-art techniques, achieving average positional and rotational errors of 2.03 mm and 0.37 deg, respectively."

This method allows the robot to transfer and generalize the search skills learned in simulation to real-world scenarios. As a result, the robot can rapidly locate the charging port in real world environments without the need for complex contact state modeling, time-consuming data collection, or model retraining. Subsequently, a biomimetic admittance controller is designed to enable the robot to adapt its compliant behavior online during the plugging process. Finally, experiments are performed on a UR robot to verify the effectiveness of our method."

    "abstract": "For successful peg-in-hole assembly, predefined sub-tasks should be executed sequentially according to the current contact state. Therefore, recognizing contact state transitions is essential in order to determine whether to continue the current task or proceed to the next. In that context, learning-based solutions have shown outstanding results. However, these methods heavily rely on balanced datasets, which are challenging to obtain due to the short duration of certain contact states and rare failure cases. To address this issue, this paper proposes a framework for estimating contact state transitions using anomaly detection through input data reconstruction. The proposed framework operates in a semi-supervised manner, eliminating the need for balanced datasets during training. For input data reconstruction, a convolutional neural network is combined with a variational autoencoder to process various sensor measurements as a multivariate time series. Unlike traditional binary anomaly detection, the proposed anomaly detector scores reconstruction errors and leverages domain knowledge to identify various contact state transitions in the peg-in-hole assembly. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through experiments using a torque-controlled dual manipulator system."

To this end, this article proposes a novel robotic assembly strategy for CECs with small relative initial deviations, whose core is to design a search trajectory and heuristic force strategy to perceive force/pose (F/P) discontinuity characteristics under different geometric constraints. This assembly strategy is independent of the CEC's size and is not affected by the socket's spatial orientation. The experiments with two different sizes of CECs on a robot equipped with a 6-dimensional force/torque (F/T) sensor are conducted, and the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed assembly strategy for CECs are demonstrated."

Specifically, MatchMaker can 1) take a simulation-incompatible, interpenetrating asset pair as input, and automatically convert it into a simulation-compatible, interpenetration-free pair, 2) take an arbitrary single asset as input , and generate a geometrically-mating asset to create an asset pair, 3) automatically erode contact surfaces from (1) or (2) according to a user-specified clearance parameter to generate realistic parts."

To this end, agricultural robots equipped with vision-based systems offer the potential to detect individual plants in the field automatically. This capability enables targeted management actions in the field, effectively reducing the amount of agrochemicals. A primary target of such vision systems is to perform a panoptic segmentation, combining the task of semantic and instance segmentation. Recent methods use neural networks for this task, which typically have to be trained on densely annotated images containing the required ground truth information for each pixel. Gathering these dense annotations is generally daunting and requires domain experts' knowledge in the agricultural domain. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively reduce the annotation bottleneck and yet achieve high performance using partial annotations. These partial annotations contain ground truth information only for a subset of pixels per image and are thus much faster to obtain than dense annotations. We propose a novel set of losses that exploit measures from vector fields used in physics, i.e., divergence and curl, to effectively supervise predictions without ground truth annotations.

We tackle the problem of object search in a farm environment, providing a method that allows a robot to semantically reason about the location of an unseen target object among a set of previously seen objects in the environment using a Large Language Model (LLM). We leverage object-to-object semantic relationships to plan a path through the environment that will allow us to accurately and efficiently locate our target object while also reducing the overall distance traveled, without needing high-level room or area-level semantic relationships.

Our offline testing yielded an average path efficiency of 84%, reflecting how closely the predicted path aligns with the ideal path. Upon deploying our system on the Boston Dynamics Spot robot in a real-world farm environment, we found that our system had a success rate of 80%, with a success weighted by path length of 0.67, which demonstrates a reasonable trade-off between task success and path efficiency under real-world conditions.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized imitation learning, allowing robots to replicate complex behaviours. However, diffusion often relies on cameras and other exteroceptive sensors to observe the environment and lacks long-term memory. In space, military, and underwater applications, robots must be highly robust to failures in exteroceptive sensors, operating using only proprioceptive information. In this paper, we propose ProDapt, a method of incorporating long-term memory of previous contacts between the robot and the environment in the diffusion process, allowing it to complete tasks using only proprioceptive data. This is achieved by identifying \"keypoints\", essential past observations maintained as inputs to the policy. We test our approach using a UR10e robotic arm in both simulation and real experiments and demonstrate the necessity of this long-term memory for task completion."

In particular, we introduce a diffusion model which produces collision-free paths in a global reference frame given an egocentric LIDAR scan, an arbitrary map, and a desired goal position. To this end, we implement diffusion in the space of paths in SE(2), and describe how to condition the denoising process on both obstacles and sensor observations. In our evaluation, we show that the proposed conditioning techniques enable generalization to realistic maps of considerably different appearance than the training environment, demonstrate our model's ability to accurately describe ambiguous solutions, and run extensive simulation experiments showcasing our model's use as a real-time, end-to-end localization and planning stack."

Leveraging successful past plans and utilising trajectory generative models as priors offers a clear advantage. Previous studies have proposed various methods to harness these priors, such as using prior samples for initialisation or incorporating the prior distribution into trajectory optimisation through inference. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated effectiveness in encoding multimodal data in high-dimensional settings. In this study, we propose a method that uses diffusion models as priors and employs Stein variational inference with Gaussian Process trajectories to integrate them into a batch inverse denoising process. This approach reduces the computation time required to approximate the posterior distribution of trajectories, particularly when adapting to new, unseen environments. Additionally, we incorporate path signatures into our method to enhance the diversity of the posterior distribution. To validate our approach, we conduct comparative assessments against multiple baseline methods across various scenarios, including 2D planar robots and robotic manipulators.

Unfortunately, combining these two orthogonal improvements has proven surprisingly difficult, since there is no clear and well understood process for making important design choices. In this paper, we identify, study and improve key architectural design decisions for high-capacity diffusion transformer policies. The resulting models can efficiently solve diverse tasks on multiple robot embodiments, without the excruciating pain of per-setup hyper-parameter tuning. By combining the results of our investigation with our improved model components, we are able to present a novel architecture, named DiT-Block Policy, that significantly outperforms the state of the art in solving long-horizon (1500+ time-steps) dexterous tasks on a bi-manual ALOHA robot. In addition, we find that our policies show improved scaling performance when trained on 10 hours of highly multi-modal, language annotated ALOHA demonstration data.

Naive human intervention may inadvertently exacerbate distribution shift, leading to constraint violations or execution failures. To better align policy output with human intent without inducing out-of-distribution errors, we propose an Inference-Time Policy Steering (ITPS) framework that leverages human interactions to bias the generative sampling process, rather than fine-tuning the policy on interaction data. We evaluate ITPS across three simulated and real-world benchmarks, testing three forms of human interaction and associated alignment distance metrics. Among six sampling strategies, our proposed stochastic sampling with diffusion policy achieves the best trade-off between alignment and distribution shift.

    "abstract": "The planning problem constitutes a fundamental aspect of the autonomous driving framework. Recent strides in representation learning have empowered vehicles to comprehend their surrounding environments, thereby facilitating the integration of learning-based planning strategies. Among these approaches, Imitation Learning stands out due to its notable training efficiency. However, traditional Imitation Learning methodologies encounter challenges associated with the covariate shift phenomenon. We propose Validity Learning on Failures, VL(on failure), as a remedy to address this issue. The essence of our method lies in deploying a pre-trained planner across diverse scenarios. Instances where the planner deviates from its immediate objectives, such as maintaining a safe distance from obstacles or adhering to traffic rules, are flagged as failures. The states corresponding to these failures are compiled into a new dataset, termed the failure dataset. Notably, the absence of expert annotations for this data precludes the applicability of standard imitation learning approaches. To facilitate learning from the closed-loop mistakes, we introduce the VL objective which aims to discern valid trajectories within the current environmental context. Experimental evaluations conducted on both reactive CARLA simulation and non-reactive log-replay simulations reveal substantial enhancements in closed-loop metrics such as Score, Progress, and Success Rate, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Further evaluations against the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate that VL(on failure) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."

Supplementing annotated waypoints with natural language guidance affords an opportunity for both. In this work we investigate one-shot versus iterative input, introducing a testbed system based on government and industry UAV planning tools that affords inputs in the form of both natural language text and drawn annotations on a terrain map. The testbed uses an LLM-based subsystem to map user inputs into additional terms for the trajectory optimization objective function. We demonstrate through a human subjects study that prompting a human teammate to iteratively add latent knowledge to a trajectory optimization aids the user in learning how the system functions, elicits more desirable robot behaviors, and ultimately achieves better task outcomes."

Previous approaches using forward projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB (Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the comprehension of the 3D scene.

However, the computation cost also increases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of LiDAR sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of points in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points has minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective Gumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a learned end-to-end sampling.

However, previous models only performed feature fusion in the deep-level BEV hierarchy when dealing with camera-LiDAR feature fusion. This approach lacks interaction with the shallow-level sensor features, which is beneficial in constructing the corresponding BEV features. However, a simple shallow-level feature interaction can introduce sensor noise caused by intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration errors. To address this, we propose RoBiFusion, a novel camera-LiDAR 3D object detection framework designed for effective sensor feature interaction and mitigating sensor noise interference. This framework consists of three submodules: the Camera-LiDAR Feature Matching module, the LiDAR-to-Camera module, and the Camera-to-LiDAR module. Firstly, in the Camera-LiDAR Feature Matching module, we use the cross-attention module to dynamically match the camera features and the LiDAR features, which solves the problem of feature inconsistency caused by noise in the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Secondly, in the LiDAR-to-Camera module, we propose a novel depth representation that can effectively mitigate LiDAR noise interference. Thirdly, in the Camera-to-LiDAR module, we introduce deformable attention to help LiDAR feature capture instance-level semantic features. Additionally, we design a novel differentiable and efficient grid sample module to accelerate the process since the bilinear grid sample module in deformable attention is time-consuming and not deployment-friendly. We compared RoBiFusion to the state-of-the-art BEVFusion on the nuScenes dataset and found that RoBiFusion surpasses BEVFusion by 1.5% mAP and 2.4% NDS.

    "abstract": "3D semantic occupancy prediction is a crucial task in visual perception, demanding a simultaneous understanding of both scene geometry and semantics. It plays a pivotal role in 3D scene comprehension and holds great potential for various applications, such as robotic vision perception and autonomous driving. Many previous works leverage planar-based representations like Bird’s Eye View (BEV) and Tri-Perspective View (TPV), which aim to simplify the complexity of 3D scenes while preserving essential object information, thereby facilitating efficient scene representation. However, in dense indoor environments where occlusions are prevalent, directly applying these planar-based methods often leads to difficulties in capturing global semantic occupancy, ultimately degrading model performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel vertical slice representation, which divides the scene along the vertical axis and projects spatial point features onto the nearest pair of parallel planes. To harness these slice features, we propose SliceOcc, a camera-based model specifically tailored for indoor 3D semantic occupancy prediction. SliceOcc utilizes pairs of slice queries and cross-attention mechanisms to extract planar features from input images. These local planar features are then combined to form a global scene representation, which is employed for indoor occupancy estimation. Experimental results on the EmbodiedScan dataset demonstrate that SliceOcc achieves a mIoU of 15.45% across 81 indoor categories, setting a new state-of-the-art performance among RGB-based models for indoor 3D semantic occupancy prediction."

To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach of bandwidth-adaptive spatiotemporal CoID for collaborative perception, where robots interactively select partial spatiotemporal observations to share with others, while adapting to the communication constraint that dynamically changes over time. We evaluate our approach over various scenarios in connected autonomous driving simulations. Experimental results have demonstrated that our approach enables CoID and adapts to the dynamic change of bandwidth constraints. In addition, our approach achieves 8%-56% overall improvements in terms of covisible object retrieval for CoID and data sharing efficiency, which outperforms the previous techniques and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

However, due to high annotation costs and strict privacy concerns, acquiring high-quality endoscopic images poses a considerable challenge in the development of ADS. Despite recent advancements in generating synthetic images for dataset expansion, existing endoscopic image generation algorithms failed to accurately generate the details of polyp boundary regions and typically required medical priors to specify plausible locations and shapes of polyps, which limited the realism and diversity of the generated images. To address these limitations, we present Polyp-Gen, the first full-automatic diffusion-based endoscopic image generation framework. Specifically, we devise a spatial-aware diffusion training scheme with a lesion-guided loss to enhance the structural context of polyp boundary regions. Moreover, to capture medical priors for the localization of potential polyp areas, we introduce a hierarchical retrieval-based sampling strategy to match similar fine-grained spatial features. In this way, our Polyp-Gen can generate realistic and diverse endoscopic images for building reliable ADS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art generation quality and the synthetic images can improve the downstream polyp detection task. Additionally, our Polyp-Gen has shown remarkable zero-shot generalizability on other datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/Polyp-Gen."

Most existing methods focus on 1) real-time reconstruction, 2) accurate voxel featuring learning, and 3) effective voxel sparsification algorithm. To this end, 1) they adopt a coarse-to-fine pipeline, where all non-empty voxels are sent to the next level for refinement. However, this results in over-refinement of flat regions, leading to unnecessary computational overhead. Furthermore, 2) advanced methods focus on exploring view visibility but overlook the discriminability among visible views, which limits the representation of learned voxel features. Moreover, 3) existing sparsification algorithms struggle to distinguish detailed and empty voxels, resulting in either the loss of detailed voxels or the retention of empty voxels. To tackle these challenges, 1) we present Dynamic Detail Refinement (DDR) to allocate more voxels to detailed regions for refinement, which could alleviate the computational burden. Furthermore, 2) we propose Discriminability-Aware Fusion (DAF) to focus on discriminative views, which helps to capture accurate voxel features. In addition, 3) we propose Hierarchical Hybrid Sparsification (HHS) to balance global completeness and local refinement, which helps to preserve detailed voxels at hierarchical levels effectively.

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles and robots often struggle with reliable visual perception at night due to the low illumination and motion blur caused by the long exposure time of RGB cameras. Existing methods address this challenge by sequentially connecting the off-the-shelf pretrained low-light enhancement and deblurring models. Unfortunately, these methods often lead to noticeable artifacts (eg., color distortions) in the over-exposed regions or make it hardly possible to learn the motion cues of the dark regions. In this paper, we interestingly find vision-language models, eg., Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), can comprehensively perceive diverse degradation levels at night. In light of this, we propose a novel transformer-based joint learning framework, named DAP-LED, which can jointly achieve low-light enhancement and deblurring, benefiting downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, segmentation, and detection in the dark. The key insight is to leverage CLIP to adaptively learn the degradation levels from images at night. This subtly enables learning rich semantic information and visual representation for optimization of the joint tasks. To achieve this, we first introduce a CLIP-guided cross-fusion module to obtain multi-scale patch-wise degradation heatmaps from the image embeddings. Then, the heatmaps are fused via the designed CLIP-enhanced transformer blocks to retain useful degradation information for effective model optimization. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our DAP-LED achieves state-of-the-art performance in the dark. Meanwhile, the enhanced results are demonstrated to be effective for three downstream tasks.\tFor demo and more results, please check the project page: url{https://vlislab22.github.io/dap-led/}."

This paper formulates multi-robot object SLAM as a variational inference problem over a communication graph subject to consensus constraints on the object estimates maintained by different robots. To solve the problem, we develop a distributed mirror descent algorithm with regularization enforcing consensus among the communicating robots. Using Gaussian distributions in the algorithm, we also derive a distributed multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) for multi-robot object SLAM. Experiments on real and simulated data show that our method improves the trajectory and object estimates, compared to individual-robot SLAM, while achieving better scaling to large robot teams, compared to centralized multi-robot SLAM."

When no global position information is available (e.g., indoor or GPS-denied environments), agents must align their coordinate frames before shared spatial information can be properly expressed and interpreted. Coordinate frame alignment is particularly difficult when robots have no initial alignment and are affected by odometry drift. To this end, we develop a novel multiple hypothesis algorithm, called TCAFF, for aligning the coordinate frames of neighboring robots. TCAFF considers potential alignments from associating sparse open-set object maps and leverages temporal consistency to determine an initial alignment and correct for drift, all without any initial knowledge of neighboring robot poses. We demonstrate TCAFF being used for frame alignment in a collaborative object tracking application on a team of four robots tracking six pedestrians and show that TCAFF enables robots to achieve a tracking accuracy similar to that of a system with ground truth localization.

Our system, which we call the qPCRBot , addresses these issues through three key pillars: automating data analysis and handling processes, standardizing data management and system communication protocols, and utilizing a robotic manipulator for labware transport. To achieve this, we developed a SiLA 2-based client-server architecture for unified and standardized access to both the qPCR device and the robot. For the manipulator, we implemented a Cartesian motion generator to ensure proper labware transport.

Currently, robots can perform these tasks faster than chemists, but how reliable are they? Improper capping could result in human exposure to toxic chemicals which could be fatal. To ensure that robots perform these tasks as accurately as humans, sensory feedback is required to assess the progress of task execution. To address this, we propose a novel methodology based on behaviour trees with multimodal perception. Along with automating robotic tasks, this methodology also verifies the successful execution of the task, a fundamental requirement in safety-critical environments. The experimental evaluation was conducted on two lab tasks: sample vial capping and laboratory rack insertion. The results show high success rate, i.e., 88% for capping and 92% for insertion, along with strong error detection capabilities.

The framework enables the robots to compute a shared confidence metric, which helps the ground robot assess terrain and determine when deploying the aerial robot will extend exploration. The robot's confidence in traversing a path is based on factors such as predicted volumetric gain, path traversability, and collision risk. A hierarchy of graphs is used to maintain an efficient representation of traversability and frontier information through multi-resolution maps. Evaluated in a real subterranean exploration scenario, the approach allows the ground robot to autonomously identify zones that are no longer traversable but suitable for aerial deployment.

For instance, silk moths adjust their wing-flapping frequency to detect pheromones, while dogs modify their sniffing behavior by altering sniff height and frequency based on proximity to an odor source. Despite the potential to enhance odor detection for olfactory navigation by drawing inspiration from these natural mechanisms, many existing approaches focus on computationally intensive methods like multi-sensory integration or rely on multiple robots for odor localization, rather than leveraging embodied sensing. In this study, we propose an embodied adaptive sensing strategy that enhances odor detection by implementing an active odor sensor on a legged robot and applying a bio-inspired adaptive robot height control system for dynamically adapting the robot's height based on real-time gas concentration feedback. The control system employs a simple artificial hormone mechanism to regulate the robot height by processing gas concentration derivatives, mimicking biological adaptability. By utilizing the interaction between the active odor sensor, adaptive control system, and the legged body, this approach allows the robot to optimize its height online to capture the maximum gas concentration, thereby reducing the need for complex algorithms and high computational resources. As a result, it offers a more efficient solution for odor-driven tasks, with potential applications in real-world environments."

The majority of legged animals and robots are bilaterally symmetric, which facilitates locomotion with consistent headings and obstacle traversal, but leads to constraints in their turning ability. On the other hand, radially symmetric animals have demonstrated rapid turning abilities enabled by their omni-directional body plans. Radially symmetric tripedal robots are able to turn instantaneously, but are commonly constrained by needing to change direction with every step, resulting in inefficient and less stable locomotion. Inspired by the radial symmetry and maneuverability of brittle stars and octopuses, we introduce a novel design for a tripedal robot that has both frictional and rolling contacts. Additionally, a freely rotating central sphere provides an added contact point so the robot can retain a stable tripod base of support while lifting and pushing with any one of its legs. The SKating, Omni-Oriented, Tripedal Robot (SKOOTR) is more versatile and stable than existing tripedal robots. It is capable of multiple forward gaits, multiple turning maneuvers, obstacle traversal, and stair climbing.

    "paper_url": "",
    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "We present a framework for learning a single policy capable of producing all quadruped gaits and transitions. The framework consists of a policy trained with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to modulate the parameters of a system of abstract oscillators (i.e. Central Pattern Generator), whose output is mapped to joint commands through a pattern formation layer that sets the gait style, i.e. body height, swing foot ground clearance height, and foot offset. Different gaits are formed by changing the coupling between different oscillators, which can be instantaneously selected at any velocity by a user. With this framework, we systematically investigate which gait should be used at which velocity, and when gait transitions should occur from a Cost of Transport (COT), i.e. energy-efficiency, point of view. Additionally, we note how gait style changes as a function of locomotion speed for each gait to keep the most energy-efficient locomotion. While the currently most popular gait (trot) does not result in the lowest COT, we find that considering different co-dependent metrics such as mean base angular velocity and joint acceleration result in different 'optimal' gaits than those that minimize COT. We deploy our controller in various hardware experiments, focusing on 9 quadruped animal gaits, and demonstrate generalizability to novel and unseen gaits during training, and robustness to leg failures."

    "abstract": "Drag-based swimming with rowing appendages, fins, and webbed feet is a widely adapted locomotion form in aquatic animals. To develop effective underwater and swimming vehicles, a wide range of bioinspired drag-based paddles have been proposed, often faced with a trade-off between propulsive efficiency and versatility. Webbed feet provide an effective propulsive force in the power phase, are light weight and robust, and can even be partially folded away in the recovery phase. However, during the transition between recovery and power phase, much time is lost folding and unfolding, leading to drag and reducing efficiency. In this work, we took inspiration from the coupling tendons of aquatic birds and utilized tendon coupling mechanisms to shorten the transition time between recovery and power phase. Results from our hardware experiments show that the proposed mechanisms improve propulsive efficiency by 2.0 and 2.4 times compared to a design without extensor tendons or based on passive paddle, respectively. We further report that distal leg joint clutching, which has been shown to improve efficiency in terrestrial walking, did not play an major role in swimming locomotion. In sum, we describe a new principle for an efficient, drag-based leg and paddle design, with potential relevance for the swimming mechanics in aquatic birds."

    "abstract": "The capability of effectively moving on complex terrains such as sand and gravel can empower our robots to robustly operate in outdoor environments, and assist with critical tasks such as environment monitoring, search-and-rescue, and supply delivery. Inspired by the Mount Lyell salamander's ability to curl its body into a loop and effectively roll down hill slopes, in this study we develop a sand-rolling robot and investigate how its locomotion performance is governed by the shape of its body. We experimentally tested three different body shapes: Hexagon, Quadrilateral, and Triangle. We found that Hexagon and Triangle can achieve a faster rolling speed on sand, but exhibited more frequent failures of getting stuck. Analysis of the interaction between robot and sand revealed the failure mechanism: the deformation of the sand produced a local ``sand incline'' underneath robot contact segments, increasing the effective region of supporting polygon (ERSP) and preventing the robot from shifting its center of mass (CoM) outside the ERSP to produce sustainable rolling. Based on this mechanism, a highly-simplified model successfully captured the critical body pitch for each rolling shape to produce sustained rolling on sand, and informed design adaptations that mitigated the locomotion failures and improved robot speed by more than 200%. Our results provide insights into how locomotors can utilize different morphological features to achieve robust rolling motion across deformable substrates."

Jumping robots in the literature are typically evaluated when jumping from rigid surfaces, in contrast to surfaces with more significant compliance or damping that are encountered in the natural world. The aim of this work is to create a physical substrate, or 'ground', for which the effective mass, compliance, and damping can be programmed. This system enables quick testing of various substrate conditions and also allows for the introduction of complex nonlinearities to analyze the interactions between latch-mediated spring actuation (LaMSA) systems and their environment. A mathematical model for the substrate is defined and the system is built with a fast brushless DC motor and controller running on a real-time target machine. The results illustrate the range of compliance and damping that can be achieved, as well as example jumps from the substrate using a 4 g jumper and a 108 g jumping robot."

However, key factors such as battery power consumption and stepping noise are often inaccurately modeled or missing in common simulators, leaving these aspects poorly optimized or unaddressed by current sim-to-real methods. Hand-designed proxies, such as mechanical power and foot contact forces, have been used to address these challenges but are often problem-specific and inaccurate. \t\t\t In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for fine-tuning locomotion policies, targeting these hard-to-simulate objectives. Our framework leverages real-world data to model these objectives and incorporates the learned model into simulation for policy improvement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on power saving for quadruped locomotion, achieving a significant 24-28% net reduction in total power consumption from the battery pack at various speeds. In essence, our approach offers a versatile solution for optimizing hard-to-simulate objectives in quadruped locomotion, providing an easy-to-adapt paradigm for continual improving with real-world knowledge."

    "abstract": "Adaptive locomotion is a fundamental capability for quadruped robots, particularly in real-world scenarios when they must transport novel or out-of-distribution (O.O.D.) payloads across diverse terrains. Previous learning-based methods often tightly couple a locomotion controller's learned parameters with the adaptation process, which requires extensive pre-training or slow online updates when encountering O.O.D. payloads. To enable adaptation of quadruped locomotion to O.O.D. payloads, we propose the novel Rapid Introspective Neural Adaptation (RINA) method that rapidly compensates for differences between expected and actual joint torques caused by O.O.D. payloads. RINA introduces an adaptive residual dynamics representation that decouples the learning model's parameters from those used for adaptation. A new neural operator network is introduced to learn a set of basis functions as the learning model, which are combined using linear coefficients to predict residual dynamics. Then, these residual dynamics are used to adjust the locomotion controller's output, compensating for additional torques induced by the O.O.D. payload. During execution, the mixing coefficients can be rapidly and introspectively adapted on-the-go to generate joint torque compensations for O.O.D. payloads, while keeping the learned basis functions unchanged. Experimental results have demonstrated that our RINA approach well addresses on-the-go O.O.D. payload adaptation on varied natural terrains without collecting and retraining on additional data and outperforms baseline methods."

In this paper, we propose DreamFLEX, a robust fault-tolerant locomotion controller that enables a quadrupedal robot to traverse complex environments even under joint failure condition. DreamFLEX integrates an explicit failure estimation and modulation network that jointly estimates the robot's joint fault vector and utilizes this information to adapt the locomotion pattern to faulty conditions in real-time, enabling quadrupedal robots to maintain stability and performance in rough terrains. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamFLEX outperforms existing methods in both simulation and real-world scenarios, effectively managing hardware failures while maintaining robust locomotion performance."

This work aims to prove that learning dynamic jumping is possible without relying on imitating a reference trajectory by leveraging a curriculum design. Starting from a vertical in-place jump, we generalize the learned policy to forward and diagonal jumps and, finally, we learn to jump across obstacles. Conditioned on the desired landing location, orientation, and obstacle dimensions, the proposed approach yields a wide range of omnidirectional jumping motions in real-world experiments. Particularly we achieve a 90cm forward jump, exceeding all previous records for similar robots reported in the existing literature. Additionally, the robot can reliably execute continuous jumping on soft grassy grounds, which is especially remarkable as such conditions were not included in the training stage."

Compact, low-cost sensing platforms can facilitate a change, but unlike their popular optical counterparts, they are difficult to deploy in high-fidelity tasks due to their low signal dimensionality and lack of a simulation model. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PseudoTouch which links high-dimensional structural information to low-dimensional sensor signals. It does so by learning a low-dimensional visual-tactile embedding, wherein we encode a depth patch from which we decode the tactile signal. We collect and train PseudoTouch on a dataset comprising aligned tactile and visual data pairs obtained through random touching of eight basic geometric shapes. We demonstrate the utility of our trained PseudoTouch model in two downstream tasks: object recognition and grasp stability prediction. In the object recognition task, we evaluate the learned embedding's performance on a set of five basic geometric shapes and five household objects. Using PseudoTouch, we achieve an object recognition accuracy 84% after just ten touches, surpassing a proprioception baseline. For the grasp stability task, we use ACRONYM labels to train and evaluate a grasp success predictor using PseudoTouch's predictions derived from virtual depth information. Our approach yields a 32% absolute improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline relying on partial point cloud data.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) rely on massive amounts of sensed data to train their underlying\tmachine-learned components. Common sensor hardware migrations can render an existing machine-learned pipeline inadequate. This necessitates the development of bespoke transformations to adapt new sensor data to the old learned model, or the retraining of a new model with new sensor data. These solutions are expensive, often performed reactively to sensor hardware migration, and rely on empirical reconstruction and validation metrics only which lack knowledge of the features important to the learned model. To address these challenges, we propose PreFixer, a technique that can systematically generate transformations for many types of sensor hardware migration during the ADS development lifecycle. PreFixer collects small datasets using colocated new and old sensors, and then uses that data and the output of the learned model to train an augmented encoder to learn a transformation that maps new sensor data to old sensor data. The trained encoder can then be deployed as a preprocessor to the old learned model. Our study shows that, for a common set of camera sensor hardware migrations, PreFixer can match or improve the performance of the best-performing baseline technique in terms of distance travelled safely with 10% of the training dataset, and take at most half of the training time."

    "abstract": "Precise identification of dynamic models in robotics is essential to support dynamic simulations, control design, friction compensation, output torque estimation, etc. A longstanding challenge remains in the development and identification of friction models for robotic joints, given the numerous physical phenomena affecting the underlying friction dynamics which result into nonlinear characteristics and hysteresis behaviour in particular. These phenomena proof difficult to be modelled and captured accurately using physical analogies alone. This has motivated researchers to shift from physics-based to data-driven models. Currently, these methods are still limited in their ability to generalize effectively to typical industrial robot deployement, characterized by high- and low-velocity operations and frequent direction reversals. Empirical observations motivate the use of dynamic friction models but these remain particulary challenging to establish. To address the current limitations, we propose to account for unidentified dynamics in the robot joints using latent dynamic states. The friction model may then utilize both the dynamic robot state and additional information encoded in the latent state to evaluate the friction torque. We cast this stochastic and partially unsupervised identification problem as a standard probabilistic representation learning problem. In this work both the friction model and latent state dynamics are parametrized as neural networks and are integrated in the conventional lumped parameter dynamic robot model. The complete dynamics model is directly learned from the noisy encoder measurements in the robot joints. We use the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm to find a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the model parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in terms of open-loop prediction accuracy in comparison with baseline methods, using the Kuka KR6 R700 as a test platform."

This paper proposes a novel semi-online setting that allows for the observation of multiple items and the selection of one for packing, thereby adjusting the packing order without reducing packing efficiency. We do work for solving the semi-online packing problem via reinforcement learning which faces two real-world challenges: (1) a variable and difficult-to-predict number of observed items, and (2) the obstruction of robotic arm movement by already packed items. On the one hand, we design a policy network capable of adapting to variable item quantities. On the other hand, we introduce a guided bottom-up packing reward function to free up space for robotic arm motion. We show that our method outperforms the baselines in terms of space utilization with the condition of observing at least two items. Further experiments demonstrate the functionality of our reward function, which can guide a virtual robot to complete packing tasks."

    "abstract": "Multiple rotation averaging plays a crucial role in computer vision and robotics domains. The conventional optimization-based methods optimize a nonlinear cost function based on certain noise assumptions, while most previous learning-based methods require ground truth labels in the supervised training process. Recognizing the handcrafted noise assumption may not be reasonable in all real-world scenarios, this paper proposes an effective rotation averaging method for mining data patterns in a learning manner while avoiding the requirement of labels. Specifically, we apply deep matrix factorization to directly solve the multiple rotation averaging problem in free linear space. For deep matrix factorization, we design a neural network model, which is explicitly low-rank and symmetric to better suit the background of multiple rotation averaging. Meanwhile, we utilize a spanning tree-based edge filtering to suppress the influence of rotation outliers. What's more, we also adopt a reweighting scheme and dynamic depth selection strategy to further improve the robustness. Our method synthesizes the merit of both optimization-based and learning-based methods. Experimental results on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method."

To bridge the gap, we introduce NeurIT, which employs a Time-Frequency Block-recurrent Transformer (TF-BRT) at its core, combining RNN and Transformer to learn both time-frequency representative features. To fully utilize IMU information, we strategically employ differentiation of body-frame magnetometers for orientation calibration in a sensor fusion manner. Experiments conducted in diverse environments show that NeurIT maintains a mere 1-meter tracking error over a 300-meter distance, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by 48.21% on unseen data. NeurIT also performs comparably to the visual-inertial approach (Tango Phone) in vision-favored conditions and surpasses it in plain environments.

However, there is a significant safety concern for future image-based BEV autonomous driving in low-light conditions (such as nighttime) while the limited research on BEV detectors for these scenes. In this paper, we attempt to enhance low-light BEV perception with illumination-guided feature fusion. We propose Retinex-BEVFormer, which uses illumination information generated by the Retinex theory to enhance the model's robustness to varying lighting conditions and improve detection performance in low-light scenes. Additionally, to address the illumination estimation discontinuity from multi-view images that can adversely affect detection, we propose the MVB-Retinex module, which balances illumination estimation by leveraging overlapping regions between adjacent images. Notably, our proposed method is a plug-and-play module that can be applied to any image-based BEV detector method and does not require any additional ground truth supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on the Nuscenes dataset, validating our algorithm in nighttime and daytime scenes. Compared to the baseline, our algorithm achieves a 2.9% increase in mAP on the validation set with minimal computational cost, especially showing a 3.6% improvement in nighttime scene. The experiments demonstrate that our Retinex-BEVFormer effectively improves detection performance in low-light conditions and enhances performance under normal illumination, indicating increased robustness of the BEV detector."

    "abstract": "Reactive collision avoidance is essential for agile robots navigating complex and dynamic environments, enabling real-time obstacle response. However, this task is inherently challenging because it requires a tight integration of perception, planning, and control, which traditional methods often handle separately, resulting in compounded errors and delays. This paper introduces a novel approach that unifies these tasks into a single reactive framework using solely onboard sensing and computing. Our method combines nonlinear model predictive control with adaptive control barrier functions, directly linking perception-driven constraints to real-time planning and control. Constraints are determined by using a neural network to refine noisy RGB-D data, enhancing depth accuracy, and selecting points with the minimum time-to-collision to prioritize the most immediate threats. To maintain a balance between safety and agility, a heuristic dynamically adjusts the optimization process, preventing overconstraints in real time. Extensive experiments with an agile quadrotor demonstrate effective collision avoidance across diverse indoor and outdoor environments, without requiring environment-specific tuning or explicit mapping."

For robot link meshes totaling 24k triangles and obstacle meshes of over 190k triangles, our methods were up to 2.8 times faster in batched discrete-pose queries than a state-of-the-art GPU-based method using a sphere robot representation. For the same obstacle mesh scene, our sphere-robot continuous collision detection was up to 7 times faster depending on trajectory batch size.

Optimization-based planners can tackle confined space trajectory planning while being cognizant of robot and (mostly static) obstacle constraints. However, handling moving obstacles is non-trivial in a real-time setting. To this end, we present the FLIQC (Fast LInear Quadratic Complementarity based) motion planner. Our reactive planner employs a novel motion model that captures the entire rigid robot as well as the obstacle geometry and ensures non- penetration between the surfaces due to the imposed constraint. We perform thorough comparative studies with the state-of- the-art, which demonstrate improved performance. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments validate our claim of generating continuous and real-time motion plans at 1 kHz for modern collaborative robots with constant minimal parameters."

    "abstract": "Achieving rapid and accurate dynamic obstacle avoidance is crucial for enhancing the survivability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in hazardous conditions. To accomplish dynamic obstacle avoidance, sensors with high temporal resolution and efficient processing models are required. Dynamic vision sensors (DVS) fulfill the sensing requirements, while spiking neural networks (SNNs) address the processing demands. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end obstacle avoidance algorithm for UAVs using only a single monocular DVS as the sensor and further enhance accuracy and speed through our proposed mechanisms. The algorithm consists of three components: ego-motion compensation, an SNN model for movement analysis, and a force filter inspired by spiking neurons. In movement analysis, we propose the temporal potential pooling (TPP) and incremental event (EI) mechanisms to accelerate our SNN model. The real-flight experiments confirm that our algorithm achieves approximately 90% accuracy with a processing latency as low as 4ms on a GPU, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies show that the proposed method maintains high accuracy in movement detection while significantly reducing computational time. Our method operates in real-time, achieves high accuracy, and is feasible across a wide range of environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/AmperiaWang/oanet_s1 for reproducibility."

However, updating neural SDFs as the scene evolves entails re-training, which is tedious, time consuming, and inefficient, making it unsuitable for robot navigation with limited field-of-view in dynamic environments. Towards this objective, we propose a compositional framework of neural SDFs to solve robot navigation in indoor environments using only an onboard RGB-D sensor. Our framework embodies a dual mode procedure for trajectory optimization, with different modes using complementary methods of modeling collision costs and collision avoidance gradients. The primary stage queries the robot body's SDF, swept along the route to goal, at the obstacle point cloud, enabling swift local optimization of trajectories. The secondary stage infers the visible scene's SDF by aligning and composing the SDF representations of its constituents, providing better informed costs and gradients for trajectory optimization. The dual mode procedure combines the best of both stages, achieving a success rate of 98%, 14.4% higher than baseline with comparable amortized plan time on iGibson 2.0. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in adapting to real-world indoor scenarios."

The problem is multifaceted, with multiple definitions arising in the vast recent literature fitting different application scenarios and leading to different computational approaches. A basic element shared by most frameworks is the definition and evaluation of the probability of collision for a mobile object in an environment with obstacles. We observe that, even in basic cases, different interpretations are possible. This paper proposes an index we call Risk Density, which offers a theoretical link between conceptually distant assumptions about the interplay of single collision events along a continuous path. We show how this index can be used to approximate the collision probability in the case where the robot evolves along a nominal continuous curve from random initial conditions. Indeed under this hypothesis the proposed approximation outperforms some well-established methods either in accuracy or computational cost."

To address the limitations of the current symbolic (slow speed) or LLM-based approaches (low accuracy), we propose a novel neuro-symbolic task planner that decomposes complex tasks into subgoals using LLM and carries out task planning for each subgoal using either symbolic or MCTS-based LLM planners, depending on the subgoal complexity. This decomposition reduces planning time and improves success rates by narrowing the search space and enabling LLMs to focus on more manageable tasks. Our method significantly reduces planning time while maintaining high success rates across task planning domains, as well as real-world and simulated robotics environments.

The theorem implicates that providing replicated resources with uncorrelated failures exponentially reduces the probability of missing a deadline. We present FogROS2-Probabilistic Latency Reliability (RLR) that uses multiple independent network interfaces to send requests to replicated cloud resources and uses the first response back. We design routing mechanisms to discover, connect, and route through non-default network interfaces on robots. FogROS2-PLR optimizes the selection of interfaces to servers by minimizing the probability of missing a deadline. We conduct a cloud-connected driving experiment with two 5G service providers, demonstrating FogROS2-PLR effectively provides smooth service quality even if one of the service providers experiences low coverage and base station handover. We use 99 Percentile (P99) latency to evaluate anomalous long-tail latency behavior. In the experiment, FogROS2-PLR improves P99 latency by up to 3.7x compared to using one service provider. We deploy FogROS2-PLR on a physical Stretch 3 robot with an indoor human-tracking task. Even in a fully covered Wi-Fi and 5G environment, FogROS2-PLR improves the responsiveness of the robot by reducing 36% of mean latency and 33% P99 latency.

    "abstract": "A modern smart factory runs a manufacturing procedure using a collection of programmable machines. Typically, materials are ferried between these machines using a team of mobile robots. To embed a manufacturing procedure in a smart factory, a factory operator must a) assign its processes to the smart factory's machines and b) determine how agents should carry materials between machines. A good embedding maximizes the smart factory's throughput; the rate at which it outputs products. Existing smart factory management systems solve the aforementioned problems sequentially, limiting the throughput that they can achieve. In this paper we introduce ACES, the Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver, the first solver which jointly optimizes the assignment of processes to machines and the assignment of paths to agents. We evaluate ACES and show that it can scale to real industrial scenarios."

The proposed control scheme is based on the notion of admittance control, and incorporates a variable damping term aiming towards increasing the controllability of the human and, at the same time, decreasing her/his effort. Furthermore, to ensure that the object is not detached from the suction cup during the collaboration, an additional control signal is proposed, which is based on a barrier artificial potential.

    "abstract": "In physical Human-Robot Collaboration (pHRC), accurate human intent estimation and rational human-robot role allocation are crucial for safe and efficient assistance. Existing methods that rely on short-term motion data for intention estimation lack multi-step prediction capabilities, hindering their ability to sense intent changes and adjust human-robot assignments autonomously, resulting in potential discrepancies. To address these issues, we propose a Dual Transformer-based Robot Trajectron (DTRT) featuring a hierarchical architecture, which harnesses human-guided motion and force data to rapidly capture human intent changes, enabling accurate trajectory predictions and dynamic robot behavior adjustments for effective collaboration. Specifically, human intent estimation in DTRT uses two Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), incorporating robot motion data in obstacle-free case with human-guided trajectory and force for obstacle avoidance. Additionally, Differential Cooperative Game Theory (DCGT) is employed to synthesize predictions based on human-applied forces, ensuring robot behavior align with human intention. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, DTRT incorporates human dynamics into long-term prediction, providing an accurate understanding of intention and enabling rational role allocation, achieving robot autonomy and maneuverability. Experiments demonstrate DTRT's accurate intent estimation and superior collaboration performance."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel learning-based approach to dynamic robot-to-human handover, addressing the challenges of delivering objects to a moving receiver. We hypothesize that dynamic handover, where the robot adjusts to the receiver’s movements, results in more efficient and comfortable interaction compared to static handover, where the receiver is assumed to be stationary. To validate this, we developed a nonparametric method for generating continuous handover motion, conditioned on the receiver's movements, and trained the model using a dataset of 1,000 human-to-human handover demonstrations. We integrated preference learning for improved handover effectiveness and applied impedance control to ensure user safety and adaptiveness. The approach was evaluated in both simulation and real-world settings, with user studies demonstrating that dynamic handover significantly reduces handover time and improves user comfort compared to static methods.

    "abstract": "Learning by demonstration techniques are gaining popularity within the human-robot collaboration (HRC) scenarios. This is because they allow to deeply exploit the versatility of collaborative robots. In this context, dynamic motion primitives (DMPs) have become a standard method for enabling human operators to easily teach tasks to robots. However, DMPs have two main limitations. First, they may encounter difficulties in generalizing some tasks, which can lead to non-intuitive behavior. Second, it is not guaranteed that the output of DMPs is compliant with ISO/TS 15066, which provides guidelines for assessing safety in collaborative scenarios. This work aims to address these two issues by introducing a novel control pipeline. This pipeline leverages a new variant of DMPs, called Swap DMPs (SDMPs), introduced in this work. The SDMPs enable a more intuitive behavior when the robot reproduces the learned task. Subsequently, SDMPs are encoded into a new optimization problem that ensures the robot complies with the Speed and Separation Monitoring (SSM) collaborative mode. The proposed approach has been experimentally validated and compared with traditional DMPs in both simulation and a real scenario, where a UR5e and a human operator collaborate on a polishing task."

This issue is further amplified when these objects are hand-held, as hand occlusions further complicate depth estimation. For assistant robots, however, accurately perceiving hand-held transparent objects is critical to effective human-robot interaction. This paper presents a Hand-Aware Depth Restoration (HADR) method based on creating an implicit neural representation function from a single RGB-D image. The proposed method utilizes hand posture as an important guidance to leverage semantic and geometric information of hand-object interaction. To train and evaluate the proposed method, we create a high-fidelity synthetic dataset named TransHand-14K with a real-to-sim data generation scheme. Experiments show that our method has better performance and generalization ability compared with existing methods. We further develop a real-world human-to-robot handover system based on HADR, demonstrating its potential in human-robot interaction applications."

    "abstract": "Human-robot interaction (HRI) encompasses a wide range of collaborative tasks, with handover being one of the most fundamental. As robots become more integrated into human environments, the potential for service robots to assist in handing objects to humans is increasingly promising. In robot-to-human (R2H) handover, selecting the optimal grasp is crucial for success, as it requires avoiding interference with the human's preferred grasp region and minimizing intrusion into their workspace. Existing methods either inadequately consider geometric information or rely on data-driven approaches, which often struggle to generalize across diverse objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot system that combines semantic and geometric information to generate optimal handover grasps. Our method first identifies grasp regions using semantic knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs) and, by incorporating customized visual prompts, achieves finer granularity in region grounding. A grasp is then selected based on grasp distance and approach angle to maximize human ease and avoid interference. We validate our approach through ablation studies and real-world comparison experiments. Results demonstrate that our system improves handover success rates and provides a more user-preferred interaction experience.

Through hand detection and segmentation, the hand region is masked and removed from the acquired depth image, which is used to estimate the object pose for grasping. For grasp pose determination, we propose to add the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to the Generative Grasping Convolutional Neural Network (GGCNN) model to enhance the recognition rate. For the object-grasp task, the AMR localizes the object in person’s hand, and uses the Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based controller to simultaneously control the mobile base and manipulator to grasp the object. A laboratory-developed mobile manipulator, equipped with a 6-DoF TM5M-900 is used for experimental verification.

However, efficient human-robot cooperation requires natural, accurate and reliable intention recognition in shared environments. The current paramount challenge for this is reducing the uncertainty of multimodal fused intention to be recognized and reasoning adaptively a more reliable result despite current interactive condition. In this work we propose a novel learning-based multimodal fusion framework Batch Multimodal Confidence Learning for Opinion Pool (BMCLOP). Our approach combines Bayesian multimodal fusion method and batch confidence learning algorithm to improve accuracy, uncertainty reduction and success rate given the interactive condition. In particular, the generic and practical multimodal intention recognition framework can be easily extended further. Our desired assistive scenarios consider three modalities gestures, speech and gaze, all of which produce categorical distributions over all the finite intentions.

This work can thus be seen as a follow-up to the work with a motion presented as dynamic movement primitive (DMP) that now considers collaborative tasks and the existence of multiple robots/manipulators. Specifically, we start with a simple task using one DMP and extend it to accommodate the coordinated execution of multiple DMPs in robots with multiple manipulators or---alternatively---multiple robots with a single manipulator. We investigate mechanisms to jointly optimize multiple DMPs to perform one task in a coordinated fashion. The joint trajectory is built from initial DMPs learned for a single manipulator, and its optimization must comply with task-specific constraints. We illustrate the application of our approach both in a simulated environment and in a simulated and real Baxter robot."

This hierarchy enables the generation of a safe reference trajectory that adeptly mitigates conflicts among safety conditions and reduce the risk while controlling the robot toward its destination without additional motion planning methods. In addition, robust bipedal locomotion is achieved by utilizing the Hybrid Linear Inverted Pendulum model, coupled with a disturbance observer addressing a disturbance from the physical interaction."

We first highlight vulnerabilities in scheduling strategies based on time and path costs. Exploiting these weaknesses, an infiltrated agent clandestinely gathers motion characteristics of other agents while posing as a teammate. Using these motion characteristics, the infiltrated agent employs an LSTM architecture to learn and predict congestion areas, thereby designing attack paths with greater time efficiency. This approach allows the infiltrated agent to secure additional resources and evade capture more effectively. Validation through simulation and real-world experiments demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, underscoring the importance of evaluating covert attacks in risk assessments within multi-agent systems."

More than just mere coexistence in the same space, they actively collaborate on shared tasks, thus raising the stakes in terms of safety. The dynamic behavior of robots must be synchronized with the anticipated and unexpected human actions, adding another layer of complexity to the safety considerations. It is essential to conduct comprehensive safety analyses that identify potential risks that pose harm to the human operator. As a proactive measure to foster early-stage safety and risk analysis, we propose the use of goal models.

Teleoperation, one of major applications in robotics, involves a leader manipulator operated by a human and a follower manipulator at a remote site, connected via a communication channel. While this setup enables operation in challenging environments, it also introduces cybersecurity risks, particularly in the communication link. The paper focuses on a specific class of cyberattacks: perfectly undetectable FDIAs, where attackers alter signals without leaving detectable traces at all. Compared to previous research on linear and first-order nonlinear systems, this paper examines bilateral teleoperation systems with second-order nonlinear manipulator dynamics. The paper derives mathematical conditions based on Lie Group theory that enable such attacks, demonstrating how an attacker can modify the follower manipulator's motion while the operator perceives normal operation through the leader device. This vulnerability challenges conventional detection methods based on observable changes and highlights the need for advanced security measures in teleoperation systems.

The proposed mechanism features fingers with three phalanges, each incorporating four-bar and eight-bar linkages arranged in parallel. These linkages perform crucial functions, including maintaining the grip angle and ensuring passive characteristics during pinch grips. Previous grippers with passive mechanisms and three-phalanx fingers faced issues with gripping instability, particularly when changes in the passive joint angle were caused by object inertia or external lateral forces. To address this problem, we propose a new passive-locking mechanism utilizing an eight-bar linkage. This innovative design is engineered to adapt to environmental conditions, establish a secure grip, and maintain the grip angle of the passive joint after the grip is achieved. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed mechanism, this paper conducts a fingertip force vector analysis and a mobility analysis according to the pinch sequence. It also details the derivation process and principles of the mechanism. The gripper’s operational range and gripping force are examined through kinematic analysis and verified by simulation. Furthermore, the study shows that the proposed mechanism effectively responds to environmental constraints, even in environments with obstacles surrounding the object. Comparative experiments with and without a contact bar indicate that the proposed gripper can stably secure an object in scenarios involving swing motions and external forces of approximately 5N."

    "abstract": "There are many ways for a gripper to estimate the forces between its fingers. If powered by direct-drive brushless motors, then one technique is to measure their current. This is not the most accurate technique, but it is simple, keeps the sensor remote, and requires no new components. The estimation involves multiplying current signals through by the torque constant and the inverse transpose of the Jacobian. The Jacobian either amplifies the signal from fingertip force to motor current (at the cost of tip force production), or diminishes it (with the gain of tip force production), indicating an inherent trade-off. However, the Jacobian is a function of configuration, and for any workspace point there are multiple configurations (multiple inverse kinematics solutions), therefore a selection of Jacobian exists. For a given workspace point, the number of Jacobian choices is just a few, but these choices can be designed (through dimensional synthesis) to overcome the trade-off. The problem can be framed as velocity ellipse synthesis over multiple output modes. In this work, we conduct optimal synthesis to compute a new gripper design. The gripper was built and tested. It transitions between two different modes: sense mode and grip mode. Sense mode can sense forces 3 times smaller than grip mode. Grip mode can exert forces 4 times greater than sense mode."

    "paper_url": "",
    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel robotic gripper that can expand workable spaces in a target environment to pick up objects from confined spaces. The proposed gripper is most effective for retrieving objects from deformable environments, such as taking an object out of a drawstring bag, or for extracting target objects located behind surrounding objects. The proposed gripper achieves both work-space expansion and grasping motion by using only a single motor. The gripper is equipped with four outer fingers for expanding the environment and two inner fingers for grasping an object. The inner and outer fingers move in different directions for their respective functions of grasping and spatial expansion. To realize two different movements of the fingers, a novel self-motion switching mechanism that switches between the functions as feed-screw and rack-and-pinion mechanisms is developed. The mechanism switches the motions according to the magnitude of the force applied to the inner fingers. This paper presents the mechanism design of the developed gripper, including the self-motion switching mechanism and the actuation strategy for expanding the workable space. The mechanical analysis is also presented, and the analysis result is validated experimentally. Moreover, an automatic object-picking system using the developed gripper is constructed to evaluate the gripper."

While deep learning models are increasingly used for this purpose, they require extensive annotated training data which is impractical to obtain in real-world healthcare settings. To bridge this gap, we present Syn-Mediverse, the first hyper-realistic multimodal synthetic dataset of diverse healthcare facilities.

We demonstrate the complexity of our dataset by evaluating the performance on a broad range of state- of-the-art baselines for each task.

To bridge this gap, we present the MBE-ARI (Multimodal Bidirectional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction), a novel multimodal dataset that captures detailed interactions between a legged robot and cows. The dataset includes synchronized RGB-D streams from multiple viewpoints, annotated with body pose and activity labels across interaction phases, offering an unprecedented level of detail for ARI research. Additionally, we introduce a full-body pose estimation model tailored for quadruped animals, capable of tracking 39 keypoints with a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.7%, outperforming existing benchmarks in animal pose estimation. The MBE-ARI dataset and our pose estimation framework lay a robust foundation for advancing research in animal-robot interaction, providing essential tools for developing perception, reasoning, and interaction frameworks needed for effective collaboration between robots and animals.

Some tasks require recognizing objects far from the robot's camera. A challenging example is Ultra-Range Gesture Recognition (URGR) in human-robot interaction where the user exhibits directive gestures at a distance of up to 25~m from the robot. However, training a model to recognize hardly visible objects located in ultra-range requires an exhaustive collection of a significant amount of labeled samples. The generation of synthetic training datasets is a recent solution to the lack of real-world data, while unable to properly replicate the realistic visual characteristics of distant objects in images. In this letter, we propose the Diffusion in Ultra-Range (DUR) framework based on a Diffusion model to generate labeled images of distant objects in various scenes. The DUR generator receives a desired distance and class (e.g., gesture) and outputs a corresponding synthetic image. We apply DUR to train a URGR model with directive gestures in which fine details of the gesturing hand are challenging to distinguish. DUR is compared to other types of generative models showcasing superiority both in fidelity and in recognition success rate when training a URGR model. More importantly, training a DUR model on a limited amount of real data and then using it to generate synthetic data for training a URGR model outperforms directly training the URGR model on real data. The synthetic-based URGR model is also demonstrated in gesture-based direction of a ground robot."

    "abstract": "Research on interactive force measurement in robotics follows two trends: distributed force sensing using soft tactile sensors and centered force sensing using rigid sensors. This study proposes a novel force sensing mechanism and algorithm to integrate the two approaches taking advantage of a soft tactile sensor and rigid actuator based on spring. Soft tactile sensors allow for gentle contact with humans, but have limited recovery and measurable force range. The rigidity of a spring-based actuator is utilized to address their force estimation issues. This allows for estimating a wider range of forces while maintaining the softness. The paper presents a novel approach for integrating two sensors using sophisticated algorithms. Specifically, a deep neural network is developed to estimate the contact location through the tactile sensor. Subsequently, a state-space observer is proposed based on the dynamic characteristics of the robot link, which integrates the network output and the torque measurements obtained from a spring-based actuator. This algorithm provides accurate force estimation during dynamic behavior and enables a wide measurable force range across the entire area of the robot link. The efficacy of the proposed mechanism and algorithm is validated through rigorous experimentation, demonstrating the fast recovery characteristics and accuracy."

However, existing algorithms for processing raw sensor inputs to useful intermediate signals such as contact patches struggle in high-deformation regimes. This is due to physical constraints imposed by sensor hardware and small-deformation assumptions used by mechanics-based models. In this work, we propose a fusion algorithm for proximity and visuotactile point clouds for contact patch segmentation, entirely independent from membrane mechanics. This algorithm exploits the synchronous, high spatial resolution proximity and visuotactile modalities enabled by an extremely deformable, selectively transmissive soft membrane, which uses visible light for visuotactile sensing and infrared light for proximity depth. We evaluate our contact patch algorithm in low (10%), medium (60%), and high (100%+) strain states. We compare our method against three baselines: proximity-only, tactile-only, and a first principles mechanics model. Our approach outperforms all baselines with an average RMSE under 2.8 mm of the contact patch geometry across all strain ranges. We demonstrate our contact patch algorithm in four applications: varied stiffness membranes, torque and shear-induced wrinkling, closed loop control, and pose estimation."

    "abstract": "Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) has emerged as a promising technology for large-area robotic skin due to its ability to reconstruct pressure distribution over extensive regions using a few sparsely distributed electrodes. Despite ERT’s potential to reconstruct the external forces applied on 3D surfaces, the uneven distribution of spatial sensitivity leads to significant errors in identifying the physical quantities of contacts, inhibiting this technique from being an effective tactile sensor. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to equalize the spatial sensitivity by modulating the conductivity of ERT sensors through topology optimization. In a simulation environment, the sensor's conductive domain was converted into a binary image and optimized to equalize spatial sensitivity and reduce disparities between low and high-sensitivity areas. Additionally, we present a sensor fabrication method with a complex optimized conductive patch pattern from simulation by applying screen printing techniques. The effectiveness of the implemented spatial sensitivity equalization was validated by comparing it to a conventional ERT sensor in both simulations and real-world environments. The proposed sensitivity optimization method expands the use of ERT-based sensors for distributed tactile sensing in physical human-robot interaction scenarios."

The soft finger, designed for applications in soft robotic grippers or hands, is viewed in isolation under pneumatic actuation controlled by motorized linear stages. The research first characterizes the soft finger's workspace and sensor response. Subsequently, three dynamic state estimators are developed using NARX architecture, differing in the degree of incorporating the optical waveguide sensor response. Evaluation on a testing path reveals that the full sensor response significantly improves end effector position estimation, reducing mean error by 51% from 5.70 mm to 2.80 mm, compared to only 21% improvement to 4.53 mm using the estimator representing a single core waveguide design.

The vast search-space includes the physical design-space and the controller parameter-space, making it a challenging problem in machine learning and optimisation in general. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown promising results in generating robot designs via gradient-free optimisation. Morpho-evolution with learning (MEL) uses EAs to concurrently generate robot designs and learn the optimal parameters of the controllers. Two main issues prevent MEL from scaling to higher complexity tasks: i) computational cost and ii) premature convergence to sub-optimal designs. To address these issues, we propose combining morpho-evolution with intrinsic motivations. Intrinsically motivated behaviour arises from embodiment and simple learning rules without external guidance. We use a homeokinetic controller that generates exploratory behaviour in a few seconds with minimal knowledge of the robot’s design. Homeokinesis replaces costly learning phases, reducing computational time and favouring diversity, preventing premature convergence. We compare our approach with current MEL methods in several downstream tasks. The generated designs score higher in all the tasks, are more diverse, and are quickly generated compared to morpho-evolution with static parameters.

However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits.

This hybrid approach leverages the reliability and interpretability of PP while using RL to fine-tune the controller's performance in real-world scenarios. Extensive testing on the F1TENTH platform demonstrates that RLPP improves lap times of the baseline controllers by up to 6.37%, closing the gap to the SotA methods by more than 52% and providing reliable performance in zero-shot real-world deployment, overcoming key challenges associated with the sim-to-real transfer and reducing the performance gap from simulation to reality by more than 8-fold when compared to the baseline RL controller.

    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "Ensuring the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is critical. Effective risk assessment helps AVs make decisions and avoid risks. However, existing methods face challenges due to environmental uncertainties, insufficient multi-dimensional risk quantification, and limited predictive accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose an uncertainty-aware probabilistic risk assessment framework that quantifies the risk of AVs violating safety constraints and calculates the expected average severity of such violations in uncertain environments. We first establish a general SOTIF risk model to characterize the static risk of the AV and surrounding traffic participants. Following this, we introduce a method for predicting dynamic uncertainty risks, resulting in probabilistic risk quantification. This framework accounts for multi-dimensional uncertainties and enhances safety under dynamic conditions. Extensive evaluations across typical traffic scenarios—including highways, intersections, and roundabouts—demonstrate that our method outperforms typical algorithms like Time Headway (THW) and Time-to-Collision (TTC). Empirical studies in extreme scenarios further validate the framework's ability to reduce risks and improve system generalization.

    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "Non-cooperative interactions commonly occur in multi-agent scenarios such as car racing, where an ego vehicle can choose to overtake the rival, or stay behind it until a safe overtaking “corridor” opens. While an expert human can do well at making such time-sensitive decisions, autonomous agents are incapable of rapidly reasoning about complex, potentially conflicting options, leading to suboptimal behaviors such as deadlocks. Recently, the nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) model has proven to exhibit fast opinion formation and avoidance of decision deadlocks. However, NOD modeling parameters are oftentimes assumed fixed, limiting their applicability in complex and dynamic environments. It remains an open challenge to determine such parameters automatically and adaptively, accounting for the ever-changing environment. In this work, we propose for the first time a learning-based and game-theoretic approach to synthesize a Neural NOD model from expert demonstrations, given as a dataset containing (possibly incomplete) state and action trajectories of interacting agents. We demonstrate Neural NOD’s ability to make fast and deadlock-free decisions in a simulated autonomous racing example. We find that Neural NOD consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art data-driven inverse game baseline in terms of safety and overtaking performance."

    "abstract": "Risk-bounded motion planning in dynamic environments for autonomous driving presents complex challenges, particularly in solving the nonconvex problem of ensuring continuous, safe, and real-time navigation towards a destination. This paper introduces an online graph-based local planning approach constrained by a user-defined driving style in terms of a risk budget Delta for the entire mission. Our online approach assigns a risk bound to each motion planning decision, ensuring that the total risk consumed remains within Delta. First, we construct a spatial lattice graph that adheres to the vehicle's curvature constraints. Then, the trajectory planning problem is reformulated as an online optimization problem, where decisions must be made sequentially without prior knowledge of future events. Therefore, we propose a reduction to the problem to be online multiple-choice knapsack problem (ON-MCKP), where the knapsack items are candidate paths generated by solving constrained shortest-path problems. To solve the ON-MCKP, we deploy online algorithms that offer theoretical guarantees on the risk allocation throughout the entire mission. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated empirically, showing significant improvements in the objective without violating safety constraints."

    "abstract": "Recent innovations in autonomous drones have facilitated time-optimal flight in single-drone configurations, and enhanced maneuverability in multi-drone systems by applying optimal control and learning-based methods. However, few studies have achieved time-optimal motion planning for multi-drone systems, particularly during highly agile maneuvers or in dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a decentralized policy network using multi-agent reinforcement learning for time-optimal multi-drone flight. To strike a balance between flight efficiency and collision avoidance, we introduce a soft collision-free mechanism inspired by optimization-based methods. By customizing PPO in a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) fashion, we unlock higher efficiency and stability in training while ensuring lightweight implementation. Extensive simulations show that, despite slight performance trade-offs compared to single-drone systems, our multi-drone approach maintains near-time-optimal performance with a low collision rate. Real-world experiments validate our method, with two quadrotors using the same network as in simulation achieving a maximum speed of 13.65 m/s and a maximum body rate of 13.4 rad/s in a 5.5 m × 5.5 m × 2.0 m space across various tracks, relying entirely on onboard computation."

    "abstract": "Autonomous racing confronts significant challenges in safely overtaking Opponent Vehicles (OVs) that exhibit uncertain trajectories, stemming from unknown driving policies. To address these challenges, this study proposes heterogeneous kernel metrics for Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), designed to robustly capture the diverse driving policies of OVs, and carry out precise trajectory predictions along with the associated uncertainties. A key virtue of the proposed kernel metrics lies in their ability to align similar driving policies and disjoin dissimilar ones in an unsupervised manner, given the observed interactions between the Ego Vehicle (EV) and OVs. The efficacy of the proposed method is substantiated through experimental studies on a 1/10th scale racecar platform, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and thereby safely overtaking against OVs. Furthermore, our method is computationally efficient for onboard computing units, affirming its viability in fast-paced racing environments."

These methods inherently rely on observations from sensors such as lidars and cameras to identify agents participating in the game and, therefore, have difficulty when some agents are occluded. To address this limitation, this paper presents an occlusion-aware game-theoretic inference method to estimate the locations of potentially occluded agents, and simultaneously infer the intentions of both visible and occluded agents, which best accounts for the observations of visible agents. Additionally, we propose a receding horizon planning strategy based on an occlusion-aware contingency game designed to navigate in scenarios with potentially occluded agents. Monte Carlo simulations validate our approach, demonstrating that it accurately estimates the game model and trajectories for both visible and occluded agents using noisy observations of visible agents. Our planning pipeline significantly enhances navigation safety when compared to occlusion-ignorant baseline as well."

Our method comprises a multi-component learning strategy to disentangle visual components, followed by subsequent generation editing procedures. Disentangled text-to-component pairs, revealing intrinsic logical constraints, conduct attention-guided residual mapping and model training with iteratively matched references across multiple scales. Experiments on the MVTecLOCO dataset confirm the efficacy of ComGEN, achieving the best AUROC score of 91.2%.

This work presents FA-ProDMP, a novel approach that introduces force awareness to Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMP). FA-ProDMP adapts trajectories during runtime to account for measured and desired forces, offering smooth trajectories and capturing position and force correlations across multiple demonstrations. FA-ProDMPs support multiple axes of force, making them agnostic to Cartesian or joint space control. This versatility makes FA-ProDMP a valuable tool for learning contact rich manipulation tasks, such power plug insertion. To reliably evaluate FA-ProDMP, this work additionally introduces a modular, 3D printed task suite called POEMPEL, inspired by the popular Lego Technic pins. POEMPEL mimics industrial peg-in-hole assembly tasks with force requirements and offers multiple parameters of adjustment, such as position, orientation and plug stiffness level, thereby varying the direction and amount of required forces. Our experiments demonstrate that FA-ProDMP outperforms other MP formulations on the POEMPEL setup and a electrical power plug insertion task, thanks to its replanning capabilities based on measured forces. These findings highlight how FA-ProDMP enhances the performance of robotic systems in contact-rich manipulation tasks."

Despite their strong performance across various robotic tasks, even for zero-shot scenarios, most VLM applications remain open-loop, adhering to a plan-and-execute paradigm without mechanisms to assess task completion. To address this limitation, we propose GenCo, a Generate-Correct framework designed to automate a peg-in-hole task using a UR5e robot. This framework integrates an VLM-based motion generator and motion expert, working collaboratively to refine and correct actions during robotic task execution. Both VLM agents are fine-tuned using the pre-trained LLaVA, enhancing adaptability and scaling efficiently to diverse tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the adaptiveness of the framework, improving the success rate for the peg-in-hole task by 12.75% compared to a single VLM open-loop method. Notably, in unseen scenarios, the success rate for a triangular peg was increased by 15%, and for a random-shaped peg by 17%, underscoring the system's effectiveness in handling novel tasks. Adaptive testing under varied camera positions demonstrated robust performance, affirming reliability despite shifts in the visual input. The framework is also designed to be lightweight and efficient, facilitating broader adoption and practical deployment.

However, it demands considerable effort, including the manual construction of simulation environments, the careful design of tasks, and the challenge of obtaining effective trajectories. These limitations hinder the efficiency of data collection from simulated scenarios. In this paper, we leverage the prior knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to generate simulated scenarios and embodied tasks. We introduce a novel framework, ASCENT (Autonomous Skill learning toward Complex Embodied tasks with fouNdaTion models), designed to efficiently accomplish these tasks and generate trajectory data. ASCENT features a fully autonomous skill learning mechanism based on AI agent. During task training, the AI agent identifies suitable atomic skills from an atomic skill library to either directly complete the task or serve as an initial policy for further training. Newly acquired atomic skills are subsequently added to the library. To address training failures and enhance efficiency, the AI agent uses an LLM to automatically optimize the skill training process based on feedback received from simulations. Experimental results indicate that the number of training steps required for learning new tasks can be reduced by up to 65.9%."

This task is challenging because inserting such sensors requires subcentimeter precision in an environment which contains high levels of clutter, lighting variation, and occlusion. To address these challenges, we develop a robust perception-action pipeline to grasp stalks, and create a custom robot gripper which mechanically aligns the sensor before inserting it into the stalk. Through experimental validation on 48 unique stalks in a cornfield in Iowa, we demonstrate our platform’s capability of detecting a stalk with 94% success, grasping a stalk with 90% success, and inserting a sensor with 60% success.

    "abstract": "As the world population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, our agricultural production system needs to double its productivity despite a decline of human workforce in the agricultural sector. Autonomous robotic systems are one promising pathway to increase productivity by taking over labor-intensive manual tasks like fruit picking. To be effective, such systems need to monitor and interact with plants and fruits precisely, which is challenging due to the cluttered nature of agricultural environments causing, for example, strong occlusions. Thus, being able to estimate the complete 3D shapes of objects in presence of occlusions is crucial for automating operations such as fruit harvesting. In this paper, we propose the first publicly available 3D shape completion dataset for agricultural vision systems. We provide an RGB-D dataset for estimating the 3D shape of fruits. Specifically, our dataset contains RGB-D frames of single sweet peppers in lab conditions but also in a commercial greenhouse. For each fruit, we additionally collected high-precision point clouds that we use as ground truth. For acquiring the ground truth shape, we developed a measuring process that allows us to record data of real sweet pepper plants, both in the lab and in the greenhouse with high precision, and determine the shape of the sensed fruits. We release our dataset, consisting of almost 7,000 RGB-D frames belonging to more than 100 different fruits. We provide segmented RGB-D frames, with camera intrinsics to easily obtain colored point clouds, together with the corresponding high-precision, occlusion-free point clouds obtained with a high-precision laser scanner.

Agricultural robots are transforming modern farming by enabling precise and efficient operations, replacing humans in arduous tasks while reducing the use of chemicals. Traditionally, path-following algorithms are designed to guide the vehicle’s center along a predefined trajectory. However, since the actual agronomic task is performed by the implement, it is essential to control a specific point on the tool itself rather than the vehicle’s center. As such, we present in this paper two approaches for achieving the control of an offset point on the robot. The first approach adapts existing control laws, initially intended for the rear axle’s midpoint, to manage the desired lateral deviation. The second approach employs backstepping control techniques to create a control law that directly targets the implement. We conduct real-world experiments, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches for offset point control, and demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods."

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation is crucial for various robotics applications in agriculture. However, many existing methods depend on RTK-GPS devices, which can be susceptible to loss of radio signal or intermittent reception of corrections from the internet. Consequently, research has increasingly focused on using RGB cameras for crop-row detection, though challenges persist when dealing with grown plants. This paper introduces a LiDAR-based navigation system that can achieve crop-agnostic over-canopy autonomous navigation in row-crop fields, even when the canopy fully blocks the inter-row spacing. Our algorithm can detect crop rows across diverse scenarios, encompassing various crop types, growth stages, illumination conditions, the presence of weeds, curved rows, and discontinuities. Without utilizing a global localization method (i.e., based on GPS), our navigation system can perform autonomous navigation in these challenging scenarios, detect the end of the crop rows, and navigate to the next crop row autonomously, providing a crop-agnostic approach to navigate an entire field. The proposed navigation system has undergone tests in various simulated and real agricultural fields, achieving an average cross-track error of 3.55 cm without human intervention. The system has been deployed on a customized UGV robot, which can be reconfigured depending on the field conditions."

For instance, citrus detection has long been of interest to the agricultural research community, yet there is an absence of work, particularly involving public datasets of citrus affected by HLB. To address this issue, we enhance state-of-the-art object detection methods for use in typical orchard settings. Concretely, we provide high-resolution images of citrus trees located in an area known to be highly affected by HLB, along with high-quality bounding box annotations of citrus fruit. Fruit on both the trees and the ground are labeled to allow for identification of fruit location, which contributes to advancements in yield estimation and potential measure of HLB impact via fruit drop. The dataset consists of over 32,000 bounding box annotations for fruit instances contained in 579 high-resolution images. In summary, our contributions are the following: (i) we introduce a novel dataset along with baseline performance benchmarks on multiple contemporary object detection algorithms, (ii) we show the ability to accurately capture fruit location on tree or on ground, and finally (ii) we present a correlation of our results with yield estimations."

CEIE converts scenario data into encoded environmental information (EEI), providing MPT with an insightful understanding of the environment. MPT leverages an attention mechanism to dynamically recalibrate its focus on EEI, task objectives, and historical planning data, refining the sampling node generation. To demonstrate the capabilities of TEMP, we train our model using a dataset consisting of planning results produced by RRT*. CEIE and MPT are collaboratively trained, enabling CEIE to autonomously learn and extract patterns from environmental data, thereby forming informative representations that MPT can more effectively interpret and utilize for motion planning. Subsequently, we systematically evaluate TEMP's efficacy across diverse dimensions and assess it in out-of-distribution real-world scenarios, demonstrating that TEMP achieves exceptional performance metrics and a heightened degree of generalizability compared to state-of-the-art SBMPs."

Our work focuses on a specific aspect of these approaches: using machine-learning techniques, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate whether robot configurations are collision free, an operation termed “collision detection”. Despite the growing popularity of these methods, there is a lack of theory supporting their efficiency and prediction accuracy. This is in stark contrast to the rich theoretical results of machine-learning methods in general and of SVMs in particular. Our work bridges this gap by analyzing the sample complexity of an SVM classifier for learning-based collision detection in motion planning. We bound the number of samples needed to achieve a specified accuracy at a given confidence level. This result is stated in terms relevant to robot motion planning such as the system’s clearance. Building on these theoretical results, we propose a collision-detection algorithm that can also provide statistical guarantees on the algorithm’s error in classifying robot configurations as collision-free or not."

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for efficient and flexible robotic exploration solutions, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is becoming a promising approach in the field of autonomous robotic exploration. However, current RL-based exploration algorithms often face limited environmental reasoning capabilities, slow convergence rates, and substantial challenges in Sim-To-Real (S2R) transfer. To address these issues, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Transformer Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (CTSAC) aimed at improving both exploration efficiency and transfer performance. To enhance the robot's reasoning ability, a Transformer is integrated into the perception network of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, leveraging historical information to improve the farsightedness of the strategy. A periodic review-based curriculum learning is proposed, which enhances training efficiency while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during curriculum transitions. Training is conducted on the ROS-Gazebo continuous robotic simulation platform, with LiDAR clustering optimization to further reduce the S2R gap. Experimental results demonstrate the CTSAC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art non-learning and learning-based algorithms in terms of success rate and success rate-weighted exploration time. Moreover, real-world experiments validate the strong S2R transfer capabilities of CTSAC."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLM) can generate plausible high-level plans when prompted with a goal, the context, an image of the scene, and any planning constraints. However, there is no guarantee that the predicted actions are geometrically and kinematically feasible for a particular robot embodiment. As a result, many prerequisite steps such as opening drawers to access objects are often omitted. Task and motion planners can generate motion trajectories that respect the geometric feasibility of actions and insert physically necessary actions, but do not scale to everyday problems that require common-sense knowledge and involve large state spaces comprised of many variables. We leverage the VLM for 1) system dynamics (i.e. recipe) and 2) search help. We propose VLM-TAMP, a hierarchical planning algorithm that leverages a VLM to generate intermediate subgoals that guide the sampling of a task and motion planner. When a subgoal or action cannot be refined, the VLM is queried again for replanning. We evaluate VLM-TAMP on kitchen tasks where a robot must accomplish cooking goals that require performing 30-50 actions in sequence and interacting with up to 21 objects. We found that VLM-TAMP substantially outperforms baselines that rigidly and independently execute VLM-generated action sequences (success rate 50 to 100% versus 0%, average task completion percentage 72 to 100% versus 15 to 45%).

    "pdf_link": "",
    "abstract": "Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous environments. Traditional planning methods are effective for solving long-horizon tasks but depend on the availability of a graph representation with predefined distance metrics. In contrast, safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) is capable of learning complex behaviors without relying on manual heuristics but fails to solve long-horizon tasks, particularly in goal-conditioned and multi-agent scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that integrates the strengths of both planning and safe RL. Our method leverages goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) and safe RL to learn a goal-conditioned policy for navigation while concurrently estimating cumulative distance and safety levels using learned value functions via an automated self-training algorithm. By constructing a graph with states from the replay buffer, our method prunes unsafe edges and generates a waypoint-based plan that the agent then executes by following those waypoints sequentially until their goal locations are reached. This graph pruning and planning approach via the learned value functions allows our approach to flexibly balance the trade-off between faster and safer routes especially over extended horizons. Utilizing this unified high-level graph and a shared low-level safe GCRL policy, we extend this approach to address the multi-agent safe navigation problem. In particular, we leverage Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to create waypoint-based plans for multiple agents allowing for their safer navigation over extended horizons. This integration enhances the scalability of goal-conditioned safe RL in multi-agent scenarios, enabling efficient coordination among agents. Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in achieving distance goals safely for multiple agents in complex and hazardous environments.

GM-RL consists of two components: the manipulability estimator and the motion planner. The manipulability estimator employs graph neural networks (GNN) to provide action guidelines based on the dynamic manipulability of the transformable robots. The motion planner generates transformation plans using reinforcement learning (RL). The activation ratio alpha adjusts the ratio of the guideline accepted between the two components. In experiments utilizing a 2-DoF transformable wheel called STEP, GM-RL with alpha=0.5 generated an optimal transformation plan with an average dynamic manipulability measure of 0.0424, the highest measure compared to pure dynamic manipulability and reinforcement learning. A real-world experiment demonstrated that the transformation plan is efficient for overcoming stairs."

We evaluate S2I through comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments across six tasks, demonstrating that with only 3 expert demonstrations for reference, S2I can improve the performance of various downstream policies when trained with mixed-quality demonstrations.

    "abstract": "Autonomous robot manipulation is a complex and continuously evolving robotics field. This paper focuses on data augmentation methods in imitation learning. Imitation learning consists of three stages: data collection from experts, learning model, and execution. However, collecting expert data requires manual effort and is time-consuming. Additionally, as sensors have different data acquisition intervals, preprocessing such as downsampling to match the lowest frequency is necessary. Downsampling enables data augmentation and also contributes to the stabilization of robot operations. In light of this background, this paper proposes the Data Augmentation Method for Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning with Images, called \"DABI\". DABI collects robot joint angles, velocities, and torques at 1000 Hz, and uses images from gripper and environmental cameras captured at 100 Hz as the basis for data augmentation. This enables a tenfold increase in data. In this paper, we collected just 5 expert demonstration datasets. We trained the bilateral control Bi-ACT model with the unaltered dataset and two augmentation methods for comparative experiments and conducted real-world experiments. The results confirmed a significant improvement in success rates, thereby proving the effectiveness of DABI. For additional material, please check:https://mertcookimg.github.io/dabi"

Current imitation learning (IL) typically discards imperfect data, focusing solely on successful expert data.

In this work, we aim to conquer the challenge of leveraging imperfect data without the need for reward information to improve the model performance for robotic manipulation in an offline manner. Specifically, we introduce a Self-Supervised Data Filtering framework (SSDF) that combines expert and imperfect data to compute quality scores for failed trajectory segments. High-quality segments from the failed data are used to expand the training dataset. Then, the enhanced dataset can be used with any downstream policy learning method for robotic manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on the ManiSkill2 benchmark built on the high-fidelity Sapien simulator and real-world robotic manipulation tasks using the Franka robot arm demonstrated that the SSDF can accurately expand the training dataset with high-quality imperfect data and improve the success rates for all robotic manipulation tasks."

Unfortunately, data collection is even more challenging here due to the difficulty of simultaneously controlling the two arms and multi-fingered hands. Automated data generation in simulation is a compelling, scalable alternative to fuel this need for training data. To this end, we introduce DexMimicGen, a large-scale automated data generation system that synthesizes trajectories from a handful of human demonstrations for bimanual robots with dexterous hands.

First, end-effector velocities are non-Euclidean and thus hard to model using standard GMMs. We thus propose to factorize the robot's end-effector velocity into its direction and magnitude, and model them using Riemannian GMMs. Second, we leverage the factorized velocities to segment and sequence skills from complex demonstration trajectories. Through the segmentation, we further align skill trajectories and hence leverage time as a powerful inductive bias. Third, we present a method to automatically detect relevant task parameters per skill from visual observations. Our approach enables learning complex manipulation tasks from just five demonstrations while using only RGB-D observations. Extensive experimental evaluations on RLBench demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with 20-fold improved sample efficiency.

However, applying SAM to low-light scenes faces a severe domain shift issue due to the lack of inductive bias in effectively transforming low-light features into natural-light ones. To address this issue, we propose to adapt SAM for low-light scenes. To reduce the reliance on labels of low-light data, we develop a self-training method that makes SAM generate source-free predictions. To reduce the domain gap between low-light target data and SAM's natural-light trained data, we design a transformation head that enhances low-light features prior to the application of SAM.

To improve perception capabilities while maintaining low costs and ensuring performance in adverse weather conditions, 4D radar has emerged as a promising alternative for 3D object detection.

To address these limitations and make use of the unique Doppler velocity information provided by 4D radar, we propose a novel approach called 4DRadDet, which uses cross-attention fusion with cluster-queried techniques for 3D object detection. The 4DRadDet model uses a specially designed incremental clustering method to cluster potential object point clouds, reducing measurement errors from limited radar angular resolution and signal multipath effects. The cross-attention feature fusion (CAFF) module enhances network performance by querying the clustered point cloud feature map, allowing the network to leverage reliable prior information from the clustered point cloud to better detect potential objects. Our experimental evaluations on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of 4DRadDet, showcasing state-of-the-art performance.
