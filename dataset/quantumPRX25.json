    "abstract": "We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed state can display (imTO)—topological order that is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, “gauging out” anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and , which can appear as anomalous surface states of three-dimensional topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or nonmodular topological order. We argue that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of nonmodular braided-fusion categories.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Symmetry in mixed quantum states can manifest in two distinct forms: , where each individual pure state in the quantum ensemble is symmetric with the same charge, and , which applies only to the entire ensemble. This paper explores a novel type of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) where a strong symmetry is broken to a weak one. While the SSB of a weak symmetry is measured by the long-ranged two-point correlation function, the strong-to-weak SSB (SWSSB) is measured by the . We prove that SWSSB is a universal property of mixed-state quantum phases, in the sense that the phenomenon of SWSSB is robust against symmetric low-depth local quantum channels. We also show that the symmetry breaking is “spontaneous” in the sense that the effect of a local symmetry-breaking measurement cannot be recovered locally. We argue that a thermal state at a nonzero temperature in the canonical ensemble (with fixed symmetry charge) should have spontaneously broken strong symmetry. Additionally, we study nonthermal scenarios where decoherence induces SWSSB, leading to phase transitions described by classical statistical models with bond randomness. In particular, the SWSSB transition of a decohered Ising model can be viewed as the “ungauged” version of the celebrated toric-code decodability transition. We confirm that, in the decohered Ising model, the SWSSB transition defined by the fidelity correlator is the only physical transition in terms of channel recoverability. We also comment on other (inequivalent) definitions of SWSSB, through correlation functions with higher Rényi indices.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state topological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double-semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable—thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasilocal quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground-state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering G-graded string-net models, and “classically gauging” symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasilocal quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated—thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be “classically gauged,” resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The fidelity of entangling operations is a key figure of merit in quantum information processing, especially in the context of quantum error correction. High-fidelity entangling gates in neutral atoms have seen remarkable advancement recently. A full understanding of error sources and their respective contributions to gate infidelity will enable the prediction of fundamental limits on quantum gates in neutral atom platforms with realistic experimental constraints. In this work, we implement the time-optimal Rydberg controlled-Z (CZ) gate, design a circuit to benchmark its fidelity, and achieve a fidelity, averaged over symmetric input states, of 0.9971(5), downward corrected for leakage error, which together with our recent work [Nature 634, 321–327 (2024)] forms a new state of the art for neutral atoms. The remaining infidelity is explained by an error model, consistent with our experimental results over a range of gate speeds, with varying contributions from different error sources. Further, we develop a fidelity response theory to efficiently predict infidelity from laser noise with nontrivial power spectral densities and derive scaling laws of infidelity with gate speed. Besides its capability of predicting gate fidelity, we also utilize the fidelity response theory to compare and optimize gate protocols, to learn laser frequency noise, and to study the noise response for quantum simulation tasks. Finally, we predict that a CZ gate fidelity of ≳0.999 is feasible with realistic experimental upgrades.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Nonstabilizerness, or “magic,” is a critical quantum resource that, together with entanglement, characterizes the nonclassical complexity of quantum states. Here, we address the problem of quantifying the average nonstabilizerness of random matrix product states (RMPSs). RMPSs represent a generalization of random product states featuring bounded entanglement that scales logarithmically with the bond dimension χ. We demonstrate that the stabilizer Rényi entropies converge to that of Haar-random states as N/χα, where N is the system size and the α are integer exponents. This indicates that MPSs with a modest bond dimension are as magical as generic states. Subsequently, we introduce the ensemble of Clifford-enhanced matrix product states (CMPSs), built by the action of Clifford unitaries on RMPSs. Leveraging our previous result, we show that CMPSs can approximate quantum state 4-designs with arbitrary accuracy. Specifically, for a constant N, CMPSs become close to 4-designs, with a scaling as χ−2. Our findings indicate that combining Clifford unitaries with polynomially complex tensor-network states can generate highly nontrivial quantum states.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The interplay between symmetries and entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the center of an intense multidisciplinary research effort. Here we introduce a setting where these questions can be characterized exactly by considering dual-unitary circuits with an arbitrary number of U(1) charges. After providing a complete characterization of these systems we show that one can introduce a class of solvable states, which extends that of generic dual-unitary circuits, for which the nonequilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly. In contrast to the known class of solvable states, which relax to the infinite-temperature state, these states relax to a family of nontrivial generalized Gibbs ensembles. The relaxation process of these states can be simply described by a linear growth of the entanglement entropy followed by saturation to a nonmaximal value but with maximal entanglement velocity. We then move on to consider the dynamics from nonsolvable states, combining the exact results with the entanglement membrane picture we argue that the entanglement dynamics from these states is qualitatively different from that of the solvable ones. It shows two different growth regimes characterized by two distinct slopes, both corresponding to submaximal entanglement velocities. Moreover, we show that nonsolvable initial states can give rise to the quantum Mpemba effect, where less symmetric initial states restore the symmetry faster than more symmetric ones.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

For device architectures restricted to two-dimensional (2D) local gates, naively implementing the high-rate codes suitable for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing incurs prohibitive overhead. In this work, we present an error-correction protocol built on a bilayer architecture that aims to reduce operational overheads when restricted to 2D local gates by measuring some generators less frequently than others. We investigate the family of bivariate-bicycle qLDPC codes and show that they are well suited for a parallel syndrome-measurement scheme using fast routing with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Through circuit-level simulations, we find that in some parameter regimes, bivariate-bicycle codes implemented with this protocol have logical error rates comparable to the surface code while using fewer physical qubits.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries—symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems—protected by both average and exact symmetries—by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled-space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed-state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

In the terminology of prior work, this procedure yields a quasiprobability decomposition with minimal 1-norm in a number of cases, which addresses an open question of Piveteau and Sutter. As an application, we give an improved algorithm for clustered Hamiltonian simulation. Specifically we show that interactions can be removed at a cost, which is exponential in the sum of their strengths times the evolution time, and vanishing in the limit of weak interactions. We also give an improved upper bound on the cost of replacing wires with measure-and-prepare channels using “timelike cuts.” We prove a matching information-theoretic lower bound when estimating output probabilities.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

Ground-state hyperfine levels in Eu3+:Y2SiO5 have previously shown coherence times as long as 6 h at 1.4 K when operated at a zero-first-order-Zeeman (ZEFOZ) point. Here, we have characterized the limiting decoherence mechanisms acting in this regime, which shows that the coherence time is limited by the presence of spin impurities. This dephasing effect has been suppressed by cooling the sample to 125 mK, resulting in an extension in the coherence time to over 13 h. In the absence of these impurities, the dominant source of dephasing is the field inhomogeneity of the ZEFOZ point arising from the spin inhomogeneous broadening. We have shown that coherence times over 18 h can be achieved by operating using a spectrally narrow subensemble selected from within the inhomogeneous line. The observed coherence time is longer than that of any other system suitable for an optical quantum memory. Furthermore, at a much higher temperature of 6 K, we have realized a 6-h coherence time, which has been obtainable using single-stage cryocoolers. These results imply advanced engineering feasibility in designing and operating future quantum information-storage devices for a wide range of applications, including in satellites.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial-size time steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training. While our main focus is on this case study of variational quantum simulation, we end by discussing how our results work in other iterative settings.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The experimental realization of increasingly complex quantum states underscores the pressing need for new methods of state learning and verification. In one such framework, quantum state tomography, the aim is to learn the full quantum state from data obtained by measurements. Without prior assumptions on the state, this task is prohibitively hard. Here, we present an efficient algorithm for learning states on n fermion modes prepared by any number of Gaussian and at most t non-Gaussian gates. By Jordan-Wigner mapping, this also includes n-qubit states prepared by nearest-neighbor matchgate circuits with at most t gates. Our algorithm is based exclusively on single-copy measurements and produces a classical representation of a state, guaranteed to be close in trace distance to the target state. The sample and time complexity of our algorithm is poly(n,2t); thus if t=O(log﻿(n)), it is efficient. We also show that, if t scales more than logarithmically, any learning algorithm to solve the same task must be inefficient, under common cryptographic assumptions. We also provide an efficient property-testing algorithm that, given access to copies of a state, determines whether such a state is far or close to the set of states for which our learning algorithm works. In addition to the outputs of quantum circuits, our tomography algorithm is efficient for some physical target states, such as those arising in time dynamics and low-energy physics of impurity models. Beyond tomography, our work sheds light on the structure of states prepared with few non-Gaussian gates and offers an improved upper bound on their circuit complexity, enabling an efficient circuit-compilation method.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

Prior work has shown that single-copy measurements suffice for k-local Pauli operators with constant k. However, we prove that for k-body fermionic observables and the full set of n-qubit Pauli operators, single-copy protocols fail to achieve sample-efficient tomography. We then present new protocols based on measuring two copies of the state at a time that overcome these lower bounds, providing a triply efficient protocol.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Fluxonium qubit is a promising elementary building block for quantum information processing due to its long coherence time combined with a strong anharmonicity. In this paper, we realize a 60-ns direct gate on two inductively coupled fluxoniums, which behave almost exactly as a pair of transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems. The -gate fidelity, estimated using randomized benchmarking, was as high as 99.94%. Furthermore, the fidelity remains above 99.9% for 24 days without any recalibration between measurements. Compared with the 99.96% fidelity of a 60-ns identity gate, our data brings the investigation of the nondecoherence-related errors during logical operations down to 2×10−4. The present result adds a simple and robust two-qubit gate into the still relatively small family of the “beyond three nines” gates on superconducting qubits.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "We present shadow spectroscopy as a simulator-agnostic quantum algorithm for estimating energy gaps using very few circuit repetitions (shots) and no extra resources (ancilla qubits) beyond performing time evolution and measurements. The approach builds on the fundamental feature that every observable property of a quantum system must evolve according to the same harmonic components: we can reveal them by postprocessing classical shadows of time-evolved quantum states to extract a large number of time-periodic signals No∝108, whose frequencies correspond to Hamiltonian energy differences with precision limited as ϵ∝1/T for simulation time T. We provide strong analytical guarantees that (a) quantum resources scale as O(log﻿No), while the classical computational complexity is linear O(No), (b) the signal-to-noise ratio increases with the number of processed signals as ∝No, and (c) spectral peak positions are immune to reasonable levels of noise. We demonstrate our approach on model spin systems and the excited-state conical intersection of molecular CH2 and verify that our method is indeed intuitively easy to use in practice, robust against gate noise, amiable to a new type of algorithmic-error mitigation technique, and uses relatively few shots given a reasonable initial state is supplied—we demonstrate that even 10 shots per time step can be sufficient. Finally, we measured a high-quality, experimental shadow spectrum of a spin chain on readily available IBM quantum computers, achieving the same precision as in noise-free simulations without using any advanced error mitigation, and verified scalability in tensor-network simulations of up to 100-qubit systems.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Quantum metrology, a cornerstone of quantum technologies, exploits entanglement and superposition to achieve higher precision than classical protocols in parameter-estimation tasks. When combined with critical phenomena such as phase transitions, the divergence of quantum fluctuations is predicted to enhance the performance of quantum sensors. Here, we implement a critical quantum sensor using a superconducting parametric (i.e., two-photon driven) Kerr resonator. The sensor, a linear resonator terminated by a superconducting quantum interference device, operates near the critical point of a finite-component second-order dissipative phase transition obtained by scaling the system parameters. We analyze the performance of a frequency-estimation protocol and show that quadratic precision scaling with respect to the system size can be achieved with finite values of the Kerr nonlinearity. Since each photon emitted from the cavity carries more information about the parameter to be estimated compared to its classical counterpart, our protocol opens up perspectives for faster or more precise metrological protocols. Our results demonstrate that quantum advantage in a sensing protocol can be achieved by exploiting a phase transition.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

Designing fault-tolerant schemes with high tolerance to loss is thus a central challenge in scaling photonic quantum information processors. Concatenation of a fault-tolerant construction with a code able to efficiently correct loss is a promising approach to achieve this but practical ways to implement code concatenation with photons have been lacking. We propose schemes for generating concatenated graph codes using multiphoton emission from two quantum emitters or a single quantum emitter coupled to a memory—capabilities available in several photonic platforms. We show that these schemes enable fault-tolerant fusion-based quantum computation in practical regimes with high photon loss and standard fusion gates without the need for auxiliary photons.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower computational complexity as compared to tensor networks with general real or complex entries. This raises the question of how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different tensor-network-contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias toward positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the tensor entries become predominantly positive; this can be understood as a tensor-network manifestation of the well-known negative-sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. The performance of this scheme is governed by the number of correlations in contiguous parts of the tensor network (which by analogy can be thought of as entanglement). Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy—i.e., from a volume-law to a boundary-law scaling of entanglement—already occurs for a slight bias of the tensor entries toward a positive mean, scaling inversely with the bond dimension D, and thus the problem becomes easy the earlier the larger D occurs. This is in contrast both to expectations and to the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction, where the hardness at fixed bias increases with the bond dimension. To provide insight into this early breakdown of computational hardness and the accompanying entanglement transition, we construct an effective classical statistical-mechanical model that predicts a transition at a bias of the tensor entries of 1/D, confirming our observations. We conclude by investigating the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor-network wave functions (projected entangled-pair states, PEPSs) and find that in this setting, the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation that maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary-law entanglement scaling but also suggests new approaches toward PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Neutral atoms are among the leading platforms toward realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). However, scaling up a single neutral-atom device beyond 104 atoms to meet the demands of FTQC for practical applications remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, we clarify the criteria and technological requirements for further scaling based on multiple neutral atom quantum processing units (QPUs) connected through photonic networking links. Our quantitative analysis shows that nanofiber optical cavities have the potential as an efficient atom-photon interface to enable fast entanglement generation between atoms in distinct neutral-atom modules, allowing multiple neutral-atom QPUs to operate cooperatively without sacrificing computational speed. Using state-of-the-art millimeter-scale nanofiber cavities with the finesse of thousands, over a hundred atoms can be coupled to the cavity mode with an optical tweezer array, with expected single-atom cooperativity exceeding 100 for telecom-band transition of ytterbium atoms. This enables efficient time-multiplexed entanglement generation with a predicted Bell-pair generation rate of 105s−1 while maintaining a small footprint for channel multiplexing. These proposals and results indicate a promising pathway for building large-scale multiprocessor fault-tolerant quantum computers using neutral atoms, nanofiber optical cavities, and fiber-optic networks.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The precision and response of trajectory observables offer valuable insights into the behavior of nonequilibrium systems. For classical systems, trade-offs between these characteristics and thermodynamic costs, such as entropy production and dynamical activity, have been established through uncertainty relations. Quantum systems, however, present unique challenges, where quantum coherence can enhance precision and violate classical uncertainty relations. In this study, we derive trade-off relations for stochastic observables in Markovian open quantum systems. Specifically, we present three key results: (i) a quantum generalization of the thermokinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the relative fluctuations of currents in terms of entropy production and dynamical activity; (ii) a quantum inverse uncertainty relation, which constrains the relative fluctuations of arbitrary counting observables based on their instantaneous fluctuations and the spectral gap of the symmetrized Liouvillian; and (iii) a quantum response kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the response of general observables to kinetic perturbations in terms of dynamical activity. These fundamental bounds, validated numerically using a three-level maser and a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between precision, response, and thermodynamic costs in quantum systems.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi , Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards its ground state. In this work, we develop a kinetic-theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic-theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations for the examples of a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, the transverse-field Ising model with an additional integrability-breaking field, and a nonintegrable antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder. In all cases, we are able to efficiently cool into the many-body ground state. The effects of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, are investigated through the lens of the kinetic theory: we show how the steady-state quasiparticle populations depend on the noise rate, and we establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

Here, we propose fusion-based architectures tailored to the capabilities and noise models in quantum emitters.

    "abstract": "Entanglement serves as a foundational pillar in quantum information theory, delineating the boundary between what is classical and what is quantum. The common assumption is that a higher degree of entanglement corresponds to a greater degree of “quantumness.” However, this folk belief is challenged by the fact that classically simulable operations, such as Clifford circuits, can create highly entangled states. The simulability of these states raises the question: What are the differences between “low-magic” entanglement and “high-magic” entanglement? To understand this interplay between entanglement and magic, we take an operational approach by studying tasks such as entanglement estimation, distillation, and dilution. We uncover a separation of Hilbert space into two distinct regimes: the entanglement-dominated (ED) phase, where entanglement surpasses magic, and the magic-dominated (MD) phase, where magic dominates entanglement. This separation induces a computational phase transition: entanglement-related tasks are efficiently solvable in the ED phase, but become intractable in the MD phase. Our results find applications in diverse areas such as quantum error correction, many-body physics, and the study of quantum chaos, providing a unifying framework for understanding the behavior of quantum systems. We also offer theoretical explanations for previous numerical observations, highlighting the broad implications of the ED-MD distinction across various subfields of physics.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

In order to run increasingly complex algorithms, it is advantageous to demonstrate high-fidelity and flexible gates between long-lived and highly coherent qubit states.

We utilize the long lifetime, flexible control, and high gate fidelity of our system to characterize native gates using single- and two-qubit Clifford and symmetric subspace randomized-benchmarking circuits with more than 200 controlled-Z () gates applied to one or two pairs of atoms. We measure our two-qubit entangling gate fidelity to be 99.72(3)% (99.40(3)%) with (without) postselection. In addition, we introduce a simple and optimized method for calibration of multiparameter quantum gates.

    "abstract": "In quantum metrology, one of the major applications of quantum technologies, the ultimate precision of estimating an unknown parameter is often stated in terms of the Cram\\'er-Rao bound. Yet, the latter is no longer guaranteed to carry an operational meaning in the regime where few measurement samples are obtained, which we illustrate through a simple example. We instead propose to quantify the quality of a metrology protocol by the probability of obtaining an estimate with a given accuracy. This approach, which we refer to as probably approximately correct (PAC) metrology, ensures operational significance in the finite-sample regime. The accuracy guarantees hold for any value of the unknown parameter, unlike the Cram\\'er-Rao bound which assumes it is approximately known. We establish a strong connection to multi-hypothesis testing with quantum states, which allows us to derive an analogue of the Cram\\'er-Rao bound which contains explicit corrections relevant to the finite-sample regime. We further study the asymptotic behavior of the success probability of the estimation procedure for many copies of the state and apply our framework to the example task of phase estimation with an ensemble of spin-1/2 particles. Overall, our operational approach allows the study of quantum metrology in the finite-sample regime and opens up a plethora of new avenues for research at the interface of quantum information theory and quantum metrology.",

    "abstract": "The driven Dicke model, wherein an ensemble of atoms is driven by an external field and undergoes collective spontaneous emission due to coupling to a leaky cavity mode, is a paradigmatic example of a system exhibiting a driven-dissipative phase transition as a function of driving strength. Recently, a similar phenomenon was experimentally observed, not in a cavity setting, but rather in a free-space atomic ensemble. The reason why similar behavior should emerge in free space is not obvious, as the system interacts with a continuum of optical modes, which encodes light-propagation effects. Here, we present and solve a simple model to explain the behavior of the free-space system, based on the one-dimensional Maxwell-Bloch equations. On one hand, we show that a free-space ensemble at a low optical depth can exhibit similar behavior as the cavity system, as spatial propagation effects are negligible. On the other hand, in the thermodynamic limit of large atom number, we show that certain observables such as the transmittance or the atomic excited population exhibit nonanalytic behavior as a function of the driving intensity, reminiscent of a phase transition. However, a closer analysis reveals that the atomic properties are highly inhomogeneous in space, and based on this we argue that the free-space system does not undergo a phase transition but rather a “phase separation,” roughly speaking, between saturated and unsaturated regions.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Photon losses are the main obstacle to fully photonic implementations of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD). Motivated by recent work showing that routed Bell scenarios offer increased robustness to detection inefficiencies for the certification of long-range quantum correlations, we investigate DIQKD protocols based on a routed setup. In these protocols, in some of the test rounds, photons from the source are routed by an actively controlled switch to a nearby test device instead of the distant one. We show how to analyze the security of these protocols and compute lower bounds on the key rates using noncommutative polynomial optimization and the Brown-Fawzi-Fawzi method. We determine lower bounds on the asymptotic key rates of several simple two-qubit routed DIQKD protocols based on CHSH or BB84 correlations and compare their performance to standard protocols. For high-quality short-path tests, we find that routed DIQKD protocols are significantly more robust to losses, showing an improvement of approximately 30% in the detection efficiency compared to their nonrouted counterparts. This translates to a large improvement in the distance over which nonzero key can be distilled in optical setups with near-perfect single-photon detectors, where the main source of loss in the setup is due to transmission in the fiber. Notably, the routed BB84 protocol achieves a positive key rate with a detection efficiency as low as 50% for the distant device, the minimal threshold for any QKD protocol featuring two untrusted measurements. However, the advantages we find are highly sensitive to noise and losses affecting the short-range correlations involving the additional test device.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Quantum measurements are a fundamental component of quantum computing. However, on present-day quantum computers, measurements can be more error prone than quantum gates and are susceptible to nonunital errors as well as nonlocal correlations due to measurement crosstalk. While readout errors can be mitigated in postprocessing, this is inefficient in the number of qubits due to a combinatorially large number of possible states that need to be characterized. In this work, we show that measurement errors can be tailored into a simple stochastic error model using randomized compiling, enabling the efficient mitigation of readout errors via quasiprobability distributions reconstructed from the measurement of a single preparation state in an exponentially large confusion matrix. We demonstrate the scalability and power of this approach by correcting readout errors without matrix inversion on a large number of different preparation states applied to a register of eight superconducting transmon qubits. Moreover, we show that this method can be extended to midcircuit measurements used for active feedback via quasiprobabilistic error cancellation, and we demonstrate the correction of measurement errors on an ancilla qubit used to detect and actively correct bit-flip errors on an entangled memory qubit. Our approach enables the correction of readout errors on large numbers of qubits and offers a strategy for correcting readout errors in adaptive circuits in which the results of midcircuit measurements are used to perform conditional operations on nonlocal qubits in real time.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Midcircuit measurements (MCMs) are crucial ingredients in the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation. While there have been rapid experimental progresses in realizing MCMs, a systematic method for characterizing noisy MCMs is still under exploration. In this work, we develop a cycle benchmarking (CB)-type algorithm to characterize noisy MCMs. The key idea is to use a joint Fourier transform on the classical and quantum registers and then estimate parameters in the Fourier space, analogous to Pauli fidelities used in CB-type algorithms for characterizing the Pauli-noise channel of Clifford gates. Furthermore, we develop a theory of the noise learnability of MCMs, which determines what information can be learned about the noise model (in the presence of state preparation and terminating measurement noise) and what cannot, which shows that all learnable information can be learned using our algorithm. As an application, we show how to use the learned information to test the independence between measurement noise and state-preparation noise in an MCM. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to illustrate the practical applicability of the algorithm. Similar to other CB-type algorithms, we expect the algorithm to provide a useful toolkit that is of experimental interest.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Isolated interacting quantum systems generally thermalize, yet there are several examples for the breakdown of ergodicity, such as many-body localization and quantum scars. Recently, ergodicity breaking has been observed in systems subjected to linear potentials, termed Stark many-body localization. This phenomenon is closely associated with Hilbert-space fragmentation, characterized by a strong dependence of dynamics on initial conditions. Here, we explore initial-state-dependent dynamics using a ladder-type superconducting processor with up to 24 qubits, which enables precise control of the qubit frequency and initial-state preparation. In systems with linear potentials, we experimentally observe distinct nonequilibrium dynamics for initial states with the same quantum numbers and energy, but with varying domain-wall numbers. Accompanied by the numerical simulation for systems with larger sizes, we reveal that this distinction becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows, in contrast with weakly disordered interacting systems. Our results provide convincing experimental evidence of the fragmentation in Stark systems, enriching our understanding of the weak breakdown of ergodicity.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Measurements and feedback have emerged as powerful resources for creating many-body quantum states. However, a detailed understanding has been restricted to fixed-point representatives of phases of matter. Here, we go beyond this and characterize the patterns of many-body entanglement that can be deterministically created from measurement. Focusing on one spatial dimension, a framework is developed for the case where a single round of measurements is the only entangling operation. We show this creates matrix-product states and identify necessary and sufficient tensor conditions for preparability, which uniquely determine the preparation protocol. We use these conditions to both classify preparable quantum states and characterize their physical constraints. In particular, we find a trade-off between the richness of the preparable entanglement spectrum and correlation functions, which leads to a no-go theorem for preparing certain quantum states. More broadly, we connect properties of the preparation protocol to the resulting phase of matter, including trivial, symmetry-breaking, and symmetry-protected topological phases—for both uniform and modulated symmetries. This work offers a resource-theoretic perspective on preparable quantum entanglement and shows how to systematically create states of matter, away from their fixed points, in quantum devices.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

At the theoretical and software levels, numerous approaches have been proposed for benchmarking quantum devices, ranging from, , quantum volume to randomized benchmarking. In this work, we utilize the quantum information-theoretic properties of multipartite maximally entangled quantum states, in addition to their correspondence with quantum error-correction codes, permitting us to quantify the entanglement generated on near-term bilinear spin-qubit architectures. For this aim, we introduce four metrics that ascertain the quality of genuine multipartite quantum entanglement, along with circuit-level fidelity measures. As part of the task of executing a quantum circuit on a device, we devise simulations, which combine expected hardware characteristics of spin-qubit devices with appropriate compilation techniques; we then analyze three different architectural choices of varying lattice sizes for bilinear arrays, under three increasingly realistic noise models. We find that if the use of a compiler is assumed, sparsely connected spin-qubit lattices can approach comparable values of our metrics to those of the most highly connected device architecture. Even more surprisingly, by incorporating crosstalk into our last noise model, we find that, as error rates for crosstalk approach realistic values, the benefits of utilizing a bilinear array with advanced connectivity vanish. Our results highlight the limitations of adding local connectivity to near-term spin-qubit devices, and can be readily adapted to other qubit technologies. The framework developed here can be used for analyzing quantum entanglement on a device before fabrication, informing experimentalists on concomitant realistic expectations.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

A transversal controlled- (t) gate on two surface codes introduces correlated errors across the code blocks and thus requires modified decoding compared to established methods of decoding surface-code quantum memory (SCQM) or lattice-surgery operations. In this work, we examine and benchmark the performance of three different decoding strategies for the t for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. In particular, we present a low-complexity decoder based on minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) that achieves the same threshold as the SCQM MWPM decoder. We extend our analysis with a study of tailored decoding of a transversal-teleportation circuit, along with a comparison between the performance of lattice-surgery and transversal operations under Pauli- and erasure-noise models.

    "abstract": "“Deep thermalization” describes the emergence of universal wave-function distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a U(1) symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or “charge”) and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wave-function distributions. We put forth a universal ansatz for the limiting form of the projected ensemble, motivated by maximum-entropy principles rooted in statistical physics and quantum information theory. This limiting form depends on a polynomial amount of data on the initial state and measurement basis, a “coarse graining” that is an essential feature of thermodynamic ensembles. We support our ansatz with three complementary approaches: (i) a rigorous proof in the simplest case of no charge fluctuations in either the initial state or the measurement basis; (ii) analytical calculations using a “replica-limit” approach, applicable when charge fluctuations are allowed in either the input state or the measurement basis but not both; and (iii) extensive numerical simulations of finite-sized systems in the most general case. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

In superconducting quantum circuits, fast qubit measurement has been achieved using a dispersively coupled resonator with a large externally limited linewidth. This necessitates the use of a Purcell filter that protects the qubit from relaxation through the readout channel. Here, we show that a readout resonator and filter resonator, coupled to each other both capacitively and inductively via a multiconductor transmission line, can produce a compact notch-filter circuit that effectively eliminates the Purcell decay channel through destructive interference. By utilizing linewidths as large as 42 MHz, we perform simultaneous readout of four qubits using a 56-ns integration window and benchmark an average assignment fidelity of 99.77%, with the highest qubit assignment fidelity exceeding 99.9%. Including the simulated readout ring-down time, the total readout duration was between 115 and 215 ns for the four qubits, which we anticipate can be reduced to around 100 ns with active ring-down pulse shaping.

    "abstract": "Topologically ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice-gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the imaginary-time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error-correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice-gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the low-density parity-check condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low-temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice-gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence for stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and timelike defects in the lattice-gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of spacelike defects corresponds to a successful “memory experiment” and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of timelike defects corresponds to a successful “stability experiment” and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Although the similarity between nonstabilizer states—also known as magic states—in discrete-variable systems and non-Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems has widely been recognized, the precise connections between these two notions have still been unclear. We establish a fundamental link between these two quantum resources via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding. We show that the negativity of the continuous-variable Wigner function for an encoded GKP state coincides with a magic measure we introduce, which matches the negativity of the discrete Wigner function for odd dimensions. We also provide a continuous-variable representation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy—a recent proposal for a magic measure for multiqubit states. We further provide the magic measure with an operational interpretation as a runtime of a classical simulation algorithm. In addition, we employ our results to prove that implementing a multiqubit logical non-Clifford operation in the GKP code subspace requires a non-Gaussian operation even at the limit of perfect encoding, despite the fact that the ideal GKP states already come with a large amount of non-Gaussianity.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "We introduce and implement GraphDD: an efficient method for real-time, circuit-specific, optimal embedding of dynamical decoupling (DD) into executable quantum algorithms. We demonstrate that for an arbitrary quantum circuit, GraphDD exactly refocuses both quasistatic single-qubit dephasing and crosstalk idling errors over the entire circuit, while using a minimal number of additional single-qubit gates embedded into idle periods. The method relies on a graph representation of the embedding problem, where the optimal decoupling sequence can be efficiently calculated using an algebraic computation that scales linearly with the number of idles. This allows optimal DD to be embedded during circuit compilation, without any calibration overhead, additional circuit execution, or numerical optimization. The method is generic and applicable to any arbitrary circuit; in compiler runtime the specific pulse-sequence solutions are tailored to the individual circuit, and consider a range of contextual information on circuit structure and device connectivity. We verify the ability of GraphDD to deliver enhanced circuit-level error suppression on 127-qubit IBM devices, showing that the optimal DD embedding resulting from GraphDD provides orders of magnitude improvements to measured circuit fidelities compared with standard embedding approaches available in Qiskit.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

We develop a scalable noise-characterization protocol suited to characterizing the syndrome-extraction circuits of quantum error-correcting codes, a key component of fault-tolerant architectures. Our protocol builds upon averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES), a framework for noise-characterization experiments that simultaneously estimates the Pauli-error probabilities of all gates in a Clifford circuit and captures averaged spatial correlations between gates implemented simultaneously in the layers of the circuit. By rigorously analyzing the performance of noise-characterization experiments in the ACES framework, we derive a figure of merit for their expected performance, allowing us to optimize their experimental design and improve the precision to which we estimate noise given fixed experimental resources. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our protocol through circuit-level numerical simulations of the entire noise-characterization procedure for the syndrome-extraction circuit of a distance-25 surface code with over 1000 qubits.

    "abstract": "Integrated photonic microresonators have become an essential resource for generating photonic qubits for quantum information processing, entanglement distribution and networking, and quantum communications. The pair-generation rate is enhanced by reducing the microresonator radius, but this comes at the cost of increasing the frequency-mode spacing and reducing the quantum information spectral density. Here, we circumvent this rate-density trade-off in an AlGaAs-on-insulator photonic device by multiplexing an array of 20 small-radius microresonators, each producing a 650-GHz-spaced comb of time-energy entangled-photon pairs. The resonators can be independently tuned via integrated thermo-optic heaters, enabling control of the mode spacing from degeneracy up to a full free spectral range. We demonstrate simultaneous pumping of five resonators with up to 50-GHz relative comb offsets, where each resonator produces pairs exhibiting time-energy entanglement visibilities up to 95%, coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 5000, and an on-chip pair rate up to 2.6GHz/mW2 per comb line—an improvement over prior work by more than a factor of 40. As a demonstration, we generate frequency-bin qubits in a maximally entangled two-qubit Bell state with fidelity exceeding 87% (90% with background correction) and detected frequency-bin entanglement rates up to 7 kHz (an approximately 70 MHz on-chip pair rate) using a pump power of approximately 250μW. Multiplexing small-radius microresonators combines the key capabilities required for programmable and dense photonic qubit encoding while retaining high pair-generation rates, heralded single-photon purity, and entanglement fidelity.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to characterize the ′t Hooft anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type. By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we incorporate them in a unified framework that enables a direct calculation of their anomalies. In the case where the full symmetry group Γ arises as a central extension of the strong-symmetry group K with the weak-symmetry group G, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are classified by Hd+2(Γ,U(1))/Hd+2(G,U(1)) in d spatial dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases as long as the weak symmetry is imposed. Analogous to the “anomaly matching” condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial steady states and long-time dynamics for open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. Notably, we identify a novel (1+1)D mixed-state quantum phase that has no counterpart in closed systems, where the steady state shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays long-range correlation on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We further establish the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such unconventional boundary correlation. Moreover, we explore the generalization of the “anomaly inflow” mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct (1+1)D and (2+1)D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies. Finally, we generalize our results to the cases including lattice translation symmetries, which serves as the Lieb-Schulz-Mattis (LSM) theorem for mixed states.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting (QEC) schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the functioning of the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ . Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of . Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error-correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor-network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement-based and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes, which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1-dimensional color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three time steps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of approximately equal to 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1-dimensional color codes.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The quantum simulation of real molecules and materials is one of the most highly anticipated applications of quantum computing. Algorithms for simulating electronic structure using a first-quantized plane-wave representation are especially promising due to their asymptotic efficiency. However, previous proposals for preparing initial states for these simulation algorithms scale poorly with the size of the basis set. We address this shortcoming by showing how to efficiently map states defined in a Gaussian-type orbital basis to a plane-wave basis with a scaling that is logarithmic in the number of plane waves. Our key technical result is a proof that molecular orbitals constructed from Gaussian-type basis functions can be compactly represented in a plane-wave basis using matrix product states. While we expect that other approaches could achieve the same logarithmic scaling with respect to basis-set size, our proposed state-preparation technique is also highly efficient in practice. For example, in a series of numerical experiments on small molecules, we find that our approach allows us to prepare an approximation to the Hartree-Fock state using orders of magnitude fewer non-Clifford gates than a naive approach. By resolving the issue of state preparation, our work allows for the first quantum simulation of molecular systems the end-to-end complexity of which is truly sublinear in the basis-set size.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Pseudorandom states (PRSs) are state ensembles that cannot be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random states. However, the definition of PRSs has been limited to pure states and lacks robustness against noise. In this work, we introduce pseudorandom density matrices (PRDMs), ensembles of n-qubit states that are computationally indistinguishable from the generalized Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble (GHSE), which is constructed from (n+m)-qubit Haar random states with m qubits traced out. For m=0, PRDMs are equivalent to PRSs, whereas for m=ω(log﻿n), PRDMs are computationally indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. PRDMs with m=ω(log﻿n) are robust to unital noise channels and separated in terms of security from PRS. PRDMs can disguise valuable quantum resources as trivial states. In particular, we construct pseudoresource state ensembles, which possess near-maximal entanglement, magic and coherence, but are computationally indistinguishable from resource-free states. PRDMs exhibit a pseudoresource gap of Θ(n) vs 0, surpassing previously found gaps. We also render EFI pairs, a fundamental cryptographic primitive, robust to strong mixed unitary noise. Our work has major implications on quantum resource theory. We show that entanglement, magic, and coherence cannot be efficiently tested, and that black-box resource distillation requires a superpolynomial number of copies. We also establish lower bounds on the purity needed for efficient testing and black-box distillation. Finally, we introduce memoryless PRSs, a noise-robust notion of PRS, which are indistinguishable to Haar random states for efficient algorithms without quantum memory, as well as noise-robust quantum money. Our work provides a comprehensive framework of pseudorandomness for mixed states, which yields powerful quantum cryptographic primitives and fundamental bounds on quantum resource theories.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Studies on quantum algorithms for ground-state energy estimation often assume perfect ground-state preparation; however, in reality the initial state will have imperfect overlap with the true ground state. Here, we address that problem in two ways: by faster preparation of matrix-product-state (MPS) approximations and by more efficient filtering of the prepared state to find the ground-state energy. We show how to achieve unitary synthesis with a Toffoli complexity about 7× lower than that in prior work and use that to derive a more efficient MPS-preparation method. For filtering, we present two different approaches: sampling and binary search. For both, we use the theory of window functions to avoid large phase errors and minimize the complexity. We find that the binary-search approach provides better scaling with the overlap at the cost of a larger constant factor, such that it will be preferred for overlaps less than about 0.003. Finally, we estimate the total resources to perform ground-state energy estimation of Fe-S cluster systems, including the FeMo cofactor by estimating the overlap of different MPS initial states with potential ground states of the FeMo cofactor using an extrapolation procedure. With a modest MPS bond dimension of 4000, our procedure produces an estimate of approximately 0.9 overlap squared with a candidate ground state of the FeMo cofactor, producing a total resource estimate of 7.3×1010 Toffoli gates; neglecting the search over candidates and assuming the accuracy of the extrapolation, this validates prior estimates that have used perfect ground-state overlap. This presents an example of a practical path to prepare states of high overlap in a challenging-to-compute chemical system.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

The resulting phase diagram is studied using the infinite density-matrix renormalization group and reveals a highly robust Haldane phase—a prime example of a symmetry-protected topological phase.

    "abstract": "Quantum dynamics on curved spacetime has never been directly probed beyond the Newtonian limit. Although we can describe such dynamics theoretically, experiments would provide empirical evidence that quantum theory holds even in this extreme limit. The practical challenge is the minute spacetime curvature difference over the length scale of the typical extent of quantum effects. Here we propose a quantum network of alkaline earth(-like) atomic processors for constructing a distributed quantum state that is sensitive to the differential proper time between its constituent atomic processor nodes, implementing a quantum observable that is affected by post-Newtonian curved spacetime. Conceptually, we delocalize one clock between three locations by encoding the presence or absence of a clock into the state of the local atoms. By separating three atomic nodes over $\\sim$km-scale elevation differences and distributing one clock between them via a W-state, we demonstrate that the curvature of spacetime is manifest in the interference of the three different proper times that give rise to three distinct beat notes in our non-local observable. We further demonstrate that $N$-atom entanglement within each node enhances the interrogation bandwidth by a factor of $N$. We discuss how our system can probe new facets of fundamental physics, such as the linearity, unitarity and probabilistic nature of quantum theory on curved spacetime. Our protocol combines several recent advances with neutral atom and trapped ions to realize a novel quantum probe of curved spacetime uniquely enabled by quantum networks.",

In this work, we demonstrate experimentally a neural-network-based preparation of Schrödinger cat states in a cavity coupled dispersively to a qubit. We show that it is possible to teach a neural network to output optimized control pulses for a whole family of quantum states. After being trained in simulations, the network takes a description of the target quantum state as input and rapidly produces the pulse shape for the experiment, without any need for time-consuming additional optimization or retraining for different states. Our experimental results demonstrate more generally how deep neural networks and transfer learning can produce efficient simultaneous solutions to a range of quantum control tasks, which will benefit not only state preparation but also parametrized quantum gates.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This appears to conflict with the reversible evolution of isolated quantum systems under the Schrödinger equation, which preserves the von Neumann entropy. Nonetheless, one finds that with respect to many observables, expectation values approach a fixed value—their equilibrium value. This ultimately raises the question: ? For classical systems, one introduces the assumption of a low-entropy initial state along with the concept of ignorance about the microscopic details of the physical system, leading to a statistical interpretation of the second law. By considering the observables through which we examine quantum systems, both these assumptions can be incorporated, building upon recent studies of the of observables. While the statistical behavior of observable expectation values is well established, a quantitative connection to entropy increase has been lacking so far. In deriving novel bounds for the equilibration of observables, and considering the entropy of the system relative to observables, we recover a variant of the second law: the entropy with respect to a given observable tends toward its equilibrium value in the course of the system’s unitary evolution. These results also support recent findings that question the necessity of nonintegrability for equilibration in quantum systems. We further illustrate our bounds using numerical results from the paradigmatic example of a quantum Ising model on a chain of spins. There, we observe entropy increasing up to equilibrium values, as well as fluctuations, which expose the underlying reversible evolution in accordance with the derived bounds.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Realistic multiqubit noise processes often result in error mechanisms that are not captured by the probabilistic Markovian error models commonly employed in circuit-level analyses of quantum fault tolerance. By working within an open-quantum system Hamiltonian formulation, we revisit the validity of the notion of a constant gate error in the presence of noise that is both and , and the impact of which is mitigated through perfect instantaneous dynamical decoupling subject to finite timing constraints. We study a minimal exactly solvable single-qubit model under Gaussian quantum dephasing noise, showing that the fidelity of a dynamically protected idling gate can depend strongly on its location in the circuit and the history of applied control, even when the system-side error propagation is fully removed through perfect reset operations. For digital periodic control, we prove that, under mild conditions on the low-frequency behavior of the nonclassical noise spectrum, at a value that is strictly smaller than the one attainable in the absence of control history; the presence of high-frequency noise peaks is also found as especially harmful, due to the possible onset of . We explicitly relate these features to the evolution of the bath statistics during the computation, which has not been fully accounted for in existing treatments. We find that only if decoupling can keep the qubit highly pure over a time scale larger than the correlation time of the noise, the bath approximately converges to its original statistics and a stable-in-time control performance is recovered. Our work highlights the significance of the full bath evolution between circuit locations and suggests that additional trade-offs and design constraints may arise in layered quantum fault-tolerant architectures from the need to appropriately reequilibrate the quantum bath statistics, particularly when Markovian noise is present alongside temporally correlated noise.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Engineering deterministic photonic gates with simple resources is one of the long-standing challenges in photonic quantum computing. Here, we design a passive conditional gate between copropagating photons using an array of only two-level emitters. The key resource is to harness the effective photon-photon interaction induced by the chiral coupling of the emitter array to two waveguide modes with different resonant momenta at the emitter’s transition frequency. By studying the system’s multiphoton scattering response, we demonstrate that, in certain limits, this configuration induces a nonlinear π-phase shift between the polariton eigenstates of the system without distorting spectrally the wave packets. Then, we show how to harness this nonlinear phase shift to engineer a conditional, deterministic photonic gate in different qubit encodings, with a fidelity arbitrarily close to 1 in the limit of large number of emitters and coupling efficiency. Our configuration can be implemented in topological photonic setups with multiple chiral-edge modes, opening their use for quantum information processing, or in other setups where such chiral light-matter couplings can be effectively obtained, such as optical fibers or photonic-crystal optical and microwave waveguides.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Among all the inventions that quantum physics has produced, the laser holds a particularly important place, both for the rich story of successive discoveries that led to its birth, and for the role it has played in fundamental and applied research. I recall here the lineage of theoretical discoveries and experiments that have marked this history, restricting myself to the contribution of lasers to blue sky science and leaving apart its well-known role in various domains of technology. This story started from advances in the old quantum theory, from Einstein’s theoretical description of stimulated emission to O. Stern’s experimental discovery of the spatial quantization of the electron spin. Nuclear magnetic resonance, atomic clocks, optical pumping, and masers followed and the pace of discoveries accelerated with the appearance of the laser in 1960. This extraordinary light source has since enabled breakthroughs in fundamental physics and opened up fields of research that could not even have been imagined at the time of its birth. I was fortunate to begin my career in physics at this crossroad of atomic physics and optics. I give in this article my personal view of the great adventures in fundamental research in which I participated as an actor or spectator, from the cooling and trapping of atoms by light, to the physics of quantum gases of bosons and fermions, the manipulation of individual quantum particles and quantum simulations. Many other areas of fundamental physics, which I will only mention briefly, owe their development to lasers and further advances are still to be expected in the years to come.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

This construction is enabled by viewing a generic input state in the phase as a collection of coherent “errors” applied to the reference state, and engineering a quantum circuit to efficiently detect and correct such errors.

Many state-of-the-art error-mitigation schemes use knowledge of the errors in the quantum processor, which opens up the question of the extent to which inaccuracy in the error model impacts the performance of error mitigation. In this work, we develop a methodology to efficiently compute upper bounds on the impact of error-model inaccuracy in error mitigation. Our protocols require no additional experiments and instead rely on comparisons between the error model and the error-learning data from which the model is generated. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology by deploying it on an IBM Quantum superconducting qubit quantum processor, and through numerical simulation of standard error models. We show that our estimated upper bounds are typically close to the worst observed performance of error mitigation on random circuits. Our methodology can also be understood as an operationally meaningful metric to assess the quality of error models and we further extend our methodology to allow for comparison between error models. Finally, contrary to what one might expect, we show that observable error in noisy layered circuits of sufficient depth is not always maximized by a Clifford circuit, which may be of independent interest.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information (“co(QCMI)”) as a diagnostic of topological order in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is nonincreasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure-state transition between a topologically trivial and a nontrivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the two-dimensional toric code decohered by onsite bit- and phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is nonzero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the Rényi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide nontrivial consistency checks for our conjecture. We use TMC to also calculate the universal scaling dimension of the anyon-condensation order parameter at this transition.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Trotter and linear combination of unitary (LCU) operations are two popular Hamiltonian simulation methods. The Trotter method is easy to implement and enjoys good system-size dependence endowed by commutator scaling, while the LCU method admits high-accuracy simulation with a smaller gate cost. We propose Hamiltonian simulation algorithms using LCU to compensate Trotter error, which enjoy both of their advantages. By adding few gates after the Kth-order Trotter formula, we realize a better time scaling than 2Kth-order Trotter. Our first algorithm exponentially improves the accuracy scaling of the Kth-order Trotter formula. For a generic Hamiltonian, the estimated gate counts of the first algorithm can be 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the best analytical bound of fourth-order Trotter formula. In the second algorithm, we consider the detailed structure of Hamiltonians and construct LCU for Trotter errors with commutator scaling. Consequently, for lattice Hamiltonians, the algorithm enjoys almost linear system-size dependence and quadratically improves the accuracy of the Kth-order Trotter. For the lattice system, the second algorithm can achieve 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher accuracy with the same gate costs as the optimal Trotter algorithm. These algorithms provide an easy-to-implement approach to achieve a low-cost and high-precision Hamiltonian simulation.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

On the examples of energy and charge diffusion in one-dimensional (1D) spin chains and sudden quench dynamics in the 2D transverse-field Ising model, it is shown that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art tensor network methods. We further demonstrate the flexibility of the approach by studying quench dynamics in the 3D transverse-field Ising model that is highly challenging for tensor network methods. For the simulation of expectation value dynamics starting in a computational basis state, we introduce an extension of sparse Pauli dynamics that truncates the growing sum of Pauli operators by discarding terms with a large number of X and Y matrices. This is validated by our 2D and 3D simulations. Finally, we argue that sparse Pauli dynamics is not only capable of converging challenging observables to high accuracy, but can also serve as a reliable approximate approach even when given only limited computational resources.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Quantum adiabatic optimization seeks to solve combinatorial problems using quantum dynamics, requiring the Hamiltonian of the system to align with the problem of interest. However, these Hamiltonians are often incompatible with the native constraints of quantum hardware, necessitating encoding strategies to map the original problem into a hardware-conformant form. While the classical overhead associated with such mappings is easily quantifiable and typically polynomial in problem size, it is much harder to quantify their overhead on the quantum algorithm, e.g., the transformation of the adiabatic timescale. In this work, we address this challenge on the concrete example of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen , PRX Quantum , 010316 (2023)], which is designed to map optimization problems on arbitrarily connected graphs into Rydberg atom arrays. We consider the fundamental building blocks underlying this encoding scheme and determine the scaling of the minimum gap with system size along adiabatic protocols. Even when the original problem is trivially solvable, we find that the encoded problem can exhibit an exponentially closing minimum gap. We show that this originates from a quantum coherent effect, which gives rise to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wave function. On the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose quantum-aware modifications of the encoding scheme that avoid this quantum bottleneck and lead to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance. This highlights the crucial importance of accounting for quantum effects when designing strategies to encode classical problems onto quantum platforms.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

Dynamically decoupled radio-frequency (DDrf) control offers a high degree of design flexibility and long electron-spin coherence times. However, previous studies have considered simplified models and little is known about optimal gate design and fundamental limits. Here, we develop a generalized DDrf framework that has important implications for spin sensing and control. Our analytical model, which we corroborate by experiments on a single NV center in diamond, reveals the mechanisms that govern the selectivity of gates and their effective Rabi frequencies, and enables flexible detuned gate designs. We apply these insights to numerically show a 60× sensitivity enhancement for detecting weakly coupled spins and study the optimization of quantum gates in multiqubit registers.

    "abstract": "We determine the computational power of isometric tensor-network states (isoTNSs), a variational ansatz originally developed to numerically find and compute properties of gapped ground states and topological states in two dimensions. By mapping two-dimensional isoTNSs to (1+1)D unitary quantum circuits, we find that the computation of local expectation values in isoTNSs (including those with translation-invariant bulk) is -complete. We then introduce isoTNSs, which are those isoTNSs that are the unique ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians and which are characterized by an injectivity parameter δ∈(0,1/D], where D is the bond dimension of the isoTNS. We show that injectivity necessarily adds depolarizing noise to the circuit at a rate η=δ2D2. We show that weakly injective isoTNS (small δ) are still -complete but that there exists an efficient classical algorithm to compute local expectation values in strongly injective isoTNSs (η≥0.41). We also show that while weakly injective isoTNSs can support long-range correlations, strongly injective isoTNSs are approximate Markov states with exponentially decaying correlations. Sampling from isoTNSs corresponds to monitored quantum dynamics and we exhibit a family of isoTNSs that undergo a phase transition from a hard regime to an easy phase in which the monitored circuit can be sampled efficiently. Our results can be used to design provable algorithms to contract isoTNSs. Our mapping between ground states of certain frustration-free Hamiltonians to open circuit dynamics in one dimension fewer may be of independent interest.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

To materialize this potential, it is necessary to adapt theoretical advances to realistic configurations. Here, we consider a quantum triangle network, for which is has been shown in theory that, remarkably, quantum nonlocality without inputs can be demonstrated for sources with an arbitrarily small level of independence. We realize such correlated sources experimentally by carefully engineering the output state of a single AlGaAs multiplexed entangled-photon source, exploiting energy-matched channels cut in its broad spectrum. This simulated triangle network, based on standard fiber telecom components, is then used to violate experimentally a Bell-like inequality that we derive to capture the effect of noise in the correlations present in our system.

    "abstract": "A central ingredient in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms is the initialization of a logical state for a given quantum error-correcting code from a set of noisy qubits. A scheme that has demonstrated promising results for small code instances that are realizable on currently available hardware composes a non-fault-tolerant state preparation circuit with a verification circuit that checks for spreading errors. Known circuit constructions of this scheme are mostly obtained manually, and no algorithmic techniques for constructing depth- or gate-optimal circuits exist. As a consequence, the current state-of-the-art exploits this scheme only for specific code instances and mostly for the special case of distance d=3 codes only. In this work, we propose an automated approach for synthesizing fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for arbitrary CSS codes. We utilize methods based on satisfiability solving (SAT) to construct fault-tolerant state preparation circuits consisting of depth- and gate-optimal preparation and verification circuits. We also provide heuristics that can synthesize fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for code instances where no optimal solution can be obtained in an adequate time. Moreover, we give a general construction for nondeterministic state preparation circuits for codes beyond distance 3. Numerical evaluations using d=3, d=5, and d=7 codes confirm that the generated circuits exhibit the desired scaling of the logical error rates. The resulting methods are publicly available as part of the (MQT) at . Such methods are an important step in providing fault-tolerant circuit constructions that can aid in near-term demonstrations of fault-tolerant quantum computing.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Magic state distillation (MSD) is an essential element for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, which distills a high-fidelity magic state from noisy magic states using ideal (error-corrected) Clifford operations. For ideal Clifford operations, it needs to be performed on the logical qubits and hence incurs a large spatiotemporal overhead, which is one of the major bottlenecks for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs). Here we propose zero-level distillation, which prepares a high-fidelity logical magic state at the physical level, namely zero level, using physical qubits and nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates on a square lattice. We develop a zero-level distillation circuit and show that distillation can be made even more efficient than the conventional sophisticated approaches with logical level distillations. The key idea involves the Knill et al.-type distillation using the Steane code and its careful mapping to the square-lattice architecture with error detection. The distilled magic state on the Steane-code state is then teleported or converted to surface codes. We numerically find that the error rate of the logical magic state scales as approximately $100 \\times p^{2}$ in terms of the physical error rate $p$. For example, with a physical error rate of $p = 10^{-4}$ ($10^{-3}$), the logical error rate is reduced to $p_{L} = 10^{-6}$ ($10^{-4}$), resulting in an improvement of 2 (1) orders of magnitude. This contributes to reducing both space and time overhead for early FTQC as well as full-fledged FTQC combined with conventional multilevel distillation protocols.",

    "abstract": "Manipulating the electromagnetic spectrum at the single-photon level is fundamental for quantum experiments. In the visible and infrared ranges, this can be accomplished with atomic quantum emitters, and with superconducting qubits such control is extended to the microwave range (below 10 GHz). Meanwhile, the region between these two energy ranges presents an unexplored opportunity for innovation. We bridge this gap by scaling up a superconducting qubit to the millimeter-wave range (near 100 GHz). Working in this energy range greatly reduces sensitivity to thermal noise compared to microwave devices, enabling operation at significantly higher temperatures, up to 1 K. This has many advantages by removing the dependence on rare 3He for refrigeration, simplifying cryogenic systems, and providing orders-of-magnitude higher cooling power, lending the flexibility needed for novel quantum sensing and hybrid experiments. Using low-loss niobium trilayer junctions, we realize a qubit at 72 GHz cooled to 0.87 K using only 4He. We perform Rabi oscillations to establish control over the qubit state, and measure relaxation and dephasing times of 15.8 and 17.4 ns, respectively. This demonstration of a millimeter-wave quantum emitter offers exciting prospects for enhanced sensitivity thresholds in high-frequency photon detection, provides new options for quantum transduction and for scaling up and speeding up quantum computing, enables integration of quantum systems where 3He refrigeration units are impractical, and, importantly, paves the way for quantum experiments exploring a novel energy range.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1=10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations derived from generators of the su(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 s. We also demonstrate that one can harness the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state—including noncommuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the su(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin su(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The Mølmer-Sørensen gate is a widely used entangling gate for ion platforms with inherent robustness to trap heating. The gate performance is limited by coherent errors, arising from the Lamb-Dicke (LD) approximation and sideband errors. Here, we provide explicit analytical formulas for errors up to fourth order in the LD parameter, by using the Magnus expansion to match numerical precision, and overcome significant orders-of-magnitude underestimation of errors by previous theory methods. We show that fourth-order Magnus expansion terms are unavoidable, being in fact leading order in LD, and are therefore critical to include for typical experimental fidelity ranges. We show how these errors can be dramatically reduced compared to previous theory by using analytical renormalization of the drive strength, by calibration of the Lamb-Dicke parameter, and by the use of smooth pulse shaping.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Quantum property preservation (QPP) is the problem of maintaining a target property of a quantum system for as long as possible. This problem arises naturally in the context of open quantum systems subject to decoherence. Here, we develop a general theory to formalize and analyze QPP. We characterize properties encoded as scalar functions of the system state that can be preserved time-locally via continuous control using smoothly varying, time-dependent control Hamiltonians. The theory offers an intuitive geometric interpretation involving the level sets of the target property and the stable and unstable points related to the noise channel. We present solutions for various noise channels and target properties, which are classified as trivially controllable, uncontrollable, or controllable. In the controllable scenario, we demonstrate the existence of control Hamiltonian singularities and breakdown times, beyond which property preservation fails. QPP via Hamiltonian control is complementary to quantum error correction, as it does not require ancilla qubits or rely on measurement and feedback. It is also complementary to dynamical decoupling, since it uses only smooth Hamiltonians without pulsing and works in the regime of Markovian open-system dynamics. From the perspective of control theory, this work addresses the challenge of tracking control for open quantum systems.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

We address this by developing high-yield entanglement distillation protocols with several advancements. (1) We extend the 2-to-1 recurrence entanglement distillation protocol to higher-rate n-to-(n−1) protocols that can correct any single-qubit errors. These protocols are evaluated through numerical simulations focusing on fidelity and yield. We also outline a method to adapt any classical error-correcting code for entanglement distillation, where the code can correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors by incorporating Hadamard gates.

This decoder is applied to entanglement distillation protocols, reducing circuit depth and enabling protocols derived from high-performance quantum error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this by evaluating the circuit complexity for entanglement distillation protocols based on surface codes and quantum convolutional codes.

We propose a fault-tolerant protocol for constant-depth encoding and decoding of arbitrary states in surface codes, with potential extensions to more general quantum low-density parity-check codes.

    "abstract": "Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of realizing a quantum process, such as preparing a state or implementing a unitary. We present an approach to quantifying the thermodynamic resources required to implement a process if the process’s complexity is restricted. We focus on the prototypical task of information erasure, or Landauer erasure, wherein an n-qubit memory is reset to the all-zero state. We show that the minimum thermodynamic work required to reset an arbitrary state in our model, via a complexity-constrained process, is quantified by the state’s . The complexity entropy therefore quantifies a trade-off between the work cost and complexity cost of resetting a state. If the qubits have a nontrivial (but product) Hamiltonian, the optimal work cost is determined by the . The complexity entropy quantifies the amount of randomness a system appears to have to a computationally limited observer. Similarly, the complexity relative entropy quantifies such an observer’s ability to distinguish two states. We prove elementary properties of the complexity (relative) entropy. In a random circuit—a simple model for quantum chaotic dynamics—the complexity entropy transitions from zero to its maximal value around the time corresponding to the observer’s computational-power limit. Also, we identify information-theoretic applications of the complexity entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the resources required for data compression if the compression algorithm must use a restricted number of gates. We further introduce a , which arises naturally in a complexity-constrained variant of information-theoretic decoupling. Assuming that this entropy obeys a conjectured chain rule, we show that the entropy bounds the number of qubits that one can decouple from a reference system, as judged by a computationally bounded referee.

    "abstract": "Sampling problems demonstrating beyond classical computing power with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices have been experimentally realized. In those realizations, however, our trust that the quantum devices faithfully solve the claimed sampling problems is usually limited to simulations of smaller-scale instances and is, therefore, indirect. The problem of verifiable quantum advantage aims to resolve this critical issue and provides us with greater confidence in a claimed advantage. Instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) sampling has been proposed to achieve beyond classical capabilities with a verifiable scheme based on quadratic-residue codes (QRC). Unfortunately, this verification scheme was recently broken by an attack proposed by Kahanamoku-Meyer. In this work, we revive IQP-based verifiable quantum advantage by making two major contributions. Firstly, we introduce a family of IQP sampling protocols called the , which builds on results linking IQP circuits, the stabilizer formalism, coding theory, and an efficient characterization of IQP-circuit correlation functions. This construction extends the scope of existing IQP-based schemes while maintaining their simplicity and verifiability. Secondly, we introduce the (HSC) problem as a well-defined mathematical challenge that underlies the stabilizer scheme. To assess classical security, we explore a class of attacks based on secret extraction, including Kahanamoku-Meyer’s attack as a special case. We provide evidence of the security of the stabilizer scheme, assuming the hardness of the HSC problem. We also point out that the vulnerability observed in the original QRC scheme is primarily attributed to inappropriate parameter choices, which can be naturally rectified with proper parameter settings.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing devices can now perform sampling tasks that, according to complexity-theoretic and numerical evidence, are beyond the reach of classical computers. This raises the question of how one can efficiently verify that a quantum computer operating in this regime works as intended. In 2008, Shepherd and Bremner proposed a protocol in which a verifier constructs a unitary from the comparatively easy-to-implement family of so-called and challenges a prover to execute it on a quantum computer. The challenge problem is designed to contain an obfuscated secret, which can be turned into a statistical test that accepts samples from a correct quantum implementation. It was conjectured that extracting the secret from the challenge problem is -hard, so that the ability to pass the test constitutes strong evidence that the prover possesses a quantum device and that it works as claimed. Unfortunately, about a decade later, Kahanamoku-Meyer found an efficient classical secret-extraction attack. Bremner, Cheng, and Ji very recently followed up by constructing a wide-ranging generalization of the original protocol. Their has been explicitly designed to circumvent the known weakness. They also suggested that the original construction can be made secure by adjusting the problem parameters. In this work, we develop a number of secret-extraction attacks that are effective against both new approaches in a wide range of problem parameters. In particular, we find multiple ways to recover the 300-bit secret hidden in a challenge data set published by Bremner, Cheng, and Ji. The important problem of finding an efficient and reliable verification protocol for sampling-based proofs of quantum advantage thus remains open.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The study of information revivals, witnessing the violation of certain data-processing inequalities, has provided an important paradigm in the study of non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes. Although often used interchangeably, we argue here that the notions of “revivals” and “backflows,” i.e., flows of information from the environment back into the system, are distinct: an information revival can occur without any backflow ever taking place. In this paper, we examine in detail the phenomenon of noncausal revivals and relate them to the theory of short Markov chains and squashed non-Markovianity. We also provide an operational condition, in terms of system-only degrees of freedom, to witness the presence of genuine backflow that cannot be explained by noncausal revivals. As a byproduct, we demonstrate that focusing on processes with genuine backflows, while excluding those with only noncausal revivals, resolves the issue of nonconvexity of Markovianity, thus enabling the construction of a convex resource theory of genuine quantum non-Markovianity.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Measurement correlations in quantum systems can exhibit nonlocal behavior, a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics with applications such as device-independent quantum information processing. However, it is in general not known which states are local and which ones are not. In particular, it remains an outstanding challenge to explicitly construct local hidden-variable (LHV) models for arbitrary multipartite entangled states. To address this, we use gradient-descent algorithms from machine learning to find LHV models that reproduce the statistics of arbitrary measurements for quantum many-body states. In contrast to previous approaches, our method employs a general ansatz, enabling it to discover LHV models for all local states. Therefore, it for example provides actual estimates for the critical noise levels at which two-qubit Werner states and three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states become local. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that two-spin subsystems in the ground states of translationally invariant Hamiltonians are genuinely local, while bigger subsystems are in general not. Our method now offers a quantitative tool for determining the regimes of nonlocality in any given physical context, such as nonequilibrium, decoherence, or disorder.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Advancing quantum sensing tools for investigating atomic and nanoscale systems is crucial for the progress of quantum technologies. While many protocols use quantum probes to extract information from stationary or weakly coupled environments, challenges intensify at the atomic scale and the nanoscale, where the environment is inherently out of equilibrium and/or strongly coupled with the sensor. In this work, we demonstrate that time-reversal symmetry in the control dynamics of a quantum sensor is broken when the qubit sensor interacts with environments that are out of equilibrium (with nonstationary fluctuations), contain quantum non-Gaussian correlations, or exhibit intrinsic time-reversal symmetry breaking. Leveraging this phenomenon, we introduce a quantum sensing paradigm based on time-asymmetric dynamical control sequences, enabling the probing of the distance of an environment from equilibrium, its time-reversal symmetry-breaking behavior, or its quantum non-Gaussian nature. Additionally, we propose sensing strategies to distinguish between these different sources of symmetry breaking. We validate our approach through proof-of-principle experimental quantum simulations using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, where we drive the environment of a qubit sensor out of equilibrium and use our protocol to quantify the nonstationary characteristics of the generated states. Our findings highlight the potential of this framework for quantifying nonstationary behavior, designing tailored pump-probe experiments (including measurements of quantum information scrambling), and detecting quantum states that exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, time-crystal structures, or quantum non-Gaussian fluctuations.

    "abstract": "Connecting two half-filled quantum dots to two superconducting leads induces a competition of bonds, with the dots forming either an interdot exchange bond or two individual Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) screening bonds with the leads. Defining a qubit using these singlet-parity bonding states provides dot-charge-noise protection, attributed to the chargeless nature of the screening quasiparticles, and magnetic noise protection, as the bonds guard against magnetic polarization. In this paper, we propose embedding a double-quantum-dot (DQD) Josephson junction in parallel with a transmon to enable circuit-quantum-electrodynamics (cQED) measurements and operation of a YSR-bond qubit. We demonstrate that, under realistic parameters, two-tone spectroscopy of the DQD can be performed, revealing a significant parameter regime suitable for qubit operation. Additionally, coherent manipulations of the bond states can be achieved through dot gates and single-shot readout is enabled by measurements of a capacitively coupled resonator. Finally, we analyze noise sources and estimate gate noise on couplings as the primary source of qubit decoherence. Since this qubit is protected against nuclear Overhauser fields and does not rely on spin-orbit interactions for operation, a broader range of material platforms becomes available compared to current Andreev spin qubits.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr\\\"obner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \\leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, \\leq 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360, 12, \\leq 24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.",

    "abstract": "The resource overhead required to achieve net computational benefits from quantum error correction (QEC) limits its utility while current systems remain constrained in size, despite exceptional progress in experimental demonstrations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the strategic application of QEC primitives without logical encoding can yield significant advantages on superconducting processors—relative to any alternative error-reduction strategy—while only requiring a modest overhead. We first present a novel protocol for implementing long-range gates that relies on a unitarily prepared Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as well as a unitary disentangling step; the protocol natively introduces an error-detection process using the disentangled qubits as flags. We demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art gate fidelities of over 85% across up to 40 lattice sites, significantly and consistently outperforming the best alternative measurement-based protocol without introducing any additional ancilla qubits. We then apply sparse stabilizer measurements to generate large GHZ states by detecting bit-flip and amplitude-damping errors. Employing this technique in combination with deterministic error suppression, we generate a 75-qubit GHZ state exhibiting genuine multipartite entanglement, the largest reported to date. The generation requires no more than 9 ancilla qubits and the fraction of samples discarded due to errors grows no higher than 78%, far lower than previous discard fractions required for tests using comparable numbers of fully encoded qubits. This work in total represents compelling evidence that adopting QEC primitives on current-generation devices can deliver substantial net benefits.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Dissipative cat qubits are a promising physical platform for quantum computing, since their large noise bias can enable more hardware-efficient quantum error correction. In this work we theoretically study the long-term prospects of a hybrid cat-transmon quantum computing architecture where dissipative cat qubits play the role of data qubits, and error syndromes are measured using ancillary transmon qubits. The cat qubits’ noise bias enables more hardware-efficient quantum error correction, and the use of transmons allows for practical, high-fidelity syndrome measurement. While correction of the dominant cat <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><a:mi>Z</a:mi></a:math> errors with a repetition code has recently been demonstrated in experiment, here we show how the architecture can be scaled beyond a repetition code.

For example, with current state-of-the-art coherence, physical error rates of <e:math xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><e:msup><e:mn>10</e:mn><e:mrow><e:mo>−</e:mo><e:mn>3</e:mn></e:mrow></e:msup></e:math> and noise biases in the range <g:math xmlns:g=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><g:msup><g:mn>10</g:mn><g:mn>3</g:mn></g:msup></g:math>–<i:math xmlns:i=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><i:msup><i:mn>10</i:mn><i:mn>4</i:mn></i:msup></i:math> are achievable. With this level of performance, the qubit overhead required to reach algorithmically relevant logical error rates with the cat-transmon architecture matches that of an unbiased-noise architecture with physical error rates in the range <k:math xmlns:k=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><k:msup><k:mn>10</k:mn><k:mrow><k:mo>−</k:mo><k:mn>5</k:mn></k:mrow></k:msup></k:math>–<m:math xmlns:m=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><m:msup><m:mn>10</m:mn><m:mrow><m:mo>−</m:mo><m:mn>4</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup></m:math>.

    "abstract": "While experimental measurements of photon correlations have become routine in laboratories, theoretical access to these quantities for the light generated in complex nanophotonic devices remains a major challenge. Current methods are limited to specific simplified cases and lack generality. Here we present a novel method that provides access to photon statistics resolved in space and frequency in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. Within the macroscopic QED framework, we develop a practical tool to compute electric field correlations for complex quantum systems by including lossy two-level systems that act as field detectors within the system. To make the implementation feasible, we use a recently developed multi-emitter few-mode quantization method to correctly account for fully retarded light propagation to the detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique by studying the photon correlations of one and two emitters in close proximity to a plasmonic nanoparticle. The simulations show that even in these relatively simple configurations, the light statistics exhibit a strong angular dependence. These results highlight the importance of going beyond conventional quantum-optical approaches to fully capture the analyzed physical effects and enable the study of the quantum light generation in realistic nanophotonic devices.",

The frequency entanglement of the two photons arises from the particle-hole coherent superposition (i.e., Andreev bound states) involving the delocalized entangled spin singlet.

We introduce a novel algorithm that combines tensor networks and quantum computation to produce results that are more accurate than what could be achieved by either method used in isolation. Our algorithm is based on multiproduct formulas (MPF) - a technique that linearly combines Trotter product formulas to reduce algorithmic error. Our algorithm uses a quantum computer to calculate the expectation values and tensor networks to calculate the coefficients used in the linear combination.

    "abstract": "Fault-tolerant implementation of non-Clifford gates is a major challenge for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with quantum error-correcting codes. Magic state distillation is the most well-studied method for this but requires significant resources. Hence, it is crucial to tailor and optimize magic state distillation for specific codes from both logical- and physical-level perspectives. In this work, we perform such optimization for two-dimensional color codes, which are promising due to their higher encoding rates compared to surface codes, transversal implementation of Clifford gates, and efficient lattice surgery. We propose two carefully designed distillation schemes based on the 15-to-1 distillation circuit and lattice surgery, differing in their methods for handling faulty rotations. Our first scheme employs faulty T-measurement, achieving infidelities of $O(p^3)$ for physical noise strength $p$. To achieve lower infidelities, our second scheme integrates distillation with 'cultivation' (a distillation-free approach to fault-tolerantly prepare magic states through transversal Clifford measurements). Our second scheme achieves significantly lower infidelities (e.g., $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-16}$ at $p = 10^{-3}$), surpassing the capabilities of both cultivation and single-level distillation. Notably, to reach a given target infidelity, our schemes require approximately two orders of magnitude fewer resources than the previous best magic state distillation schemes for color codes.",

    "abstract": "Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible—to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear-spin baths in solids.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "We study a one-dimensional lattice system of free fermions subjected to a generalized measurement process: the system exchanges particles with its environment, but each fermion leaving or entering the system is counted. In contrast to the freezing of dynamics due to frequent measurements of lattice site occupation numbers, a high rate of fermion counts induces fast fluctuations in the state of the system. Still, through numerical simulations of quantum trajectories and an analytical approach based on replica Keldysh field theory, we find that instantaneous correlations and entanglement properties of free fermions subjected to fermion counting and local occupation measurements are strikingly similar. We explain this similarity through a generalized Zeno effect induced by fermion counting and a universal long-wavelength description in terms of a nonlinear sigma model. The physical requirements underlying this universal emergent behavior are conservation of the total number of particles in the system and its environment, and conservation of the purity of the state of the system by keeping a full record of all measurement outcomes. For both types of measurement processes, we present strong evidence against the existence of a critical phase with logarithmic entanglement and conformal invariance. Instead, we identify a finite critical range of length scales on which signatures of conformal invariance are observable. While area-law entanglement is established beyond a scale that is exponentially large in the measurement rate, the upper boundary of the critical range is only algebraically large and thus numerically accessible. Our finding that these properties do not rely on particle number conservation has far reaching implications for measurement-induced phenomena beyond noninteracting fermions, such as charge sharpening in random quantum circuits or generic interacting systems.",

Many such platforms offer a limited set of calibrated gates and compile all other gates using combinations of X-type and vz gates. Here, we show that the method of compilation has important consequences in an open quantum system setting. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate that it is crucial to choose a compilation that is symmetric with respect to vz rotations. An important example is dynamical-decoupling (DD) sequences, where improper gate decomposition can result in unintended effects such as the implementation of the wrong sequence. Our findings indicate that in many cases the performance of DD is adversely affected by the incorrect use of vz gates, compounding other coherent pulse errors. This holds even for DD sequences designed to be robust against systematic control errors. In addition, we identify another source of coherent errors: interference between consecutive pulses that follow each other too closely. This work provides insights into improving general quantum gate performance and optimizing DD sequences in particular.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.",

Efficient schemes to simultaneously mediate coherent interactions between multiple quantum systems and to reduce decoherence errors can minimize the control overhead in next-generation quantum processors. Here, we present a superconducting qubit architecture based on tunable parametric interactions to perform two-qubit gates, reset, leakage recovery and to read out the qubits. In this architecture, parametrically driven multi-element couplers selectively couple qubits to resonators and neighbouring qubits, according to the frequency of the drive. We consider a system with two qubits and one readout resonator interacting via a single coupling circuit and experimentally demonstrate a controlled-Z gate with a fidelity of $98.30\\pm 0.23 \\%$, a reset operation that unconditionally prepares the qubit ground state with a fidelity of $99.80\\pm 0.02 \\%$ and a leakage recovery operation with a $98.5\\pm 0.3 \\%$ success probability. Furthermore, we implement a parametric readout with a single-shot assignment fidelity of $88.0\\pm 0.4 \\%$. These operations are all realized using a single tunable coupler, demonstrating the experimental feasibility of the proposed architecture and its potential for reducing the system complexity in scalable quantum processors.",

However, such a situation is unphysical, as it would require infinite resources, so one needs to impose some additional constraint: typically the average energy employed by the probe is finite. Here we treat both energy and time as a resource, showing that, in the presence of noise, there is a nontrivial interplay between the average energy and the time devoted to the estimation. Our results are valid for the most general metrological schemes (e.g., adaptive schemes, which may involve entanglement with external ancillae or any kind of continuous measurement). We apply recently derived precision bounds for all parameters characterizing the paradigmatic case of a bosonic mode, subject to Lindbladian noise. We show how the time employed in the estimation should be partitioned in order to achieve the best possible precision. In most cases, the optimal performance may be obtained without the necessity of adaptivity or entanglement with ancilla. We compare results with classical strategies. Interestingly, for temperature estimation, applying a fast-prepare-and-measure protocol with Fock states provides better scaling with the number of photons than any classical strategy.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Sensing a magnetic field with an atomic magnetometer operated in real time presents significant challenges, primarily due to sensor non-linearity, the presence of noise, and the need for one-shot estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive approach that integrates measurement, estimation and control strategies. Specifically, this involves implementing a quantum non-demolition measurement based on continuous light-probing of the atomic ensemble. The resulting photocurrent is then directed into an Extended Kalman Filter to produce instantaneous estimates of the system's dynamical parameters. These estimates, in turn, are utilised by a Linear Quadratic Regulator, whose output is applied back to the system through a feedback loop. This procedure automatically steers the atomic ensemble into a spin-squeezed state, yielding a quantum enhancement in precision. Furthermore, thanks to the feedback proposed, the atoms exhibit entanglement even when the measurement data is discarded. To prove that our approach constitutes the optimal strategy in realistic scenarios, we derive ultimate bounds on the estimation error applicable in the presence of both local and collective decoherence, and show that these are indeed attained. Additionally, we demonstrate that for large ensembles the EKF not only reliably predicts its own estimation error in real time, but also accurately estimates spin-squeezing at short timescales.",

While protocols have previously been suggested for this task, their exponential sample complexity renders them unpractical even for intermediate-scale quantum systems. In this work, we propose a novel protocol for this task based on Pauli sampling, a subroutine which generates Paulis distributed according to their weight in the expansion of a quantum state in the Pauli basis. We show that our protocols for both Pauli sampling and cross-platform verification are efficient for pure states with low magic and entanglement (i.e., of the order $O(\\log n)$). Conversely, we show super-polynomial lower bounds on the complexity of both tasks for states with $\\omega(\\log n)$ magic and entanglement. Interestingly, when considering states with real amplitudes the requirements of our protocol for cross-platform verification can be significantly weakened.",

    "abstract": "Quantum transmission links are central elements in essentially all protocols involving the exchange of quantum messages. Emerging progress in quantum technologies involving such links needs to be accompanied by appropriate certification tools. In adversarial scenarios, a certification method can be vulnerable to attacks if too much trust is placed on the underlying system. Here, we propose a protocol in a device-independent framework, which allows for the certification of practical quantum transmission links in scenarios in which minimal assumptions are made about the functioning of the certification setup. In particular, we take unavoidable transmission losses into account by modeling the link as a completely positive trace-decreasing map. We also, crucially, remove the assumption of independent identically distributed samples, which is known to be incompatible with adversarial settings. Particular emphasis is put on a one-sided device-independent scenario, in which the sender possesses trusted resources. Finally, in view of the use of the certified transmitted states for follow-up applications, our protocol moves beyond certification of the channel to allow us to estimate the quality of the transmitted quantum message itself. To illustrate the practical relevance and the feasibility of our protocol with currently available technology, we provide an experimental implementation in the one-sided device-independent setting, based on a state-of-the-art polarization-entangled photon-pair source in a Sagnac configuration, and analyze its robustness for realistic losses and errors.",

These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.",

To fulfill their prospects, quantum simulators must be fully controllable, allowing for precise tuning of the microscopic physical parameters that define their implementation. We consider Rydberg-atom arrays, a promising platform for quantum simulations. Experimental control of such arrays is limited by the imprecision on the optical tweezers positions when assembling the array, hence introducing uncertainties in the simulated Hamiltonian. In this work, we introduce a scalable approach to Hamiltonian learning using graph neural networks (GNNs). We employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) to generate ground-state snapshots of the transverse field Ising model realized by the array, for many realizations of the Hamiltonian parameters. Correlation functions reconstructed from these snapshots serve as input data to carry out the training. We demonstrate that our GNN model has a remarkable capacity to extrapolate beyond its training domain, both regarding the size and the shape of the system, yielding an accurate determination of the Hamiltonian parameters with a minimal set of measurements. We prove a theorem establishing a bijective correspondence between the correlation functions and the interaction parameters in the Hamiltonian, which provides a theoretical foundation to our learning algorithm. Our work could open the road to feedback control of the positions of the optical tweezers, hence providing a decisive improvement of analog quantum simulators.",

    "abstract": "Kerr-cat qubits are bosonic qubits offering autonomous bit-flip protection, traditionally studied using driven superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element (SNAIL) oscillators. Here, we theoretically explore an alternative circuit for Kerr-cat qubits based on symmetrically threaded superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). The symmetrically threaded SQUID (STS) architecture employs a simplified flux-pumped design that suppresses two-photon dissipation, a dominant loss mechanism in high-Kerr regimes, by engineering the drive Hamiltonian’s flux operator to generate only even-order harmonics. By fulfilling two critical criteria for practical Kerr-cat qubit operation, the STS emerges as an ideal platform: (1) a static Hamiltonian with diluted Kerr nonlinearity (achieved via the STS’s middle branch) and (2) a drive Hamiltonian restricted to even harmonics, which ensures robust two-photon driving with reduced dissipation. For weak Kerr nonlinearity, we find that the coherent state lifetime (Tα) is similar between STS and SNAIL circuits. However, STS Kerr-cat qubits exhibit enhanced resistance to higher-order photon dissipation, enabling significantly extended Tα even with stronger Kerr nonlinearities (approximately 10 MHz). In contrast to SNAIL, STS Kerr-cat qubits display a Tα dip under weak two-photon driving for a high Kerr coefficient. We demonstrate that this dip can be suppressed by applying drive-dependent detuning, enabling Kerr-cat qubit operation with only eight Josephson junctions (of energies 80 GHz); fewer junctions suffice for higher junction energies. We further validate the robustness of the STS design by studying the impact of strong flux driving and asymmetric Josephson junctions on Tα. With the proposed design and considering a cat size of ten photons, we predict Tα of the order of tens of milliseconds, even in the presence of multiphoton heating and dephasing effects. The robustness of the STS Kerr-cat qubit makes it a promising component for fault-tolerant quantum processors.",

In quantum thermodynamics, the same law applies when considering multipartite product thermal states evolving unitarily. If initial correlations are present, anomalous heat flow can happen, temporarily making cold thermal states colder and hot thermal states hotter. Such an effect can happen due to entanglement but also because of classical randomness, hence lacking a direct connection with nonclassicality. In this work, we introduce scenarios in which anomalous heat flow have a direct link to nonclassicality, defined as the failure of noncontextual models to explain experimental data. We start by extending known noncontextuality inequalities to a setup in which sequential transformations are considered. We then show a class of quantum prepare-transform-measure protocols, characterized by a time interval (0,τc) for a given critical time τc, where anomalous heat flow happens only if a noncontextuality inequality is violated. We also analyze a recent experiment from and find the critical time τc based on the authors’ experimental parameters. We conclude by investigating heat flow in the evolution of two-qudit systems, showing that our findings are not an artifact of using two-qubit systems.",

However, efficient and reliable reconstruction of nontrivial quantum states in the presence of hardware imperfections can be challenging. This task is particularly demanding for high-dimensional states encoded in continuous-variable (CV) systems, where a large number of grid-based measurements are often used to adequately sample relevant regions of phase space. In this work, we introduce an efficient and robust technique of optimized reconstruction with excitation-number sampling (ORENS) based on the idea of the generalized Q function. We use a standard bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) setup to experimentally demonstrate effective state reconstruction using the theoretically minimum number of measurements. Our investigation highlights that ORENS is naturally free of parasitic system dynamics and resilient to decoherence effects in the hardware, enabling it to outperform the conventional reconstruction techniques in cQED such as Wigner tomography. Finally, ORENS relies only on the ability to accurately measure the excitation number of a given CV state, making it a versatile and accessible tool for a wide range of CV platforms and readily scalable to multimode systems.

Specifically, we demonstrate this protocol in the context of phase estimation using the superposition of coherent states in the bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platform. With low average photon numbers of only up to 1.76, we achieve quantum enhanced precision approaching the Heisenberg scaling, reaching a metrological gain of 7.5(6) dB. Importantly, we show that the gain or sensitivity range can be further enhanced on the fly by tailoring the input states, with different superposition weights, based on specific system constraints.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has been pursued with various hardware platforms and an optical system is one of the most reasonable choices for large-scale computation. In the optical continuous-variable computation scheme, the incorporation of Gaussian gates and a highly nonclassical non-Gaussian state enables universal quantum computation. Although basic technologies for Gaussian gates and non-Gaussian state generation have long been developed, these building blocks have not yet been integrated in a scalable fashion. Here, we integrate them to develop a scalable and programmable optical quantum computing platform that can sequentially perform an essential Gaussian gate, the squeezing gate, on a non-Gaussian input state. The key enablers are a loop-based optical circuit with dynamical and programmable controllability and its time synchronization with the probabilistic non-Gaussian state generation. We verify the deterministic, programmable, and repeatable quantum gates on a typical non-Gaussian state by implementing up to three-step gates. The gates implemented are of such high quality that strong evidence of the nonclassicalities of the states, the negativities of the Wigner functions, are preserved even after multistep gates. This platform is compatible with other non-Gaussian states and can in principle realize large-scale universal quantum computing by incorporating other existing processing technologies.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Highly entangled multiphoton graph states are a crucial resource in photonic quantum computation and communication. Yet, the lack of photon-photon interactions makes the construction of such graph states especially challenging. Typically, these states are produced through probabilistic single-photon sources and linear-optics entangling operations that require indistinguishable photons. The resulting inefficiency of these methods necessitates a large overhead in the number of sources and operations, creating a major bottleneck in the photonic approach. Here, we show how harnessing single-atom-based photonic operations can enable deterministic generation of photonic graph states, while also lifting the requirement for photon indistinguishability. To this end, we introduce a multigate quantum node comprising a single atom in a W-type level scheme coupled to an optical resonator. This configuration provides a versatile toolbox for generating graph states, allowing the operation of both the controlled-Z and photon-atom gates, as well as the deterministic generation of single photons. Furthermore, the ability to deterministically entangle photonic qubits enables the expansion of the generated state by stitching together graph states produced by different nodes. We investigate the implementation of this gate-based approach using 87Rb atoms and evaluate its performance through numerical simulations.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "In quantum mechanics, measuring the expectation value of a general observable has an inherent statistical uncertainty that is quantified by variance or mean squared error of measurement outcome. While the uncertainty can be reduced by averaging several samples, the number of samples should be minimized when each sample is very costly. This is especially the case for fault-tolerant quantum computing that involves measurement of multiple observables of nontrivial states in large quantum systems that exceed the capabilities of classical computers. In this work, we provide an adaptive quantum algorithm for estimating the expectation values of M general observables within root mean squared error ε simultaneously, using O(ε−1Mlog﻿M) queries to a state preparation oracle of a target state. This remarkably achieves the scaling of Heisenberg limit 1/ε, a fundamental bound on the estimation precision in terms of mean squared error, together with the sublinear scaling of the number of observables M. The proposed method is an adaptive version of the quantum gradient-estimation algorithm and has a resource-efficient implementation due to its adaptiveness. Specifically, the space overhead in the proposed method is O(M), which is independent from the estimation precision ε unlike noniterative algorithms. In addition, our method can avoid the numerical instability problem for constructing quantum circuits in a large-scale task (e.g., ε≪1 in our case), which appears in the actual implementation of many algorithms relying on quantum signal processing techniques. Our method paves a new way to precisely understand and predict various physical properties in complicated quantum systems using quantum computers.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Finding the ground energy of a quantum system is a fundamental problem in condensed-matter physics and quantum chemistry. Existing classical algorithms for tackling this problem often assume that the ground state has a succinct classical description, i.e., a poly-size classical circuit for computing the amplitude. Notable examples of succinct states encompass matrix product states, contractible projected-entangled-pair states, and states that can be represented by classical neural networks. We study the complexity of the local Hamiltonian problem (LHP) with a succinct ground state. We prove that this problem is MA-complete. The Hamiltonian that we consider is general and might not be stoquastic. The MA verification protocol is based on the fixed-node quantum Monte Carlo method, particularly the variant of the continuous-time Markov chain introduced by Bravyi, Carleo, Gosset, and Liu. Based on our work, we also introduce a notion of strong guided states and conjecture that the LHP with a strong guided state is MA-complete, which will be in contrast with the QCMA-complete result of the LHP with standard guided states.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the spurious heating of the ancilla has impeded progress toward fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has so far only been realized with tunable couplers or additional parametric drives. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a three-dimensional post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. The intricate energy-level structure of this system results in a complex landscape of interactions, the sign of which can be tuned by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop without the need for additional elements.

    "abstract": "Quantum error mitigation is a key approach for extracting target state properties on state-of-the-art noisy machines and early fault-tolerant devices. Using the ideas from flag fault tolerance and virtual state purification, we develop the virtual-channel-purification (VCP) protocol, which consumes similar qubit and gate resources as virtual state purification but offers stronger error suppression with increased system size and more noisy operation copies. The application of VCP does not require specific knowledge about the target quantum state, the target problem and the gate noise model in the target circuit, and can still offer rigorous performance guarantees for practical noise regimes as long as the noise is incoherent. Further connections are made between VCP and quantum error correction to produce the virtual error-correction (VEC) protocol, one of the first protocols that combine quantum error correction (QEC) and quantum error mitigation beyond directly applying error-mitigation protocols on top of logical qubits. Assuming perfect syndrome extraction, VEC can virtually remove all correctable noise in the channel while paying only the same sampling cost as low-order purification. It can achieve QEC-level protection on an unencoded register when transmitting it through a noisy channel, removing the associated encoding qubit overhead. Another variant of VEC can mimic the error-suppression power of the surface code by inputting only a bit-flip and a phase-flip code. Our protocol can also be adapted to key tasks in quantum networks like channel capacity activation and entanglement distribution.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a variety of unique features rooted in the presence of exceptional points (EPs). The distinct topological structure in the proximity of an EP gives rise to counterintuitive behaviors absent in Hermitian systems, which emerge after encircling the EP either quasistatically or dynamically. However, experimental exploration of EP encirclement in quantum systems, particularly those involving high-order EPs, remains challenging due to the difficulty of coherently controlling more degrees of freedom. In this work, we experimentally investigate the eigenvalue braiding and state transfer arising from the encirclement of EP in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum system using superconducting circuits. We characterize the second- and third-order EPs through the coalescence of eigenvalues. Then we reveal the topological structure near the EP3 by quasistatically encircling it along various paths with three independent parameters, which yields the eigenvalue braiding described by the braid group B3. Additionally, we observe chiral state transfer between three eigenstates under a fast driving scheme when no EPs are enclosed, while time-symmetric behavior occurs when at least one EP is encircled. Our findings offer insights into understanding non-Hermitian topological structures and the manipulation of quantum states through dynamic operations.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT state with subsystem symmetry S and global symmetry G corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT phase with strong S and weak G symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wave function of an SSPT state can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT phase. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wave functions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPT phases that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure-state analogues. We show that strange correlators and twisted Rényi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and we explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPT phases. Furthermore, we discuss several implications of this holographic duality, including a method for preparing intrinsic mSPT phases through the duality.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "We introduce two quantitative measures of the strength of causal relations in quantum theory and more general physical theories. These two measures, called the maximum and minimum causal effect, quantify the maximum and minimum changes in the output of a quantum process induced by changes in its input. The maximum and minimum causal effect possesses useful properties, such as continuity and data-processing inequality. In quantum theory, they have close connections with quantum information tasks. The maximum quantum causal effect can be used to detect quantum channels with nonzero capacity for transmitting classical information. The minimum causal effect can be used to guarantee the recoverability of quantum information: every quantum process with a high value of the minimum quantum causal effect can be approximately inverted. Moreover, we show that the quantum causal effects satisfy a duality relation: if the minimum causal effect of a quantum system A on another quantum system B is high, then A must have a low value of the maximum causal effect on any other quantum system B′ that is spacelike separated with B. This duality implies a monogamy relation for quantum causal effects, and represents a fundamental difference between quantum and classical causal relations. We illustrate the application of the maximum causal effect to the analysis of two paradigmatic examples, the first involving a coherent superposition of direct cause and common cause, and the second involving a coherent superposition of multiple quantum processes.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "The performance of quantum computers is hindered by decoherence and crosstalk, which cause errors and limit the ability to perform long computations. Dynamical decoupling is a technique that alleviates these issues by applying carefully timed pulses to individual qubits, effectively suppressing unwanted interactions. However, as quantum devices grow in size, it becomes increasingly important to minimize the time required to implement dynamical decoupling across the entire system. Here, we present\"Chromatic-Hadamard Dynamical Decoupling\"(CHaDD), an approach that efficiently schedules dynamical decoupling pulses for quantum devices with arbitrary qubit connectivity. By leveraging Hadamard matrices, CHaDD achieves a circuit depth that scales linearly with the chromatic number of the connectivity graph for general two-qubit interactions, assuming instantaneous pulses. This includes ZZ crosstalk, which is prevalent in superconducting QPUs. CHaDD's scaling represents an exponential improvement over all previous multi-qubit decoupling schemes for devices with connectivity graphs whose chromatic number grows at most polylogarithmically with the number of qubits. For graphs with a constant chromatic number, CHaDD's scaling is independent of the number of qubits. We report on experiments we have conducted using IBM QPUs that confirm the advantage conferred by CHaDD. Our results suggest that CHaDD can become a useful tool for enhancing the performance and scalability of quantum computers by efficiently suppressing decoherence and crosstalk across large qubit arrays.",

In this work, we describe how learning algorithms can empirically tailor DD strategies for any quantum circuit and device. We use a genetic algorithm-inspired search to optimize DD (GADD) strategies for IBM's superconducting-qubit based quantum processors. In all observed experimental settings, we find that empirically learned DD strategies significantly improve error suppression relative to canonical sequences, with relative improvement increasing with problem size and circuit sophistication. We leverage this to study mirror randomized benchmarking on 100 qubits, GHZ state preparation on 50 qubits, and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm on 27 qubits. We further demonstrate that our empirical learning method finds strategies, in time constant with increasing circuit width and depth, that provide stable performance over long periods of time without retraining and generalize to larger circuits when trained on small sub-circuit structures.",

    "abstract": "Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error-correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom-array architecture, constituting what we call a of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of ⟦2D,D,2⟧ quantum error-detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-D instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom-array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-D IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide strong evidence that sampling from these hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate even at relatively low depths. We analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity and, depending on the local noise rate, find two different asymptotic regimes. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-4 IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of ⟦O(dD),D,d⟧ color codes of increasing distance d, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

Still, the circuits required for quantum error correction introduce significant overhead and sometimes inject more errors than they correct. In this work, we introduce adaptive syndrome extraction as a scheme to improve code performance and reduce the quantum error correction cycle time by measuring only the stabilizer generators that are likely to provide useful syndrome information. We provide a concrete example of the scheme through the [[4,2,2]] code concatenated with a hypergraph product code and a syndrome extraction cycle that uses quantum error detection to modify the syndrome extraction circuits in real time. Compared to non-concatenated codes and non-adaptive syndrome extraction, we find that the adaptive scheme achieves over an order of magnitude lower logical error rates while requiring fewer CNOT gates and physical qubits. Furthermore, we show how to achieve fault-tolerant universal logical computation with [[4,2,2]]-concatenated hypergraph product codes.",

    "abstract": "Exploiting inherent symmetries is a common and effective approach to speed up the simulation of quantum systems. However, efficiently accounting for non-Abelian symmetries, such as the global SU(2) spin symmetry, remains a major challenge. In fact, expressing total-spin eigenstates in terms of the computational basis can require an exponentially large number of coefficients. In this work, we introduce a novel formalism for designing quantum algorithms directly in an eigenbasis of the total-spin operator. Our strategy relies on the symmetric group approach in conjunction with a truncation scheme for the internal degrees of freedom of total-spin eigenstates. For the case of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, we show that this formalism yields a hierarchy of spin-adapted Hamiltonians, for each truncation threshold, whose ground-state energy and wave function quickly converge to their exact counterparts, calculated on the full model. These truncated Hamiltonians can be encoded with sparse and local qubit Hamiltonians that are suitable for quantum simulations. We demonstrate this by developing a state-preparation schedule to construct shallow quantum-circuit approximations, expressed in a total-spin eigenbasis, for the ground states of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in different symmetry sectors.

    "abstract": "How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific nonrelativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter’s constituents. We develop the necessary nonequilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges, which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator’s quantum state. This emergent structure becomes nontrivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularizes the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

To realize high-fidelity communication, it is essential to control the frequency and temporal shape of the microwave photon. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of frequency-tunable shaped microwave photons without resorting to any frequency-tunable circuit element. We develop a framework that treats a microwave resonator as a band-pass filter mediating the interaction between a superconducting qubit and the modes in the transmission line. This interpretation allows us to stimulate the photon emission by an off-resonant drive signal. We characterize how the frequency and temporal shape of the generated photon depends on the frequency and amplitude of the drive signal. By modulating the drive amplitude and frequency, we achieve a frequency tunability of 40 MHz while maintaining the photon mode shape time symmetric. Through measurements of the quadrature amplitudes of the emitted photons, we demonstrate a consistently high state and process fidelities around 95% across the tunable frequency range. Our hardware-efficient approach eliminates the need for additional biasing lines typically required for frequency tuning, offering a simplified architecture for scalable quantum communication.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

Here, we discuss how to perform such a regularization of scalar QFTs by explicitly constructing suitable many-body lattice Hamiltonians using multi-level or qudit systems, and show that this enables quantitative predictions in the continuum limit by extrapolating results obtained for large-spin models. With extensive matrix-product state simulations, we numerically demonstrate the sequence of extrapolations that leads to quantitative agreement of observables for the integrable sine-Gordon (sG) QFT. We further show how to prepare static and moving soliton excitations, and analyze their scattering dynamics in the continuum limit, in agreement with a semi-classical model and with quantitative analytical predictions. Finally, we illustrate how a non-integrable perturbation of the sG model gives rise to dynamics reminiscent of string breaking and plasma oscillations in gauge theories. Our methods are directly applicable in state-of-the-art analog quantum simulators, opening the door to quantitatively investigating a wide variety of scalar field theories and tackling long-standing questions in non-equilibrium QFT like the fate of the false vacuum.",

    "abstract": "Free-fermionic states, also known as fermionic Gaussian states, represent an important class of quantum states ubiquitous in physics. They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.",

    "abstract": "Quantum metrology aims to maximize measurement precision on quantum systems, with a wide range of applications in quantum sensing. Achieving the Heisenberg limit (HL) - the fundamental precision bound set by quantum mechanics - is often hindered by noise-induced decoherence, which typically reduces achievable precision to the standard quantum limit (SQL). While quantum error correction (QEC) can recover the HL under Markovian noise, its applicability to non-Markovian noise remains less explored. In this work, we analyze a hidden Markov model in which a quantum probe, coupled to an inaccessible environment, undergoes joint evolution described by Lindbladian dynamics, with the inaccessible degrees of freedom serving as a memory. We derive generalized Knill-Laflamme conditions for the hidden Markov model and establish three types of sufficient conditions for achieving the HL under non-Markovian noise using QEC. Additionally, we demonstrate the attainability of the SQL when these sufficient conditions are violated, by analytical solutions for special cases and numerical methods for general scenarios. Our results not only extend prior QEC frameworks for metrology but also provide new insights into precision limits under realistic noise conditions.",

Here, we address the converse question: given a quantum error correcting code, when does it define a stable gapped quantum phase of matter, whose ground state degeneracy is robust against perturbations in the thermodynamic limit? We prove that a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code defines such a phase, robust against all few-body perturbations, if its code distance grows at least logarithmically in the number of degrees of freedom, and it exhibits\"check soundness\". Many constant-rate quantum LDPC expander codes have such properties, and define stable phases of matter with a constant zero-temperature entropy density, violating the third law of thermodynamics. Our results also show that quantum toric code phases are robust to spatially nonlocal few-body perturbations. Similarly, phases of matter defined by classical codes are stable against symmetric perturbations. In the classical setting, we present improved locality bounds on the quasiadiabatic evolution operator between two nearby states in the same code phase.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-13]. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation may greatly extend runtimes for useful, large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single-qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with 0.9(3)% loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure a state-of-the-art CZ fidelity of 99.73(3)% when excluding atom-loss events, which may be mitigated through erasure conversion. Our results represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.",

    "abstract": "We present and experimentally implement a real-time protocol for calibrating the frequency of a resonantly driven qubit, achieving exponential scaling in calibration precision with the number of measurements, up to the limit imposed by decoherence. The real-time processing capabilities of a classical controller dynamically generate adaptive probing sequences for qubit-frequency estimation. Each probing evolution time and drive frequency are calculated to divide the prior probability distribution into two branches, following a locally optimal strategy that mimics a conventional binary search. The scheme does not require repeated measurements at the same setting, as it accounts for state preparation and measurement errors. Its use of a parametrized probability distribution favors numerical accuracy and computational speed. We show the efficacy of the algorithm by stabilizing a flux-tunable transmon qubit, leading to improved coherence and gate fidelity. As benchmarked by gate-set tomography, the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) powered control electronics partially mitigates non-Markovian noise, which is detrimental to quantum error correction. The mitigation is achieved by dynamically updating and feeding forward the qubit frequency. Our protocol highlights the importance of feedback in improving the calibration and stability of qubits subject to drift and can be readily applied to other qubit platforms.",

    "abstract": "Unitary $k$-designs are distributions of unitary gates that match the Haar distribution up to its $k$-th statistical moment. They are a crucial resource for randomized quantum protocols. However, their implementation on encoded logical qubits is nontrivial due to the need for magic gates, which can require a large resource overhead. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to generate unitary designs for encoded qubits in surface codes by applying local unitary rotations (\"coherent errors\") on the physical qubits followed by syndrome measurement and error correction. We prove that under some conditions on the coherent errors (notably including all single-qubit unitaries) and on the error correcting code, this process induces a unitary transformation of the logical subspace. We numerically show that the ensemble of logical unitaries (indexed by the random syndrome outcomes) converges to a unitary design in the thermodynamic limit, provided the density or strength of coherent errors is above a finite threshold. This\"unitary design\"phase transition coincides with the code's coherent error threshold under optimal decoding. Furthermore, we propose a classical algorithm to simulate the protocol based on a\"staircase\"implementation of the surface code encoder and decoder circuits. This enables a mapping to a 1+1D monitored circuit, where we observe an entanglement phase transition (and thus a classical complexity phase transition of the decoding algorithm) coinciding with the aforementioned unitary design phase transition. Our results provide a practical way to realize unitary designs on encoded qubits, with applications including quantum state tomography and benchmarking in error correcting codes.",

    "abstract": "One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (<a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><a:msup><a:mi>FL</a:mi><a:mo>∗</a:mo></a:msup></a:math>) and orthogonal metal (OM) phases.

With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative scenario: an orthogonal metal with a geometric origin (GOM) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to <e:math xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><e:msub><e:mrow><e:mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">Z</e:mi></e:mrow><e:mn>2</e:mn></e:msub></e:math> topological excitations of the domain-wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GOM framework establishes a deep connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron- and hole-) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.",

We introduce a new approximation channel for short-time evolution, inspired by the quantum trajectory method, which underpins the efficiency of our algorithms. The first algorithm achieves a gate complexity independent of the number of jump operators, m, marking a significant improvement in efficiency. The second algorithm achieves near-optimal dependence on the evolution time t and precision ϵ and introduces only an additional O~(m) factor, which strictly improves upon state-of-the-art gate-based quantum algorithm that has an O~(m2) factor. The improvement stems from the integration of the new approximation channel with a novel structured linear combination of unitaries method. In both our algorithms, the reduction of dependence on m significantly enhances the efficiency of simulating practical dissipative processes characterized by a large number of jump operators.",

    "abstract": "Semiconductor-based spin qubits embedded into a superconducting microwave cavity constitute a fast-progressing and promising platform for realizing fast and fault-tolerant qubit control with long-range two-qubit coupling. The flopping-mode spin qubit consists of a single electron in a double quantum dot; it combines a charge qubit with a spin qubit. With its strong and tunable cavity coupling, the flopping-mode qubit is proven to be well suited for low-power qubit control and cavity-mediated long-range quantum gates. The singlet-triplet (ST) and exchange-only (EO) qubits are multielectron realizations that go without broadband control and are protected from some types of noise, but are challenging to couple to each other and to microwave cavities. We combine the flopping-mode concept with the ST and EO qubits and propose two new flopping-mode qubits that consist of three (four) quantum dots, occupied by two (three) electrons near the (1,0,1)↔(0,1,1)[(1,0,1,1)↔(0,1,1,1)] charge transition. The two-electron system augments the ST0 spin qubit with a charge qubit that interacts transversally and longitudinally with a cavity. Both couplings are highly tunable, and the longitudinal coupling distinguishes the flopping-mode ST qubit from the regular flopping-mode qubit. The longitudinal coupling allows for nondissipative universal control similar to superconducting transmon qubits. The EO flopping-mode qubit comprises four dots occupied by three electrons and opens a new possibility to perform two-qubit gates for EO qubits that are challenging to perform directly with the exchange coupling. We use input-output theory to provide means of extracting the coupling strengths from cavity transmission data.",

    "abstract": "A complex but important challenge in understanding quantum mechanical phenomena is the simulation of quantum many-body dynamics. Although quantum computers offer significant potential to accelerate these simulations, their practical application is currently limited by noise and restricted scalability. In this work, we address these problems by introducing a hybrid ansatz combining the strengths of quantum and classical computational methods. Using Trotterization, we propose to evolve an initial state on the quantum computer according to a simplified Hamiltonian, focusing on terms that are difficult to simulate classically. A classical model then corrects the simulation by including the terms omitted in the quantum circuit. While the classical ansatz is optimized during the time evolution, the quantum circuit has no variational parameters. Derivatives can thus be calculated purely classically, avoiding challenges arising in the optimization of parametrized quantum circuits. We demonstrate three applications of this hybrid method. First, our approach allows us to avoid gates in the quantum circuit by restricting the quantum part of the ansatz to hardware-efficient terms of the Hamiltonian. Second, we can mitigate errors arising from the Trotterization of the time-evolution unitary. Finally, we can extend the system size while keeping the number of qubits in the quantum circuit constant by including additional degrees of freedom in the classical ansatz.",

However, the presence of physical noise in near-term experiments hinders the realization of quantum computational advantage with boson sampling. Since physical noise in near-term boson-sampling devices is inevitable, precise characterization of the boundary of noise rates where the classical intractability of boson sampling is maintained is crucial for quantum computational advantage using near-term devices. In this work, we identify the level of partial-distinguishability noise that upholds the classical intractability of boson sampling. We find that boson sampling with on average O(log﻿N) distinguishable photons out of N input photons maintains the equivalent complexity to the ideal boson-sampling case. By providing strong complexity-theoretical evidence for the classical intractability of noisy boson sampling, we expect that our findings will ultimately facilitate the demonstration of quantum computational advantage with noisy boson-sampling experiments in the near future.",

In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized, in two spatial dimensions, against generic “heralded” noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian (Z2) and non-Abelian (D4) topological order whose steady states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed-state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian D4 case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.",

One consequence of this is the existence of a large shift of the transition with respect to the bare atomic frequency. In the linear optics regime (low light intensity), one observes a spectroscopic shift of the Lorentzian atomic line often called the collective Lamb shift. For stronger driving, many excitations are present in the system rendering the calculation of this shift theoretically challenging, but its understanding is important for instance when performing Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks. Here we report on the study of the collective optical response of a one-dimensional array of 30 dysprosium atoms. We drive the atoms on the narrow intercombination transition isolating a two-level system, and measure the atomic state with single-shot state readout using a broad transition. In the linear optics regime, we measure the shift of the resonance in steady state due to dipole interactions, and measure how this shift depends on the interatomic distance. We further resolve at the single atom level how the excitation is distributed over the array. Then, on the same transition we perform Ramsey spectroscopy i.e., away from the linear regime. We observe a time-dependent shift, that allows us to draw the connection between the collective Lamb shift observed in the linear optics regime and in the large-excitation case.",

In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the nonperturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource intensive.",

While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MISTs) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson-junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.",

    "abstract": "The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the X or Z axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle α about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds αth. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error-correcting phase, α<αth, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a Z2 symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix, a nonunitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit, can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states; and (ii) based on this approach, we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The αth values we find show that the maximum-likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.",

    "abstract": "When experimentally learning the action of a continuous-variable quantum process by probing it with inputs, there will often be some restriction on the input states used. One experimentally simple way to probe a quantum channel is to use low-energy coherent states. Learning a quantum channel in this way presents difficulties, due to the fact that two channels may act similarly on low-energy inputs but very differently for high-energy inputs. They may also act similarly on coherent-state inputs but differently on nonclassical inputs. Extrapolating the behavior of a channel for more general input states from its action on the far more limited set of low-energy coherent states is a case of out-of-distribution generalization. To be sure that such generalization gives meaningful results, one needs to relate error bounds for the training set to bounds that are valid for all inputs. We show that for any pair of channels that act sufficiently similarly on low-energy coherent-state inputs, one can bound how different the input-output relations are for any (high-energy or highly nonclassical) input. This proves that out-of-distribution generalization is always possible for learning quantum channels using low-energy coherent states, as long as enough samples are used.",

We further analyze the temperature and interaction-strength dependence of the condensate and superfluid fractions. Notably, in contrast to dilute atomic BECs, the SBG phase displays a low condensate fraction and a high superfluid fraction, resembling the behavior of strongly correlated 4He superfluids. These significant many-body correlations arise from the interplay between long-range dipole-dipole interactions and the short-range shielding potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the aspect ratio of the gas provides a characteristic geometric signature to accurately determine the EG-to-SBG transition, robust against external trapping potentials.

    "abstract": "Quantum networking technologies use spin qubits and their interface to single photons as core components of a network node. This necessitates the ability to co-design the magnetic- and optical-dipole response of a quantum system—a capability that has been notably absent in solid-state platforms where spin-orbit coupling and the crystalline environment lead to inhomogeneity of electronic g-factors and optically active states. Here, we demonstrate the ability to design both the optical and magnetic response of a solid-state quantum emitter . We show that GaAs quantum dots (QDs), obtained via local droplet etching epitaxy and already known as exceptionally coherent and efficient quantum light sources, also exhibit spin and optical properties that follow directly from assuming the highest possible system symmetry. Our measurements of electron and hole g-tensors—using a new sign-sensitive measurement protocol based on the hyperfine interaction—and of transition dipole moment orientations for charged excitons agree with our predictions from a multiband k⋅p simulation constrained only by a single atomic-force-microscopy reconstruction of QD morphology. This agreement is verified across multiple wavelength-specific growth runs at different facilities within the range of 730 to 790 nm for the exciton emission. Remarkably, our measurements and simulations track the in-plane electron g-factors through a zero-crossing from −0.1 to 0.3 and linear optical dipole moment orientations fully determined by an external magnetic field. The robustness and generality of these results establish a fundamentally new paradigm for solid-state spin-photon interfaces: one in which the properties of a spin qubit and its tunable optical interface can be designed—prior to growth—for a target magnetic and photonic environment, with direct applications to scalable and high-fidelity spin-photon entanglement.",

However, these symmetry-based techniques exploit symmetry in quantum rather than quantum , limiting their application to cases where the entire circuit shares the same symmetry. In this work, we propose symmetric channel verification (SCV), a channel purification protocol that leverages the symmetry inherent in quantum channels. By introducing different phases to each symmetric subspace and employing a quantum phase estimation-like circuit, SCV can detect and correct symmetry-breaking noise in quantum channels. We further propose a hardware-efficient implementation of SCV at the virtual level, which requires only a single-qubit ancilla and is robust against the noise in the ancilla qubit. Our protocol is applied to various Hamiltonian simulation circuits and phase estimation circuits, resulting in a significant reduction of errors. Furthermore, in setups where only Clifford unitaries can be used for noise purification, which is relevant in the early fault-tolerant regime, we show that SCV under Pauli symmetry represents the optimal purification method.",

    "abstract": "Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. This dual approach allows us to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the phase structure and the nature of the transition. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.",

Building on the close relationship between the unraveled Lindblad dynamics, stochastic Magnus integrators, and variational quantum simulation, we propose a high-order scheme for solving the quantum state diffusion equation using exponential integrators. This formulation facilitates the simulation of wavefunction trajectories within the established framework of variational quantum algorithms for time evolution. Our algorithm significantly enhances robustness in two key aspects: the stability of the simulation with large time steps, and the reduction in the number of quantum trajectories required to accurately simulate the Lindblad dynamics in terms of the ensemble average. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical examples in both classical and quantum implementations, including the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with damping, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and the radical pair model (RPM). The simulation accuracy can be systematically improved, and the algorithm remains reliable even in highly oscillatory regimes.

    "abstract": "Adaptive quantum circuits—where a quantum many-body state is controlled using measurements and conditional unitary operations—are a powerful paradigm for state preparation and quantum error-correction tasks. They can support two types of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions: measurement-induced transitions between volume- and area-law-entangled steady states and control-induced transitions where the system falls into an absorbing state or, more generally, an orbit visiting several absorbing states. Within this context, nonlocal conditional operations can alter the critical properties of the two transitions and the topology of the phase diagram. Here, we consider the scenario where the measurements are , in order to engineer efficient control onto dynamical trajectories. Motivated by Rydberg-atom arrays, we consider a locally constrained model with global sublattice magnetization measurements and local correction operations to steer the system’s dynamics onto a many-body orbit with finite recurrence time. The model has a well-defined classical limit, which we leverage to aid our analysis of the control transition. As a function of the density of local correction operations, we find control and entanglement transitions with continuously varying critical exponents. For sufficiently high densities of local correction operations, we find that both transitions acquire a dynamical critical exponent z<1, reminiscent of criticality in long-range power-law interacting systems. At low correction densities, we find that the criticality reverts to a short-range nature with z≳1. In the long-range regime, the control and entanglement transitions are indistinguishable to within the resolution of our finite-size numerics, while in the short-range regime we find evidence that the transitions become distinct. We conjecture that the effective long-range criticality mediated by collective measurements is essential in driving the two transitions together.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Randomized benchmarking (RB) is the most commonly employed protocol for the characterization of unitary operations in quantum circuits due to its reasonable experimental requirements and robustness against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. So far, the protocol has been limited to discrete or fermionic systems, whereas extensions to bosonic systems have been unclear for a long time due to challenges arising from the underlying bosonic Hilbert space. In this work, we close the gap for bosonic systems and develop an RB protocol to benchmark passive Gaussian transformations on any particle-number subspace, which we call . The protocol is built on top of the recently developed filtered RB framework [J. Helsen , PRX Quantum 3, 020357 (2022), M. Heinrich , Randomized benchmarking with random quantum circuits, arxiv:2212.06181 [quant-ph]] and is designed to isolate the multitude of exponential decays arising for passive bosonic transformations. We give explicit formulas and a Julia implementation for the necessary postprocessing of the experimental data. We also analyze the sampling complexity of passive bosonic RB by deriving analytical expressions for the variance. They show a mild scaling with the number of modes, suggesting that passive bosonic RB is experimentally feasible for a moderate number of modes. We focus on experimental settings involving Fock states and particle-number-resolving measurements, but also discuss Gaussian settings, deriving the first results for heterodyne measurements.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

Prior work [Chen , Phys. Rev. A 105, 032435 (2022)] has proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime in which one has a limited amount of quantum memory; i.e., any protocol with ≤0.99n ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided that it is . Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward. Surprisingly, in this work we show that protocols with an extremely small amount of quantum memory achieve an exponential advantage for this task. We give a protocol that can estimate any prescribed set of eigenvalues A of a Pauli channel to error ε using only O(log﻿log﻿(|A|)/ε2) ancilla qubits, O~(n2/ε2) measurements, and O(n2|A|/ε2) queries to the Pauli channel. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla—even a concatenating one—must make Ω(2n/ε2) measurements. We also prove that the number of queries cannot be improved significantly: with k ancilla qubits, Ω(2(n−k)/3) queries to the channel are necessary to learn all eigenvalues, even for concatenating protocols.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

For prepare-and-measure QKD, one approach for obtaining such proofs is the generalized entropy-accumulation theorem (GEAT) but thus far it has only been applied to study a small selection of protocols. In this work, we present techniques for applying the GEAT in finite-size analysis of generic prepare-and-measure protocols, with a focus on decoy-state protocols. In particular, we present an improved approach for computing entropy bounds for decoy-state protocols, which has the dual benefits of providing tighter bounds than previous approaches (even asymptotically) and being compatible with methods for computing min-trade-off functions in the GEAT. Furthermore, we develop methods to incorporate some improvements to the finite-size terms in the GEAT and implement techniques to automatically optimize the min-trade-off function. Our approach also addresses some numerical-stability challenges specific to prepare-and-measure protocols, which have not been addressed in previous works.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

    "abstract": "Characterizing quantum systems is a fundamental task that enables the development of quantum technologies. Various approaches, ranging from full tomography to instances of classical shadows, have been proposed to this end. However, quantum states that are being prepared in practice often involve families of quantum states characterized by continuous parameters, such as the time evolution of a quantum state. In this work, we extend the foundations of quantum state tomography to parametrized quantum states. We introduce a framework that unifies different notions of tomography and use it to establish a natural figure of merit for tomography of parametrized quantum states. Building on this, we provide an explicit algorithm that combines signal processing techniques with a tomography scheme to recover an approximation to the parametrized quantum state equipped with explicit guarantees. Our algorithm uses techniques from compressed sensing to exploit structure in the parameter dependence and operates with a “plug-and-play” nature, using the underlying tomography scheme as a black box. In an analogous fashion, we derive a figure of merit that applies to parametrized quantum channels. Substituting the state tomography scheme with a scheme for process tomography in our algorithm, we then obtain a protocol for tomography of parametrized quantum channels. We showcase our algorithm with two examples of shadow tomography of states time evolved under an NMR Hamiltonian and a free-fermionic Hamiltonian.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

We discover a wide variety of catalysts, including GHZ-like states that spontaneously break the symmetry, gapless states with critical correlations, topological orders with symmetry fractionalization, and spin-glass states. These catalysts are all united under a single framework that has close connections to the theory of quantum anomalies, and we use this connection to put strong constraints on possible pure- and mixed-state catalysts. We also show how the catalyst approach leads to new insights into the structure of certain phases of matter, and to new methods to efficiently prepare SPT phases with long-range interactions or projective measurements.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2025",

While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ans\\\"atze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.",

In this regime, the expectation value of any arbitrary set of observables can be measured in a quantum nondemolition (QND) way without reset or repreparation of the state.

Here, we demonstrate a control scheme for superconducting fluxonium qubits that eliminates qubit decay through the control channel by suppressing the environmental density of states at the transition frequency. Adding a low-pass filter on the flux line allows for flux-biasing and, at the same time, coherently controlling the fluxonium qubit by parametrically driving it at integer fractions of its transition frequency. We compare the filtered to the unfiltered configuration and find a five times longer $T_1$, and ten times improved $T_2$-echo time in the filtered case. We demonstrate coherent control with up to 11-photon sub-harmonic drives, highlighting the strong non-linearity of the fluxonium potential. Measured Rabi frequencies and drive-induced frequency shifts show excellent agreement with numerical and analytical models. Furthermore, we show the equivalence of a 3-photon sub-harmonic drive to an on-resonance drive by benchmarking sub-harmonic gate fidelities above 99.94$\\,$%. These results open up a scalable path for full qubit control through a single Purcell-protected channel, providing strong suppression of control-induced decoherence and enabling wiring-efficient superconducting quantum processors.",

Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semiclassical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path-integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern atomic, molecular, and optical research, including lasing, central-spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs, and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA approach outperforms the cumulant-expansion method in certain models and performs comparably well in others, all while offering significantly lower computational costs and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations. We therefore argue that TWA could, in the near future, become a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer-grade computers.",

The algorithm does not assume any prior information about the unitary to be emulated, the sample input states, or the relation between them. We rigorously prove that if the sample input states are tomographically complete, such that the action of an unknown unitary on the input subspace can be uniquely determined by its action on the sample input states, then our proposed algorithm succeeds in generating the desired output, with an error that becomes arbitrarily small by increasing the number of copies of the samples. Remarkably, the run-time of the algorithm is logarithmic in D, the dimension of the Hilbert space, and increases polynomially with d, the dimension of the subspace spanned by the sample input states. Furthermore, the sample complexity of the algorithm—i.e., the total number of copies of the sample input-output pairs needed to run the algorithm—is independent of D and polynomial in d. In contrast, the run-time and sample complexity of algorithms that perform tomography on the sample states are both linear in D. This algorithm can be used as a subroutine in other algorithms, such as quantum phase estimation.

    "abstract": "Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical-linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth-broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole-burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T-center frequency and a probe pulse to measure the frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time lead to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral-diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.",

    "abstract": "Qudits, generalizations of qubits to multi-level quantum systems, offer enhanced computational efficiency by encoding more information per lattice cell, avoiding costly swap operations and providing even exponential speedup in some cases. Utilizing the $d$-level manifold, however, requires high-speed gate operations because of the stronger decoherence at higher levels. While analytical control methods have proven effective for qubits in achieving fast gates with minimal control errors, their extension to qudits is nontrivial due to the increased complexity of the energy level structure arising from additional ancillary states. In this work, we present a universal pulse construction for generating rapid, high-fidelity unitary rotations between adjacent qudit levels, thereby providing a prescription for any gate in $SU(d)$. Control errors in these operations are effectively analyzed within a four-level subspace, including two leakage levels with approximately opposite detuning. By identifying the optimal degrees of freedom, we derive concise analytical pulse schemes that suppress multiple control errors and outperform existing methods. Remarkably, our approach achieves consistent coherent error scaling across all levels, approaching the quantum speed limit independently of parameter variations between levels. Validation on transmon circuits demonstrates significant improvements in gate fidelity for various qudit sizes aiming for $10^{-4}$ error. This method provides a scalable solution for improving qudit control and can be broadly applied to other quantum systems with ladder structures or operations involving multiple ancillary levels.",

    "abstract": "Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Classical shadow estimation (CSE) is a powerful tool for learning the properties of quantum states and quantum processes. Here we consider the CSE task for quantum unitary channels. By querying an unknown unitary channel U multiple times in quantum experiments, the goal is to learn a classical description from which one can accurately predict many different linear properties of the channel, i.e., the expectation values of arbitrary observables measured on the output of U upon arbitrary input states. Based on collective measurements on multiple systems, we propose a query-efficient protocol for this task, whose query complexity has a quadratic advantage over the previous best approach for this problem, and almost saturates the information-theoretic lower bound. To further enhance practicality, we also present a variant protocol using only single-copy measurements, which still offers much better query performance than previous protocols that do not use quantum memory, and can serve as a key subroutine for learning an arbitrary unknown Hamiltonian from dynamics. In addition to linear properties of unitary channels, our protocol can also be applied to simultaneously predict many nonlinear properties, such as out-of-time-ordered correlators.",

By using only symmetric cryptography primitives to implement commitments, we construct computationally secure randomized oblivious transfer without the need for public-key cryptography or assumptions imposing limitations on the adversarial devices. We show that the protocol is secure under an indistinguishability-based notion of security and demonstrate an experimental implementation to test its real-world performance. Its security and performance are then compared to both quantum and classical alternatives, showing potential advantages over existing solutions based on the noisy storage model and public-key cryptography.",

This is possible due to a new framework for analyzing the computational properties of phases of matter that is more general than previous constructions, which have been limited to short-range entangled phases in one dimension. We show that ground states of the toric code in an anisotropic magnetic field yield a natural, albeit noncomputationally universal, application of our framework. We then present a new model with topological order the ground states of which are universal resources for MBQC. Both topological models are enriched by subsystem symmetries and these symmetries protect their computational power. Our framework greatly expands the range of physical models that can be analyzed from the computational perspective.",
