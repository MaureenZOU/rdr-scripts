    "abstract": "Inverted (pin) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) afford improved operating stability in comparison to their nip counterparts but have lagged in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The energetic losses responsible for this PCE deficit in pin PSCs occur primarily at the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge-transport layers. Additive and surface treatments that use passivating ligands usually bind to a single active binding site: This dense packing of electrically resistive passivants perpendicular to the surface may limit the fill factor in pin PSCs. We identified ligands that bind two neighboring lead(II) ion (Pb 2+ ) defect sites in a planar ligand orientation on the perovskite. We fabricated pin PSCs and report a certified quasi–steady state PCE of 26.15 and 24.74% for 0.05– and 1.04–square centimeter illuminated areas, respectively. The devices retain 95% of their initial PCE after 1200 hours of continuous 1 sun maximum power point operation at 65°C.",

By fine-tuning on denoising tasks, we developed RFdiffusion All-Atom (RFdiffusionAA), which builds protein structures around small molecules. Starting from random distributions of amino acid residues surrounding target small molecules, we designed and experimentally validated, through crystallography and binding measurements, proteins that bind the cardiac disease therapeutic digoxigenin, the enzymatic cofactor heme, and the light-harvesting molecule bilin.",

    "abstract": "Long Covid is a debilitating condition of unknown etiology. We performed multimodal proteomics analyses of blood serum from COVID-19 patients followed up to 12 months after confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Analysis of >6500 proteins in 268 longitudinal samples revealed dysregulated activation of the complement system, an innate immune protection and homeostasis mechanism, in individuals experiencing Long Covid. Thus, active Long Covid was characterized by terminal complement system dysregulation and ongoing activation of the alternative and classical complement pathways, the latter associated with increased antibody titers against several herpesviruses possibly stimulating this pathway. Moreover, markers of hemolysis, tissue injury, platelet activation, and monocyte–platelet aggregates were increased in Long Covid. Machine learning confirmed complement and thromboinflammatory proteins as top biomarkers, warranting diagnostic and therapeutic interrogation of these systems.",

Long-term stability of PSCs requires keeping the SAM compact under the perovskite layer during operation. We found that strong polar solvents in the perovskite precursor desorb the SAM if it is anchored on substrates by hydrogen-bonded, rather than covalently bonded, hydroxyl groups. We used atomic-layer deposition to create an indium tin oxide substrate with a fully covalent hydroxyl-covered surface for SAM anchoring, as well as a SAM with a trimethoxysilane group that exhibited strong tridentate anchoring to the substrate. The resulting PSCs achieved PCEs of 24.8 (certified 24.6) and 23.2% with aperture areas of 0.08 and 1.01 square centimeters, respectively. The devices retained 98.9 and 98.2% of the initial PCE after 1000 hours damp-heat test and operation in maximum power point tracking at 85°C for 1200 hours under standard illumination, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are increasingly recognized as key players in the tumor immune response and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite recent advances characterizing the diversity of neutrophil states in cancer, common trajectories and mechanisms governing the ontogeny and relationship between these neutrophil states remain undefined. Here, we demonstrate that immature and mature neutrophils that enter tumors undergo irreversible epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic modifications to converge into a distinct, terminally differentiated dcTRAIL-R1 + state. Reprogrammed dcTRAIL-R1 + neutrophils predominantly localize to a glycolytic and hypoxic niche at the tumor core and exert pro-angiogenic function that favors tumor growth. We found similar trajectories in neutrophils across multiple tumor types and in humans, suggesting that targeting this program may provide a means of enhancing certain cancer immunotherapies.",

In the past decade, progress has been made toward the fabrication of highly efficient laboratory-scale tandems through a range of vacuum- and solution-based perovskite processing technologies onto various types of c-Si bottom cells. However, to become a commercial reality, the transition from laboratory to industrial fabrication will require appropriate, scalable input materials and manufacturing processes. In addition, perovskite/silicon tandem research needs to increasingly focus on stability, reliability, throughput of cell production and characterization, cell-to-module integration, and accurate field-performance prediction and evaluation. This Review discusses these aspects in view of contemporary solar cell manufacturing, offers insights into the possible pathways toward commercial perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics, and highlights research opportunities to realize this goal.",

Pore size has long been considered the main lever to improve capacitance. However, our evaluation of a large series of commercial nanoporous carbons finds a lack of correlation between pore size and capacitance. Instead, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements and simulations reveal a strong correlation between structural disorder in the electrodes and capacitance. More disordered carbons with smaller graphene-like domains show higher capacitances owing to the more efficient storage of ions in their nanopores. Our findings suggest ways to understand and exploit disorder to achieve highly energy-dense supercapacitors.",

However, the realization of a high energy density combined with a high efficiency is a major challenge for practical applications. We propose a high-entropy design in barium titanate (BaTiO 3 )–based lead-free MLCCs with polymorphic relaxor phase. This strategy effectively minimizes hysteresis loss by lowering the domain-switching barriers and enhances the breakdown strength by the high atomic disorder with lattice distortion and grain refining. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, we achieved a high energy density of 20.8 joules per cubic centimeter with an ultrahigh efficiency of 97.5% in the MLCCs. This approach should be universally applicable to designing high-performance dielectrics for energy storage and other related functionalities.",

These impacts include changes in groundwater recharge, discharge, flow, storage, and distribution. Climate-induced shifts are evident in altered recharge rates, greater groundwater contribution to streamflow in glacierized catchments, and enhanced groundwater flow in permafrost areas. Direct anthropogenic changes include groundwater withdrawal and injection, regional flow regime modification, water table and storage alterations, and redistribution of embedded groundwater in foods globally. Notably, groundwater extraction contributes to sea level rise, increasing the risk of groundwater inundation in coastal areas. The role of groundwater in the global water cycle is becoming more dynamic and complex. Quantifying these changes is essential to ensure sustainable supply of fresh groundwater resources for people and ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "It is widely hoped that statistical models can improve decision-making related to medical treatments. Because of the cost and scarcity of medical outcomes data, this hope is typically based on investigators observing a model’s success in one or two datasets or clinical contexts. We scrutinized this optimism by examining how well a machine learning model performed across several independent clinical trials of antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia. Models predicted patient outcomes with high accuracy within the trial in which the model was developed but performed no better than chance when applied out-of-sample. Pooling data across trials to predict outcomes in the trial left out did not improve predictions. These results suggest that models predicting treatment outcomes in schizophrenia are highly context-dependent and may have limited generalizability.",

In this work, we present a versatile flow-based robotic platform to address these challenges through the integration of readily available hardware and custom software. Our open-source platform combines a liquid handler, syringe pumps, a tunable continuous-flow photoreactor, inexpensive Internet of Things devices, and an in-line benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to enable automated, data-rich optimization with a closed-loop Bayesian optimization strategy. A user-friendly graphical interface allows chemists without programming or machine learning expertise to easily monitor, analyze, and improve photocatalytic reactions with respect to both continuous and discrete variables. The system's effectiveness was demonstrated by increasing overall reaction yields and improving space-time yields compared with those of previously reported processes.",

The reduction in calcium ions, which made up the largest impurity in the aqueous solution, led to the greatest reduction in carrier trap states, and its deliberate introduction was shown to decrease device performance. With these purified precursors, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.6% (25.3% certified) in inverted PSCs and retained 94% of the initial PCE after 1000 hours of continuous simulated solar illumination at 50°C.",

The bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3 )–based coolers currently in use are limited by the scarcity of Te and less-than-ideal cooling capability. We demonstrate how removing lattice vacancies through a grid-design strategy switched PbSe from being useful as a medium-temperature power generator to a thermoelectric cooler. At room temperature, the seven-pair device based on n-type PbSe and p-type SnSe produced a maximum cooling temperature difference of ~73 kelvin, with a single-leg power generation efficiency approaching 11.2%. We attribute our results to a power factor of >52 microwatts per centimeter per square kelvin, which was achieved by boosting carrier mobility. Our demonstration suggests a path for commercial applications of thermoelectric cooling based on Earth-abundant Te-free selenide-based compounds.",

We report a three-dimensionally (3D) architected electronic skin (denoted as 3DAE-Skin) with force and strain sensing components arranged in a 3D layout that mimics that of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings in human skin. This 3DAE-Skin shows excellent decoupled sensing performances of normal force, shear force, and strain and enables development of a tactile system for simultaneous modulus/curvature measurements of an object through touch. Demonstrations include rapid modulus measurements of fruits, bread, and cake with various shapes and degrees of freshness.",

However, current textile electronic systems often rely on rigid silicon components, which limits seamless integration, energy efficiency, and comfort. Chipless electronic systems still face digital logic challenges owing to the lack of dynamic energy-switching carriers. We propose a chipless body-coupled energy interaction mechanism for ambient electromagnetic energy harvesting and wireless signal transmission through a single fiber. The fiber itself enables wireless visual–digital interactions without the need for extra chips or batteries on textiles. Because all of the electronic assemblies are merged in a miniature fiber, this facilitates scalable fabrication and compatibility with modern weaving techniques, thereby enabling versatile and intelligent clothing. We propose a strategy that may address the problems of silicon-based textile systems.",

Using nanoconfined water-induced basal-plane alignment and covalent and π-π interplatelet bridging, we fabricated Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene-bridged graphene sheets at room temperature with isotropic in-plane tensile strength of 1.87 gigapascals and moduli of 98.7 gigapascals.

We improved the thermoelectric efficiency in SnS crystals by promoting the convergence of energy and momentum of four valance bands, termed quadruple-band synglisis. We introduced more Sn vacancies to activate quadruple-band synglisis and facilitate carrier transport by inducing SnS 2 in selenium (Se)–alloyed SnS, leading to a high dimensionless figure of merit ( ZT ) of ~1.0 at 300 kelvin and an average ZT of ~1.3 at 300 to 773 kelvin in p-type SnS crystals. We further obtained an experimental efficiency of ~6.5%, and our fabricated cooler demonstrated a maximum cooling temperature difference of ~48.4 kelvin at 353 kelvin. Our observations should draw interest to earth-abundant SnS crystals for applications of waste-heat recovery and thermoelectric cooling.",

Holes underwent long-distance diffusion toward the carbon back electrode, and this carrier separation reduced recombination at the back contact. Nonradiative recombination at the bulk titanium dioxide/perovskite interface was reduced by ammonium phosphate modification. The resulting p-MPSCs achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.2% and maintained 97% of their initial efficiency after 750 hours of maximum power point tracking at 55 ± 5°C.",

We discovered that DNA and gelatin aggregation into an ordered layered aerogel achieves a solar-weighted reflectance of 104.0% in visible light regions through fluorescence and phosphorescence. The cooling effect can reduce ambient temperatures by 16.0°C under high solar irradiance.

    "abstract": "Based on an extensive model intercomparison, we assessed trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services from historical reconstructions and future scenarios of land-use and climate change. During the 20th century, biodiversity declined globally by 2 to 11%, as estimated by a range of indicators. Provisioning ecosystem services increased several fold, and regulating services decreased moderately. Going forward, policies toward sustainability have the potential to slow biodiversity loss resulting from land-use change and the demand for provisioning services while reducing or reversing declines in regulating services. However, negative impacts on biodiversity due to climate change appear poised to increase, particularly in the higher-emissions scenarios. Our assessment identifies remaining modeling uncertainties but also robustly shows that renewed policy efforts are needed to meet the goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity.",

However, urban areas have heat island effects that largely diminish the effectiveness of cooling textiles as wearable fabrics because they absorb emitted radiation from the ground and nearby buildings. We developed a mid-infrared spectrally selective hierarchical fabric (SSHF) with emissivity greatly dominant in the atmospheric transmission window through molecular design, minimizing the net heat gain from the surroundings. The SSHF features a high solar spectrum reflectivity of 0.97 owing to strong Mie scattering from the nano-micro hybrid fibrous structure. The SSHF is 2.3°C cooler than a solar-reflecting broadband emitter when placed vertically in simulated outdoor urban scenarios during the day and also has excellent wearable properties.",

For use in the human body, they must show flexibility, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. These requirements are challenging for conventional inorganic piezoelectric oxides and piezoelectric polymers. We discovered high piezoelectricity in a molecular crystal HOCH 2 (CF 2 ) 3 CH 2 OH [2,2,3,3,4,4-hexafluoropentane-1,5-diol (HFPD)] with a large piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of ~138 picocoulombs per newton and piezoelectric voltage constant g 33 of ~2450 × 10 −3 volt-meters per newton under no poling conditions, which also exhibits good biocompatibility toward biological cells and desirable biodegradation and biosafety in physiological environments. HFPD can be composite with polyvinyl alcohol to form flexible piezoelectric films with a d 33 of 34.3 picocoulombs per newton. Our material demonstrates the ability for molecular crystals to have attractive piezoelectric properties and should be of interest for applications in transient implantable electromechanical devices.",

Lack of inclusion must be addressed at-scale to identify causal disease factors and understand the genetic causes of health disparities. We present genome-wide associations for 2068 traits from 635,969 participants in the Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program, a longitudinal study of diverse United States Veterans. Systematic analysis revealed 13,672 genomic risk loci; 1608 were only significant after including non-European populations. Fine-mapping identified causal variants at 6318 signals across 613 traits. One-third ( n = 2069) were identified in participants from non-European populations. This reveals a broadly similar genetic architecture across populations, highlights genetic insights gained from underrepresented groups, and presents an extensive atlas of genetic associations.",

Polyamide films offer excellent water permeability and salt rejection but also suffer from poor chlorine resistance, high fouling propensity, and low boron rejection. We addressed these issues by molecularly designing a polyester thin-film composite reverse osmosis membrane using co-solvent–assisted interfacial polymerization to react 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methylbenzoic acid with trimesoyl chloride. This polyester membrane exhibits substantial water permeability, high rejection for sodium chloride and boron, and complete resistance toward chlorine. The ultrasmooth, low-energy surface of the membrane also prevents fouling and mineral scaling compared with polyamide membranes. These membranes could increasingly challenge polyamide membranes by further optimizing water-salt selectivity, offering a path to considerably reducing pretreatment steps in desalination.",

Yet previous failures in correcting conspiracy beliefs may be due to counterevidence being insufficiently compelling and tailored. To evaluate this possibility, we leveraged developments in generative artificial intelligence and engaged 2190 conspiracy believers in personalized evidence-based dialogues with GPT-4 Turbo. The intervention reduced conspiracy belief by ~20%. The effect remained 2 months later, generalized across a wide range of conspiracy theories, and occurred even among participants with deeply entrenched beliefs. Although the dialogues focused on a single conspiracy, they nonetheless diminished belief in unrelated conspiracies and shifted conspiracy-related behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that many conspiracy theory believers can revise their views if presented with sufficiently compelling evidence.",

We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to alignment to improve its fidelity. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at a far distance (58% sequence identity) from known fluorescent proteins, which we estimate is equivalent to simulating 500 million years of evolution.",

Our approach integrates a comprehensive climate policy database with a machine learning–based extension of the common difference-in-differences approach. We identified 63 successful policy interventions with total emission reductions between 0.6 billion and 1.8 billion metric tonnes CO 2 . Our insights on effective but rarely studied policy combinations highlight the important role of price-based instruments in well-designed policy mixes and the policy efforts necessary for closing the emissions gap.",

However, state-of-the-art surface passivation techniques rely on ammonium ligands that suffer deprotonation under light and thermal stress. We developed a library of amidinium ligands, of interest for their resonance effect–enhanced N–H bonds that may resist deprotonation, to increase the thermal stability of passivation layers on perovskite surfaces. This strategy resulted in a >10-fold reduction in the ligand deprotonation equilibrium constant and a twofold increase in the maintenance of photoluminescence quantum yield after aging at 85°C under illumination in air. Implementing this approach, we achieved a certified quasi–steady-state PCE of 26.3% for inverted PSCs; and we report retention of ≥90% PCE after 1100 hours of continuous 1-sun maximum power point operation at 85°C.",

Here we identify inhibitor resistance mutations in BTK with distinct enzymatic activities, including some that impair BTK enzymatic activity while imparting novel protein-protein interactions that sustain B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Furthermore, we describe a clinical-stage BTK and IKZF1/3 degrader, NX-2127, that can bind and proteasomally degrade each mutant BTK proteoform, resulting in potent blockade of BCR signaling. Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with NX-2127 achieves >80% degradation of BTK in patients and demonstrates proof-of-concept therapeutic benefit. These data reveal an oncogenic scaffold function of mutant BTK that confers resistance across clinically approved BTK inhibitors but is overcome by BTK degradation in patients.",

We report degradation mechanisms of p-i-n–structured perovskite solar cells under unfiltered sunlight and with LEDs. Weak chemical bonding between perovskites and polymer hole-transporting materials (HTMs) and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) dominate the accelerated A-site cation migration, rather than direct degradation of HTMs. An aromatic phosphonic acid, [2-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (EtCz3EPA), enhanced bonding at the perovskite/HTM/TCO region with a phosphonic acid group bonded to TCOs and a nitrogen group interacting with lead in perovskites. A hybrid HTM of EtCz3EPA with strong hole-extraction polymers retained high efficiency and improved the UV stability of perovskite devices, and a champion perovskite minimodule—independently measured by the Perovskite PV Accelerator for Commercializing Technologies (PACT) center—retained operational efficiency of >16% after 29 weeks of outdoor testing.",

Despite intensive investigation for half a century, the complete biosynthetic pathway of baccatin III remains unknown. In this work, we identified a bifunctional cytochrome P450 enzyme [taxane oxetanase 1 (TOT1)] in Taxus mairei that catalyzes an oxidative rearrangement in paclitaxel oxetane formation, which represents a previously unknown enzyme mechanism for oxetane ring formation. We created a screening strategy based on the taxusin biosynthesis pathway and uncovered the enzyme responsible for the taxane oxidation of the C9 position (T9αH1). Finally, we artificially reconstituted a biosynthetic pathway for the production of baccatin III in tobacco.",

We demonstrate a design strategy to unlock consistent and enhanced properties directly from 3D printing. Using Ti−5Al−5Mo−5V−3Cr as a model alloy, we show that adding molybdenum (Mo) nanoparticles promotes grain refinement during solidification and suppresses the formation of phase heterogeneities during solid-state thermal cycling. The microstructural change because of the bifunctional additive results in uniform mechanical properties and simultaneous enhancement of both strength and ductility. We demonstrate how this alloy can be modified by a single component to address unfavorable microstructures, providing a pathway to achieve desirable mechanical characteristics directly from 3D printing.",

To decode the functions of tumor-infiltrating B cells, we generated a B cell blueprint encompassing single-cell transcriptome, B cell–receptor repertoire, and chromatin accessibility data across 20 different cancer types (477 samples, 269 patients). B cells harbored extraordinary heterogeneity and comprised 15 subsets, which could be grouped into two independent developmental paths (extrafollicular versus germinal center). Tumor types grouped into the extrafollicular pathway were linked with worse clinical outcomes and resistance to immunotherapy. The dysfunctional extrafollicular program was associated with glutamine-derived metabolites through epigenetic-metabolic cross-talk, which promoted a T cell–driven immunosuppressive program. These data suggest an intratumor B cell balance between extrafollicular and germinal-center responses and suggest that humoral immunity could possibly be harnessed for B cell–targeting immunotherapy.",

We report two intravenous priming agents given 1 to 2 hours before a blood draw to recover more ctDNA. Our priming agents consist of nanoparticles that act on the cells responsible for cfDNA clearance and DNA-binding antibodies that protect cfDNA.

The combination of operando and postreaction characterization of the catalyst revealed that its high activity, selectivity, and stability are attributable to crystallographic phase purity, weak CO-Mo 2 C interactions, and interstitial oxygen atoms, respectively. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided evidence that the reaction proceeds through an H 2 -aided redox mechanism.",

In this work, we report the dislocation cutting of B2 (ordered body-centered cubic) nanoprecipitates, typically considered nonshearable intermetallics, in a lightweight compositionally complex steel during cryogenic tensile loading. Shearing is enabled by the high strength level for dislocation glide within the austenitic matrix, attributed to the substantial strengthening from subnanoscale local chemical ordering zones and the pronounced solid solution strengthening from the multiprincipal elements in the matrix. This mechanism not only harnesses the intense strengthening and strain hardening provided by otherwise impenetrable brittle nanoprecipitates but also introduces ductility through their sequential shearing with ongoing deformation. Our steel thus showcases ultrahigh cryogenic tensile strength up to 2 gigapascal at a remarkable tensile elongation of 34%. This study reveals a new strategy for designing high-performance structural materials.",

The electron oscillation in plates and dipole polarization in dielectric layers contribute to the reflection and absorption of electromagnetic waves. Guided by this, the synergistic nonpercolation densification and dielectric enhancement enable our composite to combine high resistivity, shielding performance, and thermal conductivity.

A layer-by-layer approach using repeated cycles of blade coating improves the orientation degree to 0.935 in the LBM film, while a LM with good deformability reduces voids into porosity of 5.4%. The interfacial interactions are enhanced by the hydrogen bonding from BC and the coordination bonding with LM, which improves the stress-transfer efficiency.

The subnanometric beads can efficiently unfold and refold under cyclic mechanical strains; thus, the hydrogel can rapidly recover after being stretched to an areal strain of more than 10,000%. Additionally, the hydrogel can quickly heal from minor mechanical damages such as needle punctures and cuts. These advancements make our ionic hydrogels ideal for multifunctional pneumatic gripper materials; they simultaneously offer an ultralarge gripping range, self-sensing capabilities, and fast healing abilities.",

We discovered that arterial pressure pulsations can directly modulate central neuronal activity. In a semi-intact rat brain preparation, vascular pressure pulsations elicited correlated local field oscillations in the olfactory bulb mitral cell layer. These oscillations did not require synaptic transmission but reflected baroreceptive transduction in mitral cells. This transduction was mediated by a fast excitatory mechanosensitive ion channel and modulated neuronal spiking activity. In awake animals, the heartbeat entrained the activity of a subset of olfactory bulb neurons within ~20 milliseconds. Thus, we propose that this fast, intrinsic interoceptive mechanism can modulate perception—for example, during arousal—within the olfactory bulb and possibly across various other brain areas.",

The memory performance of this ferroelectric device does not show the wake-up effect at low cycles or a substantial fatigue effect after 10 6 switching cycles under different pulse widths. The total stress time of the device under an electric field is up to 10 5 s, which is long relative to other devices.

    "abstract": "Hydrogels are an attractive category of biointerfacing materials with adjustable mechanical properties, diverse biochemical functions, and good ionic conductivity. Despite these advantages, their application in electronics has been restricted because of their lack of semiconducting properties, and they have traditionally only served as insulators or conductors. We developed single- and multiple-network hydrogels based on a water-soluble n-type semiconducting polymer, endowing conventional hydrogels with semiconducting capabilities. These hydrogels show good electron mobilities and high on/off ratios, enabling the fabrication of complementary logic circuits and signal amplifiers with low power consumption and high gains. We demonstrate that hydrogel electronics with good bioadhesive and biocompatible interface can sense and amplify electrophysiological signals with enhanced signal-to-noise ratios.",

    "abstract": "Transitioning from polycrystalline to single-crystalline nickel-rich cathodes has garnered considerable attention in both academia and industry, driven by advantages of high tap density and enhanced mechanical properties. However, cathodes with high nickel content (>70%) suffer from substantial capacity degradation, which poses a challenge to their commercial viability. Leveraging multiscale spatial resolution diffraction and imaging techniques, we observe that lattice rotations occur universally in single-crystalline cathodes and play a pivotal role in the structure degradation. These lattice rotations prove unrecoverable and govern the accumulation of adverse lattice distortions over repeated cycles, contributing to structural and mechanical degradation and fast capacity fade. These findings bridge the previous knowledge gap that exists in the mechanistic link between fast performance failure and atomic-scale structure degradation.",

By compiling 223,593 field-based measurements and developing machine-learning models, we report that global soils store 2305 ± 636 (±1 SD) billion tonnes of carbon as SIC over the top 2-meter depth. Under future scenarios, soil acidification associated with nitrogen additions to terrestrial ecosystems will reduce global SIC (0.3 meters) up to 23 billion tonnes of carbon over the next 30 years, with India and China being the most affected. Our synthesis of present-day land-water carbon inventories and inland-water carbonate chemistry reveals that at least 1.13 ± 0.33 billion tonnes of inorganic carbon is lost to inland-waters through soils annually, resulting in large but overlooked impacts on atmospheric and hydrospheric carbon dynamics.",

The theory applies to metal nanoparticles and atoms on oxide supports and oxide films on metal supports. We found that for late-transition metal catalysts, metal-metal interactions dominated the oxide support effects and suboxide encapsulation over metal nanoparticles. A principle of strong metal-metal interactions for encapsulation occurrence is formulated and substantiated by extensive ‎experiments including 10 metals and 16 ‎oxides.

This interface harnesses enantiomer-controlled entropy to enhance tolerance to thermal cycling–induced fatigue and material degradation, and a heterochiral arrangement of organic cations leads to closer packing of benzene rings, which enhances chemical stability and charge transfer. The encapsulated PSCs showed retentions of 92% of power-conversion efficiency under a thermal cycling test (−40°C to 85°C; 200 cycles over 1200 hours) and 92% under a damp heat test (85% relative humidity; 85°C; 600 hours).",

Patients who failed to respond to initial anti–PD-1 immunotherapy but responded after addition of itacitinib had multiple features of poor immune function to anti–PD-1 alone that improved after JAK inhibition. Itacitinib promoted CD8 T cell plasticity and therapeutic responses of exhausted and effector memory–like T cell clonotypes. Patients with persistent inflammation refractory to itacitinib showed progressive CD8 T cell terminal differentiation and progressive disease. Thus, JAK inhibition may improve the efficacy of anti–PD-1 immunotherapy by pivoting T cell differentiation dynamics.",

The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit is a promising candidate because the required multiqubit operations are readily available at optical frequency. To date, however, GKP qubits have been demonstrated only at mechanical and microwave frequencies. We realized a GKP state in propagating light at telecommunication wavelength and verified it through homodyne measurements without loss corrections. The generation is based on interference of cat states, followed by homodyne measurements. Our final states exhibit nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity, including the trident shape of faint instances of GKP states. Improvements toward brighter, multipeaked GKP qubits will be the basis for quantum computation with light.",

The conventional coordinative solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) promoted δ-FAPbI 3 formation under high relative humidity (RH) conditions because of its hygroscopic nature. We introduced chlorine-containing organic molecules to form a capping layer that blocked moisture penetration while preserving DMSO-based complexes to regulate crystal growth.

Precipitation variability should also increase, producing larger wet-dry swings, but that is yet to be confirmed observationally. Here we show that precipitation variability has already grown globally (over 75% of land area) over the past century, as a result of accumulated anthropogenic warming. The increased variability is seen across daily to intraseasonal timescales, with daily variability increased by 1.2% per 10 years globally, and is particularly prominent over Europe, Australia, and eastern North America. Increased precipitation variability is driven mainly by thermodynamics linked to atmospheric moistening, modulated at decadal timescales by circulation changes. Amplified precipitation variability poses new challenges for weather and climate predictions, as well as for resilience and adaptation by societies and ecosystems.",

We examined the strength and fracture toughness of a bcc refractory alloy, NbTaTiHf, from 77 to 1473 kelvin. This alloy’s behavior differed from that of comparable systems by having fracture toughness over 253 MPa·m 1/2 , which we attribute to a dynamic competition between screw and edge dislocations in controlling the plasticity at a crack tip. Whereas the glide and intersection of screw and mixed dislocations promotes strain hardening controlling uniform deformation, the coordinated slip of <111> edge dislocations with {110} and {112} glide planes prolongs nonuniform strain through formation of kink bands. These bands suppress strain hardening by reorienting microscale bands of the crystal along directions of higher resolved shear stress and continually nucleate to accommodate localized strain and distribute damage away from a crack tip.",

Hit rates were high and similar for the experimental and AF2 structures, as were affinities. Success in docking against the AF2 models was achieved despite differences between orthosteric residue conformations in the AF2 models and the experimental structures. Determination of the cryo–electron microscopy structure for one of the more potent 5-HT2A ligands from the AF2 docking revealed residue accommodations that resembled the AF2 prediction.

    "abstract": "We present a design strategy for fabricating ultrastable phase-pure films of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) by lattice templating using specific two-dimensional (2D) perovskites with FA as the cage cation. When a pure FAPbI 3 precursor solution is brought in contact with the 2D perovskite, the black phase forms preferentially at 100°C, much lower than the standard FAPbI 3 annealing temperature of 150°C. X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy suggest that the resulting FAPbI 3 film compresses slightly to acquire the (011) interplanar distances of the 2D perovskite seed. The 2D-templated bulk FAPbI 3 films exhibited an efficiency of 24.1% in a p-i-n architecture with 0.5–square centimeter active area and an exceptional durability, retaining 97% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours under 85°C and maximum power point tracking.",

    "abstract": "Age-associated B cells (ABCs) accumulate during infection, aging, and autoimmunity, contributing to lupus pathogenesis. In this study, we screened for transcription factors driving ABC formation and found that zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is required for human and mouse ABC differentiation in vitro. ABCs are reduced in ZEB2 haploinsufficient individuals and in mice lacking Zeb2 in B cells. In mice with toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)–driven lupus, ZEB2 is essential for ABC formation and autoimmune pathology. ZEB2 binds to +20-kb myocyte enhancer factor 2b ( Mef2b )’s intronic enhancer, repressing MEF2B-mediated germinal center B cell differentiation and promoting ABC formation. ZEB2 also targets genes important for ABC specification and function, including Itgax . ZEB2-driven ABC differentiation requires JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription), and treatment with JAK1/3 inhibitor reduces ABC accumulation in autoimmune mice and patients. Thus, ZEB2 emerges as a driver of B cell autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "A role for vitamin D in immune modulation and in cancer has been suggested. In this work, we report that mice with increased availability of vitamin D display greater immune-dependent resistance to transplantable cancers and augmented responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Similarly, in humans, vitamin D–induced genes correlate with improved responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment as well as with immunity to cancer and increased overall survival. In mice, resistance is attributable to the activity of vitamin D on intestinal epithelial cells, which alters microbiome composition in favor of Bacteroides fragilis , which positively regulates cancer immunity. Our findings indicate a previously unappreciated connection between vitamin D, microbial commensal communities, and immune responses to cancer. Collectively, they highlight vitamin D levels as a potential determinant of cancer immunity and immunotherapy success.",

A primary-, secondary-, or tertiary-amino–silane alone negatively or barely affected perovskite crystallinity and charge transport, but amino-silanes that incorporate primary and secondary amines yield up to a 60-fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield and preserve long-range conduction. Amino-silane–treated devices retained 95% power conversion efficiency for more than 1500 hours under full-spectrum sunlight at 85°C and open-circuit conditions in ambient air with a relative humidity of 50 to 60%.",

This problem has puzzled the community for decades because of the complexity of interactions between air components and their impact on both bulk and surfaces of NLOs. We show here that water vapor plays a pivotal role in initiating destructive acid and oxidative degradations of NLOs only when coupled with carbon dioxide or oxygen, respectively. Quantification analysis revealed that reducing the defined cation competition coefficient (η), which integrates the effects of ionic potential and sodium content, and increasing the particle size can enhance the resistance to acid attack, whereas using high-potential redox couples can eliminate oxidative degradation. These findings elucidate the underlying air deterioration mechanisms and rationalize the design of air-stable NLOs.",

We report the counterintuitive observation that strongly absorbing molecules can achieve optical transparency in live animals. We explored the physics behind this observation and found that when strongly absorbing molecules dissolve in water, they can modify the refractive index of the aqueous medium through the Kramers-Kronig relations to match that of high-index tissue components such as lipids. We have demonstrated that our straightforward approach can reversibly render a live mouse body transparent to allow visualization of a wide range of deep-seated structures and activities. This work suggests that the search for high-performance optical clearing agents should focus on strongly absorbing molecules.",

Embedding platinum into the palladium oxide crystal structure stabilized oxidized platinum species, resulting in improved catalyst performance. The reaction kinetics suggest that epoxidation on PdPtO x /C proceeds through electrophilic attack by metal-bound peroxo intermediates.

BI-hTFR1 was actively transported across human brain endothelial cells and, relative to AAV9, provided 40 to 50 times greater reporter expression in the CNS of human TFRC knockin mice. The enhanced tropism was CNS-specific and absent in wild-type mice. When used to deliver GBA1 , mutations of which cause Gaucher disease and are linked to Parkinson’s disease, BI-hTFR1 substantially increased brain and cerebrospinal fluid glucocerebrosidase activity compared with AAV9.

We investigate the performance of a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) based on sliding ferroelectricity in bilayer boron nitride at room temperature. Sliding ferroelectricity represents a different form of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics, characterized by the switching of out-of-plane polarization through interlayer sliding motion. We examined the FeFET device employing monolayer graphene as the channel layer, which demonstrated ultrafast switching speeds on the nanosecond scale and high endurance exceeding 10 11 switching cycles, comparable to state-of-the-art FeFET devices. These characteristics highlight the potential of 2D sliding ferroelectrics for inspiring next-generation nonvolatile memory technology.",

We report direct measurements of an elevated outgassing rate of 84% (by volume) of H 2 from the deep underground Bulqizë chromite mine in Albania. A minimum of 200 tons of H 2 is vented annually from the mine’s galleries, making it one of the largest recorded H 2 flow rates to date. We cannot attribute the flux solely to the release of paleo-fluids trapped within the rocks or to present-day active and pervasive serpentinization of ultramafic rocks; rather, our results demonstrate the presence of a faulted reservoir deeply rooted in the Jurassic ophiolite massif.

    "abstract": "China’s massive wave of urbanization may be threatened by land subsidence. Using a spaceborne synthetic aperture radar interferometry technique, we provided a systematic assessment of land subsidence in all of China’s major cities from 2015 to 2022. Of the examined urban lands, 45% are subsiding faster than 3 millimeters per year, and 16% are subsiding faster than 10 millimeters per year, affecting 29 and 7% of the urban population, respectively. The subsidence appears to be associated with a range of factors such as groundwater withdrawal and the weight of buildings. By 2120, 22 to 26% of China’s coastal lands will have a relative elevation lower than sea level, hosting 9 to 11% of the coastal population, because of the combined effect of city subsidence and sea-level rise. Our results underscore the necessity of enhancing protective measures to mitigate potential damages from subsidence.",

    "abstract": "The Hubbard model is an iconic model in quantum many-body physics and has been intensely studied, especially since the discovery of high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Combining the complementary capabilities of two computational methods, we found superconductivity in both the electron- and hole-doped regimes of the two-dimensional Hubbard model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. In the electron-doped regime, superconductivity was weaker and was accompanied by antiferromagnetic Néel correlations at low doping. The strong superconductivity on the hole-doped side coexisted with stripe order, which persisted into the overdoped region with weaker hole-density modulation. These stripe orders varied in fillings between 0.6 and 0.8. Our results suggest the applicability of the Hubbard model with next-nearest hopping for describing cuprate high–transition temperature ( T c ) superconductivity.",

The combination yielded a best overall response rate of 53% (10/19). Ruxolitinib significantly reduced neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and percentages of myeloid suppressor cells but increased numbers of cytokine-producing T cells.

This study introduces the use of apportionment entropy as a robust measure to assess flow-volume nonuniformity across seasons, enabling a global analysis. We found that ~21% of long-term river gauging stations exhibit significant alterations in seasonal flow distributions, but two-thirds of these are unrelated to trends in annual mean discharge. By combining a data-driven runoff reconstruction with state-of-the-art hydrological simulations, we identified a discernible weakening of river flow seasonality in northern high latitudes (above 50°N), a phenomenon directly linked to anthropogenic climate forcing.",

Rational catalyst design requires theoretical guidance and clear mechanistic understanding. Recently, a spin-mediated promotion mechanism was proposed to activate traditionally unreactive magnetic materials such as cobalt (Co) for ammonia synthesis by introducing hetero metal atoms bound to the active site of the catalyst surface. We combined theory and experiment to validate this promotion mechanism on a lanthanum (La)/Co system. By conducting model catalyst studies on Co single crystals and mass-selected Co nanoparticles at ambient pressure, we identified the active site for ammonia synthesis as the B 5 site of Co steps with La adsorption. The turnover frequency of 0.47 ± 0.03 per second achieved on the La/Co system at 350°C and 1 bar surpasses those of other model catalysts tested under identical conditions.",

However, small-molecule concepts that address oncogenic KRAS alleles remain elusive beyond replacing glycine at position 12 with cysteine (G12C), which is clinically drugged through covalent inhibitors. Guided by biophysical and structural studies of ternary complexes, we designed a heterobifunctional small molecule that potently degrades 13 out of 17 of the most prevalent oncogenic KRAS alleles. Compared with inhibition, KRAS degradation results in more profound and sustained pathway modulation across a broad range of KRAS mutant cell lines, killing cancer cells while sparing models without genetic KRAS aberrations. Pharmacological degradation of oncogenic KRAS was tolerated and led to tumor regression in vivo. Together, these findings unveil a new path toward addressing KRAS-driven cancers with small-molecule degraders.",

We show that competitive interactions among populations with sublinear growth do not lead to exclusion, as occurs with logistic growth, but instead promote stability at higher diversity. Our model realigns theory with classic observations and predicts large-scale macroecological patterns. However, it makes an unsettling prediction: Biodiversity loss may accelerate the destabilization of ecosystems.",

There is a clear need for the design of inherently recyclable ERTs that are based on renewable resources. We present the synthesis and closed-loop recycling of a fully lignocellulose-derivable epoxy resin (DGF/MBCA), prepared from dimethyl ester of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (DMFD), 4,4′-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (MBCA), and glycidol, which displays excellent thermomechanical properties (a glass transition temperature of 170°C, and a storage modulus at 25°C of 1.2 gigapascals). Notably, the material undergoes methanolysis in the absence of any catalyst, regenerating 90% of the original DMFD. The diamine MBCA and glycidol can subsequently be reformed by acetolysis. Application and recycling of DGF/MBCA in glass and plant fiber composites are demonstrated.",

Long-term experiments, various membrane tests, and different size assessments demonstrate the stability, compatibility, and scalability of STLES.

Our new reconstruction of temperature change over the past 4.5 million years includes two phases of long-term cooling, with the second phase of accelerated cooling during the Middle Pleistocene Transition (1.5 to 0.9 million years ago) being accompanied by a transition from dominant 41,000-year low-amplitude periodicity to dominant 100,000-year high-amplitude periodicity.

Whereas the combination of woven COFs with amorphous and brittle polymethyl methacrylate results in surface interactions, the use of the liquid-crystalline polymer polyimide induces the formation of polymer-COF junctions. These junctions are generated by the threading of polymer chains through the pores of the nanocrystals, thus allowing for spatial arrangement of polymer strands. This offers a programmable pathway for unthreading polymer strands under stress and leads to the in situ formation of high-aspect-ratio nanofibrils, which dissipate energy during the fracture. Polymer-COF junctions also strengthen the filler-matrix interfaces and lower the percolation thresholds of the composites, enhancing strength, ductility, and toughness of the composites by adding small amounts (~1 weight %) of woven COF nanocrystals. The ability of the polymer strands to closely interact with the woven framework is highlighted as the main parameter to forming these junctions, thus affecting polymer chain penetration and conformation.",

Activation of astrocytic IDO1 by amyloid β and tau oligomers increases KYN and suppresses glycolysis in an aryl hydrocarbon receptor–dependent manner. In amyloid and tau models, IDO1 inhibition improves hippocampal glucose metabolism and rescues hippocampal long-term potentiation in a monocarboxylate transporter–dependent manner. In astrocytic and neuronal cocultures from AD subjects, IDO1 inhibition improved astrocytic production of lactate and uptake by neurons. Thus, IDO1 inhibitors presently developed for cancer might be repurposed for treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and drug-resistant mutants calls for additional oral antivirals. The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL pro ) is a promising but challenging drug target. We designed and synthesized 85 noncovalent PL pro inhibitors that bind to a recently discovered ubiquitin binding site and the known BL2 groove pocket near the S4 subsite. Leads inhibited PL pro with the inhibitory constant K i values from 13.2 to 88.2 nanomolar. The co-crystal structures of PL pro with eight leads revealed their interaction modes. The in vivo lead Jun12682 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, including nirmatrelvir-resistant strains with EC 50 from 0.44 to 2.02 micromolar. Oral treatment with Jun12682 improved survival and reduced lung viral loads and lesions in a SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model, suggesting that PL pro inhibitors are promising oral SARS-CoV-2 antiviral candidates.",

We propose and demonstrate a circuit architecture and programming protocol that converts the analog computing result to digital at the last step and enables low-precision analog devices to perform high-precision computing. We use a weighted sum of multiple devices to represent one number, in which subsequently programmed devices are used to compensate for preceding programming errors. With a memristor system-on-chip, we experimentally demonstrate high-precision solutions for multiple scientific computing tasks while maintaining a substantial power efficiency advantage over conventional digital approaches.",

However, twisted homobilayers have been difficult to study in the limit of large moiré wavelengths, where interactions are most dominant. In this study, we conducted local electronic compressibility measurements of twisted bilayer WSe 2 (tWSe 2 ) at small twist angles. We demonstrated multiple topological bands that host a series of Chern insulators at zero magnetic field near a “magic angle” around 1.23°. Using a locally applied electric field, we induced a topological quantum-phase transition at one hole per moiré unit cell. Our work establishes the topological phase diagram of a generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in tWSe 2 , demonstrating a tunable platform for strongly correlated topological phases.",

However, its journey from a wild gathered food to domestication remains enigmatic, sparking ongoing debates in the biological and anthropological fields. Here, we present evidence of rice phytoliths sampled from two archaeological sites in China, Shangshan and Hehuashan, near the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. We demonstrate the growth of wild rice at least 100,000 years before present, its initial exploitation as a gathered resource at about 24,000 years before present, its predomestication cultivation at about 13,000 years before present, and eventually its domestication at about 11,000 years before present. These developmental stages illuminate a protracted process of rice domestication in East Asia and extend the continuous records of cereal evolution beyond the Fertile Crescent.",

What drives these changes and how they relate to genetic susceptibility in this complex condition are not well understood. We performed deep single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to examine cell composition and transcriptomics, identifying dysregulation of cell type–specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which we corroborated using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics. Transcriptomic changes were primarily cell type specific, involving multiple cell types, most prominently interhemispheric and callosal-projecting neurons, interneurons within superficial laminae, and distinct glial reactive states involving oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. Autism-associated GRN drivers and their targets were enriched in rare and common genetic risk variants, connecting autism genetic susceptibility and cellular and circuit alterations in the human brain.",

Yet little is understood about how genetic variants influence cell-level gene expression. Addressing this, we uniformly processed single-nuclei, multiomics datasets into a resource comprising >2.8 million nuclei from the prefrontal cortex across 388 individuals. For 28 cell types, we assessed population-level variation in expression and chromatin across gene families and drug targets. We identified >550,000 cell type–specific regulatory elements and >1.4 million single-cell expression quantitative trait loci, which we used to build cell-type regulatory and cell-to-cell communication networks. These networks manifest cellular changes in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders. We further constructed an integrative model accurately imputing single-cell expression and simulating perturbations; the model prioritized ~250 disease-risk genes and drug targets with associated cell types.",

We report the QAHE in a rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) heterostructure. Distinct from other experimentally confirmed QAHE systems, this system has neither magnetic element nor moiré superlattice effect. The QAH states emerge at charge neutrality and feature Chern numbers C = ±5 at temperatures of up to about 1.5 kelvin. This large QAHE arises from the synergy of the electron correlation in intrinsic flat bands of pentalayer graphene, the gate-tuning effect, and the proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of crystalline two-dimensional materials for intertwined electron correlation and band topology physics and may enable a route for engineering chiral Majorana edge states.",

However, advancing their U e beyond 200 joules per cubic centimeter is challenging, limiting their potential for next-generation energy-storage devices. We implemented a partitioning polar-slush strategy in RFEs to push the boundary of U e . Guided by phase-field simulations, we designed and fabricated high-performance Bi(Mg 0.5 Ti 0.5 )O 3 -SrTiO 3 –based RFE films with isolated slush-like polar clusters, which were realized through suppression of the nonpolar cubic matrix and introduction of highly insulating networks. The simultaneous enhancement of the reversible polarization and breakdown strength leads to a U e of 202 joules per cubic centimeter with a high efficiency of ~79%. The proposed strategy provides a design freedom for next-generation high-performance dielectrics.",

We assessed these responses using two Earth system models by comparing a scenario with extensive global forest expansion in suitable regions to other plausible futures. We found that forestation increased aerosol scattering and the greenhouse gases methane and ozone following increased biogenic organic emissions. Additionally, forestation decreased surface albedo, which yielded a positive radiative forcing (i.e., warming). This offset up to a third of the negative forcing from the additional CO 2 removal under a 4°C warming scenario. However, when forestation was pursued alongside other strategies that achieve the 2°C Paris Agreement target, the offsetting positive forcing was smaller, highlighting the urgency for simultaneous emission reductions.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary materials discovery requires intricate sequences of synthesis, formulation, and characterization that often span multiple locations with specialized expertise or instrumentation. To accelerate these workflows, we present a cloud-based strategy that enabled delocalized and asynchronous design-make-test-analyze cycles. We showcased this approach through the exploration of molecular gain materials for organic solid-state lasers as a frontier application in molecular optoelectronics. Distributed robotic synthesis and in-line property characterization, orchestrated by a cloud-based artificial intelligence experiment planner, resulted in the discovery of 21 new state-of-the-art materials. Gram-scale synthesis ultimately allowed for the verification of best-in-class stimulated emission in a thin-film device. Demonstrating the asynchronous integration of five laboratories across the globe, this workflow provides a blueprint for delocalizing—and democratizing—scientific discovery.",

Using detailed global and regional plastics datasets coupled with socioeconomic data, we employ machine learning to predict that, without intervention, annual mismanaged plastic waste will nearly double to 121 million metric tonnes (Mt) [100 to 139 Mt 95% confidence interval] by 2050. Annual greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic system are projected to grow by 37% to 3.35 billion tonnes CO 2 equivalent (3.09 to 3.54) over the same period. The United Nations plastic pollution treaty presents an opportunity to reshape these outcomes. We simulate eight candidate treaty policies and find that just four could together reduce mismanaged plastic waste by 91% (86 to 98%) and gross plastic–related greenhouse gas emissions by one-third.",

Although ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) is a promising alternative, its poor stability has hindered practical application. We used well-defined extended surface models to identify that RuO 2 undergoes structure-dependent corrosion that causes Ru dissolution. Tantalum (Ta) doping effectively stabilized RuO 2 against such corrosion and enhanced the intrinsic activity of RuO 2 . In an industrial demonstration, Ta-RuO 2 electrocatalyst exhibited stability near that of IrO 2 and had a performance decay rate of ~14 microvolts per hour in a 2800-hour test. At current densities of 1 ampere per square centimeter, it had an overpotential 330 millivolts less than that of IrO 2 .",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, sharks have been increasingly recognized among the world’s most threatened wildlife and hence have received heightened scientific and regulatory scrutiny. Yet, the effect of protective regulations on shark fishing mortality has not been evaluated at a global scale. Here we estimate that total fishing mortality increased from at least 76 to 80 million sharks between 2012 and 2019, ~25 million of which were threatened species. Mortality increased by 4% in coastal waters but decreased by 7% in pelagic fisheries, especially across the Atlantic and Western Pacific. By linking fishing mortality data to the global regulatory landscape, we show that widespread legislation designed to prevent shark finning did not reduce mortality but that regional shark fishing or retention bans had some success. These analyses, combined with expert interviews, highlight evidence-based solutions to reverse the continued overexploitation of sharks.",

How much of this knowledge is learnable from sensory input with relatively generic learning mechanisms, and how much requires stronger inductive biases? Using longitudinal head-mounted camera recordings from one child aged 6 to 25 months, we trained a relatively generic neural network on 61 hours of correlated visual-linguistic data streams, learning feature-based representations and cross-modal associations. Our model acquires many word-referent mappings present in the child’s everyday experience, enables zero-shot generalization to new visual referents, and aligns its visual and linguistic conceptual systems. These results show how critical aspects of grounded word meaning are learnable through joint representation and associative learning from one child’s input.",

Brassinosteroids are synthesized in the cell interior but bind receptors at the cell surface, necessitating a yet to be identified export mechanism. Here, we show that a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, ABCB19, functions as a brassinosteroid exporter. We present its structure in both the substrate-unbound and the brassinosteroid-bound states. Bioactive brassinosteroids are potent activators of ABCB19 ATP hydrolysis activity, and transport assays showed that ABCB19 transports brassinosteroids. In Arabidopsis thaliana , ABCB19 and its close homolog, ABCB1, positively regulate brassinosteroid responses. Our results uncover an elusive export mechanism for bioactive brassinosteroids that is tightly coordinated with brassinosteroid signaling.",

Cells lacking p53 can still undergo apoptosis upon DNA damage, yet the responsible pathways are unknown. We observed that p53-independent apoptosis in response to DNA damage coincided with translation inhibition, which was characterized by ribosome stalling on rare leucine-encoding UUA codons and globally curtailed translation initiation. A genetic screen identified the transfer RNAse SLFN11 and the kinase GCN2 as factors required for UUA stalling and global translation inhibition, respectively. Stalled ribosomes activated a ribotoxic stress signal conveyed by the ribosome sensor ZAKα to the apoptosis machinery. These results provide an explanation for the frequent inactivation of SLFN11 in chemotherapy-unresponsive tumors and highlight ribosome stalling as a signaling event affecting cell fate in response to DNA damage.",

This generalizable approach reaches high monomer conversion at room temperature without the need for additional stimuli, such as light or heat after printing, and enables additive manufacturing of highly entangled hydrogels and elastomers that exhibit fourfold- to sevenfold-higher extension energies in comparison to that of traditional DLP. We used this method to print high-resolution and multimaterial structures with features such as spatially programmed adhesion to wet tissues.",

Here, we introduce EBCare, a mask-based device for real-time in situ monitoring of EBC biomarkers. Using a tandem cooling strategy, automated microfluidics, highly selective electrochemical biosensors, and a wireless reading circuit, EBCare enables continuous multimodal monitoring of EBC analytes across real-life indoor and outdoor activities. We validated EBCare’s usability in assessing metabolic conditions and respiratory airway inflammation in healthy participants, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and patients after COVID-19 infection.",

This simplification, for example, in the form of intensively managed monocultures, poses a risk to keeping the world within safe and just Earth system boundaries. Here, we estimated how agricultural diversification simultaneously affects social and environmental outcomes. Drawing from 24 studies in 11 countries across 2655 farms, we show how five diversification strategies focusing on livestock, crops, soils, noncrop plantings, and water conservation benefit social (e.g., human well-being, yields, and food security) and environmental (e.g., biodiversity, ecosystem services, and reduced environmental externalities) outcomes. We found that applying multiple diversification strategies creates more positive outcomes than individual management strategies alone. To realize these benefits, well-designed policies are needed to incentivize the adoption of multiple diversification strategies in unison.",

Two general paradigms have been proposed to explain this variation: (i) trade-offs between performance efficiency and breadth and (ii) the joint influence of extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic (genomic) factors. We assembled genomic, metabolic, and ecological data from nearly all known species of the ancient fungal subphylum Saccharomycotina (1154 yeast strains from 1051 species), grown in 24 different environmental conditions, to examine niche breadth evolution. We found that large differences in the breadth of carbon utilization traits between yeasts stem from intrinsic differences in genes encoding specific metabolic pathways, but we found limited evidence for trade-offs. These comprehensive data argue that intrinsic factors shape niche breadth variation in microbes.",

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a prevalent reproductive disorder in women of reproductive age, features androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Despite its high prevalence, specific pharmacologic intervention for PCOS is challenging. In this study, we identified artemisinins as anti-PCOS agents. Our finding demonstrated the efficacy of artemisinin derivatives in alleviating PCOS symptoms in both rodent models and human patients, curbing hyperandrogenemia through suppression of ovarian androgen synthesis. Artemisinins promoted cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1) protein degradation to block androgen overproduction. Mechanistically, artemisinins directly targeted lon peptidase 1 (LONP1), enhanced LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction, and facilitated LONP1-catalyzed CYP11A1 degradation. Overexpression of LONP1 replicated the androgen-lowering effect of artemisinins. Our data suggest that artemisinin application is a promising approach for treating PCOS and highlight the crucial role of the LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction in controlling hyperandrogenism and PCOS occurrence.",

This has challenged conventional understanding of the sources of their volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors. Using airborne flux measurements to map emissions of a wide range of VOCs, we demonstrate that biogenic terpenoid emissions contribute ~60% of emitted VOC OH reactivity, ozone, and secondary organic aerosol formation potential in summertime Los Angeles and that this contribution strongly increases with temperature. This implies that control of nitrogen oxides is key to reducing ozone formation in Los Angeles. We also show some anthropogenic VOC emissions increase with temperature, which is an effect not represented in current inventories. Air pollution mitigation efforts must consider that climate warming will strongly change emission amounts and composition.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors can stimulate antitumor immunity but can also induce toxicities termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Colitis is a common and severe irAE that can lead to treatment discontinuation. Mechanistic understanding of gut irAEs has been hampered because robust colitis is not observed in laboratory mice treated with checkpoint inhibitors. We report here that this limitation can be overcome by using mice harboring the microbiota of wild-caught mice, which develop overt colitis following treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Intestinal inflammation is driven by unrestrained activation of IFNγ-producing CD4 + T cells and depletion of peripherally induced regulatory T cells through Fcγ receptor signaling. Accordingly, anti-CTLA-4 nanobodies that lack an Fc domain can promote antitumor responses without triggering colitis. This work suggests a strategy for mitigating gut irAEs while preserving antitumor stimulating effects of CTLA-4 blockade.",

The nature of these mass gap objects is unknown, as is the formation of their host binary systems. We report pulsar timing observations made with the Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT) of PSR J0514−4002E, an eccentric binary millisecond pulsar in the globular cluster NGC 1851. We found a total binary mass of 3.887 ± 0.004 solar masses ( M ⊙ ), and multiwavelength observations show that the pulsar’s binary companion is also a compact object. The companion’s mass (2.09 to 2.71 M ⊙ , 95% confidence interval) is in the mass gap, indicating either a very massive NS or a low-mass BH. We propose that the companion formed in a merger between two earlier NSs.",

To achieve this, we have exploited dynamic covalent networks that contain labile, dynamic thia-Michael bonds, whose extent of bonding can be thermally modulated and retained through tempering, akin to the process used in metallurgy. In addition, we show that the shape memory behavior of these materials can be tailored through tempering and that these materials can be patterned to spatially control mechanical properties.",

Therefore, we established a systemwide portrait of KRAS- and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)–dependent gene transcription in KRAS-mutant cancer to delineate the molecular mechanisms of growth and of inhibitor resistance. Unexpectedly, our KRAS-dependent gene signature diverges substantially from the frequently cited Hallmark KRAS signaling gene signature, is driven predominantly through the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and accurately reflects KRAS- and ERK-regulated gene transcription in KRAS-mutant cancer patients. Integration with our ERK-regulated phospho- and total proteome highlights ERK deregulation of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and other components of the cell cycle machinery as key processes that drive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) growth. Our findings elucidate mechanistically the critical role of ERK in driving KRAS-mutant tumor growth and in resistance to KRAS-ERK MAPK targeted therapies.",

We administered GLP-1RAs to patients with obesity and observed a heightened sense of preingestive satiation. Analysis of human and mouse brain samples pinpointed GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) as candidates for encoding preingestive satiation. Optogenetic manipulation of DMH GLP-1R neurons caused satiation. Calcium imaging demonstrated that these neurons are actively involved in encoding preingestive satiation. GLP-1RA administration increased the activity of DMH GLP-1R neurons selectively during eating behavior. We further identified that an intricate interplay between DMH GLP-1R neurons and neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARC NPY/AgRP neurons) occurs to regulate food intake. Our findings reveal a hypothalamic mechanism through which GLP-1RAs control preingestive satiation, offering previously unexplored neural targets for obesity and metabolic diseases.",

This characteristic hinders dislocation nucleation in ceramics, thereby impeding the enhancement of plasticity through a dislocation-engineering strategy commonly used in metals. Finding a strategy that continuously generates dislocations within ceramics may enhance plasticity. Here, we propose a “borrowing-dislocations” strategy that uses a tailored interfacial structure with well-ordered bonds. Such an approach enables ceramics to have greatly improved tensile ductility by mobilizing a considerable number of dislocations in ceramic borrowed from metal through the interface, thereby overcoming the challenge associated with direct dislocation nucleation within ceramics.

In this study, we establish that aging of the immune system, regardless of the age of the stroma and tumor, drives lung cancer progression. Hematopoietic aging enhances emergency myelopoiesis, resulting in the local accumulation of myeloid progenitor–like cells in lung tumors. These cells are a major source of interleukin (IL)–1⍺, which drives the enhanced myeloid response. The age-associated decline of DNA methyltransferase 3A enhances IL-1⍺ production, and disrupting IL-1 receptor 1 signaling early during tumor development normalized myelopoiesis and slowed the growth of lung, colonic, and pancreatic tumors. In human tumors, we identified an enrichment for IL-1⍺–expressing monocyte-derived macrophages linked to age, poorer survival, and recurrence, unraveling how aging promotes cancer and offering actionable therapeutic strategies.",

Here, we demonstrate subambient daytime radiative cooling of vertical surfaces under peak sunlight using a hierarchically designed, angularly asymmetric, spectrally selective thermal emitter. Under peak sunlight of about 920 watts per square meter, our emitter reaches a temperature that is about 2.5°C below ambient temperature, corresponding to a temperature reduction of about 4.3° and 8.9°C compared with a silica-polymer hybrid radiative cooler and commercial white paint, respectively.",

Here, we established a stable orthogonal replication system in Escherichia coli. The orthogonal replicon can carry diverse cargos of at least 16.5 kilobases and is not copied by host polymerases but is selectively copied by an orthogonal DNA polymerase (O-DNAP), which does not copy the genome. We designed mutant O-DNAPs that selectively increase the mutation rate of the orthogonal replicon by two to four orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the utility of our system for accelerated continuous evolution by evolving a 150-fold increase in resistance to tigecycline in 12 days. And, starting from a GFP variant, we evolved a 1000-fold increase in cellular fluorescence in 5 days.",

    "abstract": "Snakes and lizards (Squamata) represent a third of terrestrial vertebrates and exhibit spectacular innovations in locomotion, feeding, and sensory processing. However, the evolutionary drivers of this radiation remain poorly known. We infer potential causes and ultimate consequences of squamate macroevolution by combining individual-based natural history observations (>60,000 animals) with a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny that we anchored with genomic data (5400 loci) from 1018 species. Due to shifts in the dynamics of speciation and phenotypic evolution, snakes have transformed the trophic structure of animal communities through the recurrent origin and diversification of specialized predatory strategies. Squamate biodiversity reflects a legacy of singular events that occurred during the early history of snakes and reveals the impact of historical contingency on vertebrate biodiversity.",

However, the factors responsible for sex differences in tissue immunity remain poorly understood. Here, we uncovered a dominant role for type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in shaping sexual immune dimorphism within the skin. Mechanistically, negative regulation of ILC2s by androgens leads to a reduction in dendritic cell accumulation and activation in males, along with reduced tissue immunity. Collectively, our results reveal a role for the androgen-ILC2-dendritic cell axis in controlling sexual immune dimorphism. Moreover, this work proposes that tissue immune set points are defined by the dual action of sex hormones and the microbiota, with sex hormones controlling the strength of local immunity and microbiota calibrating its tone.",

We found that so-designed compositions have both larger power factors and lower thermal conductivities and that one of these compositions exhibits a large thermoelectric figure of merit value in comparison with to other p-type Zintls. Our material shows high stability both thermally and temporally.

Carbon nanotube fibers are one of the most promising candidates. Using a strategy to optimize hierarchical structures, we fabricated carbon nanotube fibers with a dynamic strength of 14 gigapascals (GPa) and excellent energy absorption. The dynamic performance of the fibers is attributed to the simultaneous breakage of individual nanotubes and delocalization of impact energy that occurs during the high–strain rate loading process; these behaviors are due to improvements in interfacial interactions, nanotube alignment, and densification therein. This work presents an effective strategy to utilize the strength of individual carbon nanotubes at the macroscale and provides fresh mechanism insights.",

The high stability results from vapor-enabled homogeneous fluorine passivation over large-area perovskite surfaces, suppressing defect formation energy and ion diffusion. The extracted degradation activation energy of 0.61 electron volts for solar modules is comparable to that of most reported stable cells, which indicates that modules are not inherently less stable than cells and closes the cell-to-module stability gap.",

Our findings indicate general concordance between utilized and total plant diversity, supporting the potential for simultaneously conserving species diversity and its contributions to people. Although Indigenous lands across Mesoamerica, the Horn of Africa, and Southern Asia harbor a disproportionate diversity of utilized plants, the incidence of protected areas is negatively correlated with utilized species richness.

    "abstract": "The steps governing healing with or without fibrosis within the same microenvironment are unclear. After acute kidney injury (AKI), injured proximal tubular epithelial cells activate SOX9 for self-restoration. Using a multimodal approach for a head-to-head comparison of injury-induced SOX9 lineages, we identified a dynamic SOX9 switch in repairing epithelia. Lineages that regenerated epithelia silenced SOX9 and healed without fibrosis (SOX9 on-off ). By contrast, lineages with unrestored apicobasal polarity maintained SOX9 activity in sustained efforts to regenerate, which were identified as a SOX9 on-on Cadherin6 pos cell state. These reprogrammed cells generated substantial single-cell WNT activity to provoke a fibroproliferative response in adjacent fibroblasts, driving AKI to chronic kidney disease. Transplanted human kidneys displayed similar SOX9/CDH6/WNT2B responses. Thus, we have uncovered a sensor of epithelial repair status, the activity of which determines regeneration with or without fibrosis.",

It is unclear whether SynGAP imparts structural properties at synapses independently of its GAP activity. Here, we report that inactivating mutations within the GAP domain do not inhibit synaptic plasticity or cause behavioral deficits. Instead, SynGAP modulates synaptic strength by physically competing with the AMPA-receptor-TARP excitatory receptor complex in the formation of molecular condensates with synaptic scaffolding proteins. These results have major implications for developing therapeutic treatments for SYNGAP1 -related neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Using a permanent 0.05 Tesla magnet and deep learning for electromagnetic interference elimination, we developed a whole-body scanner that operates using a standard wall power outlet and without radiofrequency and magnetic shielding. We demonstrated its wide-ranging applicability for imaging various anatomical structures. Furthermore, we developed three-dimensional deep learning reconstruction to boost image quality by harnessing extensive high-field MRI data. These advances pave the way for affordable deep learning–powered ultra-low-field MRI scanners, addressing unmet clinical needs in diverse health care settings worldwide.",

We show that replication fork collapse at leading-strand nicks generates resected single-ended double-strand breaks (seDSBs) that are repaired by homologous recombination (HR). If these seDSBs are not promptly repaired, arrival of adjacent forks creates double-ended DSBs (deDSBs), which could drive genomic scarring in HR-deficient cancers. deDSBs can also be generated directly when the replication fork bypasses lagging-strand nicks. Unlike deDSBs produced independently of replication, end resection at nick-induced seDSBs and deDSBs is BRCA1-independent. Nevertheless, BRCA1 antagonizes 53BP1 suppression of RAD51 filament formation. These results highlight distinctive mechanisms that maintain replication fork stability.",

We report an interfacial epitaxy methodology for their growth of several compositions, including molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), molybdenum diselenide, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, niobium disulfide, niobium diselenide, and molybdenum sulfoselenide. Feeding of metals and chalcogens continuously to the interface between a single-crystal Ni substrate and grown layers ensured consistent 3R stacking sequence and controlled thickness from a few to 15,000 layers. Comprehensive characterizations confirmed the large-scale uniformity, high crystallinity, and phase purity of these films.

Notably, a Gln 226 Leu substitution switched Texas HA binding specificity to human-type receptors, which was enhanced when combined with an Asn 224 Lys mutation. Crystal structures of the Texas HA with avian receptor analog LSTa and its Gln 226 Leu mutant with human receptor analog LSTc elucidated the structural basis for this preferential receptor recognition.

    "abstract": "Mapping single-neuron projections is essential for understanding brain-wide connectivity and diverse functions of the hippocampus (HIP). Here, we reconstructed 10,100 single-neuron projectomes of mouse HIP and classified 43 projectome subtypes with distinct projection patterns. The number of projection targets and axon-tip distribution depended on the soma location along HIP longitudinal and transverse axes. Many projectome subtypes were enriched in specific HIP subdomains defined by spatial transcriptomic profiles. Furthermore, we delineated comprehensive wiring diagrams for HIP neurons projecting exclusively within the HIP formation (HPF) and for those projecting to both intra- and extra-HPF targets. Bihemispheric projecting neurons generally projected to one pair of homologous targets with ipsilateral preference. These organization principles of single-neuron projectomes provide a structural basis for understanding the function of HIP neurons.",

    "abstract": "The complexity and heterogeneity of schizophrenia have hindered mechanistic elucidation and the development of more effective therapies. Here, we performed single-cell dissection of schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic changes in the human prefrontal cortex across 140 individuals in two independent cohorts. Excitatory neurons were the most affected cell group, with transcriptional changes converging on neurodevelopment and synapse-related molecular pathways. Transcriptional alterations included known genetic risk factors, suggesting convergence of rare and common genomic variants on neuronal population-specific alterations in schizophrenia. Based on the magnitude of schizophrenia-associated transcriptional change, we identified two populations of individuals with schizophrenia marked by expression of specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal cell states. This single-cell atlas links transcriptomic changes to etiological genetic risk factors, contextualizing established knowledge within the human cortical cytoarchitecture and facilitating mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia pathophysiology and heterogeneity.",

Separately, they have both been found in certain nematic liquid crystalline phases; however, they have never been observed simultaneously. Here, we report a heliconical arrangement of achiral molecules in the ferroelectric nematic phase. The phase is thus spontaneously both polar and chiral. Notably, the pitch of the heliconical structure is comparable to the wavelength of visible light, giving selective reflection controllable by temperature or application of a weak electric field. Despite bearing resemblance to the heliconical twist-bend nematic phase, this chiral ferroelectric nematic phase arises from electrical interactions that induce a noncollinear orientation of electric dipoles.",

We report a family of stabilized αLA polymer adhesives that can be tailored for a variety of medical or nonmedical uses and sustainably sourced and recycled in a closed-loop manner. Minor changes in monomer composition afforded a pressure-sensitive adhesive that functions well in dry and wet conditions, as well as a structural adhesive with strength equivalent to that of conventional epoxies. αLA surgical superglue successfully sealed murine amniotic sac ruptures, increasing fetal survival from 0 to 100%.",

Ecologists have documented both the importance of bats as natural predators of insects as well as their population declines after the emergence of a wildlife disease, resulting in a potential decline in biological pest control. In this work, I study how species interactions can extend beyond an ecosystem and affect agriculture and human health. I find that farmers compensated for bat decline by increasing their insecticide use by 31.1%. The compensatory increase in insecticide use by farmers adversely affected health—human infant mortality increased by 7.9% in the counties that experienced bat die-offs. These findings provide empirical validation to previous theoretical predictions about how ecosystem disruptions can have meaningful social costs.",

Here, we introduce a water-soluble sacrificial layer, “super-tetragonal” Sr 4 Al 2 O 7 (SAO T ). The low-symmetric crystal structure enables a superior capability to sustain epitaxial strain, allowing for broad tunability in lattice constants. The resultant structural coherency and defect-free interface in perovskite ABO 3 /SAO T heterostructures effectively restrain crack formation during the water release of freestanding oxide membranes. For a variety of nonferroelectric oxide membranes, the crack-free areas can span up to a millimeter in scale. This compelling feature, combined with the inherent high water solubility, makes SAO T a versatile and feasible sacrificial layer for producing high-quality freestanding oxide membranes, thereby boosting their potential for innovative device applications.",

Nevertheless, the high reactivity of HAT reagents, coupled with the small differences among various C(sp 3 )–H bond strengths, renders site-selective transformations of straight-chain alkanes a great challenge. Here, we present a photocatalytic intermolecular radical sampling process for the iron-catalyzed borylation of terminal C(sp 3 )–H bonds in substrates with small steric hindrance, including unbranched alkanes. Mechanistic investigations have revealed that the reaction proceeds through a reversible HAT process, followed by a selective borylation of carbon radicals. A boron-sulfoxide complex may contribute to the high terminal regioselectivity observed.",

Intriguingly, LUAD can histologically transform into SCLC after treatment with targeted therapies. In this study, we designed models to follow the conversion of LUAD to SCLC and found that the barrier to histological transformation converges on tolerance to Myc, which we implicate as a lineage-specific driver of the pulmonary neuroendocrine cell. Histological transformations are frequently accompanied by activation of the Akt pathway. Manipulating this pathway permitted tolerance to Myc as an oncogenic driver, producing rare, stem-like cells that transcriptionally resemble the pulmonary basal lineage. These findings suggest that histological transformation may require the plasticity inherent to the basal stem cell, enabling tolerance to previously incompatible oncogenic driver programs.",

    "abstract": "Engineered dissipative reservoirs have the potential to steer many-body quantum systems toward correlated steady states useful for quantum simulation of high-temperature superconductivity or quantum magnetism. Using up to 49 superconducting qubits, we prepared low-energy states of the transverse-field Ising model through coupling to dissipative auxiliary qubits. In one dimension, we observed long-range quantum correlations and a ground-state fidelity of 0.86 for 18 qubits at the critical point. In two dimensions, we found mutual information that extends beyond nearest neighbors. Lastly, by coupling the system to auxiliaries emulating reservoirs with different chemical potentials, we explored transport in the quantum Heisenberg model. Our results establish engineered dissipation as a scalable alternative to unitary evolution for preparing entangled many-body states on noisy quantum processors.",

We quantified emissions at hundreds of large landfills across 18 states in the United States between 2016 and 2022 using airborne imaging spectrometers. Spanning 20% of open United States landfills, this represents the most systematic measurement-based study of methane point sources of the waste sector. We detected significant point source emissions at a majority (52%) of these sites, many with emissions persisting over multiple revisits (weeks to years). We compared these against independent contemporaneous in situ airborne observations at 15 landfills and established good agreement. Our findings indicate a need for long-term, synoptic-scale monitoring of landfill emissions in the context of climate change mitigation policy.",

Here, we developed an approach to reprogram tumor cells in vivo by adenoviral delivery of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3, which enabled them to present antigens as type 1 conventional dendritic cells. Reprogrammed tumor cells remodeled their tumor microenvironment, recruited, and expanded polyclonal cytotoxic T cells; induced tumor regressions; and established long-term systemic immunity in multiple mouse melanoma models. In human tumor spheroids and xenografts, reprogramming to immunogenic dendritic-like cells progressed independently of immunosuppression, which usually limits immunotherapy. Our study paves the way for human clinical trials of in vivo immune cell reprogramming for cancer immunotherapy.",

Although in silico methods that use protein language models (PLMs) can provide modeled fitness landscape guidance, they struggle to generalize across diverse protein families and map to protein activity. We present EVOLVEpro, a few-shot active learning framework that combines PLMs and regression models to rapidly improve protein activity. EVOLVEpro surpasses current methods, yielding up to 100-fold improvements in desired properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness across six proteins in RNA production, genome editing, and antibody binding applications. These results highlight the advantages of few-shot active learning with minimal experimental data over zero-shot predictions.

In synthesis, dioxygen should be able to undergo oxygen atom transfer to two organic molecules with perfect atom economy, but such reactivity is rare. Monooxygenase enzymes commonly reductively activate dioxygen by sacrificing one of the oxygen atoms to generate a more reactive oxidant. Here, we used a manganese-tetraphenylporphyrin catalyst to pair electrochemical oxygen reduction and water oxidation, generating a reactive manganese-oxo at both electrodes. This process supports dioxygen atom transfer to two thioether substrate molecules, generating two equivalents of sulfoxide with a single equivalent of dioxygen. This net dioxygenase reactivity consumes no electrons but uses electrochemical energy to overcome kinetic barriers.",

We identify key sequence patterns that contribute to human promoter activity, each activating transcription with distinct position-specific effects. Furthermore, we explain the sequence basis of bidirectional transcription at promoters, identify the links between promoter sequence and gene expression variation across cell types, and explore the conservation of sequence determinants of transcription initiation across mammalian species.",

Our DNA-based nanoscale tetrapods crystallize into a rod-connected diamond cubic lattice with a periodicity of 170 nanometers.

In these structures, three Ap Orco subunits serve as scaffold components that cannot bind the ligand and remain relatively unchanged. Upon ligand binding, the pore-forming helix S7b of Ap OR5 shifts outward from the central pore axis, causing an asymmetrical pore opening for ion influx. Our study provides insights into odorant recognition and channel gating of the OR-Orco heterocomplex and offers structural resources to support development of innovative insecticides and repellents for pest control.",

By deciphering the clustered-spikelet rice germplasm, we show that activation of the BR catabolic gene BRASSINOSTEROID-DEFICIENT DWARF3 ( BRD3 ) markedly increases grain number. We establish a molecular pathway in which the BR signaling inhibitor GSK3/SHAGGY-LIKE KINASE2 phosphorylates and stabilizes OsMADS1 transcriptional factor, which targets TERMINAL FLOWER1 -like gene RICE CENTRORADIALIS2 . The tissue-specific activation of BRD3 in the secondary branch meristems enhances panicle branching, minimizing negative effects on grain size, and improves grain yield.

Collections of small bioresorbable metal disks distributed within thin, pH-responsive hydrogels, deployed by surgical implantation or syringe injection, allow ultrasound-based measurements of spatiotemporal changes in pH for early assessments of anastomotic leaks after gastrointestinal surgeries, and their bioresorption after a recovery period eliminates the need for surgical extraction.

    "abstract": "Numerous nonantibiotic drugs have potent antibacterial activity and can adversely affect the human microbiome. The mechanistic underpinning of this toxicity remains largely unknown. We investigated the antibacterial activity of 200 drugs using genetic screens with thousands of barcoded Escherichia coli knockouts. We analyzed 2 million gene-drug interactions underlying drug-specific toxicity. Network-based analysis of drug-drug similarities revealed that antibiotics clustered into modules that are consistent with the mode of action of their established classes, whereas nonantibiotics remained unconnected. Half of the nonantibiotics clustered into separate modules, potentially revealing shared and unexploited targets for new antimicrobials. Analysis of efflux systems revealed that they widely affect antibiotics and nonantibiotics alike, suggesting that the impact of nonantibiotics on antibiotic cross-resistance should be investigated closely in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Understanding universal aspects of quantum dynamics is an unresolved problem in statistical mechanics. In particular, the spin dynamics of the one-dimensional Heisenberg model were conjectured as to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class based on the scaling of the infinite-temperature spin-spin correlation function. In a chain of 46 superconducting qubits, we studied the probability distribution of the magnetization transferred across the chain’s center, P M . The first two moments of P M show superdiffusive behavior, a hallmark of KPZ universality. However, the third and fourth moments ruled out the KPZ conjecture and allow for evaluating other theories. Our results highlight the importance of studying higher moments in determining dynamic universality classes and provide insights into universal behavior in quantum systems.",

However, the matrix of interactions between arrays of molecularly defined neuron subsets and of immunocyte lineages remains unclear. We used a chemogenetic approach to activate eight distinct neuronal subsets, assessing effects by deep immunophenotyping, microbiome profiling, and immunocyte transcriptomics in intestinal organs. Distinct immune perturbations followed neuronal activation: Nitrergic neurons regulated T helper 17 (T H 17)–like cells, and cholinergic neurons regulated neutrophils. Nociceptor neurons, expressing Trpv1, elicited the broadest immunomodulation, inducing changes in innate lymphocytes, macrophages, and RORγ + regulatory T (T reg ) cells. Neuroanatomical, genetic, and pharmacological follow-up showed that Trpv1 + neurons in dorsal root ganglia decreased T reg cell numbers via the neuropeptide calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP). Given the role of these neurons in nociception, these data potentially link pain signaling with gut T reg cell function.",

However, current configurations suffer from the trade-off between MOF loadings and mechanical compliance. We report a wrinkled configuration of MOF thin films. We established an interfacial synthesis confined and controlled by a polymer topcoat and achieved multiple Turing motifs in the wrinkled thin films. These films have complete MOF surface coverage and exhibit strain tolerance up to 53.2%. The enhanced mechanical properties allow film transfer onto various substrates. We obtained membranes with large H 2 /CO 2 selectivity (41.2) and high H 2 permeance (8.46 × 10 3 gas permeation units), showcasing negligible defects after transfer. We also achieved soft humidity sensors on delicate electrodes by avoiding exposure to harsh MOF synthesis conditions. These results highlight the potential of wrinkled MOF thin films for plug-and-play integration.",

The Chang’e-6 (CE-6) spacecraft collected samples from the South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin on the farside and brought them to Earth. We used lead-lead and rubidium-strontium isotope systems to date low-titanium basalt in a CE-6 sample, finding a consistent age of 2830 (±5) million years. We interpret this as the date of volcanism in SPA and incorporate it into lunar crater chronology. Strontium, neodymium, and lead isotopes indicate that the volcanic magma was from a lunar mantle source depleted in incompatible elements and containing almost no KREEP component.",

Archaeological excavations date the occupation from around 500 BCE to between 300 and 600 CE. The most notable landscape feature is the complex road system extending over tens of kilometers, connecting the different urban centers, thus creating a regional-scale network. Such extensive early development in the Upper Amazon is comparable to similar Maya urban systems recently highlighted in Mexico and Guatemala.",

However, the erosion sensitivity of mineral weathering remains difficult to quantify. Solute-chemistry datasets from mountain streams in different orogens isolate the impact of erosion on silicate weathering—a carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sink—and coupled sulfide and carbonate weathering—a CO 2 source. Contrasting erosion sensitivities of these reactions produce a CO 2 -drawdown maximum at erosion rates of ~0.07 millimeters per year. Thus, landscapes with moderate uplift rates bolster Earth’s inorganic CO 2 sink, whereas more rapid uplift decreases or even reverses CO 2 sequestration. This concept of an “erosion optimum” for CO 2 drawdown reconciles conflicting views on the impact of mountain building on the carbon cycle and permits estimates of geologic CO 2 fluxes dependent upon tectonic changes.",

Endogenous proteins tagged in-frame with SD40 using prime editing are degraded by otherwise inert PT-179. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of SD40 in complex with ligand-bound cereblon revealed mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of SD40’s activity and specificity.

We demonstrate that the ground state of a flat slab of a ferroelectric nematic unconstrained by externally imposed alignment directions is chiral, with left- and right-handed twists of polarization. Although the helicoidal deformations and defect walls that separate domains of opposite handedness increase the elastic energy, the twists reduce the electrostatic energy and become weaker when the material is doped with ions. This work shows that the polar orientational order of molecules could trigger chirality in soft matter with no chemically induced chiral centers.",

As a basis for understanding how odorants activate these heteromeric receptors, we report here cryo–electron microscopy structures of two different heteromeric odorant receptor complexes containing ORs from disease-vector mosquitos Aedes aegypti or Anopheles gambiae . These structures reveal an unexpected stoichiometry of one OR to three Orco subunits. Comparison of structures in odorant-bound and unbound states indicates that odorant binding to the sole OR subunit is sufficient to open the channel pore, suggesting a mechanism of OR activation and a conceptual framework for understanding evolution of insect odorant receptor sensitivity.",

We lack systematic methods to create dry contact interfaces whose frictional behavior satisfies preset specifications. We propose a generic surface design strategy to prepare dry rough interfaces that have predefined relationships between normal and friction forces. Such metainterfaces circumvent the usual multiscale challenge of tribology by considering simplified surface topographies as assemblies of spherical asperities. Optimizing the individual asperities’ heights enables specific friction laws to be targeted. Through various centimeter-scaled elastomer-glass metainterfaces, we illustrate three types of achievable friction laws, including linear laws with a specified friction coefficient and unusual nonlinear laws. This design strategy represents a scale- and material-independent, chemical-free pathway toward energy-saving and adaptable smart interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Two powerful earthquakes struck Türkiye on 6 February 2023. The initial rupture was on the Dead Sea fault zone, yet maximum displacements and energy release [moment magnitude ( M w ) 7.8] occurred 24 seconds later when rupture transferred to the East Anatolian fault zone (EAFZ). More than 7 hours later, a M w 4.5 aftershock at the junction of the EAFZ with the east-west striking Çardak-Sürgü fault was followed 86 minutes later by the second large ( M w 7.5) earthquake, suggesting a causal relationship. We provide quantitative ground and aerial documentation of surface offsets and kinematics from the slipped faults, providing important data on surface deformation during large continental strike-slip earthquakes, rupture propagation mechanisms, and how slip may be transferred between complex fault systems. We also provide insight into how slip along linked fault systems accommodates global plate motions.",

    "abstract": "Humans, like all mammals, depend on the gut microbiome for digestion of cellulose, the main component of plant fiber. However, evidence for cellulose fermentation in the human gut is scarce. We have identified ruminococcal species in the gut microbiota of human populations that assemble functional multienzymatic cellulosome structures capable of degrading plant cell wall polysaccharides. One of these species, which is strongly associated with humans, likely originated in the ruminant gut and was subsequently transferred to the human gut, potentially during domestication where it underwent diversification and diet-related adaptation through the acquisition of genes from other gut microbes. Collectively, these species are abundant and widespread among ancient humans, hunter-gatherers, and rural populations but are rare in populations from industrialized societies thus indicating potential disappearance in response to the westernized lifestyle.",

Yet only rudimentary knowledge exists regarding cortical partial oxygen tension ( P o 2 ) dynamics under physiological conditions. Here we introduce Green enhanced Nano-lantern (GeNL), a genetically encoded bioluminescent oxygen indicator for P o 2 imaging. In awake behaving mice, we uncover the existence of spontaneous, spatially defined “hypoxic pockets” and demonstrate their linkage to the abrogation of local capillary flow. Exercise reduced the burden of hypoxic pockets by 52% compared with rest. The study provides insight into cortical oxygen dynamics in awake behaving animals and concurrently establishes a tool to delineate the importance of oxygen tension in physiological processes and neurological diseases.",

Alternating current (AC) electrosynthesis, characterized by polarity reversal and periodic fluctuations, may be advantageous for multiple chemical reactions, but apparatus, principles, and application scenarios remain underdeveloped. In this work, we introduce a protocol for programmed AC (pAC) electrosynthesis that systematically adjusts currents, frequencies, and duty ratios. The application of representative pAC waveforms facilitates copper-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage in cross-coupling and difunctionalization reactions that exhibit suboptimal performance under DC and chemical oxidation conditions. Moreover, observing catalyst dynamic variation under diverse waveform applications provides mechanistic insight.",

Although room-temperature ferromagnetic skyrmions and their current-induced manipulation have been demonstrated, their velocity has been limited to about 100 meters per second. In addition, their dynamics are perturbed by the skyrmion Hall effect, a motion transverse to the current direction caused by the skyrmion topological charge. Here, we show that skyrmions in compensated synthetic antiferromagnets can be moved by current along the current direction at velocities of up to 900 meters per second. This can be explained by the cancellation of the net topological charge leading to a vanishing skyrmion Hall effect. Our results open an important path toward the realization of logic and memory devices based on the fast manipulation of skyrmions in tracks.",

However, attempts so far have mostly only been successful in silico and often fail in experiment because of unpredicted traps associated with kinetic slowing down (gelation, glass transition) and competing ordered structures. Theoretical predictions also face the difficulty of encoding the desired interparticle interaction potential with the experimentally available nano- and micrometer-sized particles. To overcome these issues, we combine SAT assembly (a patchy-particle interaction design algorithm based on constrained optimization) with coarse-grained simulations of DNA nanotechnology to experimentally realize trap-free self-assembly pathways. We use this approach to assemble a pyrochlore three-dimensional lattice, coveted for its promise in the construction of optical metamaterials, and characterize it with small-angle x-ray scattering and scanning electron microscopy visualization.",

However, in all these examples the liquid transport for a specific liquid is completely restricted in a fixed direction. We demonstrate that Crassula muscosa shoot surfaces have the ability to transport a specific liquid unidirectionally in either direction. This is accomplished through the presence of asymmetric reentrant leaves with varying reentrant angles, which yields the variation in liquid meniscus heterogeneity. These findings enable engineered biomimetic structures capable of selective directional liquid transport, with functions such as intelligent flow direction switching, liquid distribution, and mixing.",

We show that a few environmental isolates, driven by horizontal gene acquisition, have become dominant epidemic clones that have sequentially emerged and spread through global transmission networks over the past 200 years. These clones demonstrate varying intrinsic propensities for infecting CF or non-CF individuals (linked to specific transcriptional changes enabling survival within macrophages); have undergone multiple rounds of convergent, host-specific adaptation; and have eventually lost their ability to transmit between different patient groups. Our findings thus explain the pathogenic evolution of P. aeruginosa and highlight the importance of global surveillance and cross-infection prevention in averting the emergence of future epidemic clones.",

This design is compatible with harsh brines having magnesium/lithium molar ratios of up to 3258 and lithium concentrations down to 0.15 millimolar, enabling the production of battery-grade (>99.95% pure) lithium carbonate. Energy savings of up to ~21.5% were realized by efficiently harvesting the osmotic energy of the brines.

We use machine learning to systematically group forest ecoregions into 12 global forest pyromes, with each showing distinct sensitivities to climatic, human, and vegetation controls. This delineation revealed that rapidly increasing forest fire emissions in extratropical pyromes, linked to climate change, offset declining emissions in tropical pyromes during 2001 to 2023. Annual emissions tripled in one extratropical pyrome due to increases in fire-favorable weather, compounded by increased forest cover and productivity. This contributed to a 60% increase in forest fire carbon emissions from forest ecoregions globally. Our results highlight the increasing vulnerability of forests and their carbon stocks to fire disturbance under climate change.",

In this work, we used a chemical library of 1024 molecules—covering insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and plant growth inhibitors—to assess the impact of sublethal pesticide doses on insects. In Drosophila melanogaster , 57% of chemicals affected larval behavior, and a higher proportion compromised long-term survivability. Exposure to sublethal doses also induced widespread changes in the phosphoproteome and changes in development and reproduction. The negative effects of agrochemicals were amplified when the temperature was increased. We observed similar behavioral changes across multiple insect species, including mosquitoes and butterflies. These findings suggest that widespread sublethal pesticide exposure can alter insect behavior and physiology, threatening long-term population survival.",

Previous best-guess estimates of known drivers, including anthropogenic warming and the El Niño onset, fall short by about 0.2 kelvin in explaining the temperature rise. Using satellite and reanalysis data, we identified a record-low planetary albedo as the primary factor bridging this gap. The decline is apparently caused largely by a reduced low-cloud cover in the northern mid-latitudes and tropics, in continuation of a multiannual trend. Further exploring the low-cloud trend and understanding how much of it is due to internal variability, reduced aerosol concentrations, or a possibly emerging low-cloud feedback will be crucial for assessing the present and expected future warming.",

Currently, the stability of the most active iridium (Ir) catalysts is impaired by dissolution, redeposition, detachment, and agglomeration of Ir species. Here we present a ripening-induced embedding strategy that securely embeds the Ir catalyst in a cerium oxide support. Cryogenic electron tomography and all-atom kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that synchronizing the growth rate of the support with the nucleation rate of Ir, regulated by sonication, is pivotal for successful synthesis. A PEMWE using this catalyst achieves a cell voltage of 1.72 volts at a current density of 3 amperes per square centimeter with an Ir loading of just 0.3 milligrams per square centimeter and a voltage degradation rate of 1.33 microvolts per hour, as demonstrated by a 6000-hour accelerated aging test.",

Materials design has focused on structures that can define transport pathways with minimal cation coordination change, restricting attention to a small part of chemical space. Motivated by the greater structural diversity of binary intermetallics than that of the metallic elements, we used two anions to build a pathway for three-dimensional superionic lithium ion conductivity that exploits multiple cation coordination environments. Li 7 Si 2 S 7 I is a pure lithium ion conductor created by an ordering of sulphide and iodide that combines elements of hexagonal and cubic close-packing analogously to the structure of NiZr. The resulting diverse network of lithium positions with distinct geometries and anion coordination chemistries affords low barriers to transport, opening a large structural space for high cation conductivity.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule motor vital for cellular organization and division. It functions as a ~4-megadalton complex containing its cofactor dynactin and a cargo-specific coiled-coil adaptor. However, how dynein and dynactin recognize diverse adaptors, how they interact with each other during complex formation, and the role of critical regulators such as lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) protein (LIS1) remain unclear. In this study, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of dynein-dynactin on microtubules with LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor JIP3. This structure reveals the molecular basis of interactions occurring during dynein activation. We show how JIP3 activates dynein despite its atypical architecture. Unexpectedly, LIS1 binds dynactin’s p150 subunit, tethering it along the length of dynein. Our data suggest that LIS1 and p150 constrain dynein-dynactin to ensure efficient complex formation.",

This is largely a consequence of conventional polar-bond retrosynthetic disconnections that in turn require multiple functional group interconversions, redox manipulations, and protecting group chemistry. Here, we report a simple catalyst and reductant combination that converts two types of feedstock chemicals, carboxylic acids and olefins, into tetrasubstituted carbons through quaternization of radical intermediates. An iron porphyrin catalyst activates each substrate by electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer, and then combines the fragments using a bimolecular homolytic substitution (S H 2) reaction. This cross-coupling reduces the synthetic burden to procure numerous quaternary carbon–­­containing products from simple chemical feedstocks.",

We estimate that only one in three people used SMDWS in LMICs in 2020 and identified fecal contamination as the primary limiting factor affecting almost half of the population of LMICs. Our results are relevant for raising awareness about the challenges and limitations of current global monitoring approaches and demonstrating how globally available geospatial data can be leveraged to fill data gaps and identify priority areas in LMICs.",

CRM exhibits in vitro and in vivo efficacy against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . We show that CRM is highly preorganized for ribosomal binding by determining its density functional theory–calculated, solution-state, solid-state, and (wild-type) ribosome-bound structures, which all align identically within the macrobicyclic subunits. Lastly, we report two additional x-ray crystal structures of CRM in complex with bacterial ribosomes separately modified by the ribosomal RNA methylases, chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance (Cfr) and erythromycin-resistance ribosomal RNA methylase (Erm), revealing concessive adjustments by the target and antibiotic that permit CRM to maintain binding where other antibiotics fail.",

By possessing internal degrees of freedom such as polarization, light and sound can be subjected to various manipulations, including constituent materials, structured environments, and tailored source conditions. These manipulations enable the creation of a great variety of Hamiltonians, through which rich non-Abelian phenomena can be explored and observed. Recent developments have constituted a versatile testbed for exploring non-Abelian physics at the intersection of atomic, molecular, and optical physics; condensed matter physics; and mathematical physics. These fundamental endeavors could enable photonic and acoustic devices with multiplexing functionalities. Our review aims to provide a timely and comprehensive account of this emerging topic. Starting from the foundation of matrix-valued geometric phases, we address non-Abelian topological charges, non-Abelian gauge fields, non-Abelian braiding, non-Hermitian non-Abelian phenomena, and their realizations with photonics and acoustics and conclude with future prospects.",

    "abstract": "Propylene production through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is endothermic, and high temperatures required to achieve acceptable propane conversions lead to low selectivity and severe carbon-induced deactivation of conventional catalysts. We developed a catalyst-membrane system that removes the hydrogen by-product and can thus achieve propane conversions that exceed equilibrium limits. In this codesigned system, a silica/alumina (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ) hollow-fiber hydrogen membrane was packed with a selective platinum-tin (Pt 1 Sn 1 /SiO 2 ) PDH catalyst on the tube side with hydrogen diffusing from the tube to the shell side. We demonstrate that the catalyst-membrane system can achieve propane conversions >140% of the nominal equilibrium conversion with a propylene selectivity >98% without deactivation of the system components. We also show that by introducing oxygen on the shell side of the catalyst-membrane system, we can couple the endothermic PDH reaction on the tube side with exothermic hydrogen oxidation on the shell side. This coupling results in higher rates of hydrogen transport, leading to further enhancements in the propane conversion as well as desired thermoneutral system operation.",

Our brain multiregion, multiomic study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) included the central nucleus of the amygdala, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Genes and exons within the mPFC carried most disease signals replicated across two independent cohorts. Pathways pointed to immune function, neuronal and synaptic regulation, and stress hormones. Multiomic factor and gene network analyses provided the underlying genomic structure. Single nucleus RNA sequencing in dorsolateral PFC revealed dysregulated (stress-related) signals in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Analyses of brain-blood intersections in >50,000 UK Biobank participants were conducted along with fine-mapping of the results of PTSD and MDD genome-wide association studies to distinguish risk from disease processes. Our data suggest shared and distinct molecular pathology in both disorders and propose potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers.",

However, creating thermodynamically stable network structures with high packing frustration remains a challenge. In this study, we report a methodology to access diverse network structures such as gyroid, diamond, and primitive phases from diblock copolymers using end group and linker chemistry. The stability of the medial packing of polymer chain ends (plumber’s nightmare structure) over skeletal aggregation (gyroid) is attributed to the interplay between the strength of the end-end interactions and the initial shape of the curvature. Our study establishes an approach to develop tailored network structures from block copolymers, providing an important platform for using block copolymers in nanotechnology applications.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are essential for intracellular organization and chromosome segregation. They are nucleated by the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC). However, isolated vertebrate γTuRC adopts an open conformation that deviates from the microtubule structure, raising the question of the nucleation mechanism. In this study, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures of human γTuRC bound to a nascent microtubule. Structural changes of the complex into a closed conformation ensure that γTuRC templates the 13-protofilament microtubules that exist in human cells. Closure is mediated by a latch that interacts with incorporating tubulin, making it part of the closing mechanism. Further rearrangements involve all γTuRC subunits and the removal of the actin-containing luminal bridge. Our proposed mechanism of microtubule nucleation by human γTuRC relies on large-scale structural changes that are likely the target of regulation in cells.",

We report structures of Drosophila sweet taste receptors GR43a and GR64a in the apo and sugar-bound states. Both GRs form tetrameric sugar-gated cation channels composed of one central pore domain (PD) and four peripheral ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Whereas GR43a is specifically activated by the monosaccharide fructose that binds to a narrow pocket in LBDs, disaccharides sucrose and maltose selectively activate GR64a by binding to a larger and flatter pocket in LBDs. Sugar binding to LBDs induces local conformational changes, which are subsequently transferred to the PD to cause channel opening. Our studies reveal a structural basis for sugar recognition and activation of GRs.",

Here we show that interaction between Phaseolus vulgaris PGIP2 (PvPGIP2) and Fusarium phyllophilum polygalacturonase (FpPG) enhances substrate binding, resulting in inhibition of the enzyme activity of FpPG. This interaction promotes FpPG-catalyzed production of long-chain immunoactive oligogalacturonides, while diminishing immunosuppressive short oligogalacturonides. PvPGIP2 binding creates a substrate binding site on PvPGIP2-FpPG, forming a new polygalacturonase with boosted substrate binding activity and altered substrate preference. Structure-based engineering converts a putative PGIP that initially lacks FpPG-binding activity into an effective FpPG-interacting protein. These findings unveil a mechanism for plants to transform pathogen virulence activity into a defense trigger and provide proof of principle for engineering PGIPs with broader specificity.",

We developed a nanopore-based method, which we call Telomere Profiling, to determine telomere length at nearly single-nucleotide resolution. Mapping telomere reads to chromosome ends showed chromosome end–specific length distributions that could differ by more than six kilobases. Examination of telomere lengths in 147 individuals revealed that certain chromosome ends were consistently longer or shorter. The same rank order was found in newborn cord blood, suggesting that telomere length is determined at birth and that chromosome end–specific telomere length differences are maintained as telomeres shorten with age. Telomere Profiling makes precision investigation of telomere length widely accessible for laboratory, clinical, and drug discovery efforts and will allow deeper insights into telomere biology.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms that regulate breast cancer cell (BCC) metastasis and proliferation within the leptomeninges (LM) are poorly understood, which limits the development of effective therapies. In this work, we show that BCCs in mice can invade the LM by abluminal migration along blood vessels that connect vertebral or calvarial bone marrow and meninges, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. This process is dependent on BCC engagement with vascular basement membrane laminin through expression of the neuronal pathfinding molecule integrin α6. Once in the LM, BCCs colocalize with perivascular meningeal macrophages and induce their expression of the prosurvival neurotrophin glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Intrathecal GDNF blockade, macrophage-specific GDNF ablation, or deletion of the GDNF receptor neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) from BCCs inhibits breast cancer growth within the LM. These data suggest integrin α6 and the GDNF signaling axis as new therapeutic targets against breast cancer LM metastasis.",

Taking classic bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3 )–based thermoelectric semiconductors as an example, we show that antisite defects can lead to high-density, diverse microstructures that substantially affect mechanical properties and thus successfully transform these bulk semiconductors from brittle to plastic, leading to a high figure of merit of up to 1.05 at 300 kelvin compared with other plastic semiconductors, similar to the best brittle semiconductors. We provide an effective strategy to plastify brittle semiconductors to display good plasticity and excellent functionality simultaneously.",

Using Escherichia coli lineages spanning 50,000 generations of evolution, we quantify the fitness effects of insertion mutations in every gene. Macroscopically, the fraction of deleterious mutations changed little over time whereas the beneficial tail declined sharply, approaching an exponential distribution. Microscopically, changes in individual gene essentiality and deleterious effects often occurred in parallel; altered essentiality is only partly explained by structural variation. The identity and effect sizes of beneficial mutations changed rapidly over time, but many targets of selection remained predictable because of the importance of loss-of-function mutations. Taken together, these results reveal the dynamic—but statistically predictable—nature of mutational fitness effects.",

We show that massive magma flow into dikes can be established with only modest overpressure in a magma body if a large enough pathway opens at its boundary and gradual buildup of high tensile stress has occurred along the dike pathway prior to the onset of diking. This explains rapid initial magma flow rates, modeled up to about 7400 cubic meters per second into a dike ~15-kilometers long, which propagated under the town of Grindavík, Southwest Iceland, in November 2023. Such high flow rates provide insight into the formation of major dikes and imply a serious hazard potential for high–flow rate intrusions that propagate to the surface and transition into eruptions.",

To corroborate the method, we chose a material distinctly different from MAX phases, in terms of structure and chemical composition, for experimental verification. We selectively etched Y from YRu 2 Si 2 , resulting in 2D Ru 2 Si x O y . The high-throughput methodology suggests a vast chemical space of 2D materials from chemical exfoliation.",

Single-molecule techniques have revealed bond strength by measuring “rupture force,” but it has long been recognized that rupture force is dependent on loading rate—how quickly force is ramped up. Thus, the physiological loading rate needs to be measured to reveal the mechanical strength of individual bonds in their functional context. We have developed an overstretching tension sensor (OTS) to allow more accurate force measurement in physiological conditions with single-molecule detection sensitivity even in mechanically active regions. We used serially connected OTSs to show that the integrin loading rate ranged from 0.5 to 4 piconewtons per second and was about three times higher in leukocytes than in epithelial cells.",

We found that pyrimidines, but not purines, maintain pyruvate oxidation and the tricarboxylic citric acid (TCA) cycle by regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. PDH activity requires sufficient substrates and cofactors, including thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Depletion of cellular pyrimidines decreased TPP synthesis, a reaction carried out by TPP kinase 1 (TPK1), which reportedly uses ATP to phosphorylate thiamine (vitamin B1). We found that uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP) acts as the preferred substrate for TPK1, enabling cellular TPP synthesis, PDH activity, TCA-cycle activity, lipogenesis, and adipocyte differentiation. Thus, UTP is required for vitamin B1 utilization to maintain pyruvate oxidation and lipogenesis.",

Apoptotic cells are defined by homogeneous characteristics, ignoring their original cell lineage identity. We found that in an interleukin-4 (IL-4)–enriched environment, the sensing of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages triggered their tissue remodeling signature. Engulfment of apoptotic hepatocytes promoted a tolerogenic phenotype, whereas phagocytosis of T cells had little effect on IL-4–induced gene expression. In a mouse model of parasite-induced pathology, the transfer of macrophages conditioned with IL-4 and apoptotic neutrophils promoted parasitic egg clearance. Knockout of phagocytic receptors required for the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils and partially T cells, but not hepatocytes, exacerbated helminth infection. These findings suggest that the identity of apoptotic cells may contribute to the development of distinct IL-4–driven immune programs in macrophages.",

In this work, we report a neuromorphic tactile system that uses spike timing, especially the first-spike timing, to code dynamic tactile information about touch and grasp. This strategy enables the system to seamlessly code highly dynamic information with millisecond temporal resolution on par with the biological nervous system, yielding dynamic extraction of tactile features. Upon interaction with objects, the system rapidly classifies them in the initial phase of touch and grasp, thus paving the way to fast tactile feedback desired for neuro-robotics and neuro-prosthetics.",

The isomerizing ethenolysis of unsaturated polyolefins could be an energetically and environmentally viable route to propylene and isobutylene; however, noble-metal homogeneous catalysts and an unsaturated polyolefin are currently required and the process has been limited to PE. We show that the simple combination of tungsten oxide on silica and sodium on gamma-alumina transforms PE, PP, or a mixture of the two, including postconsumer forms of these materials, to propylene or a mixture of propylene and isobutylene in greater than 90% yield at 320°C without the need for dehydrogenation of the starting polyolefins.",

We present a Janus channel of membranes (JCM) that features a confined architecture constructed of a pair of hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes, which allows for concurrent, highly efficient recovery of oil and water from surfactant-stabilized emulsions. The confined Janus channel can amplify the interplay of the membrane pair through a feedback loop that involves enrichment and demulsification. Our JCM achieves exceptional oil and water recoveries of up to 97 and 75%, respectively, with near 99.9% purities. Moreover, its versatility in handling diverse emulsions may enable near-zero liquid discharge for a range of separations.",

The topography of Madagascar is dominated by a mountainous continental rift escarpment, with the highest plant diversity and rarity found along the steep, eastern side of this geographic feature. Using a process-explicit model, we show that precipitation-driven erosion and landward retreat of this high-relief topography creates transient habitat organization through multiple mechanisms, including catchment expansion, isolation of highland remnants, and formation of topographic barriers. Habitat isolation and reconnection on a million-year timescale serves as an allopatric speciation pump creating the observed biodiversity.",

Although there has been much success with overlapped near-infrared femtosecond and extreme ultraviolet attosecond pulses combined with theory, true attosecond-pump/attosecond-probe experiments have been limited. We used a synchronized attosecond x-ray pulse pair from an x-ray free-electron laser to study the electronic response to valence ionization in liquid water through all x-ray attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AX-ATAS). Our analysis showed that the AX-ATAS response is confined to the subfemtosecond timescale, eliminating any hydrogen atom motion and demonstrating experimentally that the 1b 1 splitting in the x-ray emission spectrum is related to dynamics and is not evidence of two structural motifs in ambient liquid water.",

Despite many efforts, its measurement at the nanoscale remains challenging. We introduce a variance sum rule (VSR) for displacement and force variances that permits us to measure the entropy production rate σ in nonequilibrium steady states. We first illustrate it for directly measurable forces, such as an active Brownian particle in an optical trap. We then apply the VSR to flickering experiments in human red blood cells. We find that σ is spatially heterogeneous with a finite correlation length, and its average value agrees with calorimetry measurements. The VSR paves the way to derive σ using force spectroscopy and time-resolved imaging in living and active matter.",

Combining FOS-Seq, CRISPR-perturbation, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we identified Rheb as a molecular substrate that regulates cell type–specific signal transduction in NAc while enabling drugs to suppress natural reward consumption. Mapping NAc-projecting regions activated by drugs of abuse revealed input-specific effects on natural reward consumption. These findings characterize the dynamic, molecular and circuit basis of a common reward pathway, wherein drugs of abuse interfere with the fulfillment of innate needs.",

We report proteome-wide maps of protein-binding propensity for 407 structurally diverse small-molecule fragments. We verified that identified interactions can be advanced to active chemical probes of E3 ubiquitin ligases, transporters, and kinases. Integrating machine learning binary classifiers further enabled interpretable predictions of fragment behavior in cells. The resulting resource of fragment-protein interactions and predictive models will help to elucidate principles of molecular recognition and expedite ligand discovery efforts for hitherto undrugged proteins.",

In this study, we show that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows into the trigeminal ganglion, establishing nonsynaptic signaling between brain and trigeminal cells. After CSD, ~11% of the CSF proteome is altered, with up-regulation of proteins that directly activate receptors in the trigeminal ganglion. CSF collected from animals exposed to CSD activates trigeminal neurons in naïve mice in part by CSF-borne calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP). We identify a communication pathway between the central and peripheral nervous system that might explain the relationship between migrainous aura and headache.",

We applied this platform to profile neighborhoods of the oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor and orthogonally validated more than 20 neighbors using immunoassays and AlphaFold-Multimer prediction. We further profiled the protein neighborhoods of cell-cell synapses induced by bispecific T cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. This integrated multiscale PLP platform maps local and distal protein networks on and between cell surfaces, which will aid in the systematic construction of the cell surface interactome, revealing horizontal signaling partners and reveal new immunotherapeutic opportunities.",

The direct carbonylative coupling of alkenes and amines holds promise as a perfectly atom-economical approach to amide synthesis, but general methods remain underdeveloped. Herein, we report an alkene hydroaminocarbonylation catalyzed by unmodified, inexpensive cobalt carbonyl under mild conditions and low pressure promoted by light. Silane addition after the reaction enables sequential cobalt-catalyzed amide reduction, constituting a formal alkene hydroaminomethylation. These methods exhibit exceptional scope across both alkene and amine components with high chemo- and regioselectivity and proceed efficiently even in the absence of solvent. The formation of a hydridocobalt through photodissociation of a carbonyl ligand is proposed to enable catalytic activity under mild conditions, which addresses a long-standing challenge in catalysis.",

About 65% of all species and 82% of endemic species are classified as threatened. We rediscovered five species classified as Extinct on the IUCN Red List and identified 13 endemics as possibly extinct. Uncertainties in species information had little influence on the assessments, but using fewer Red List criteria severely underestimated threat levels.

Big-headed ants disrupted the mutualism between native ants ( Crematogaster spp.) and the dominant whistling-thorn tree ( Vachellia drepanolobium ), rendering trees vulnerable to elephant ( Loxodonta africana ) browsing and resulting in landscapes with higher visibility. Although zebra kills were significantly less likely to occur in higher-visibility, invaded areas, lion numbers did not decline since the onset of the invasion, likely because of prey-switching to African buffalo ( Syncerus caffer ). We show that by controlling biophysical structure across landscapes, a tiny invader reconfigured predator-prey dynamics among iconic species.",

By using a mutant with defects in photoperiodic growth, we identified a seasonal growth regulation pathway that functions in long days in parallel to the canonical long-day photoperiod flowering mechanism. This is achieved by using distinct mechanisms to detect different photoperiods: The flowering pathway measures photoperiod as the duration of light intensity, whereas the growth pathway measures photoperiod as the duration of photosynthetic activity (photosynthetic period). Plants can then independently control expression of genes required for flowering or growth. This demonstrates that seasonal flowering and growth are dissociable, allowing them to be coordinated independently across seasons.",

    "abstract": "The identification of mechanisms to store glucose carbon in the form of glycogen rather than fat in hepatocytes has important implications for the prevention of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and other chronic metabolic diseases. In this work, we show that glycogenesis uses its intermediate metabolite uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG) to antagonize lipogenesis, thus steering both mouse and human hepatocytes toward storing glucose carbon as glycogen. The underlying mechanism involves transport of UDPG to the Golgi apparatus, where it binds to site-1 protease (S1P) and inhibits S1P-mediated cleavage of sterol regulatory element–binding proteins (SREBPs), thereby inhibiting lipogenesis in hepatocytes. Consistent with this mechanism, UDPG administration is effective at treating NAFLD in a mouse model and human organoids. These findings indicate a potential opportunity to ameliorate disordered fat metabolism in the liver.",

Unlike textbook PKSs, trans -AT PKSs feature an extraordinary diversity of PKS modules and commonly evolve to form hybrid PKSs. In this study, we analyzed amino acid coevolution to identify a common module site that yields functional PKSs. We used this site to insert and delete diverse PKS parts and create 22 engineered trans -AT PKSs from various pathways and in two bacterial producers. The high success rates of our engineering approach highlight the broader applicability to generate complex designer polyketides.",

We examined the interactions and importance of intratissue clock networks in muscle tissue maintenance. In arrhythmic mice showing premature aging, we created a basic clock module involving a central and a peripheral (muscle) clock. Reconstituting the brain-muscle clock network is sufficient to preserve fundamental daily homeostatic functions and prevent premature muscle aging. However, achieving whole muscle physiology requires contributions from other peripheral clocks. Mechanistically, the muscle peripheral clock acts as a gatekeeper, selectively suppressing detrimental signals from the central clock while integrating important muscle homeostatic functions. Our research reveals the interplay between the central and peripheral clocks in daily muscle function and underscores the impact of eating patterns on these interactions.",

However, elimination of endogenous PrP halts prion disease progression. In this study, we describe Coupled Histone tail for Autoinhibition Release of Methyltransferase (CHARM), a compact, enzyme-free epigenetic editor capable of silencing transcription through programmable DNA methylation. Using a histone H3 tail-Dnmt3l fusion, CHARM recruits and activates endogenous DNA methyltransferases, thereby reducing transgene size and cytotoxicity. When delivered to the mouse brain by systemic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV), Prnp -targeted CHARM ablates PrP expression across the brain. Furthermore, we have temporally limited editor expression by implementing a kinetically tuned self-silencing approach. CHARM potentially represents a broadly applicable strategy to suppress pathogenic proteins, including those implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

For many years, the identity of the mobile signal and its direct transduction mechanism for systemic SA synthesis in initiating SAR have been debated. We found that in Arabidopsis thaliana , after a local infection, the conserved cysteine residue of the transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE) undergoes sulfenylation in systemic tissues, which enhances its binding to the promoter of the SA-synthesis gene ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 ( ICS1 ) and increases SA production. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) produced through NADPH oxidases is the mobile signal that sulfenylates CHE in a concentration-dependent manner. Accumulation of SA and the previously reported signal molecules, such as N -hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP), then form a signal amplification loop to establish SAR.",

Combining semiconducting properties with hydrogel designs can enhance biointeractive functions and intimacy at biointerfaces, but this is challenging owing to the low hydrophilicity of polymer semiconductors. We developed a solvent affinity–induced assembly method that incorporates water-insoluble polymer semiconductors into double-network hydrogels. These semiconductors exhibited tissue-level moduli as soft as 81 kilopascals, stretchability of 150% strain, and charge-carrier mobility up to 1.4 square centimeters per volt per second. When they are interfaced with biological tissues, their tissue-level modulus enables alleviated immune reactions.

Complexes assembled through a Polo-like kinase 1–dependent mechanism during extended mitosis and elicited a p53 response in G 1 that prevented the proliferation of the progeny of cells that experienced an approximately threefold extended mitosis or successive less extended mitoses. The ability to monitor mitotic extension was lost in p53-mutant cancers and some p53–wild-type (p53-WT) cancers, consistent with classification of TP53BP1 and USP28 as tumor suppressors.

In this study, we identified a bacterium from the gut of field Aedes albopictus mosquitoes named Rosenbergiella sp.

Inoculation of 1.6 × 10 3 colony forming units (CFUs) of Rosenbergiella_ YN46 into A. albopictus mosquitoes effectively prevents viral infection. Mechanistically, this bacterium secretes glucose dehydrogenase ( Ry GDH), which acidifies the gut lumen of fed mosquitoes, causing irreversible conformational changes in the flavivirus envelope protein that prevent viral entry into cells. In semifield conditions, Rosenbergiella_ YN46 exhibits effective transstadial transmission in field mosquitoes, which blocks transmission of dengue virus by newly emerged adult mosquitoes. The prevalence of Rosenbergiella_ YN46 is greater in mosquitoes from low-dengue areas (52.9 to ~91.7%) than in those from dengue-endemic regions (0 to ~6.7%). Rosenbergiella_ YN46 may offer an effective and safe lead for flavivirus biocontrol.",

This strategy is showcased to enable decarboxylative trifluoromethylation of sensitive (hetero)arenes by using trifluoroacetate, an inexpensive yet relatively inert trifluoromethyl group (CF 3 ) source. An ion-shielding layer, formed by trifluoroacetate anions electrostatically adsorbed on a positive molybdenum-doped tungsten trioxide (WO 3 ) photoanode, prevents undesired electron transfer between substrates and photogenerated holes. The practicality of the developed method was demonstrated with robust photoanode stability (approximately 380 hours), a good substrate scope, and scaling capability to achieve 100-gram synthesis by using photoelectrochemical flow cells.",

We isolated SVs from rat brain using SidK, a V-ATPase–binding bacterial effector protein. Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy allowed high-resolution structure determination of V-ATPase within the native SV membrane. In the structure, regularly spaced cholesterol molecules decorate the enzyme’s rotor and the abundant SV protein synaptophysin binds the complex stoichiometrically.

Using space geodetic and seismic observations, we have shown that the event deformed the peninsula with a peak uplift reaching 5 meters at the west coast. Shallow slip exceeded 10 meters on an offshore fault. Peak stress drop was greater than 10 megapascals. This devastating event began with a slow rupture propagation lasting 15 to 20 seconds near its hypocenter, where seismic swarms had surged since 2020 because of lower-crust fluid supply. The slow start was accompanied by intense high-frequency seismic radiation.

We found that a metal (gold) containing spherical voids with a fraction of up to 10% does not fracture prematurely in tension when the voids are shrunk to the submicron or nanometer scale. Instead, the dispersed nanovoids increase the strength and ductility of the material while simultaneously reducing its weight. Apart from the suppressed stress or strain concentration, such structure provides enormous surface area and promotes surface-dislocation interactions, which enable strengthening and additional strain hardening and thus toughening. Transforming voids from crack-like detrimental defects into a beneficial “ingredient” provides an inexpensive and environmentally friendly approach for the development of a new class of lightweight, high-performance materials.",

However, despite the ubiquitous brain expression of its molecular target, the N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor (NMDAR), it was not clear whether there is a selective, primary site for ketamine’s antidepressant action. We found that ketamine injection in depressive-like mice specifically blocks NMDARs in lateral habenular (LHb) neurons, but not in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. This regional specificity depended on the use-dependent nature of ketamine as a channel blocker, local neural activity, and the extrasynaptic reservoir pool size of NMDARs. Activating hippocampal or inactivating LHb neurons swapped their ketamine sensitivity. Conditional knockout of NMDARs in the LHb occluded ketamine’s antidepressant effects and blocked the systemic ketamine–induced elevation of serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. This distinction of the primary versus secondary brain target(s) of ketamine should help with the design of more precise and efficient antidepressant treatments.",

    "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known colloquially as “forever chemicals,” have been associated with adverse human health effects and have contaminated drinking water supplies across the United States owing to their long-term and widespread use. People in the United States may unknowingly be drinking water that contains PFAS because of a lack of systematic analysis, particularly in domestic water supplies. We present an extreme gradient–boosting model for predicting the occurrence of PFAS in groundwater at the depths of drinking water supply for the conterminous United States. Our model results indicate that 71 million to 95 million people in the conterminous United States potentially rely on groundwater with detectable concentrations of PFAS for their drinking water supplies before any treatment.",

    "abstract": "The design of enzymes with complex active sites that mediate multistep reactions remains an outstanding challenge. With serine hydrolases as a model system, we combined the generative capabilities of RFdiffusion with an ensemble generation method for assessing active site preorganization at each step in the reaction to design enzymes starting from minimal active site descriptions. Experimental characterization revealed catalytic efficiencies ( k cat / K m ) up to 2.2 × 10 5 M −1 s −1 and crystal structures that closely match the design models (Cα root mean square deviations <1 angstrom). Selection for structural compatibility across the reaction coordinate enabled identification of new catalysts remove with five different folds distinct from those of natural serine hydrolases. Our de novo approach provides insight into the geometric basis of catalysis and a roadmap for designing enzymes that catalyze multistep transformations.",

In this work, we found that without resolving lineage plasticity, skin stem cells cannot effectively generate each lineage in vitro nor regrow hair and repair wounded epidermis in vivo. A small-molecule screen unearthed retinoic acid as a critical regulator. Combining high-throughput approaches, cell culture, and in vivo mouse genetics, we dissected its roles in tissue regeneration. We found that retinoic acid is made locally in hair follicle stem cell niches, where its levels determine identity and usage. Our findings have therapeutic implications for hair growth as well as chronic wounds and cancers, where lineage plasticity is unresolved.",

Using about 14,000 field observations per year from 2013 to 2019 in Kern County, California, we postulate that organic crop producers benefit from surrounding organic fields decreasing overall pesticide use and, specifically, pesticides targeting insect pests. Conventional fields, by contrast, tend to increase pesticide use as the area of surrounding organic production increases. Our simulation suggests that spatially clustering organic cropland can entirely mitigate spillover effects that lead to an increase in net pesticide use.",

We transformed micron-sized natural minerals like quartz and ruby into 5- to 10-nanometer particles when integrated into aqueous microdroplets generated via electrospray. We deposited the droplets on a substrate, which allowed nanoparticle characterization. We determined through simulations that quartz undergoes proton-induced slip, especially when reduced in size and exposed to an electric field. This leads to particle scission and the formation of silicate fragments, which we confirmed with mass spectrometry. This rapid weathering process may be important for soil formation, given the prevalence of charged aerosols in the atmosphere.",

Although resonant control is used to execute high-fidelity quantum gates, the scalability is challenged by the integration of high-frequency oscillating signals, qubit cross-talk, and heating. Here, we show that by engineering the hopping of spins between quantum dots with a site-dependent spin quantization axis, quantum control can be established with discrete signals. We demonstrate hopping-based quantum logic and obtain single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.97%, coherent shuttling fidelities of 99.992% per hop, and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.3%, corresponding to error rates that have been predicted to allow for quantum error correction. We also show that hopping spins constitute a tuning method by statistically mapping the coherence of a 10–quantum dot system. Our results show that dense quantum dot arrays with sparse occupation could be developed for efficient and high-connectivity qubit registers.",

We printed native oxide films over large areas at ambient conditions by moving a molten metal meniscus across a target substrate. The oxide gently separates from the metal through fluid instabilities that occur in the meniscus, leading to uniform films free of liquid residue. The printed oxide has a metallic interlayer that renders the films highly conductive. The metallic character of the printed films promotes wetting of trace amounts of evaporated gold that would otherwise form disconnected islands on conventional oxide surfaces. The resulting ultrathin (<10 nanometers) conductors can be patterned into flexible circuits that are transparent, mechanically robust, and electrically stable, even at elevated temperatures.",

We conducted a megastudy ( n = 32,059 participants) testing 25 treatments designed by academics and practitioners to reduce Americans’ partisan animosity and antidemocratic attitudes. We find that many treatments reduced partisan animosity, most strongly by highlighting relatable sympathetic individuals with different political beliefs or by emphasizing common identities shared by rival partisans. We also identify several treatments that reduced support for undemocratic practices—most strongly by correcting misperceptions of rival partisans’ views or highlighting the threat of democratic collapse—which shows that antidemocratic attitudes are not intractable. Taken together, the study’s findings identify promising general strategies for reducing partisan division and improving democratic attitudes, shedding theoretical light on challenges facing American democracy.",

We found that hydroxide (OH − ) donated ~8% more negative charge to the H bond network of water, and hydronium (H 3 O + ) accepted ~4% less negative charge from the H bond network of water. Deuterium oxide (D 2 O) had ~9% more H bonds compared with water (H 2 O), and acidic solutions displayed more dominant NQEs than basic ones.",

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a singular opportunity to evaluate how influenza circulation worldwide was perturbed by human behavioral changes. We combine molecular, epidemiological, and international travel data and find that the pandemic’s onset led to a shift in the intensity and structure of international influenza lineage movement. During the pandemic, South Asia played an important role as a phylogenetic trunk location of influenza A viruses, whereas West Asia maintained the circulation of influenza B/Victoria. We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage. After a period of 3 years, the intensity of among-region influenza lineage movements returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the exception of B/Yamagata, after the recovery of global air traffic, highlighting the robustness of global lineage dispersal patterns to substantial perturbation.",

Quantum chemical calculations rationalize how σ-electron delocalization/donation and π-electron negative hyperconjugation together stabilize the formally vacant σ orbital and the filled π orbital at the carbene center. In contrast to traditional carbene counterparts this carbene can undergo synthetic transformations with both a Lewis base and a silver salt, producing a Lewis acid/base adduct and a silver π-complex, respectively.

We developed a computational procedure to design a protein that recognizes a common pharmacophore in a series of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–1 inhibitors. One of three designed proteins bound different inhibitors with affinities ranging from <5 nM to low micromolar. X-ray crystal structures confirmed the accuracy of the designed protein-drug interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations informed the role of water in binding. Binding free energy calculations performed directly on the designed models were in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured affinities. We conclude that de novo design of high-affinity small molecule–binding proteins with tuned interaction energies is feasible entirely from computation.",

Ferroelectric materials offer high maximum polarization, but high remnant polarization has hindered their effective deployment in energy storage applications. Previous methodologies have encountered problems because of the deteriorated crystallinity of the ferroelectric materials. We introduce an approach to control the relaxation time using two-dimensional (2D) materials while minimizing energy loss by using 2D/3D/2D heterostructures and preserving the crystallinity of ferroelectric 3D materials. Using this approach, we were able to achieve an energy density of 191.7 joules per cubic centimeter with an efficiency greater than 90%. This precise control over relaxation time holds promise for a wide array of applications and has the potential to accelerate the development of highly efficient energy storage systems.",

    "abstract": "RNA splicing is highly prevalent in the brain and has strong links to neuropsychiatric disorders; yet, the role of cell type–specific splicing and transcript-isoform diversity during human brain development has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we leveraged single-molecule long-read sequencing to deeply profile the full-length transcriptome of the germinal zone and cortical plate regions of the developing human neocortex at tissue and single-cell resolution. We identified 214,516 distinct isoforms, of which 72.6% were novel (not previously annotated in Gencode version 33), and uncovered a substantial contribution of transcript-isoform diversity—regulated by RNA binding proteins—in defining cellular identity in the developing neocortex. We leveraged this comprehensive isoform-centric gene annotation to reprioritize thousands of rare de novo risk variants and elucidate genetic risk mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "To delineate the mechanisms by which the ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinases support mutant KRAS–driven cancer growth, we determined the ERK-dependent phosphoproteome in KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer. We determined that ERK1 and ERK2 share near-identical signaling and transforming outputs and that the KRAS-regulated phosphoproteome is driven nearly completely by ERK. We identified 4666 ERK-dependent phosphosites on 2123 proteins, of which 79 and 66%, respectively, were not previously associated with ERK, substantially expanding the depth and breadth of ERK-dependent phosphorylation events and revealing a considerably more complex function for ERK in cancer. We established that ERK controls a highly dynamic and complex phosphoproteome that converges on cyclin-dependent kinase regulation and RAS homolog guanosine triphosphatase function (RHO GTPase). Our findings establish the most comprehensive molecular portrait and mechanisms by which ERK drives KRAS-dependent pancreatic cancer growth.",

Therapeutic induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate disease complications and has been intently pursued. However, safe and effective small-molecule inducers of HbF remain elusive. We report the discovery of dWIZ-1 and dWIZ-2, molecular glue degraders of the WIZ transcription factor that robustly induce HbF in erythroblasts. Phenotypic screening of a cereblon (CRBN)–biased chemical library revealed WIZ as a previously unknown repressor of HbF. WIZ degradation is mediated by recruitment of WIZ(ZF7) to CRBN by dWIZ-1, as resolved by crystallography of the ternary complex. Pharmacological degradation of WIZ was well tolerated and induced HbF in humanized mice and cynomolgus monkeys. These findings establish WIZ degradation as a globally accessible therapeutic strategy for SCD.",

    "abstract": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) is the most commonly mutated metabolic gene across human cancers. Mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) generates the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, disrupting enzymes involved in epigenetics and other processes. A hallmark of IDH1 -mutant solid tumors is T cell exclusion, whereas mIDH1 inhibition in preclinical models restores antitumor immunity. Here, we define a cell-autonomous mechanism of mIDH1-driven immune evasion. IDH1 -mutant solid tumors show selective hypermethylation and silencing of the cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensor CGAS , compromising innate immune signaling. mIDH1 inhibition restores DNA demethylation, derepressing CGAS and transposable element (TE) subclasses. dsDNA produced by TE-reverse transcriptase (TE-RT) activates cGAS, triggering viral mimicry and stimulating antitumor immunity. In summary, we demonstrate that mIDH1 epigenetically suppresses innate immunity and link endogenous RT activity to the mechanism of action of a US Food and Drug Administration–approved oncology drug.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome-containing micronuclei are a hallmark of aggressive cancers. Micronuclei frequently undergo irreversible collapse, exposing their enclosed chromatin to the cytosol. Micronuclear rupture catalyzes chromosomal rearrangements, epigenetic abnormalities, and inflammation, yet mechanisms safeguarding micronuclear integrity are poorly understood. In this study, we found that mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) disrupt micronuclei by promoting a noncanonical function of charged multivesicular body protein 7 (CHMP7), a scaffolding protein for the membrane repair complex known as endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III). ROS retained CHMP7 in micronuclei while disrupting its interaction with other ESCRT-III components. ROS-induced cysteine oxidation stimulated CHMP7 oligomerization and binding to the nuclear membrane protein LEMD2, disrupting micronuclear envelopes. Furthermore, this ROS-CHMP7 pathological axis engendered chromosome shattering known to result from micronuclear rupture. It also mediated micronuclear disintegrity under hypoxic conditions, linking tumor hypoxia with downstream processes driving cancer progression.",

Systematically evaluating the effect of a single atom, however, poses synthetic challenges, primarily as a result of thermodynamic mismatches in atomic exchange processes. We present a photocatalytic strategy that swaps an oxygen atom of furan with a nitrogen group, directly converting the furan into a pyrrole analog in a single intermolecular reaction. High compatibility was observed with various furan derivatives and nitrogen nucleophiles commonly used in drug discovery, and the late-stage functionalization furnished otherwise difficult-to-access pyrroles from naturally occurring furans of high molecular complexity. Mechanistic analysis suggested that polarity inversion through single electron transfer initiates the redox-neutral atom exchange processes at room temperature.",

Infrared emission bands show that PAHs are abundant in space, but only a few specific PAHs have been detected in the interstellar medium. We detected 1-cyanopyrene, a cyano-substituted derivative of the related four-ring PAH pyrene, in radio observations of the dense cloud TMC-1, using the Green Bank Telescope. The measured column density of 1-cyanopyrene is ∼ 1 .52×10 12 cm −2 , from which we estimate that pyrene contains up to 0.1% of the carbon in TMC-1. This abundance indicates that interstellar PAH chemistry favors the production of pyrene. We suggest that some of the carbon supplied to young planetary systems is carried by PAHs that originate in cold molecular clouds.",

However, if the appropriate individual building blocks are selected (e.g., cubes), or multiple shapes of the appropriate dimensions are matched (e.g., octahedra and tetrahedra) and their pairing interactions are subsequently forced, space-filled architectures may be possible. With flexible molecular ligands (polyethylene glycol–modified DNA), the shape of a polyhedral nanoparticle can be deliberately altered and used to realize geometries that favor space tessellation. In this work, 10 new colloidal crystals were synthesized from DNA-modified nanocrystal building blocks that differed in shapes and sizes, designed to form space-filling architectures with micron-scale dimensions. The insights and capabilities provided by this new strategy substantially expand the scope of colloidal crystals possible and provide an expanded tool kit for researchers interested in designing metamaterials.",

Steep population declines cannot be easily reversed owing to long generation lengths, low recovery potentials, and the near absence of management.

By combining large-scale neural recordings in mice with dimensionality reduction techniques, we observed that successive maze traversals were tracked by continuously drifting populations of neurons, providing neuronal signatures of both places visited and events encountered. When the brain state changed during reward consumption, sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) occurred on some trials, and their specific spike content decoded the trial blocks that surrounded them. During postexperience sleep, SPW-Rs continued to replay those trial blocks that were reactivated most frequently during waking SPW-Rs. Replay content of awake SPW-Rs may thus provide a neurophysiological tagging mechanism to select aspects of experience that are preserved and consolidated for future use.",

We previously discovered a conserved process called cell extrusion that drives homeostatic epithelial cell death when cells become too crowded. In this work, we show that the pathological crowding of a bronchoconstrictive attack causes so much epithelial cell extrusion that it damages the airways, resulting in inflammation and mucus secretion in both mice and humans. Although relaxing the airways with the rescue treatment albuterol did not affect these responses, inhibiting live cell extrusion signaling during bronchoconstriction prevented all these features. Our findings show that bronchoconstriction causes epithelial damage and inflammation by excess crowding-induced cell extrusion and suggest that blocking epithelial extrusion, instead of the ensuing downstream inflammation, could prevent the feed-forward asthma inflammatory cycle.",

Most previous works are based on either memristor-based CIMs, which suffer from accuracy loss and do not support training as a result of limited endurance, or digital static random-access memory (SRAM)–based CIMs, which suffer from large area requirements and volatile storage. We report an AI edge processor that uses a memristor-SRAM CIM-fusion scheme to simultaneously exploit the high accuracy of the digital SRAM CIM and the high energy-efficiency and storage density of the resistive random-access memory memristor CIM. This also enables adaptive local training to accommodate personalized characterization and user environment. The fusion processor achieved high CIM capacity, short wakeup-to-response latency (392 microseconds), high peak energy efficiency (77.64 teraoperations per second per watt), and robust accuracy (<0.5% accuracy loss). This work demonstrates that memristor technology has moved beyond in-lab development stages and now has manufacturability for AI edge processors.",

Here, we report on the synthesis of a stable nitrene by photolysis of the arylazide M S FluindN 3 ( 1 ), which gave rise to the quantitative formation of the arylnitrene M S FluindN ( 2 ) (M S Fluind is dispiro[fluorene-9,3′-(1′,1′,7′,7′-tetramethyl-s-hydrindacen-4′-yl)-5′,9′′-fluorene]) that remains unchanged for at least 3 days when stored under argon atmosphere at room temperature. The extraordinary life span permitted the full characterization of 2 by single-crystal x-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, which supported a triplet ground state. Theoretical simulations suggest that in addition to the kinetic stabilization conferred by the bulky M S Fluind aryl substituent, electron delocalization across the central aromatic ring contributes to the electron stabilization of 2 .",

    "abstract": "Perovskite solar modules (PSMs) show outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), but long-term operational stability remains problematic. We show that incorporating N,N -dimethylmethyleneiminium chloride into the perovskite precursor solution formed dimethylammonium cation and that previously unobserved methyl tetrahydrotriazinium ([MTTZ] + ) cation effectively improved perovskite film. The in situ formation of [MTTZ] + cation increased the formation energy of iodine vacancies and enhanced the migration energy barrier of iodide and cesium ions, which suppressed nonradiative recombination, thermal decomposition, and phase segregation processes. The optimized PSMs achieved a record (certified) PCE of 23.2% with an aperture area of 27.2 cm 2 , with a stabilized PCE of 23.0%. The encapsulated PSM retained 87.0% of its initial PCE after ~1900 hours of maximum power point tracking at 85°C and 85% relative humidity under 1.0-sun illumination.",

    "abstract": "Carbon capture can mitigate point-source carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, but hurdles remain that impede the widespread adoption of amine-based technologies. Capturing CO 2 at temperatures closer to those of many industrial exhaust streams (>200°C) is of interest, although metal oxide absorbents that operate at these temperatures typically exhibit sluggish CO 2 absorption kinetics and instability to cycling. Here, we report a porous metal–organic framework featuring terminal zinc hydride sites that reversibly bind CO 2 at temperatures above 200°C—conditions that are unprecedented for intrinsically porous materials. Gas adsorption, structural, spectroscopic, and computational analyses elucidate the rapid, reversible nature of this transformation. Extended cycling and breakthrough analyses reveal that the material is capable of deep carbon capture at low CO 2 concentrations and high temperatures relevant to postcombustion capture.",

In this work, we show that prosaposin (pSAP) drives CD8 T cell–mediated tumor immunity and that its hyperglycosylation in tumor dendritic cells (DCs) leads to cancer immune escape. We found that lysosomal pSAP and its single-saposin cognates mediated disintegration of tumor cell–derived apoptotic bodies to facilitate presentation of membrane-associated antigen and T cell activation. In the tumor microenvironment, transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) induced hyperglycosylation of pSAP and its subsequent secretion, which ultimately caused depletion of lysosomal saposins. pSAP hyperglycosylation was also observed in tumor-associated DCs from melanoma patients, and reconstitution with pSAP rescued activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Targeting DCs with recombinant pSAP triggered tumor protection and enhanced immune checkpoint therapy. Our studies demonstrate a critical function of pSAP in tumor immunity and may support its role in immunotherapy.",

To accomplish silicon-carbon bond cleavage, the enzyme catalyzes two tandem oxidations of a siloxane methyl group, which is followed by putative [1,2]-Brook rearrangement and hydrolysis.

Using an oxygen isotope ensemble approach—comprising shale, iron oxide, carbonate, silica, and phosphate records—we reconcile a multibillion-year history of seawater δ 18 O, temperature, and marine and terrestrial clay abundance. Our results reveal a rise in seawater δ 18 O and a temperate Proterozoic climate distinct to interpretations of a hot early Earth, indicating a strongly buffered climate system. Precambrian sediments are enriched in marine authigenic clay, with prominent reductions occurring in concert with Paleozoic and Cenozoic cooling, the expansion of siliceous life, and the radiation of land plants. These findings support the notion that shifts in the locus and extent of clay formation contributed to seawater 18 O enrichment, clement early Earth conditions, major climate transitions, and climate stability through the reverse weathering feedback.",

There has been no direct observation of this compact object. In this work, we observe the supernova remnant with JWST spectroscopy, finding narrow infrared emission lines of argon and sulfur. The line emission is spatially unresolved and blueshifted in velocity relative to the supernova rest frame. We interpret the lines as gas illuminated by a source of ionizing photons located close to the center of the expanding ejecta. Photoionization models show that the line ratios are consistent with ionization by a cooling neutron star or a pulsar wind nebula. The velocity shift could be evidence for a neutron star natal kick.",

In label-free microscopes, however, conventional AO faces limitations because of the absence of a guide star and the need to select an optimization metric specific to the sample and imaging process. Here, we propose an AO approach leveraging correlations between entangled photons to directly correct the point spread function. This guide star–free method is independent of the specimen and imaging modality. We demonstrate the imaging of biological samples in the presence of aberrations using a bright-field imaging setup operating with a source of spatially entangled photon pairs. Our approach performs better than conventional AO in correcting specific aberrations, particularly those involving substantial defocus. Our work improves AO for label-free microscopy and could play a major role in the development of quantum microscopes.",

The ferromagnetic state is identified as a Chern insulator with a Chern number of 4; its maximum Hall resistance reaches 78% quantization at zero magnetic field and is fully quantized at either 0.4 or –1.5 tesla. Three distinct broken-symmetry insulating states, layer-antiferromagnet, Chern insulator, and layer-polarized insulator, along with their transitions, can be continuously tuned by the vertical displacement field. In this system, the magnetic order of the Chern insulator can be switched by three knobs, including magnetic field, electrical doping, and vertical displacement field.",

However, as the recruitment of memory B cells (MBCs) to germinal centers (GCs) is inefficient and may be derailed by serum antibody–induced epitope masking, driving further B cell receptor (BCR) modification in GC-experienced B cells after boosting poses a challenge. Using humanized immunoglobulin knockin mice, we found that GT protein trimer immunogen N332-GT5 could prime inferred-germline precursors to the V3-glycan–targeted bnAb BG18 and that B cells primed by N332-GT5 were effectively boosted by either of two novel protein immunogens designed to have minimum cross-reactivity with the off-target V1-binding responses. The delivery of the prime and boost immunogens as messenger RNA lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) generated long-lasting GCs, somatic hypermutation, and affinity maturation and may be an effective tool in HIV vaccine development.",

Using massively parallel reporter assays in primary human cells from mid-gestation cortex and cerebral organoids, we interrogated the cis-regulatory activity of 102,767 open chromatin regions, including thousands of sequences with cell type–specific accessibility and variants associated with brain gene regulation. In primary cells, we identified 46,802 active enhancer sequences and 164 variants that alter enhancer activity. Activity was comparable in organoids and primary cells, suggesting that organoids provide an adequate model for the developing cortex. Using deep learning we decoded the sequence basis and upstream regulators of enhancer activity. This work establishes a comprehensive catalog of functional gene regulatory elements and variants in human neuronal development.",

The system manifests ease of synthesis, bistability, excellent photoswitching properties, and superb ON-OFF binding properties (difference of up to six orders of magnitude).",

The results disentangle intricate circuits of splicing factor cross-regulation, reveal that the precise architecture of late-assembling U4/U6.U5 tri–small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes regulates splice site pairing, and discover an unprecedented division of labor among protein components of U1 snRNP for regulating exon definition and alternative 5′ splice site selection.

This work aims to discover natural ribozymes that behave as hydrolytic and sequence-specific DNA endonucleases, which could be repurposed as DNA manipulation tools. Focused on bacterial group II-C introns, we found that many systems without intron-encoded protein propagate multiple copies in their resident genomes. These introns, named HYdrolytic Endonucleolytic Ribozymes (HYERs), cleaved RNA, single-stranded DNA, bubbled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and plasmids in vitro. HYER1 generated dsDNA breaks in the mammalian genome. Cryo–electron microscopy analysis revealed a homodimer structure for HYER1, where each monomer contains a Mg 2+ -dependent hydrolysis pocket and captures DNA complementary to the target recognition site (TRS). Rational designs including TRS extension, recruiting sequence insertion, and heterodimerization yielded engineered HYERs showing improved specificity and flexibility for DNA manipulation.",

In this work, we probe the influence of catalyst potential and interfacial electric fields on heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalysis. We observed that variations in applied potential of ~380 mV led to a 100,000-fold rate enhancement for 1-methylcyclopentanol dehydration, which was catalyzed by carbon-supported phosphotungstic acid. Mechanistic studies support a model in which the interfacial electrostatic potential drop drives quasi-equilibrated proton transfer to the adsorbed substrate prior to rate-limiting C–O bond cleavage. Large increases in rate with potential were also observed for the same reaction catalyzed by Ti/TiO y H x and for the Friedel Crafts acylation of anisole with acetic anhydride by carbon-supported phosphotungstic acid.",

Here, we demonstrate electron ptychography in an uncorrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) with deep subangstrom spatial resolution down to 0.44 angstroms, exceeding the conventional resolution of aberration-corrected tools and rivaling their highest ptychographic resolutions​. Our approach, which we demonstrate on twisted two-dimensional materials in a widely available commercial microscope, far surpasses prior ptychographic resolutions (1 to 5 angstroms) of uncorrected STEMs. We further show how geometric aberrations can create optimized, structured beams for dose-efficient electron ptychography. Our results demonstrate that expensive aberration correctors are no longer required for deep subangstrom resolution.",

We provided empirical evidence that AGOP captured features learned by various neural network architectures, including transformer-based language models, convolutional networks, multilayer perceptrons, and recurrent neural networks. Moreover, we demonstrated that AGOP, which is backpropagation-free, enabled feature learning in machine learning models, such as kernel machines, that a priori could not identify task-specific features. Overall, we established a fundamental mechanism that captured feature learning in neural networks and enabled feature learning in general machine learning models.",

We performed a natural transmission experiment to directly estimate the rate of transmission to and from vaccinated and unvaccinated calves over a 1-year exposure period. The results show a higher indirect efficacy of BCG to reduce transmission from vaccinated animals that subsequently become infected [74%; 95% credible interval (CrI): 46 to 98%] compared with direct protection against infection (58%; 95% CrI: 34 to 73%) and an estimated total efficacy of 89% (95% CrI: 74 to 96%).

It catalyzes two chemical reactions: water oxidation to molecular oxygen and plastoquinone reduction. Coupling of electron and proton transfer is crucial for efficiency; however, the molecular basis of these processes remains speculative owing to uncertain water binding sites and the lack of experimentally determined hydrogen positions. We thus collected high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy data of fully hydrated photosystem II from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vestitus to a final resolution of 1.71 angstroms. The structure reveals several previously undetected partially occupied water binding sites and more than half of the hydrogen and proton positions. This clarifies the pathways of substrate water binding and plastoquinone B protonation.",

This situation poses a challenge for the biosynthesis of fluorinated compounds used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. We developed a photoenzymatic hydrofluoroalkylation that integrates fluorinated motifs into olefins. The photoinduced promiscuity of flavin-dependent ene-reductases enables the generation of carbon-centered radicals from iodinated fluoroalkanes, which are directed by the photoenzyme to engage enantioselectively with olefins. This approach facilitates stereocontrol through interaction between a singular fluorinated unit and the enzyme, securing high enantioselectivity at β, γ, or δ positions of fluorinated groups through enzymatic hydrogen atom transfer—a process that is notably challenging with conventional chemocatalysis. This work advances enzymatic strategies for integrating fluorinated chemical feedstocks and opens avenues for asymmetric synthesis of fluorinated compounds.",

In this work, we genetically dissected repeated origins and losses of prickles—sharp epidermal projections—that convergently evolved in numerous plant lineages. Mutations in a cytokinin hormone biosynthetic gene caused at least 16 independent losses of prickles in eggplants and wild relatives in the genus Solanum . Homologs underlie prickle formation across angiosperms that collectively diverged more than 150 million years ago, including rice and roses. By developing new Solanum genetic systems, we leveraged this discovery to eliminate prickles in a wild species and an indigenously foraged berry. Our findings implicate a shared hormone activation genetic program underlying evolutionarily widespread and recurrent instances of plant morphological innovation.",

We applied cryo–electron tomography to capture intermediates of S2 refolding and understand inhibition by antibodies to the S2 stem-helix. Subtomogram averaging revealed ACE2 dimers cross-linking spikes before transitioning into S2 intermediates, which were captured at various stages of refolding. Pan-betacoronavirus neutralizing antibodies targeting the S2 stem-helix bound to and inhibited refolding of spike prehairpin intermediates. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations, these structures elucidate the process of SARS-CoV-2 entry and reveal how pan-betacoronavirus S2-targeting antibodies neutralize infectivity by arresting prehairpin intermediates.",

In this work, we introduce a metric of variational accuracy, the V-score, obtained from the variational energy and its variance. We provide an extensive curated dataset of variational calculations of many-body quantum systems, identifying cases where state-of-the-art numerical approaches show limited accuracy and future algorithms or computational platforms, such as quantum computing, could provide improved accuracy. The V-score can be used as a metric to assess the progress of quantum variational methods toward a quantum advantage for ground-state problems, especially in regimes where classical verifiability is impossible.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic landscape of cancer greatly influences antitumor immunity, yet it remains unclear how organ-specific metabolites in the tumor microenvironment influence immunosurveillance. We found that accumulation of primary conjugated and secondary bile acids (BAs) are metabolic features of human hepatocellular carcinoma and experimental liver cancer models. Inhibiting conjugated BA synthesis in hepatocytes through deletion of the BA-conjugating enzyme bile acid–CoA:amino acid N -acyltransferase (BAAT) enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses, reduced tumor growth, and sensitized tumors to anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti–PD-1) immunotherapy. Furthermore, different BAs regulated CD8 + T cells differently; primary BAs induced oxidative stress, whereas the secondary BA lithocholic acid inhibited T cell function through endoplasmic reticulum stress, which was countered by ursodeoxycholic acid. We demonstrate that modifying BA synthesis or dietary intake of ursodeoxycholic acid could improve tumor immunotherapy in liver cancer model systems.",

    "abstract": "On 3 October 2023, a multihazard cascade in the Sikkim Himalaya, India, was triggered by 14.7 million cubic meters of frozen lateral moraine collapsing into South Lhonak Lake. The impact generated an ~20-meter tsunami-like impact wave, which breached the moraine and drained ~50 million cubic meters of the lake’s water. The ensuing glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) eroded ~270 million cubic meters of sediment, which overwhelmed infrastructure, including hydropower installations along the Teesta River. The physical scale and human and economic impacts of this event prompt urgent reflection on the role of climate change and human activities in exacerbating such disasters. Insights into multihazard evolution are pivotal for informing policy development, enhancing early warning systems (EWS), and spurring paradigm shifts in GLOF risk management strategies in the Himalaya and other mountain environments.",

To address this, we introduce a method to record transient cellular events for later analysis. We designed proteins that become labeled in the presence of both a specific cellular activity and a fluorescent substrate. The recording period is set by the presence of the substrate, whereas the cellular activity controls the degree of the labeling. The use of distinguishable substrates enabled the recording of successive periods of activity. We recorded protein-protein interactions, G protein–coupled receptor activation, and increases in intracellular calcium. Recordings of elevated calcium levels allowed selections of cells from heterogeneous populations for transcriptomic analysis and tracking of neuronal activities in flies and zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "In some mammals, notably humans, recombination occurs almost exclusively where the protein PRDM9 binds, whereas in vertebrates lacking an intact PRDM9 , such as birds and canids, recombination rates are elevated near promoter-like features. To determine whether PRDM9 directs recombination in nonmammalian vertebrates, we focused on an exemplar species with a single, intact PRDM9 ortholog, the corn snake ( Pantherophis guttatus ). Analyzing historical recombination rates along the genome and crossovers in pedigrees, we found evidence that PRDM9 specifies the location of recombination events, but we also detected a separable effect of promoter-like features. These findings reveal that the uses of PRDM9 and promoter-like features need not be mutually exclusive and instead reflect a tug-of-war that is more even in some species than others.",

In this work, we resolved the native structure of a massive host-defense complex that polymerizes 30,000 guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) over the surface of gram-negative bacteria inside human cells. Construction of this giant nanomachine took several minutes and remained stable for hours, required guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis, and recruited four GBPs plus caspase-4 and Gasdermin D as a cytokine and cell death immune signaling platform. Cryo–electron tomography suggests that GBP1 can adopt an extended conformation for bacterial membrane insertion to establish this platform, triggering lipopolysaccharide release that activated coassembled caspase-4. Our “open conformer” model provides a dynamic view into how the human GBP1 defense complex mobilizes innate immunity to infection.",

However, the neural mechanisms governing these processes remain unclear. We identified excitatory vocalization-specific laryngeal premotor neurons located in the retroambiguus nucleus (RAm VOC ) in adult mice as being both necessary and sufficient for driving vocal cord closure and eliciting mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). The duration of RAm VOC activation can determine the lengths of both USV syllables and concurrent expiration periods, with the impact of RAm VOC activation depending on respiration phases. RAm VOC neurons receive inhibition from the preBötzinger complex, and inspiration needs override RAm VOC -mediated vocal cord closure. Ablating inhibitory synapses in RAm VOC neurons compromised this inspiration gating of laryngeal adduction, resulting in discoordination of vocalization with respiration. Our study reveals the circuits for vocal production and vocal-respiratory coordination.",

In this study, we show that generalized fear in mice results from a transmitter switch from glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in serotonergic neurons of the lateral wings of the dorsal raphe. Similar change in transmitter identity was found in the postmortem brains of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Overriding the transmitter switch in mice prevented the acquisition of generalized fear. Corticosterone release and activation of glucocorticoid receptors mediated the switch, and prompt antidepressant treatment blocked the cotransmitter switch and generalized fear. Our results provide important insight into the mechanisms involved in fear generalization.",

In this work, immunization with N332-GT5, an HIV envelope trimer designed to target precursors of the HCDR3-dominant bnAb BG18, primed bnAb-precursor B cells in eight of eight rhesus macaques to substantial frequencies and with diverse lineages in germinal center and memory B cells. We confirmed bnAb-mimicking, HCDR3-dominant, trimer-binding interactions with cryo–electron microscopy. Our results demonstrate proof of principle for HCDR3-dominant bnAb-precursor priming in outbred animals and suggest that N332-GT5 holds promise for the induction of similar responses in humans.",

    "abstract": "The molecular organization of the human neocortex historically has been studied in the context of its histological layers. However, emerging spatial transcriptomic technologies have enabled unbiased identification of transcriptionally defined spatial domains that move beyond classic cytoarchitecture. We used the Visium spatial gene expression platform to generate a data-driven molecular neuroanatomical atlas across the anterior-posterior axis of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Integration with paired single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data revealed distinct cell type compositions and cell-cell interactions across spatial domains. Using PsychENCODE and publicly available data, we mapped the enrichment of cell types and genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders to discrete spatial domains.",

However, existing strategies in mammalian cells rely on the introduction of a blank codon to incorporate ncAAs, which is inefficient and limits their widespread applications. In this study, we developed a rare codon recoding strategy that takes advantage of the relative rarity of the TCG codon to achieve highly selective and efficient ncAA incorporation through systematic engineering and big data–model predictions. We highlight the broad utility of this strategy for the incorporation of dozens of ncAAs into various functional proteins at the wild-type protein expression levels, as well as the synthesis of proteins with up to six-site ncAAs or four distinct ncAAs in mammalian cells for downstream applications.",

However, modeling sporadic LOAD that endogenously captures hallmark neuronal pathologies such as amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, tau tangles, and neuronal loss remains an unmet need. We demonstrate that neurons generated by microRNA (miRNA)–based direct reprogramming of fibroblasts from individuals affected by autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) and LOAD in a three-dimensional environment effectively recapitulate key neuropathological features of AD. Reprogrammed LOAD neurons exhibit Aβ-dependent neurodegeneration, and treatment with β- or γ-secretase inhibitors before (but not subsequent to) Aβ deposit formation mitigated neuronal death. Moreover inhibiting age-associated retrotransposable elements in LOAD neurons reduced both Aβ deposition and neurodegeneration. Our study underscores the efficacy of modeling late-onset neuropathology of LOAD through high-efficiency miRNA-based neuronal reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is increasingly predisposing polar regions to large landslides. Tsunamigenic landslides have occurred recently in Greenland ( Kalaallit Nunaat ), but none have been reported from the eastern fjords. In September 2023, we detected the start of a 9-day-long, global 10.88-millihertz (92-second) monochromatic very-long-period (VLP) seismic signal, originating from East Greenland. In this study, we demonstrate how this event started with a glacial thinning–induced rock-ice avalanche of 25 × 10 6 cubic meters plunging into Dickson Fjord, triggering a 200-meter-high tsunami. Simulations show that the tsunami stabilized into a 7-meter-high long-duration seiche with a frequency (11.45 millihertz) and slow amplitude decay that were nearly identical to the seismic signal. An oscillating, fjord-transverse single force with a maximum amplitude of 5 × 10 11 newtons reproduced the seismic amplitudes and their radiation pattern relative to the fjord, demonstrating how a seiche directly caused the 9-day-long seismic signal. Our findings highlight how climate change is causing cascading, hazardous feedbacks between the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere.",

In this work, we developed a messenger RNA (mRNA)–lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccine targeting C. difficile toxins and virulence factors. This multivalent vaccine elicited robust and long-lived systemic and mucosal antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across animal models, independent of changes to the intestinal microbiota. Vaccination protected mice from lethal CDI in both primary and recurrent infection models, and inclusion of non-toxin cellular and spore antigens improved decolonization of toxigenic C. difficile from the gastrointestinal tract. Our studies demonstrate mRNA-LNP vaccine technology as a promising platform for the development of novel C. difficile therapeutics with potential for limiting acute disease and promoting bacterial decolonization.",

We observed SS 433 in gamma rays using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and found an energy-dependent shift in the apparent position of the gamma-ray emission from the parsec-scale jets. These observations trace the energetic electron population and indicate that inverse Compton scattering is the emission mechanism of the gamma rays. Our modeling of the energy-dependent gamma-ray morphology constrains the location of particle acceleration and requires an abrupt deceleration of the jet flow. We infer the presence of shocks on either side of the binary system, at distances of 25 to 30 parsecs, and that self-collimation of the precessing jets forms the shocks, which then efficiently accelerate electrons.",

Here we report a technique to break the chiral symmetry and to differentiate enantiomers by inducing directional rotation of chiral gas-phase ions. Dual alternating current excitations were applied to manipulate the motions of trapped ions, including the rotation around the center of mass and macro movement around the center of the trap. Differences in collision cross section were induced, which could be measured by ion cloud profiling at high resolutions above 10,000. High-field ion mobility and tandem mass spectrometry analyses of the enantiomers were combined and implemented by using a miniature ion trap mass spectrometer. The effectiveness of the developed method was demonstrated with a variety of organic compounds including amino acids, sugars, and several drug molecules, as well as a proof-of-principle ligand optimization study for asymmetric hydrogenation.",

    "abstract": "Tubulin, one of the most abundant cytoskeletal building blocks, has numerous isotypes in metazoans encoded by different conserved genes. Whether these distinct isotypes form cell type– and context-specific microtubule structures is poorly understood. Based on a cohort of 12 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia as well as mouse mutants, we identified and characterized variants in the TUBB4B isotype that specifically perturbed centriole and cilium biogenesis. Distinct TUBB4B variants differentially affected microtubule dynamics and cilia formation in a dominant-negative manner. Structure-function studies revealed that different TUBB4B variants disrupted distinct tubulin interfaces, thereby enabling stratification of patients into three classes of ciliopathic diseases. These findings show that specific tubulin isotypes have distinct and nonredundant subcellular functions and establish a link between tubulinopathies and ciliopathies.",

We estimate that Neanderthals have 2.5 to 3.7% human ancestry, and we leverage human-introgressed sequences in Neanderthals to revise estimates of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans, show that Neanderthal population sizes were significantly smaller than previously estimated, and identify two distinct waves of modern human gene flow into Neanderthals.

A reagent specifically designed for chemoselective introduction of monoatomic carbon is a particularly formidable challenge. Here, we report a straightforward, azide-free synthesis of a crystalline and isolable diazophosphorus ylide, Ph 3 PCN 2 , a stable compound with a carbon atom bonded to two chemically labile groups, triphenylphosphine (PPh 3 ) and dinitrogen (N 2 ). Without any additives, the diazophosphorus ylide serves as a highly selective transfer reagent for fragments, including Ph 3 PC, to deliver phosphorus ylide–terminated heterocumulenes and CN 2 to produce multisubstituted pyrazoles. Ultimately, even exclusive carbon-atom transfer is possible. In reactions with aldehydes and acyclic and cyclic ketones (R 2 C=O), the carbon-atom substitution forms a vinylidene (R 2 C=C:) en route to alkynes or butatrienes.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) generates micronuclei—aberrant extranuclear structures that catalyze the acquisition of complex chromosomal rearrangements present in cancer. Micronuclei are characterized by persistent DNA damage and catastrophic nuclear envelope collapse, which exposes DNA to the cytoplasm. We found that the autophagic receptor p62/SQSTM1 modulates micronuclear stability, influencing chromosome fragmentation and rearrangements. Mechanistically, proximity of micronuclei to mitochondria led to oxidation-driven homo-oligomerization of p62, limiting endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)–dependent micronuclear envelope repair by triggering autophagic degradation. We also found that p62 levels correlate with increased chromothripsis across human cancer cell lines and with increased CIN in colorectal tumors. Thus, p62 acts as a regulator of micronuclei and may serve as a prognostic marker for tumors with high CIN.",

In this study, we report a ligand-controlled stereodivergent synthesis of non-natural α-quaternary amino acids bearing trisubstituted alkene moieties in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity and Z / E selectivities. This success is achieved through a palladium/copper–cocatalyzed three-component assembly of readily available aryl iodides, allenes, and aldimine esters by simply tuning the chiral ligands of the palladium and copper catalysts.",

In this work, we investigated the roles of PIEZO mechanosensitive channels in the intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche. We used mouse genetics and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to assess the requirement for PIEZO channels in ISC maintenance. In vivo measurement of basement membrane stiffness showed that ISCs reside in a more rigid microenvironment at the bottom of the crypt. Three-dimensional and two-dimensional organoid systems combined with bioengineered substrates and a stretching device revealed that PIEZO channels sense extracellular mechanical stimuli to modulate ISC function. This study delineates the mechanistic cascade of PIEZO activation that coordinates ISC fate decision and maintenance.",

Coupling two unsaturated bonds with carbon monoxide, the transformation remains limited to CO as a C 1 building block. Herein we report analogous cycloaddition reactions with nitrenes as an N 1 unit. The reaction of a nonconjugated diene with a nitrene precursor produces bicyclic bioisosteres of common saturated heterocycles such as piperidine, morpholine, and piperazine. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies support relaying of the diradical nature of triplet nitrene into the π-system. We showcase the reaction’s utility in late-stage functionalization of drug compounds and discovery of soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors.",

A combination of a bulky ancillary phosphine ligand on palladium and a commercially available amination reagent enables efficient reactivity across aryl halides and pseudohalides, boronic acids and esters, and many functional groups and heterocycles. Mechanistic insights reveal flexibility on the order of bond-forming events, suggesting potential for expansion of the aminative cross-coupling concept to encompass diverse nucleophiles and electrophiles as well as four-component variants.",

How excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic cytomatrices or densities (e/iPSDs) are segregated is not understood. Broadly, why membraneless organelles are naturally segregated in cellular subcompartments is unclear. Using biochemical reconstitutions in vitro and in cells, we demonstrate that ePSDs and iPSDs spontaneously segregate into distinct condensed molecular assemblies through phase separation. Tagging iPSD scaffold gephyrin with a PSD-95 intrabody (dissociation constant ~4 nM) leads to mistargeting of gephyrin to ePSD condensates. Unexpectedly, formation of iPSD condensates forces the intrabody-tagged gephyrin out of ePSD condensates. Thus, instead of diffusion-governed spontaneous mixing, demixing is a default process for biomolecules in condensates. Phase separation can generate biomolecular compartmentalization specificities that cannot occur in dilute solutions.",

Here, we describe the identification of a class of compounds called ReS19-T, which are able to restore calcium homeostasis in cell-based models of tau pathology. Aberrant tau accumulation leads to uncontrolled activation of store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs) by remodeling septin filaments at the cell cortex. Binding of ReS19-T to septins restores filament assembly in the disease state and restrains calcium entry through SOCCs. In amyloid-β and tau-driven mouse models of disease, ReS19-T agents restored synaptic plasticity, normalized brain network activity, and attenuated the development of both amyloid-β and tau pathology. Our findings identify the septin cytoskeleton as a potential therapeutic target for the development of disease-modifying AD treatments.",

We describe a mode of pressure adaptation in comb jellies (ctenophores) that also constrains these animals’ depth range. Structural analysis of deep-sea ctenophore lipids shows that they form a nonbilayer phase at pressures under which the phase is not typically stable. Lipidomics and all-atom simulations identified phospholipids with strong negative spontaneous curvature, including plasmalogens, as a hallmark of deep-adapted membranes that causes this phase behavior. Synthesis of plasmalogens enhanced pressure tolerance in Escherichia coli , whereas low-curvature lipids had the opposite effect. Imaging of ctenophore tissues indicated that the disintegration of deep-sea animals when decompressed could be driven by a phase transition in their phospholipid membranes.",

    "abstract": "We describe an approach for designing high-affinity small molecule–binding proteins poised for downstream sensing. We use deep learning–generated pseudocycles with repeating structural units surrounding central binding pockets with widely varying shapes that depend on the geometry and number of the repeat units. We dock small molecules of interest into the most shape complementary of these pseudocycles, design the interaction surfaces for high binding affinity, and experimentally screen to identify designs with the highest affinity. We obtain binders to four diverse molecules, including the polar and flexible methotrexate and thyroxine. Taking advantage of the modular repeat structure and central binding pockets, we construct chemically induced dimerization systems and low-noise nanopore sensors by splitting designs into domains that reassemble upon ligand addition.",

    "abstract": "Earthquakes vary in size over many orders of magnitude, often rupturing in complex multifault and multievent sequences. Despite the large number of observed earthquakes, the scaling of the earthquake energy budget remains enigmatic. We propose that fundamentally different fracture processes govern small and large earthquakes. We combined seismological observations with physics-based earthquake models, finding that both dynamic weakening and restrengthening effects are non-negligible in the energy budget of small earthquakes. We established a linear scaling relationship between fracture energy and fault size and a break in scaling with slip. We applied this scaling using supercomputing and unveiled large dynamic rupture earthquake cascades involving >700 multiscale fractures within a fault damage zone. We provide a simple explanation for seismicity across all scales with implications for comprehending earthquake genesis and multifault rupture cascades.",

However, the inability to surmount multiple functionality trade-offs limits the discovery of next-generation multifunctional materials. Departing from conventional alloying design philosophy, we present a hierarchical nanostructure (HNS) strategy to simultaneously break multiple performance trade-offs in a material. Using a praseodymium-cobalt (PrCo 5 ) ferromagnet as a proof of concept, the resulting HNS outperforms contemporary high-temperature ferromagnets with a 50 to 138% increase in electrical resistivity while achieving their highest energy density. Our strategy also enables an exceptional thermal stability of coercivity (−0.148%/°C)—a key characteristic for device accuracy and reliability—surpassing that of existing commercial rare-earth magnets. The multifunctionality stems from the deliberately introduced nanohierarchical structure, which activates multiple micromechanisms to resist domain wall movement and electron transport, offering an advanced design concept for multifunctional materials.",

To address the material recyclability challenges in sustainable energy infrastructure, we introduce scalable biomass-derivable polyester covalent adaptable networks and corresponding fiber-reinforced composites for recyclable wind blade fabrication. Through experimental and computational studies, including vacuum-assisted resin-transfer molding of a 9-meter wind blade prototype, we demonstrate drop-in technological readiness of this material with existing manufacture techniques, superior properties relative to incumbent materials, and practical end-of-life chemical recyclability. Most notable is the counterintuitive creep suppression, outperforming industry state-of-the-art thermosets despite the dynamic cross-link topology. Overall, this report details the many facets of wind blade manufacture, encompassing chemistry, engineering, safety, mechanical analyses, weathering, and chemical recyclability, enabling a realistic path toward biomass-derivable, recyclable wind blades.",

The E3 ligase tripartite motif–containing protein 21 (TRIM21) degrades antibody-bound proteins in an assembly state–specific manner due to the requirement of TRIM21 RING domain clustering for activation, yet effective targeting of intracellular assemblies remains challenging. Here, we fused the RING domain of TRIM21 to a target-specific nanobody to create intracellularly expressed constructs capable of selectively degrading assembled proteins. We evaluated this approach against green fluorescent protein–tagged histone 2B (H2B-GFP) and tau, a protein that undergoes pathological aggregation in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. RING-nanobody degraders prevented or reversed tau aggregation in culture and in vivo, with minimal impact on monomeric tau. This approach may have therapeutic potential for the many disorders driven by intracellular protein aggregation.",

We recorded spontaneous “phee-call” dialogues between pairs of marmoset monkeys. We discovered that marmosets use these calls to vocally label their conspecifics. Moreover, they respond more consistently and correctly to calls that are specifically directed at them. Analysis of calls from multiple monkeys revealed that family members use similar calls and acoustic features to label others and perform vocal learning. These findings shed light on the complexities of social vocalizations among nonhuman primates and suggest that marmoset vocalizations may provide a model for understanding aspects of human language, thereby offering new insights into the evolution of social communication.",

We investigated three commonly mutated epigenetic regulators that promote clonal hematopoiesis to determine whether they affect T cell stemness and response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. CD8 T cells lacking Dnmt3a, Tet2, or Asxl1 preserved a progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) population for more than 1 year during chronic antigen exposure without undergoing malignant transformation. Asxl1 controlled the self-renewal capacity of T cells and reduced CD8 T cell differentiation through H2AK119 ubiquitination and epigenetic modification of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase pathway. Asxl1-deficient T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy to improve tumor control in experimental models and conferred a survival advantage to mutated T cells from treated patients.",

Many of the detected chemicals as well as the whole extracts interfered with neurite development. Experimental testing of simulated complex mixtures of detected chemicals in the neurotoxicity assay confirmed additive mixture effects at concentrations less than individual chemicals’ effect thresholds. The use of high-throughput target screening combined with bioassays has the potential to improve human biomonitoring and provide a new approach to including mixture effects in epidemiological studies.",

In this work, we report a small-molecule acceptor (SMA), also known as a non–fullerene acceptor (NFA), designed for stretchable organic solar cell ( s -OSC) blends with large mechanical compliance and performance. Blends of the organosilane-functionalized SMA BTP-Si4 with the polymer donor PNTB6-Cl achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >16% and ultimate strain (ε u ) of >95%. Typical SMAs suppress OSC blend ductility, but the addition of BTP-Si4 enhances it. Although BTP-Si4 is less crystalline than other SMAs, it retains considerable electron mobility and is highly miscible with PNTB6-Cl and is essential for enhancing ε u . Thus, s -OSCs with PCE > 14% and operating normally under various deformations (>80% PCE retention under an 80% strain) were demonstrated. Analysis of several SMA-polymer blends revealed general molecular structure–miscibility–stretchability relationships for designing ductile blends.",

We introduce a strategy called “hydro-locking,” which involves immobilizing the water molecules within the polymer network of the hydrogel. This is accomplished by establishing robust connections between water molecules and the polymer by using sulfuric acid. A sacrificial network is introduced to shield the prime polymer network from collapsing. Under the hydro-locking mode, an alginate-polyacrylamide double-network hydrogel remains soft and stretchable within a temperature range that spans from –115° to 143°C. The strategy works with a range of hydrogels and solutions and may enable the preservation and observation of materials or even living organisms at extreme temperatures.",

Temperate grasslands have exhibited the greatest declines in vegetation greenness during MYDs, whereas boreal and tropical forests have had comparably minor responses.

In this work, we report a main chain–initiated, visible light–triggered depolymerization directly applicable to commercial polymers containing undisclosed impurities (e.g., comonomers, additives, or dyes). By in situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the solvent, near-quantitative (>98%) depolymerization of polymethacrylates could be achieved regardless of their synthetic route (e.g., radical or ionic polymerization), end group, and molecular weight (up to 1.6 million daltons).

Our additive-free method for skeletal editing employs easily accessible, benchtop-stable sulfenylnitrene precursors over a broad temperature range (−30 to 150°C). This approach is compatible with diverse functional groups, including oxidation-sensitive functionalities such as phenols and thioethers, and has been applied to various natural products, amino acids, and pharmaceuticals.

    "abstract": "That neutrinos carry a nonvanishing rest mass is evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles. Their absolute mass holds relevance in fields from particle physics to cosmology. We report on the search for the effective electron antineutrino mass with the KATRIN experiment. KATRIN performs precision spectroscopy of the tritium β-decay close to the kinematic endpoint. On the basis of the first five measurement campaigns, we derived a best-fit value of m ν 2 = − 0.14 − 0.15 + 0.13 eV 2 , resulting in an upper limit of m ν < 0.45 eV at 90% confidence level. Stemming from 36 million electrons collected in 259 measurement days, a substantial reduction of the background level, and improved systematic uncertainties, this result tightens KATRIN’s previous bound by a factor of almost two.",

In North America, HPAI A(H5N1) viruses related to the goose/Guangdong 2.3.4.4b hemagglutinin phylogenetic clade have infected wild birds, poultry, and mammals. Our genomic analysis and epidemiological investigation showed that a reassortment event in wild bird populations preceded a single wild bird–to-cattle transmission episode. The movement of asymptomatic or presymptomatic cattle has likely played a role in the spread of HPAI within the United States dairy herd. Some molecular markers that may lead to changes in transmission efficiency and phenotype were detected at low frequencies. Continued transmission of H5N1 HPAI within dairy cattle increases the risk for infection and subsequent spread of the virus to human populations.",

    "abstract": "The role of glioma-associated myeloid cells in tumor growth and immune evasion remains poorly understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of immune and tumor cells from 33 gliomas, identifying two distinct myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations in isocitrate dehydrogenase–wild-type (IDT-WT) glioblastoma: an early progenitor MDSC (E-MDSC) population with up-regulation of metabolic and hypoxia pathways and a monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) population. Spatial transcriptomics demonstrated that E-MDSCs geographically colocalize with metabolic stem-like tumor cells in the pseudopalisading region. Ligand-receptor analysis revealed cross-talk between these cells, where glioma stem-like cells produce chemokines attracting E-MDSCs, which in turn produce growth factors for the tumor cells. This interaction is absent in IDH-mutant gliomas, associated with hypermethylation and repressed gene expression of MDSC-attracting chemokines. Our study elucidates specific MDSCs that may facilitate glioblastoma progression and mediate tumor immunosuppression.",

Image-based transcriptomics approaches offer an avenue to study such behaviors, yet these approaches have been hindered by the massive density of bacterial messenger RNA. To overcome this challenge, we combined 1000-fold volumetric expansion with multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to create bacterial-MERFISH. This method enables high-throughput, spatially resolved profiling of thousands of operons within individual bacteria. Using bacterial-MERFISH, we dissected the response of Escherichia coli to carbon starvation, systematically mapped subcellular RNA organization, and charted the adaptation of a gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to micrometer-scale niches in the mammalian colon. We envision that bacterial-MERFISH will be broadly applicable to the study of bacterial single-cell heterogeneity in diverse, spatially structured, and native environments.",

We uncover erucamide as a previously unknown phytoalexin of both dicots and monocots that blocks the T3SS function of multiple bacterial pathogens. Genetically impairing erucamide accumulation or exogenous application in Arabidopsis highlighted erucamide’s role in antibacterial immunity. Erucamide binds Hypersensitive response and conserved C (HrcC), a key T3SS component, to block injectisome assembly. Analyses of erucamide analogs and HrcC mutants indicated that the erucamide-HrcC binding is required for inhibiting T3SS in vitro and antibacterial resistance in plants, suggesting an essential role of erucamide-HrcC binding in disease resistance. This work reveals a plant chemical defense that targets major virulence machinery in bacterial pathogens.",

This study identifies driving forces of burn severity and estimates its spatiotemporal variations in Canadian forests. Our results show that fuel aridity was the most influential driver of burn severity, summer months were more prone to severe burning, and the northern areas were most influenced by the changing climate. About 6% (0.54 to 14.64%) of the modeled areas show significant increases in the number of days conducive to high-severity burning during 1981 to 2020, most of which were found during 2001 to 2020 and in the spring and autumn. The extraordinary 2023 fire season demonstrated similar spatial patterns but more-widespread escalations in burn severity.",

However, nonalloyed α-FAPbI 3 is metastable with respect to the photoinactive δ-phase. We have developed a kinetic modulation strategy to fabricate high-quality and stable nonalloyed α-FAPbI 3 films, assisted by cogenetic volatile iodine intercalation and decalation. The intercalation of iodine facilitated the formation of corner-sharing Pb-I framework building blocks and reduced the kinetic barrier for α-FAPbI 3 formation, whereas the iodine decalation improved the final perovskite film quality in terms of composition purity and overall homogeneity. Solar cells based on this nonalloyed α-FAPbI 3 (free of other extrinsic composition ions) achieved a power conversion efficiency of >24%. The devices also exhibited excellent durability, retaining 99% of their original power conversion efficiency after operating for more than 1100 hours at 85° ± 5°C under illumination.",

In this study, we show that both male and female mice exhibit female preference but shift to male preference when facing survival threats; their preference is mediated by the dimorphic changes in the excitability of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic (VTA DA ) neurons. In males, VTA DA projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate female preference, and those to the medial preoptic area mediate male preference. In females, firing-pattern (phasic-like versus tonic-like) alteration of the VTA DA -NAc projection determines sociosexual preferences. These findings define VTA DA neurons as a key node for social decision-making and reveal the sexually dimorphic DA circuit mechanisms underlying sociosexual preference.",

However, ultrastrong alloys inevitably show decreased strain-hardening capacity, limiting their uniform elongation. We present a supranano (<10 nanometers) and short-range ordering design for grain interiors and grain boundary regions, respectively, in fine-grained alloys based on vanadium, cobalt, and nickel, with additions of tungsten, copper, aluminum, and boron. The pronounced grain boundary–related strengthening and ductilization mechanism is realized through segregation of the short-range ordering near the grain boundary. Furthermore, the supranano ordering with a larger size has an enhanced pinning effect for dislocations and stacking faults, multiplied and accumulated in grain interiors during plastic deformation. These mechanisms promote continuously increased flow stress until fracture of the alloy at 10% strain with 2.6-gigapascal tensile stress.",

We demonstrate a new thermal catalytic route for the partial reforming of ethanol into hydrogen and acetic acid with near-zero carbon dioxide emissions. This reaction is enabled by a catalyst containing a high density of atomic Pt 1 and Ir 1 species supported on a reactive alpha-molybdenum carbide substrate, achieving a hydrogen production rate of 331.3 millimoles of hydrogen per gram catalyst per hour and an acetic acid selectivity of 84.5% at 270°C, and is therefore more energy-efficient compared with standard reforming. Techno-economic analysis of partial ethanol reforming demonstrates the potential profitability for operation at an industrial scale, presenting the opportunity to produce hydrogen and acetic acid with a substantially reduced carbon dioxide footprint.",

We employed in vivo CRISPR-Cas9–based perturbation sequencing to assess the role of ~40 transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modulators in T cell fate decisions. Unexpectedly, we found that knockout of the TF Klf2 resulted in aberrant differentiation to exhausted-like CD8 T cells during acute infection. KLF2 was required to suppress the exhaustion-promoting TF TOX and to enable the TF TBET to drive effector differentiation. KLF2 was also necessary to maintain a polyfunctional tumor-specific progenitor state. Thus, KLF2 provides effector CD8 T cell lineage fidelity and suppresses the exhaustion program.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal accumulation and spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils are key events in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the uptake of α-syn fibrils remain unclear. In this work, we identified FAM171A2 as a PD risk gene that affects α-syn aggregation. Overexpressing FAM171A2 promotes α-syn fibril endocytosis and exacerbates the spread and neurotoxicity of α-syn pathology. Neuronal-specific knockdown of FAM171A2 expression shows protective effects. Mechanistically, the FAM171A2 extracellular domain 1 interacts with the α-syn C terminus through electrostatic forces, with >1000 times more selective for fibrils. Furthermore, we identified bemcentinib as an effective blocker of FAM171A2–α-syn fibril interaction with an in vitro binding assay, in cellular models, and in mice. Our findings identified FAM171A2 as a potential receptor for the neuronal uptake of α-syn fibrils and, thus, as a therapeutic target against PD.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.",

ProtGPS successfully guided generation of novel protein sequences that selectively assemble in the nucleolus.

Our results indicate that protein sequences contain not only a folding code but also a previously unrecognized code governing their distribution to diverse subcellular compartments.",

Butterflies are the most surveyed insect taxa, yet analyses have been limited in geographic scale or rely on data from a single monitoring program. Using records of 12.6 million individual butterflies from >76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programs, we characterized overall and species-specific butterfly abundance trends across the contiguous United States. Between 2000 and 2020, total butterfly abundance fell by 22% across the 554 recorded species. Species-level declines were widespread, with 13 times as many species declining as increasing. The prevalence of declines throughout all regions in the United States highlights an urgent need to protect butterflies from further losses.",

In this work, we report an HLB resistance regulatory circuit in Citrus composed of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, PUB21, and its substrate, the MYC2 transcription factor, which regulates jasmonate-mediated defense responses. A helitron insertion in the PUB21 promoter introduced multiple MYC2-binding cis-elements to create a regulatory circuit linking the PUB21 activity with MYC2 degradation. Ectopic expression of a natural dominant-negative PUB21 paralog discovered in distant Citrus relatives stabilized MYC2 and conferred resistance to HLB. Antiproteolysis peptides (APPs), identified by artificial intelligence, stabilized MYC2 by binding and inhibiting PUB21 activity. A 14–amino acid peptide, APP3-14, molecularly controlled HLB in greenhouse and field trials. This approach represents a strategy to combat uncultivable pathogens through targeted disease resistance protein stabilization.",

Demonstrated features include half-quantized Chern numbers on each surface that resembles a fractional Chern insulator, unidirectional chiral hinge states forming topological transport in three dimensions, and arithmetic operations between fractional and integer Chern numbers. Our work experimentally establishes the axion insulator as a three-dimensional topological phase of matter and enables chiral states to form complex, unidirectional three-dimensional networks through braiding.",

Their designs rely on continuous networks of members to control the global mechanical behavior of the bulk. In this study, we introduce a class of materials that consist of discrete concatenated rings or cage particles interlocked in three-dimensional networks, forming polycatenated architected materials (PAMs). We propose a general design framework that translates arbitrary crystalline networks into particle concatenations and geometries. In response to small external loads, PAMs behave like non-Newtonian fluids, showing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening responses, which can be controlled by their catenation topologies. At larger strains, PAMs behave like lattices and foams, with a nonlinear stress-strain relation. At microscale, we demonstrate that PAMs can change their shapes in response to applied electrostatic charges. The distinctive properties of PAMs pave the path for developing stimuli-responsive materials, energy-absorbing systems, and morphing architectures.",

Additionally, intestinal ILC2s were found in the pancreas, which was dependent on their expression of the adrenergic beta 2 receptor. Targeted activation of catecholaminergic intestinal neurons promoted the accumulation of ILC2s in the pancreas. Our work provides evidence that immune cells can be regulated by neuronal signals in response to fasting, activating an inter-organ communication route that promotes pancreatic endocrine function and regulation of blood glucose levels.",

We report that mice exhibit stereotypic behaviors toward unconscious or dead social partners, which escalate from sniffing and grooming to more forceful actions such as mouth or tongue biting and tongue pulling. The latter intense actions, more prominent in familiar pairs, begin after prolonged immobility and unresponsiveness and cease when the partner regains activity. Their consequences, including improved airway opening and clearance and accelerated recovery from unconsciousness, suggest rescue-like efforts. Oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus respond differentially to the presence of unconscious versus active partners, and their activation, along with oxytocin signaling, is required for the reviving-like actions. This tendency to assist unresponsive members may enhance group cohesion and survival of social species.",

Using high-speed x-ray imaging, we demonstrate that the flow vortex–induced protrusion on the rear keyhole wall is crucial in initiating keyhole instability. Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect–induced Lorentz force’s direction. We show that at LPBF length scales, electromagnetic damping is weak, and for alloys with a large Seebeck coefficient, TEMHD becomes the dominant mechanism controlling flow behind the keyhole.",

In this work, we describe the hijacking of plant phosphate sensing by a conserved family of Nudix hydrolase effectors from pathogenic Magnaporthe and Colletotrichum fungi. Structural and enzymatic analyses of the Nudix effector family demonstrate that they selectively hydrolyze PP-InsP. Gene deletion experiments of Nudix effectors in Magnaporthe oryzae , Colletotrichum higginsianum , and Colletotrichum graminicola indicate that PP-InsP hydrolysis substantially enhances disease symptoms in diverse pathosystems. Further, we show that this conserved effector family induces phosphate starvation signaling in plants.

This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise (~4.4 millimeters) and Earth’s pole shift (~45 centimeters). Precipitation deficits and stable evapotranspiration likely caused this decline, and SM has not recovered as of 2021, with future recovery unlikely under present climate conditions.",

    "abstract": "Conventionally, the size, shape, and biomechanics of cartilages are determined by their voluminous extracellular matrix. By contrast, we found that multiple murine cartilages consist of lipid-filled cells called lipochondrocytes. Despite resembling adipocytes, lipochondrocytes were molecularly distinct and produced lipids exclusively through de novo lipogenesis. Consequently, lipochondrocytes grew uniform lipid droplets that resisted systemic lipid surges and did not enlarge upon obesity. Lipochondrocytes also lacked lipid mobilization factors, which enabled exceptional vacuole stability and protected cartilage from shrinking upon starvation. Lipid droplets modulated lipocartilage biomechanics by decreasing the tissue’s stiffness, strength, and resilience. Lipochondrocytes were found in multiple mammals, including humans, but not in nonmammalian tetrapods. Thus, analogous to bubble wrap, superstable lipid vacuoles confer skeletal tissue with cartilage-like properties without “packing foam–like” extracellular matrix.",

    "abstract": "Commercial adhesives are petroleum-based thermoset networks or nonbiodegradable thermoplastic hot melts, making them ideal targets for replacement by biodegradable alternatives. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) is a biorenewable and biodegradable alternative to conventional plastics, but microbial P3HB, which has a stereoperfect stereomicrostructure, exhibits no adhesion. In this study, by elucidating the fundamental relationship between chemocatalytically engineered P3HB stereomicrostructures and adhesion properties, we found that biodegradable syndio-rich P3HB exhibits high adhesion strength and outperforms common commercial adhesives, whereas syndiotactic, isotactic, or iso-rich P3HB shows no measurable adhesion. The syndio-rich stereomicrostructure brings about desired thermomechanical and viscoelastic properties of P3HB that enable strong adhesion to a range of substrates tested, including aluminum, steel, glass, and wood, and its performance is insensitive to molar mass and reprocessing or reuse.",

However, ICMS currently provides an imperfect sense of touch, limiting manual dexterity and tactile experience. Leveraging our understanding of how tactile features are encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we sought to inform individuals with paralysis about local geometry and apparent motion of objects on their skin. We simultaneously delivered ICMS through electrodes with spatially patterned projected fields (PFs), evoking sensations of edges. We then created complex PFs that encode arbitrary tactile shapes and skin indentation patterns. By delivering spatiotemporally patterned ICMS, we evoked sensation of motion across the skin, the speed and direction of which could be controlled. Thus, we improved individuals’ tactile experience and use of brain-controlled bionic hands.",

Despite the substantial advances in olefin metathesis and ozonolysis for natural product synthesis through C=C double-bond cleavage, the catalytic remodeling of complex molecules through C=C double-bond deconstruction has been underdeveloped. We report a heterogeneous copper-catalyzed C=C double-bond cleavage, which enables the remodeling of complex molecules by converting the carbons on either side of the C=C double bond to carbonyl and cyano groups, respectively. In particular, this method provides an efficient protocol to conveniently transform terpenoids, glycals, steroids, and bioactive molecules to privileged scaffolds with underexplored chemical space.",

    "abstract": "Myostatin is a paracrine myokine that regulates muscle mass in a variety of species, including humans. In this work, we report a functional role for myostatin as an endocrine hormone that directly promotes pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and thereby ovarian function in mice. Previously, this FSH-stimulating role was attributed to other members of the transforming growth factor–β family, the activins. Our results both challenge activin’s eponymous role in FSH synthesis and establish an unexpected endocrine axis between skeletal muscle and the pituitary gland. Our data also suggest that efforts to antagonize myostatin to increase muscle mass may have unintended consequences on fertility.",

    "abstract": "Vascular inflammation regulates endothelial pathophenotypes, particularly in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Dysregulated lysosomal activity and cholesterol metabolism activate pathogenic inflammation, but their relevance to PAH is unclear. Nuclear receptor coactivator 7 ( NCOA7 ) deficiency in endothelium produced an oxysterol and bile acid signature through lysosomal dysregulation, promoting endothelial pathophenotypes. This oxysterol signature overlapped with a plasma metabolite signature associated with human PAH mortality. Mice deficient for endothelial Ncoa7 or exposed to an inflammatory bile acid developed worsened PAH. Genetic predisposition to NCOA7 deficiency was driven by single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11154337, which alters endothelial immunoactivation and is associated with human PAH mortality. An NCOA7-activating agent reversed endothelial immunoactivation and rodent PAH. Thus, we established a genetic and metabolic paradigm that links lysosomal biology and oxysterol processes to endothelial inflammation and PAH.",

We describe a bacterial immune system comprising both a caspase-like protease and a TIR-domain protein. We found that the TIR protein, once it recognizes phage invasion, produces the previously unknown immune signaling molecule adenosine 5′-diphosphate-cyclo[N7:1′′]-ribose (N7-cADPR). This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease, which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation. Our study highlights the diversity of TIR-produced immune signaling molecules and demonstrates that cell death regulated by proteases of the caspase family is an ancient mechanism of innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Kidney dysfunction is a major cause of mortality, but its genetic architecture remains elusive. In this study, we conducted a multiancestry genome-wide association study in 2.2 million individuals and identified 1026 (97 previously unknown) independent loci. Ancestry-specific analysis indicated an attenuation of newly identified signals on common variants in European ancestry populations and the power of population diversity for further discoveries. We defined genotype effects on allele-specific gene expression and regulatory circuitries in more than 700 human kidneys and 237,000 cells. We found 1363 coding variants disrupting 782 genes, with 601 genes also targeted by regulatory variants and convergence in 161 genes. Integrating 32 types of genetic information, we present the “Kidney Disease Genetic Scorecard” for prioritizing potentially causal genes, cell types, and druggable targets for kidney disease.",

Conformational ensembles built from 1231 structures of 17 serine proteases revealed atomic-level changes across their reaction states. By comparing the enzymatic and solution reaction, we identified molecular features that provide catalysis and quantified their energetic contributions to catalysis. Serine proteases precisely position their reactants in destabilized conformers, creating a downhill energetic gradient that selectively favors the motions required for reaction while limiting off-pathway conformational states. The same catalytic features have repeatedly evolved in proteases and additional enzymes across multiple distinct structural folds. Our ensemble-function analyses revealed previously unknown catalytic features, provided quantitative models based on simple physical and chemical principles, and identified motifs recurrent in nature that may inspire enzyme design.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis is crucial for health, with dysregulation leading to metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). This study identifies alkylation repair homolog protein 5 (ALKBH5), an RNA N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) demethylase, as a major regulator in metabolic disease. ALKBH5 is up-regulated in the liver during obesity and also phosphorylated by protein kinase A, causing its translocation to the cytosol. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Alkbh5 reduces glucose and lipids by inhibiting the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathways. Targeted knockdown of hepatic Alkbh5 reverses T2DM and MAFLD in diabetic mice, highlighting its therapeutic potential. This study unveils a regulatory mechanism wherein ALKBH5 orchestrates glucose and lipid homeostasis by integrating the GCGR and mTORC1 pathways, providing insight into the regulation of metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Whether a gut-joint axis exists to regulate osteoarthritis is unknown. In two independent cohorts, we identified altered microbial bile acid metabolism with reduced glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) in osteoarthritis. Suppressing farnesoid X receptor (FXR)—the receptor of GUDCA—alleviated osteoarthritis through intestine-secreted glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in mice. GLP-1 receptor blockade attenuated these effects, whereas GLP-1 receptor activation mitigated osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis patients exhibited a lower relative abundance of Clostridium bolteae , which promoted the formation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a precursor of GUDCA. Treatment with C. bolteae and Food and Drug Administration–approved UDCA alleviated osteoarthritis through the gut FXR–joint GLP-1 axis in mice. UDCA use was associated with lower risk of osteoarthritis-related joint replacement in humans. These findings suggest that orchestrating the gut microbiota–GUDCA–intestinal FXR–GLP-1–joint pathway offers a potential strategy for osteoarthritis treatment.",

Although genomic evidence suggests their widespread distribution throughout eastern Asia and possibly Oceania, so far only a few fossils from the Altai and Tibet are confidently identified molecularly as Denisovan. We identified a hominin mandible (Penghu 1) from Taiwan (10,000 to 70,000 years ago or 130,000 to 190,000 years ago) as belonging to a male Denisovan by applying ancient protein analysis. We retrieved 4241 amino acid residues and identified two Denisovan-specific variants. The increased fossil sample of Denisovans demonstrates their wider distribution, including warm and humid regions, as well as their shared distinct robust dentognathic traits that markedly contrast with their sister group, Neanderthals.",

    "abstract": "Cachexia, a severe wasting syndrome associated with inflammatory conditions, often leads to multiorgan failure and death. Patients with cachexia experience extreme fatigue, apathy, and clinical depression, yet the biological mechanisms underlying these behavioral symptoms and their relationship to the disease remain unclear. In a mouse cancer model, cachexia specifically induced increased effort-sensitivity, apathy-like symptoms through a cytokine-sensing brainstem-to-basal ganglia circuit. This neural circuit detects elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) at cachexia onset and translates inflammatory signals into decreased mesolimbic dopamine, thereby increasing effort sensitivity. We alleviated these apathy-like symptoms by targeting key circuit nodes: administering an anti–IL-6 antibody treatment, ablating cytokine sensing in the brainstem, and optogenetically or pharmacologically boosting mesolimbic dopamine. Our findings uncovered a central neural circuit that senses systemic inflammation and orchestrates behavioral changes, providing mechanistic insights into the connection between chronic inflammation and depressive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Ancient Mars had surface liquid water and a dense carbon dioxide (CO 2 )–rich atmosphere. Such an atmosphere would interact with crustal rocks, potentially leaving a mineralogical record of its presence. We analyzed the composition of an 89-meter stratigraphic section of Gale crater, Mars, using data collected by the Curiosity rover. An iron carbonate mineral, siderite, occurs in abundances of 4.8 to 10.5 weight %, colocated with highly water-soluble salts. We infer that the siderite formed in water-limited conditions, driven by water-rock reactions and evaporation. Comparison with orbital data indicates that similar strata (deposited globally) sequestered the equivalent of 2.6 to 36 millibar of atmospheric CO 2 . The presence of iron oxyhydroxides in these deposits indicates that a partially closed carbon cycle on ancient Mars returned some previously sequestered CO 2 to the atmosphere.",

However, these batteries face short-circuit challenges caused by uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth during cycling. Using operando scanning electron microscopy and phase-field simulations, we determined that failure of SSBs is closely linked to the fatigue of the lithium metal anode, which markedly contributes to interface degradation and dendrite growth in SSBs. This fatigue follows the Coffin-Manson equation in mechanics, indicating that it is an innate characteristic. Clarifying the essential role of fatigue provides a physical basis for understanding failures of SSBs and paves the way to extending their lifespan.",

Here, we report a grafted superstructure, MOF@POM, formed by self-assembling a metal-organic framework (MOF) with polyoxometalate (POM). In situ electrochemical transformation converts MOF into active metal (oxy)hydroxides to produce a catalyst with a low overpotential of 178 millivolts at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. An anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer incorporating this catalyst achieves 3 amperes per square centimeter at 1.78 volts at 80°C and stable operation at 2 amperes per square centimeter for 5140 hours at room temperature. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that the synergistic interactions between metal atoms create a fast electron-transfer channel from catalytic iron and cobalt sites, nickel, and tungsten in the polyoxometalate to the electrode, stabilizing the metal sites and preventing dissolution.",

Lineage tracing in mice revealed that adipose progenitor cells (APCs) in visceral fat undergo extensive adipogenesis during middle age. Thus, despite the low turnover rate of adipocytes in young adults, adipogenesis is unlocked during middle age. Transplantations quantitatively showed that APCs in middle-aged mice exhibited high adipogenic capacity cell-autonomously. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified a distinct APC population, the committed preadipocyte, age-enriched (CP-A), emerging at this age. CP-As demonstrated elevated proliferation and adipogenesis activity. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations indicated that leukemia inhibitory factor receptor signaling was indispensable for CP-A adipogenesis and visceral fat expansion. These findings uncover a fundamental mechanism of age-dependent adipose remodeling, offering critical insights into age-related metabolic diseases.",

Here, we show that NE remodeling of synaptic function is completely independent from its binding on neuronal receptors. Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses. Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–derived and A1 adenosine receptor–mediated control of presynaptic efficacy. These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of degradation and deforestation on tropical forests are poorly understood, particularly at landscape scales. We present an extensive ecosystem analysis of the impacts of logging and conversion of tropical forest to oil palm from a large-scale study in Borneo, synthesizing responses from 82 variables categorized into four ecological levels spanning a broad suite of ecosystem properties: (i) structure and environment, (ii) species traits, (iii) biodiversity, and (iv) ecosystem functions. Responses were highly heterogeneous and often complex and nonlinear. Variables that were directly impacted by the physical process of timber extraction, such as soil structure, were sensitive to even moderate amounts of logging, whereas measures of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning were generally resilient to logging but more affected by conversion to oil palm plantation.",

Canonical SLs act as signals to microbes and plants, whereas noncanonical SLs are primarily plant hormones. The cytochrome P450 CYP722C catalyzes a critical step, converting CLA to canonical SLs in most angiosperms. Using synthetic biology, we investigated the function of CYP722A , an evolutionary predecessor of CYP722C . CYP722A converts CLA into 16-hydroxy-CLA (16-OH-CLA), a noncanonical SL detected exclusively in the shoots of various flowering plants. 16-OH-CLA application restores control of shoot branching to SL-deficient mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana and is perceived by the SL signaling pathway. We hypothesize that biosynthesis of 16-OH-CLA by CYP722A was a metabolic stepping stone in the evolution of canonical SLs that mediate rhizospheric signaling in many flowering plants.",

We show that differences in circulating androgens between the three male mating morphs in ruff sandpipers are linked to 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (HSD17B2), encoded by a gene within the supergene that determines the morphs. Low-testosterone males had higher HSD17B2 expression in blood than high-testosterone males, as well as in brain areas related to social behaviors and testosterone production. Derived HSD17B2 isozymes, which are absent in high-testosterone males but preferentially expressed in low-testosterone males, converted testosterone to androstenedione faster than the ancestral isozyme. Thus, a combination of evolutionary changes in regulation, sequence, and structure of a single gene introduces endocrine variation underlying reproductive phenotypes.",

However, the mechanisms through which scratching exacerbates inflammation and whether scratching provides benefit to the host are largely unknown. We found that scratching was required for skin inflammation in mouse models dependent on FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation. Scratching-induced inflammation required pain-sensing nociceptors, the neuropeptide substance P, and the mast cell receptor MrgprB2. Scratching also increased cutaneous inflammation and augmented host defense to superficial Staphylococcus aureus infection. Thus, through the activation of nociceptor-driven neuroinflammation, scratching both exacerbated allergic skin disease and provided protection from S. aureus , reconciling the seemingly paradoxical role of scratching as a pathological process and evolutionary adaptation.",

Spatial differences in soil moisture are perceived by root tips, leading to the patterning of new root branches toward available water in a process called hydropatterning. Little is known about hydropatterning behavior and its genetic basis in crop plants. Here, we developed an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and revealed substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection. Genetic analysis of hydropatterning confirmed the regulatory role of auxin and revealed that the gaseous hormone ethylene locally inhibits root branching from air-exposed tissues. Our results demonstrate how distinct signaling pathways translate spatial patterns of water availability to developmental programs that determine root architecture.",

We elucidated a structural pathway of enzyme activation through cryo-EM analysis of PI3KC3-C1. The inactive conformation of the VPS15 pseudokinase stabilizes the inactive conformation, sequestering its N -myristate in the N-lobe of the pseudokinase. Upon activation, the myristate is liberated such that the VPS34 lipid kinase catalyzes PI3P production on membranes. The VPS15 pseudokinase domain binds tightly to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and stabilizes a web of interactions to autoinhibit the cytosolic complex and to promote the activation upon membrane binding. These findings show in atomistic detail how the VPS34 lipid kinase is activated in the context of a complete PI3K complex.",

However, it is difficult to generate uniform subnanometer pores over large areas on 2D materials. We report that the well-defined eight-membered ring (8-MR) pores, typically formed at the boundaries of two antiparallel grains of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), can serve as molecular sieves for efficient water-ion separation. The density of grain boundaries and, consequently, the number of 8-MR pores can be tuned by regulating the grain size. Optimized MoS 2 membranes outperformed the state-of-the-art membranes in forward osmosis tests by demonstrating both ultrahigh water/sodium chloride selectivity and exceptional water permeance. Creating precise pore structures on atomically thin films through grain boundary engineering presents a promising route for producing membranes suitable for various applications.",

Whereas cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. In this study, we reveal a bacterial antiphage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine triphosphates (dITPs) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates a downstream effector to mediate depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form), resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular deoxyadenosine monophosphate, the precursor of dITP messengers. Our findings uncover a nucleobase modification–based antiphage signaling pathway, establishing noncanonical nucleotides as a new type of immune messengers in bacteria.",

The Chang’e-6 mission retrieved samples from the South Pole–Aitken basin (SPA) on the Moon’s far side. We analyzed basalt fragments collected by Chang’e-6 and found that their composition resembles that of low-titanium basalts previously sampled by the Apollo missions. Uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating indicated a basalt age of 2823.0 ± 5.9 million years and a source 238 U/ 204 Pb ratio (μ-value) of 480 ± 56. This high μ-value indicates that the source contained materials that formed during the late stages of lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization. The results are consistent with the LMO model, but the Chang’e-6 basalt deviates from the trend in Apollo mission samples of younger basalts having higher μ-values. We suggest that this indicates post-LMO modification of the mantle by the SPA impact.",

Through iterative structural and sequence homology-based mining starting with a guide RNA-interaction domain of Cas9, we identified a family of RNA-guided DNA-targeting proteins in phage and parasitic bacteria. Each system consists of a tandem interspaced guide RNA (TIGR) array and a TIGR-associated (Tas) protein containing a nucleolar protein (Nop) domain, sometimes fused to HNH (TasH)– or RuvC (TasR)–nuclease domains. We show that TIGR arrays are processed into 36-nucleotide RNAs (tigRNAs) that direct sequence-specific DNA binding through a tandem-spacer targeting mechanism. TasR can be reprogrammed for precise DNA cleavage, including in human cells. The structure of TasR reveals striking similarities to box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins and IS110 RNA-guided transposases, providing insights into the evolution of diverse RNA-guided systems.",

Familiar molluscan groups—gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods—each represent a diverse radiation with myriad morphological, ecological, and behavioral adaptations. The phylum further encompasses many more unfamiliar experiments in animal body-plan evolution. In this work, we reconstructed the phylogeny for living Mollusca on the basis of metazoan BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) genes extracted from 77 (13 new) genomes, including multiple members of all eight classes with two high-quality genome assemblies for monoplacophorans. Our analyses confirm a phylogeny proposed from morphology and show widespread genomic variation.

Here we show, through field, lab, and virtual reality experimentation, that classical models of collective behavior cannot account for how collective motion emerges in marching desert locusts, whose swarms affect the livelihood of millions. In contrast to assumptions made by these models, locusts do not explicitly align with neighbors. While individuals respond to moving-dot stimuli through the optomotor response, this innate behavior does not mediate social response to neighbors. Instead, locust marching behavior, across scales, can be explained by a minimal cognitive framework, which incorporates individuals’ neural representation of bearings to neighbors and internal consensus dynamics for making directional choices. Our findings challenge long-held beliefs about how order can emerge from disorder in animal collectives.",

FABP5 directly bound to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) to enhance formation of functional mTORC1 and substrate binding, ultimately converging on increased mTOR signaling and proliferation. The amounts of FABP5 protein were increased in tumors and serum from triple-negative compared with those from receptor-positive breast cancer patients, which highlights its potential role as a biomarker that mediates cellular responses to ω-6 LA intake in this disease subtype.",

We determined a 3.1-angstrom resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of dimeric human PINK1 stabilized at an endogenous array of mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) complexes. Symmetric arrangement of two TOM core complexes around a central VDAC2 dimer is facilitated by TOM5 and TOM20, both of which also bind PINK1 kinase C-lobes. PINK1 enters mitochondria through the proximal TOM40 barrel of the TOM core complex, guided by TOM7 and TOM22. Our structure explains how human PINK1 is stabilized at the TOM complex and regulated by oxidation, uncovers a previously unknown TOM-VDAC assembly, and reveals how a physiological substrate traverses TOM40 during translocation.",

We found that TAT assembled into helices with a pitch of six molecules, associating angular momentum to the valence and conduction bands and obtaining the observed CPL. Cosublimation of TAT as the “guest” in a structurally mismatched “host” enabled fabrication of thin films in which chiral crystallization was achieved in situ by thermally triggered nanophase segregation of dopant and host while preserving film integrity.

However, its distribution across different pools, live or dead biomass and soil and sedimentary organic carbon, remains uncertain. Analyzing global observational datasets of changes in terrestrial carbon pools, we found that ≈35 ± 14 gigatons of carbon (GtC) have been sequestered on land between 1992 and 2019, whereas live biomass changed by ≈1 ± 7 GtC. Global vegetation models instead imply that sequestration has been mostly in live biomass. We identify key processes not included in most models that can explain this discrepancy. Most terrestrial carbon gains are sequestered as nonliving matter and thus are more persistent than previously appreciated, with a substantial fraction linked to human activities such as river damming, wood harvest, and garbage disposal in landfills.",

We found that regulatory T cells (T reg cells) could inhibit nociception through a mechanism that was not dependent on their ability to regulate immune activation and tissue repair. Site-specific depletion or expansion of meningeal T reg cells (mT reg cells) in mice led to female-specific and sex hormone–dependent modulation of mechanical sensitivity. Specifically, mT reg cells produced the endogenous opioid enkephalin that exerted an antinociceptive action through the delta opioid receptor expressed by MrgprD + sensory neurons. Although enkephalin restrains nociceptive processing, it was dispensable for T reg cell–mediated immunosuppression. Thus, our findings uncovered a sexually dimorphic immunological circuit that restrains nociception, establishing T reg cells as sentinels of pain homeostasis.",

Central to such modeling is Glen’s flow law, in which strain rate depends on stress raised to a power of n = 3 to 4. In sharp contrast to this nonlinearity, we found by conducting large-scale, shear-deformation experiments that temperate ice is linear-viscous ( n ≈ 1.0) over common ranges of liquid water content and stress expected near glacier beds and in ice-stream margins. This linearity is likely caused by diffusive pressure melting and refreezing at grain boundaries and could help to stabilize modeled responses of ice sheets to shrinkage-induced stress increases.",

In this work, we developed a neurobehavioral platform to enable wireless recording of the same premotor neurons in both RCs and FMCs. Neurons often encoded the same hand and mouth actions differently in RCs and FMCs. Furthermore, in FMCs, we identified cells that selectively encoded actions untestable during RCs and others that displayed mixed selectivity for multiple actions, which is compatible with an organization based on cortical motor synergies at different levels of complexity. Cross-context decoding demonstrated that neural activity in FMCs is richer and more generalizable than in RCs, which suggests that neuroethological approaches are better suited to unveil the neural bases of behavior.",

Here, we show that chirality of either handedness can be induced in the nonchiral piezoelectric material boron phosphate (BPO 4 ) by irradiation with terahertz pulses. Resonant excitation of either one of two orthogonal, degenerate vibrational modes determines the sign of the induced chiral order parameter. The optical activity of the photo-induced phases is comparable to the static value of prototypical chiral α-quartz. Our findings offer new prospects for the control of out-of-equilibrium quantum phenomena in complex materials.",

In-flight, most hippocampal place cells were socially modulated and represented the identity and sex of conspecifics. Upon social interactions, neurons represented specific interaction types. During active observation, neurons encoded the bat’s own position and head direction, together with the position, direction, and identity of multiple conspecifics. Identity-coding neurons encoded the same bat across contexts. The strength of identity coding was modulated by sex, hierarchy, and social affiliation. Thus, hippocampal neurons form a multidimensional sociospatial representation of the natural world.",

Unlike CODH, the multidomain ACS undergoes large conformational changes to form an internal connection to the CODH active site, accommodate the CoFeSP for methyl transfer, and protect the reaction intermediates. Altogether, the structures allow us to draw a detailed reaction mechanism of this enzyme, which is crucial for CO 2 fixation in anaerobic organisms.",

This accomplishment was a precursor to an unprecedented burgeoning of large language models (LLMs) in the life sciences. That was just the beginning. In recent months, we have moved into a hyperaccelerated phase of new foundation models , pretrained on massive datasets, with the ability to perform a wide range of tasks that are helping us understand the structure, biology, evolution, and design of proteins, RNA, DNA, and ligands, as well as their biomolecular interactions. Unlike multimodal LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude, which process text, audio, and images, these large language of life models (LLLMs) are multiomic. That is to say, they are not only multimodal but pertain to different layers of molecular biology. For example, Evo , a foundation model trained on 2.7 million diverse phage and prokaryotic genomes (equivalent to about 300 billion DNA nucleotides), predicts the impact of variants in DNA, RNA, or proteins on structure and function, as well as how essential genes are to cell function, and can generate new DNA sequences.",

However, only with a whole Y chromosome assembly can candidate genes be validated experimentally and their locations determined and related to the suppression of recombination.

In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.",

We demonstrate global RNAPII elevations in mouse gliomas and assorted human tumors in small clinical samples and discover regional elevations corresponding to de novo HER2 amplifications punctuated by likely selective sweeps. RNAPII occupancy at S-phase-dependent histone genes correlated with WHO grade in meningiomas, accurately predicted rapid recurrence, and corresponded to whole-arm chromosome losses.

In this study, we demonstrated that mice exhibit rescue-like social behaviors toward unresponsive conspecifics, characterized by intense physical contact and grooming directed at the recipient’s facial and mouth areas, which expedite their recovery from unresponsiveness. We identified the medial amygdala (MeA) as a key region that encodes the unresponsive state of others and drives this head-directed physical contact. Notably, the behavioral responses toward unresponsive conspecifics differed from those directed at awake, stressed individuals, and these responses were differentially represented in the MeA. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying prosocial responses toward unresponsive individuals.",

We report that nonconvex, dumbbell-shaped nanocrystals (nanodumbbells) exhibit globally interlocking self-assembly behaviors governed by curvature-guided depletion interactions. By tailoring the local curvature of nanodumbbells, we can precisely and flexibly adjust particle bonding directionality, a level of control rarely achievable with conventional convex building blocks. These nanodumbbells can undergo long-range ordered assembly into various intricate two-dimensional superlattices, including the chiral Kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Kagome lattice is a thermodynamically stable phase, with depletion interactions playing a crucial role in stabilizing these non–close-packed structures. The emergence of Kagome lattices and other unusual structures highlights the vast potential of nonconvex nanocrystals for creating sophisticated architectures.",

We circumvent this problem by focusing on the morphology of deglaciation and inception, which we show depends strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity. We demonstrate that although both parameters are important, precession has more influence on deglacial onset, whereas obliquity is more important for the attainment of peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. We find that the set of precession peaks (minima) responsible for terminations since 0.9 million years ago is a subset of those peaks that begin (i.e., the precession parameter starts decreasing) while obliquity is increasing. Specifically, termination occurs with the first of these candidate peaks to occur after each eccentricity minimum. Thus, the gross morphology of 100-thousand-year (100-kyr) glacial cycles appears largely deterministic.",

This method enables the spring index to be varied along a muscle’s length by varying the plying twist, resulting in muscles that transition between homochiral and heterochiral when either heated or cooled. We demonstrate use of these polymer muscles for robots and environmentally driven comfort-adjusting jackets. This mandrel-free method was used to make high-spring-index carbon nanotube yarns for mechanical energy harvesters, self-powered strain sensors, and solvent-driven and electrochemically driven artificial muscles.",

These conclusions are supported by comparisons of model parameters with independent functional genomic data. By decomposing mutational and selective influences on mRNA-protein dynamics, our approach provides a framework for discovering the evolutionary rules that drive divergence in gene expression.",

In this study, we used cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures from four RNA families, including ARRPOF and OLE forming dimers and ROOL and GOLLD forming hexameric, octameric, and dodecameric nanostructures, at 2.6- to 4.6-angstrom resolutions. These homo-oligomeric assemblies reveal a plethora of structural motifs that contribute to RNA multivalency, including kissing-loop, palindromic base-pairing, A-stacking, metal ion coordination, pseudoknot, and minor-groove interactions. These results provide the molecular basis of intermolecular interactions driving RNA multivalency with potential functional relevance.",

Using laboratory- and field-based experiments across multiple years in Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ; n = 730), we show that the globally detected anxiolytic pollutant clobazam accumulates in the brain of exposed fish and influences river-to-sea migration success. Clobazam exposure increased the speed with which fish passed through two hydropower dams along their migration route, resulting in more clobazam-exposed fish reaching the sea compared with controls. We argue that such effects may arise from altered shoaling behavior in fish exposed to clobazam. Drug-induced behavioral changes are expected to have wide-ranging consequences for the ecology and evolution of wild populations.",

First, condensin disassembles interphase chromatin loop organization by evicting or displacing extrusive cohesin. Second, condensin bypasses cohesive cohesins, thereby maintaining sister chromatid cohesion as sisters separate. Studies of mitotic chromosomes formed by cohesin, condensin II, and condensin I alone or in combination lead to refined models of mitotic chromosome conformation. In these models, loops are consecutive and not overlapping, implying that condensins stall upon encountering each other. The dynamics of Hi-C interactions and chromosome morphology reveal that during prophase, loops are extruded in vivo at ∼1 to 3 kilobases per second by condensins as they form a disordered discontinuous helical scaffold within individual chromatids.",

However, these chemically specific dynamic interactions are difficult to predict. In this study, we repurposed the chemical physics developed originally for molecular simulations to predict this chemical specificity between IDRs and partner proteins using protein sequence as the only input. Our approach—FINCHES—enables the direct prediction of phase diagrams, the identification of chemically specific interaction hotspots on IDRs, the decomposition of chemically distinct domains in IDRs, and a route to develop and test mechanistic hypotheses regarding IDR function in molecular recognition.",

Genomes from Central Türkiye ~8000 BCE are genetically proximal to the domestic origins of sheep but do not fully explain the ancestry of later populations, suggesting a mosaic of wild ancestries. Genomic signatures indicate selection by ancient herders for pigmentation patterns, hornedness, and growth rate. Although the first European sheep flocks derive from Türkiye, in a notable parallel with ancient human genome discoveries, we detected a major influx of Western steppe–related ancestry in the Bronze Age.",

To address this gap, we applied CRISPR prime editing to insert recombination handles into repetitive sequences, up to 1697 per cell line, which enables generating large-scale deletions, inversions, translocations, and circular DNA. Recombinase induction produced more than 100 stochastic megabase-sized rearrangements in each cell. We tracked these rearrangements over time to measure selection pressures, finding a preference for shorter variants that avoided essential genes. We characterized 29 clones with multiple rearrangements, finding an impact of deletions on expression of genes in the variant but not on nearby genes. This genome-scrambling strategy enables large deletions, sequence relocations, and the insertion of regulatory elements to explore genome dispensability and organization.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial damage is a hallmark of metabolic diseases, including diabetes, yet the consequences of compromised mitochondria in metabolic tissues are often unclear. In this work, we report that dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control engages a retrograde (mitonuclear) signaling program that impairs cellular identity and maturity in β cells, hepatocytes, and brown adipocytes. Targeted deficiency throughout the mitochondrial quality control pathway, including genome integrity, dynamics, or turnover, impaired the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, activating the mitochondrial integrated stress response, eliciting chromatin remodeling, and promoting cellular immaturity rather than apoptosis to yield metabolic dysfunction. Pharmacologic blockade of the integrated stress response in vivo restored β cell identity after the loss of mitochondrial quality control. Targeting mitochondrial retrograde signaling may therefore be promising in the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders.",

Insulin’s actions go beyond metabolic cells and also involve blood vessels, where insulin increases capillary blood flow and delivery of insulin and nutrients. We show that adrenomedullin, whose plasma levels are increased in obese humans and mice, inhibited insulin signaling in human endothelial cells through protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B–mediated dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. In obese mice lacking the endothelial adrenomedullin receptor, insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide–synthase activation and skeletal muscle perfusion were increased. Treating mice with adrenomedullin mimicked the effect of obesity and induced endothelial and systemic insulin resistance. Endothelial loss or blockade of the adrenomedullin receptor improved obesity-induced insulin resistance. These findings identify a mechanism underlying obesity-induced systemic insulin resistance and suggest approaches to treat obesity-associated type 2 diabetes.",

However, the dioecious plant Silene latifolia has a giant ~550-megabase Y chromosome, which has remained unsequenced so far. We used a long- and short-read hybrid approach to obtain a high-quality male genome. Comparative analysis of the sex chromosomes with their homologs in outgroups showed that the Y is highly rearranged and degenerated. Recombination suppression between X and Y extended in several steps and triggered a massive accumulation of repeats on the Y as well as in the nonrecombining pericentromeric region of the X, leading to giant sex chromosomes. Using sex phenotype mutants, we identified candidate sex-determining genes on the Y in locations consistent with their favoring recombination suppression events 11 and 5 million years ago.",

Animals can adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions, but the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We found that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning; instead, the learned behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over escape responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses.",

The fate of collective charge excitations, or plasmons, in these systems is a subject of debate. Several studies have suggested that plasmons are overdamped, whereas other studies have detected propagating plasmons. In this work, we present direct nano-optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl 2 . HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl 2 . Photoemission data presented here reveal a highly anisotropic Fermi surface, reconstructed and made partly incoherent, likely through electronic interactions as explained by many-body theory. HPPs remain long-lived despite this, revealing previously unseen imprints of many-body effects on plasmonic collective modes.",

We therefore scrutinized its cellular composition and evolution using cell type atlases from chicken, mouse, and nonavian reptiles. We found that the avian pallium shares most inhibitory neuron types with other amniotes. Whereas excitatory neuron types in amniote hippocampal regions show evolutionary conservation, those in other pallial regions have diverged. Neurons in the avian mesopallium display gene expression profiles akin to the mammalian claustrum and deep cortical layers, while certain nidopallial cell types resemble neurons in the piriform cortex. Lastly, we observed substantial gene expression convergence between the dorsally located hyperpallium and ventrally located nidopallium during late development, suggesting that topological location does not always dictate gene expression programs determining functional properties in the adult avian pallium.",

However, the idea that mutation can become biased toward adaptive outcomes remains controversial. In this work, we report the evolution of enhanced evolvability through localized hypermutation in experimental populations of bacteria. The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change. Lineages with localized hypermutability were more likely to acquire additional adaptive mutations, revealing an unanticipated benefit.",

PIFA, a commercially available and inexpensive hypervalent iodine reagent, is key to this reactivity. Our mechanistic proposal is supported by chemical trapping experiments, which concomitantly demonstrate the utility of our method to access valuable N -heterocycles.

These maps provide improved extinction corrections for astronomical observations. We find that R ( V ) varies with extinction, consistent with dust grains growing by accretion in low-extinction regions and by coagulation in higher-extinction regions. Star-forming regions have high R ( V ) values, indicating either preferential destruction of small dust grains or additional supply of large dust grains in those regions.",

In the extension zone, we found that ice exhibits anisotropic properties. We constructed ice shelf–wide anisotropic viscosity maps that capture the suture zones, which inhibit rift propagation. The inferred stress exponent near the grounding zone dictates the grounding-line ice flux and grounding line stability, whereas the inferred viscosity maps inform the prediction of rifts.

Respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a respirasome supercomplex, from which we determined a native 5-angstrom (Å) resolution structure showing binding of electron carrier cytochrome c . Combined with single-particle cryo–electron microscopy at 2.4-Å resolution, we model how the respiratory complexes organize inside native mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Tandem kinase proteins underlie the innate immune systems of cereal plants, but how they initiate plant immune responses remains unclear. This report identifies wheat protein wheat tandem NBD 1 (WTN1), a noncanonical nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor featuring tandem nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, plant R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC) domains, required for WTK3-mediated disease resistance. Both WTK3 and its allelic variant Rwt4—known for conferring resistance to wheat powdery mildew and blast, respectively—are capable of recognizing the blast effector PWT4. They activate WTN1 to form calcium-permeable channels, akin to ZAR1 and Sr35. Thus, tandem kinase proteins and their associated NLRs operate as “sensor-executor” pairs against fungal pathogens. Additionally, evolutionary analyses reveal a coevolutionary trajectory of the tandem kinase-NLR module, highlighting their cooperative role in triggering plant immunity.",

We show that uniaxial compression induces clonal multicellularity in haloarchaea, forming tissue-like structures. These archaeal tissues are mechanically and molecularly distinct from their unicellular lifestyle, mimicking several eukaryotic features. Archaeal tissues undergo a multinucleate stage followed by tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. After cellularization, tissue junction elasticity becomes akin to that of animal tissues, giving rise to two cell types—peripheral (Per) and central scutoid (Scu) cells—with distinct actin and protein glycosylation polarity patterns. Our findings highlight the potential convergent evolution of a biophysical mechanism in the emergence of multicellular systems across domains of life.",

Nucleolin, a major MycG4-binding protein, exhibits greater affinity for MycG4 than for nucleolin recognition element (NRE) RNA. Nucleolin’s four RNA binding domains (RBDs) are essential for high-affinity MycG4 binding. We present the 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of the nucleolin-MycG4 complex, revealing a folded parallel three-tetrad G-quadruplex with two coordinating potassium ions (K + ), interacting with RBD1, RBD2, and Linker12 through its 6–nucleotide (nt) central loop and 5′ flanking region. RBD3 and RBD4 bind MycG4’s 1-nt loops as demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Cleavage under targets and tagmentation sequencing confirmed nucleolin’s binding to MycG4 in cells. Our results revealed a G4 conformation-based recognition by a regulating protein through multivalent interactions, suggesting that G4s are nucleolin’s primary cellular substrates, indicating G4 epigenetic transcriptional regulation and helping G4-targeted drug discovery.",

By using participatory science data from eBird, we estimated continental population change and relative abundance at 27-kilometer resolution for 495 bird species from 2007 to 2021. Results revealed high and previously undetected spatial heterogeneity in trends; although 75% of species were declining, 97% of species showed separate areas of significantly increasing and decreasing populations. Populations tended to decline most steeply in strongholds where species were most abundant, yet they fared better where species were least abundant. These high-resolution trends improve our ability to understand population dynamics, prioritize recovery efforts, and guide conservation at a time when action is urgently needed.",

Using high-resolution immunopeptidomics, we discovered that cryptic peptides are abundant in the pancreatic cancer immunopeptidome. Approximately 30% of ncHLAp exhibited cancer-restricted translation, and a substantial subset were shared among patients. Cancer-restricted ncHLAp displayed robust immunogenic potential in a sensitive ex vivo T cell priming platform. ncHLAp-reactive, T cell receptor–redirected T cells exhibited tumoricidal activity against patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids. These findings demonstrate that pancreatic cancer harbors cancer-restricted ncHLAp that can be recognized by cytotoxic T cells. Future therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer, and potentially other solid tumors, may include targeting cryptic antigens.",

During futility-induced behavioral transitions in the larval zebrafish, the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) drives fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity. We found that astroglial purinergic signaling implements the inhibitory arm of this motif. In larval zebrafish, NE triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), extracellular conversion of ATP into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors. Our results suggest a computational and behavioral role for an evolutionarily conserved astroglial purinergic signaling axis in NE-mediated behavioral and brain state transitions and position astroglia as important effectors in neuromodulatory signaling.",

Using phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), we generated CAST variants with >200-fold average improved integration activity. The evolved CAST system (evoCAST) achieves ~10 to 30% integration efficiencies of kilobase-size DNA cargoes in human cells across 14 tested genomic target sites, including safe harbor loci, sites used for immunotherapy, and genes implicated in loss-of-function diseases, with undetected indels and low levels of off-target integration.

In this study, we demonstrate that micropatterned human pluripotent stem cell–derived gastruloids enable in vitro modeling of the earliest stages of vascularization. We identify a combination of vascular-inducing factors that give rise to cardiac vascularized organoids with a spatially organized and branched vascular network. To show the broader utility of our vascularization strategy, we use the same vascular-inducing factors to produce hepatic vascularized organoids.

Here, we find an unusual reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in niobium phosphide (NbP) semimetal deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400°C. In films thinner than 5 nanometers, the room temperature resistivity (~34 microhm centimeters for 1.5-nanometer-thick NbP) is up to six times lower than the resistivity of our bulk NbP films, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness (typically about 100 microhm centimeters). The NbP films are not crystalline but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower effective resistivity is caused by conduction through surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics beyond the limitations of conventional metals.",

This pGlu-CSP epitope is not targeted by current anti-PfCSP mAbs and is not included in the licensed malaria vaccines. MAD21-101, the most potent mAb in this class, confers sterile protection against Pf infection in a human liver–chimeric mouse model.

Bats also showed unexpected flexibility in their ability to migrate across a wide range of conditions if needed. However, females leaving toward the end of the season showed higher total activity per distance traveled, a possible cost for their flexible migration timing.",

    "abstract": "How populations adapt to their environment is a fundamental question in biology. Yet, we know surprisingly little about this process, especially for endangered species, such as nonhuman great apes. Chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, are particularly notable because they inhabit diverse habitats, from rainforest to woodland-savannah. Whether genetic adaptation facilitates such habitat diversity remains unknown, despite it having wide implications for evolutionary biology and conservation. By using newly sequenced exomes from 828 wild chimpanzees (388 postfiltering), we found evidence of fine-scale genetic adaptation to habitat, with signatures of positive selection in forest chimpanzees in the same genes underlying adaptation to malaria in humans. This work demonstrates the power of noninvasive samples to reveal genetic adaptations in endangered populations and highlights the importance of adaptive genetic diversity for chimpanzees.",

    "abstract": "Optical frequency combs have enabled distinct advantages in broadband, high-resolution spectroscopy and precision interferometry. However, quantum mechanics ultimately limits the metrological precision achievable with laser frequency combs. Quantum squeezing has led to substantial measurement improvements with continuous wave lasers, but experiments demonstrating metrological advantage with squeezed combs are less developed. Using the Kerr effect in nonlinear optical fiber, a 1-gigahertz frequency comb centered at 1560 nanometers is amplitude-squeezed by >3 decibels (dB) over a 2.5-terahertz bandwidth. Dual-comb interferometry yields mode-resolved spectroscopy of hydrogen sulfide gas with a signal-to-noise ratio nearly 3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit. The quantum noise reduction leads to a twofold quantum speedup in the determination of gas concentration, with implications for high-speed measurements of multiple species in dynamic chemical environments.",

Within polymers, these linkages will confer distinctive mechanical properties and other emergent behaviors, but polymerizations that form mechanical bonds efficiently and use simple monomeric building blocks are rare. In this work, we introduce a solid-state polymerization in which one monomer infiltrates crystals of another to form a macrocycle and mechanical bond at each repeat unit of a two-dimensional (2D) polymer. This mechanically interlocked 2D polymer is formed as a layered solid that is readily exfoliated in common organic solvents, enabling spectroscopic characterization and atomic-resolution imaging using advanced electron microscopy techniques. The 2D mechanically interlocked polymer is easily prepared on multigram scales, which, along with its solution processibility, enables the facile fabrication of composite fibers with Ultem that exhibit enhanced stiffness and strength.",

    "abstract": "Incorporation of animal-based foods into early hominin diets has been hypothesized to be a major catalyst of many important evolutionary events, including brain expansion. However, direct evidence of the onset and evolution of animal resource consumption in hominins remains elusive. The nitrogen-15 to nitrogen-14 ratio of collagen provides trophic information about individuals in modern and geologically recent ecosystems (<200,000 years ago), but diagenetic loss of this organic matter precludes studies of greater age. By contrast, nitrogen in tooth enamel is preserved for millions of years. We report enamel-bound organic nitrogen and carbonate carbon isotope measurements of Sterkfontein Member 4 mammalian fauna, including seven Australopithecus specimens. Our results suggest a variable but plant-based diet (largely C 3 ) for these hominins. Therefore, we argue that Australopithecus at Sterkfontein did not engage in regular mammalian meat consumption.",

    "abstract": "High sugar–containing foods are readily consumed, even after meals and beyond fullness sensation (e.g., as desserts). Although reward-driven processing of palatable foods can promote overeating, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the selective appetite for sugar in states of satiety remain unclear. Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are principal regulators of satiety because they decrease food intake through excitatory melanocortin neuropeptides. We discovered that POMC neurons not only promote satiety in fed conditions but concomitantly switch on sugar appetite, which drives overconsumption. POMC neuron projections to the paraventricular thalamus selectively inhibited postsynaptic neurons through mu-opioid receptor signaling. This opioid circuit was strongly activated during sugar consumption, which was most notable in satiety states. Correspondingly, inhibiting its activity diminished high-sugar diet intake in sated mice.",

We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry. The derived seismic hydrographs reveal distinct expressions of groundwater and surficial water droughts: Whereas surface and near-surface water storage nearly fully recovered in the epic wet season of 2023, only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was restored. On a decadal scale, we find substantial depletion in aquifers below 50-meter depth, with only limited storm-related recovery. Our analysis underscores the need to monitor deep aquifers for a more complete assessment of total water deficits, using high-resolution tools such as seismic sensing.",

We used deep learning to characterize these enhancer codes and devised three metrics to compare cell types in the telencephalon across amniotes. To this end, we generated single-cell multiome and spatially resolved transcriptomics data of the chicken telencephalon. Enhancer codes of orthologous nonneuronal and γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) cell types show a high degree of similarity across amniotes, whereas excitatory neurons of the mammalian neocortex and avian pallium exhibit varying degrees of similarity. Enhancer codes of avian mesopallial neurons are most similar to those of mammalian deep-layer neurons. With this study, we present generally applicable deep learning approaches to characterize and compare cell types on the basis of genomic regulatory sequences.",

When combined with expansion microscopy, cycleHCR revealed an intricate network of 10 subcellular structures in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

This knowledge gap is particularly acute in high-biodiversity tropical forests. Here, we examined how tropical forests of the Americas have shifted community trait composition in recent decades as a response to changes in climate. Based on historical trait-climate relationships, we found that, overall, the studied functional traits show shifts of less than 8% of what would be expected given the observed changes in climate. However, the recruit assemblage shows shifts of 21% relative to climate change expectation. The most diverse forests on Earth are changing in functional trait composition but at a rate that is fundamentally insufficient to track climate change.",

We report a critical neonatal window in mice when microbiota disruption results in lifelong metabolic consequences stemming from reduced β cell development. We show evidence for the existence of a similar program in humans and identify specific fungi and bacteria that are sufficient for β cell growth. The microbiota also plays an important role in seeding islet-resident macrophages, and macrophage depletion during development reduces β cells. Candida dubliniensis increases β cells in a macrophage-dependent manner through distinctive cell wall composition and reduces murine diabetes incidence. Provision of C. dubliniensis after β cell ablation or antibiotic treatment improves β cell function.

This loss of peroxisomes impaired inflammation resolution and lung repair during severe respiratory viral infections. Peroxisomes were found to modulate lipid metabolism and mitochondrial health in a macrophage type-specific manner and enhanced alveolar macrophage-mediated tissue repair and alveolar regeneration after viral infection. Peroxisomes also prevented excessive macrophage inflammasome activation and IL-1β release, limiting accumulation of KRT8 high dysplastic epithelial progenitors following viral injury. Pharmacologically enhancing peroxisome biogenesis mitigated both acute symptoms and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in animal models.

    "abstract": "Ceramides play a central role in human health and disease, yet their role as systemic signaling molecules remain poorly understood. In this work, we identify formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) as a membrane receptor that specifically binds long-chain ceramides (C14 to C20). In brown and beige adipocytes, C16:0 ceramide binding to FPR2 inhibits thermogenesis through G i cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathways, an effect that is reversed in the absence of FPR2. We present three cryo–electron microscopy structures of FPR2 in complex with G i trimers bound to C16:0, C18:0, and C20:0 ceramides. The hydrophobic tails are deeply embedded in the orthosteric ligand pocket, which has a limited amount of plasticity. Modification of the ceramide binding motif in closely related receptors, such as FPR1 or FPR3, converts them from inactive to active ceramide receptors. Our findings provide a structural basis for adipocyte thermogenesis mediated by FPR2.",

Integrating them with optical cavities enables fast nondestructive qubit readout and access to fast remote entanglement generation for quantum networking. In this work, we introduce a platform for coupling single atoms in optical tweezers to a Fabry-Perot fiber cavity. Leveraging the strong atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrated fast qubit-state readout with 99.960 − 24 + 14 % fidelity and two methods for cavity-mediated entanglement generation with integrated error detection. First, we used cavity-carving to generate a Bell state with 91(4)% fidelity and a 32(1)% success rate (the number in parentheses is the standard deviation). Second, we performed a cavity-mediated gate with a deterministic entanglement fidelity of 52.5(18)%, increased to 76(2)% with error detection. Our approach provides a route toward modular quantum computing and networking.",

Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales.",

We discovered that hedonic eating is controlled by a neural pathway from the peri–locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using photometry-calibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (VTA DA ) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally regulate hedonic food consumption. VTA DA neuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist used as an antiobesity drug. Mice recovered palatable food appetite and VTA DA neuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by consumption-triggered VTA DA neuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTA DA neurons, which sustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide.",

AvrSr62 binds to the N-terminal kinase 1 of Sr62 TK , triggering displacement of kinase 2, which activates Sr62 NLR . Modeling and mutation analysis indicated that this is mediated by overlapping binding sites (i) on kinase 1 for binding AvrSr62 and kinase 2 and (ii) on kinase 2 for binding kinase 1 and Sr62 NLR .

In this work, we show that a prominent industrial process, palladium (Pd)–catalyzed vinyl acetate synthesis, proceeds via interconversion of heterogeneous Pd(0) and homogeneous Pd(II) during catalysis, with each species playing a complementary role. Using electrochemical probes, we found that heterogeneous, nanoparticulate Pd(0) serves as an active oxygen reduction electrocatalyst to furnish the high potential required for corrosion to form homogeneous Pd(II), which then catalyzes selective ethylene acetoxylation with reformation of heterogeneous Pd(0). Inhibiting the corrosion of Pd(0) to Pd(II) by galvanic protection results in reversible poisoning of catalysis, evincing the essential role of phase conversion in this catalytic cycle. These results highlight how dynamic phase interconversion can harness and couple complementary reactivity across molecular and material active sites.",

Conceptually, our system is analogous to a DNA transposition reaction but uses orthogonal pairs of engineered split inteins to mediate the editing process. This “protein transposition” reaction is applied to several systems, including folded protein complexes, allowing the efficient introduction of a variety of noncoded elements. By carrying out a molecular “cut and paste” under native protein-folding conditions, our approach substantially expands the scope of protein semisynthesis.",

This process cooperates with chloride accommodation and promotes halide homogenization across the entire film volume. The resulting 1.67–electron volt WBG perovskite exhibits photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 14% under 1-sun-equivalent irradiation, corresponding to a quasi–Fermi level splitting of ~1.34 electron volts. A WBG perovskite solar cell with an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.30 volts was prepared, corresponding to 93.5% of the radiative V OC limit and representing the lowest photovoltage loss relative to the theoretical limit observed in WBG perovskites.",

We found that the observed RTN stems from anyon quasiparticle number n fluctuations, and we reconstructed three Aharonov-Bohm oscillation signals phase shifted by 2π/3, corresponding to the three possible interference branches from braiding around n (mod 3) anyons. Our methods can be readily extended to interference of non-abelian anyons.",

These catalysts reversibly switch between Pt clusters and Pt single atoms in response to reducing reaction and oxidizing regeneration conditions. This environmental adaptability allows them to completely self-regenerate over 110 reaction and regeneration cycles in propane dehydrogenation, and they exhibited unprecedented sintering resistance when exposed to air at 800°C for 10 days.

This approach efficiently produces highly enantioenriched α-chiral alkyl amines and facilitates the enantioselective formal synthesis of a series of important drug molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that bulky peripheral modifications on the ligands help create a truncated cone-shaped chiral pocket, enabling precise enantiodiscrimination through steric hindrance and noncovalent interactions. This strategy holds broad potential for asymmetric transformations involving diverse unactivated prochiral alkyl radicals and nucleophiles.",

However, the rules governing which synapses will undergo different forms of plasticity in vivo during learning and whether these rules are uniform within individual neurons remain unclear. Using in vivo longitudinal imaging with single-synapse resolution in the mouse motor cortex during motor learning, we found that apical and basal dendrites of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons showed distinct activity-dependent synaptic plasticity rules. The strengthening of apical and of basal synapses is predicted by local coactivity with nearby synapses and activity coincident with postsynaptic action potentials, respectively. Blocking postsynaptic spiking diminished basal synaptic potentiation without affecting apical plasticity. Thus, individual neurons use multiple activity-dependent plasticity rules in a compartment-specific manner in vivo during learning.",

In this study, an all-optical technique allowed real-time monitoring of EDL dynamics at arbitrary concentration by quasi-instantaneously changing the surface propensity of protons (H 3 O + ) adsorbed at the air-aqueous electrolyte solution interface and by subsequently tracking EDL relaxation with femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy. EDL reorganization occurred on picosecond timescales and was strongly concentration dependent. Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and analytical modeling showed that ion conduction primarily drove EDL dynamics. This research quantified EDL dynamics and identified its primary driver, providing insights for optimization of electrochemical applications.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota is known to be associated with a variety of human metabolic diseases, including metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Fungi are increasingly recognized as important members of this community; however, the role of fungal symbionts in metabolic diseases is unknown. We have systematically isolated and characterized gut fungi, identifying Fusarium foetens as an intestinal symbiotic filamentous fungus in mice. F. foetens reverses MASH progression in mouse models through an intestinal ceramide synthetase 6 (CerS6)–ceramide axis. Moreover, we identified FF-C1, a secondary metabolite from F. foetens , as a CerS6 inhibitor that has an endogenous protective effect on MASH progression.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional printing offers promise for patient-specific implants and therapies but is often limited by the need for invasive surgical procedures. To address this, we developed an imaging-guided deep tissue in vivo sound printing (DISP) platform. By incorporating cross-linking agent–loaded low-temperature–sensitive liposomes into bioinks, DISP enables precise, rapid, on-demand cross-linking of diverse functional biomaterials using focused ultrasound. Gas vesicle–based ultrasound imaging provides real-time monitoring and allows for customized pattern creation in live animals. We validated DISP by successfully printing near diseased areas in the mouse bladder and deep within rabbit leg muscles in vivo, demonstrating its potential for localized drug delivery and tissue replacement. DISP’s ability to print conductive, drug-loaded, cell-laden, and bioadhesive biomaterials demonstrates its versatility for diverse biomedical applications.",

However, we discovered that haploid cells of the pathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea distribute their chromosomes such that each of their nuclei contains only a subset of the haploid chromosomes (≤½N). The unusual chromosomal distribution was confirmed by cellular and molecular methods including chromosome counting, fluorescence in situ hybridization, flow cytometry–based DNA measurements, and single-nucleus polymerase chain reaction experiments. This phenomenon challenges fundamental assumptions about nuclear organization and opens fresh avenues in chromosome biology.",

Here, we describe a general deep learning–guided approach for de novo design of dynamic changes between intradomain geometries of proteins, similar to switch mechanisms prevalent in nature, with atomic-level precision. We solve four structures that validate the designed conformations, demonstrate modulation of the conformational landscape by orthosteric ligands and allosteric mutations, and show that physics-based simulations are in agreement with deep-learning predictions and experimental data. Our approach demonstrates that new modes of motion can now be realized through de novo design and provides a framework for constructing biology-inspired, tunable, and controllable protein signaling behavior de novo.",

A recent transition from egg-laying to live-bearing in marine snails ( Littorina spp.) provides the opportunity to study the genetic architecture of an innovation that has evolved repeatedly across animals. Individuals do not cluster by reproductive mode in a genome-wide phylogeny, but local genealogical analysis revealed numerous small genomic regions where all live-bearers carry the same core haplotype. Candidate regions show evidence for live-bearer–specific positive selection and are enriched for genes that are differentially expressed between egg-laying and live-bearing reproductive systems. Ages of selective sweeps suggest that live-bearer–specific alleles accumulated over more than 200,000 generations. Our results suggest that new functions evolve through the recruitment of many alleles rather than in a single evolutionary step.",

In a normal liquid, a hotspot diffuses, whereas in a superfluid, heat propagates as a wave called “second sound.” Direct imaging of heat transport is challenging, and one usually resorts to detecting secondary effects. In this study, we establish thermography of a strongly interacting atomic Fermi gas, whose radio-frequency spectrum provides spatially resolved thermometry with subnanokelvin resolution. The superfluid phase transition was directly observed as the sudden change from thermal diffusion to second-sound propagation and is accompanied by a peak in the second-sound diffusivity. This method yields the full heat and density response of the strongly interacting Fermi gas and therefore all defining properties of Landau’s two-fluid hydrodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Plants are constantly exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are released during plant-plant communication, within-plant self-signaling, and plant-microbe interactions. Therefore, understanding VOC perception and downstream signaling is vital for unraveling the mechanisms behind information exchange in plants, which remain largely unexplored. Using the hormone-like function of volatile terpenoids in reproductive organ development as a system with a visual marker for communication, we demonstrate that a petunia karrikin-insensitive receptor, PhKAI2ia, stereospecifically perceives the (−)-germacrene D signal, triggering a KAI2-mediated signaling cascade and affecting plant fitness. This study uncovers the role(s) of the intermediate clade of KAI2 receptors, illuminates the involvement of a KAI2ia-dependent signaling pathway in volatile communication, and provides new insights into plant olfaction and the long-standing question about the nature of potential endogenous KAI2 ligand(s).",

In this work, we report two types of cleavage-independent GSDM activation. First, Tricho GSDM, a pore-forming domain–only protein from the basal metazoan Trichoplax adhaerens , is a disulfides-linked autoinhibited dimer activated by reduction of the disulfides. The cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure illustrates the assembly mechanism for the 44-mer Tricho GSDM pore. Second, RCD-1-1 and RCD-1-2, encoded by the polymorphic regulator of cell death–1 ( rcd-1 ) gene in filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa , are also pore-forming domain–only GSDMs. RCD-1-1 and RCD-1-2, when encountering each other, form pores and cause pyroptosis, underlying allorecognition in Neurospora . The cryo-EM structure reveals a pore of 11 RCD-1-1/RCD-1-2 heterodimers and a heterodimerization-triggered pore assembly mechanism. This study shows mechanistic diversities in GSDM activation and indicates versatile functions of GSDMs.",

We chemically synthesized 18 macrocycles predicted to adopt single low-energy states and determined their x-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance structures; 15 of these were very close to the design models. We illustrate the therapeutic potential of these macrocycle designs by developing selective inhibitors of three protein targets of current interest. By opening up a vast space of readily synthesizable drug-like macrocycles, our results should considerably enhance structure-based drug design.",

However, prioritizing risk genes and mechanisms is challenging without a unified regulatory atlas. Across 672 diverse developing human brains, we identified 15,752 genes harboring gene, isoform, and/or splicing quantitative trait loci, mapping 3739 to cellular contexts. Gene expression heritability drops during development, likely reflecting both increasing cellular heterogeneity and the intrinsic properties of neuronal maturation. Isoform-level regulation, particularly in the second trimester, mediated the largest proportion of GWAS heritability. Through colocalization, we prioritized mechanisms for about 60% of GWAS loci across five disorders, exceeding adult brain findings. Finally, we contextualized results within gene and isoform coexpression networks, revealing the comprehensive landscape of transcriptome regulation in development and disease.",

We report a molecular templating method that restricted crystal growth along all crystallographic directions except for [110] and promoted one-dimensional growth. Our approach is widely applicable to synthesize a range of high-quality layered perovskite nanowires with large aspect ratios and tunable organic-inorganic chemical compositions. These nanowires form exceptionally well-defined and flexible cavities that exhibited a wide range of unusual optical properties beyond those of conventional perovskite nanowires. We observed anisotropic emission polarization, low-loss waveguiding (below 3 decibels per millimeter), and efficient low-threshold light amplification (below 20 microjoules per square centimeter).",

In this work, we identify 2107 registered US voters who account for 80% of the fake news shared on Twitter during the 2020 US presidential election by an entire panel of 664,391 voters. We found that supersharers were important members of the network, reaching a sizable 5.2% of registered voters on the platform. Supersharers had a significant overrepresentation of women, older adults, and registered Republicans. Supersharers’ massive volume did not seem automated but was rather generated through manual and persistent retweeting. These findings highlight a vulnerability of social media for democracy, where a small group of people distort the political reality for many.",

We report that during liver regeneration, proliferation is suppressed in electron transport chain (ETC)–dysfunctional hepatocytes due to an inability to generate acetyl-CoA from peripheral fatty acids through mitochondrial β-oxidation. Alternative modes for acetyl-CoA production from pyruvate or acetate are suppressed in the setting of ETC dysfunction. This metabolic inflexibility forces a dependence on ETC-functional mitochondria and restoring acetyl-CoA production from pyruvate is sufficient to allow ETC-dysfunctional hepatocytes to proliferate. We propose that metabolic inflexibility within hepatocytes can be advantageous by limiting the expansion of ETC-dysfunctional cells.",

We investigated ~3000 glass beads in lunar soil samples collected by the Chang’e-5 mission and identified three as having a volcanic origin on the basis of their textures, chemical compositions, and sulfur isotopes. Uranium-lead dating of the three volcanic glass beads shows that they formed 123 ± 15 million years ago. We measured high abundances of rare earth elements and thorium in these volcanic glass beads, which could indicate that such recent volcanism was related to local enrichment of heat-generating elements in the mantle sources of the magma.",

Using a 5-second pulse, we achieved >30% of capacity recovery in both Li-Si and Si–lithium iron phosphate (Si-LFP) batteries. The recovered capacity sustains and replicates through multiple pulses, providing a constant capacity advantage. We validated the recovery mechanism as the movement of the neutral isolated Li x Si particles under a localized nonuniform electric field, a phenomenon known as dielectrophoresis.",

Implantable sensors for monitoring small molecules such as glucose have been available for more than a decade. However, analysis of proteins remains an unmet need because the lower physiological levels require that sensors have high affinities, which are linked to long complexation half-lives ( t 1/2 ~20 hours) and slow equilibration when concentrations decrease. We report active-reset sensors by use of high-frequency oscillations to accelerate dissociation, which enables regeneration of the unbound form of the sensor within 1 minute. When implemented within implanted devices, these sensors allow for real-time, in vivo monitoring of proteins within interstitial fluid. Active-reset protein sensors track biomarker levels on a physiological timescale for inflammation monitoring in living animals.",

Combined with biochemical, cellular, and biophysical experiments, these structural snapshots allow the visualization of atypical engagement of βarrs with 7TMRs and also reveal a structural transition in the carboxyl terminus of βarr2 from a β strand to an α helix upon activation by D6R. Our study provides previously unanticipated molecular insights into the structural and functional diversity encoded in 7TMR-βarr complexes with direct implications for exploring novel therapeutic avenues.",

In this work, we characterize a set of associated genes of a type III-B system from Haliangium ochraceum that contains two caspase-like proteases, SAVED-CHAT and PCaspase (prokaryotic caspase), co-opted from a cyclic oligonucleotide–based antiphage signaling system (CBASS). Cyclic tri–adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–induced oligomerization of SAVED-CHAT activates proteolytic activity of the CHAT domains, which specifically cleave and activate PCaspase. Subsequently, activated PCaspase cleaves a multitude of proteins, which results in a strong interference phenotype in vivo in Escherichia coli. Taken together, our findings reveal how a CRISPR-Cas–based detection of a target RNA triggers a cascade of caspase-associated proteolytic activities.",

However, the molecular basis underlying secretory cavity development is unknown. Here, we reveal a molecular framework for Citrus oil gland formation. Using genetic mapping and genome editing, we demonstrated that this process requires LATE MERISTEM IDENTITY1 (LMI1), a key regulator of leaf serration. A conserved GCC box element of the LMI1 promoter recruits DORNROSCHEN-like (DRNL) for transcriptional activation. This DRNL-LMI1 cascade triggers MYC5 activation, facilitating the development of oil glands and the biosynthesis of essential oils.

Prevailing models suggest that cohesin complexes, bound to DNA before replication, remain behind the advancing replication fork to keep sister chromatids together. By visualizing single replication forks colliding with preloaded cohesin complexes, we find that the replisome instead pushes cohesin to where a converging replisome is met. Whereas the converging replisomes are removed during DNA replication termination, cohesin remains on nascent DNA and provides cohesion. Additionally, we show that CMG (CDC45–MCM2-7–GINS)  helicase disassembly during replication termination is vital for proper cohesion in budding yeast. Together, our results support a model wherein sister chromatid cohesion is established during DNA replication termination.",

To investigate the coordination of replication forks, we developed a replication-associated in situ HiC method to capture chromatin interactions involving nascent DNA. We identify more than 2000 fountain-like structures of chromatin contacts in human and mouse genomes, indicative of coupling of DNA replication forks. Replication fork interaction not only occurs between sister forks but also involves forks from two distinct origins to predetermine replication termination. Termination-associated chromatin fountains are sensitive to replication stress and lead to coupled forks–associated genomic deletions in cancers. These findings reveal the spatial organization of DNA replication forks within the chromatin context.",

In this study, we took advantage of the diversity of bright warning patterns displayed by Heliconius butterflies, which are also used during mate choice. Combining behavioral, population genomic, and expression analyses, we show that two Heliconius species have evolved the same preferences for red patterns by exchanging genetic material through hybridization. Neural expression of regucalcin1 correlates with visual preference across populations, and disruption of regucalcin1 with CRISPR-Cas9 impairs courtship toward conspecific females, providing a direct link between gene and behavior. Our results support a role for hybridization during behavioral evolution and show how visually guided behaviors contributing to adaptation and speciation are encoded within the genome.",

These HD-Zip IV genes also control style length by regulating the transition from cell division to endoreduplication. The expression of these HD-Zip IV genes and their downstream gene, Style 2.1 , was sequentially modified to shape the cleistogamy morphology during tomato evolution and domestication. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of cleistogamy in modern tomato and suggest targets for improving fruit set and preventing pollen contamination in genetically modified crops.",

    "abstract": "Extreme weather events radically alter ecosystems. When ecological damage persists, selective pressures on individuals can change, leading to phenotypic adjustments. For group-living animals, social relationships may be a mechanism enabling adaptation to ecosystem disturbance. Yet whether such events alter selection on sociality and whether group-living animals can, as a result, adaptively change their social relationships remain untested. We leveraged 10 years of data collected on rhesus macaques before and after a category 4 hurricane caused persistent deforestation, exacerbating monkeys’ exposure to intense heat. In response, macaques demonstrated persistently increased tolerance and decreased aggression toward other monkeys, facilitating access to scarce shade critical for thermoregulation. Social tolerance predicted individual survival after the hurricane, but not before it, revealing a shift in the adaptive function of sociality.",

We demonstrate that in PDAC coupled with pancreatitis (ptPDAC), antigen-presenting type I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are specifically activated. Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (iCBT) leads to cytotoxic CD8 + T cell activation and elimination of ptPDAC with restoration of life span even upon PDAC rechallenge. Using PDAC antigen-loaded cDC1s as a vaccine, immunotherapy-resistant PDAC was rendered sensitive to iCBT with elimination of tumors. cDC1 vaccination coupled with iCBT identified specific CDR3 sequences in the tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells with potential therapeutic importance. This study identifies a fundamental difference in the immune microenvironment in PDAC concurrent with, or without, pancreatitis and provides a rationale for combining cDC1 vaccination with iCBT as a potential treatment option.",

Current engineering approaches for nanopore sensors are limited to naturally occurring channels, which provide suboptimal starting points. By contrast, de novo protein design can in principle create an unlimited number of new nanopores with any desired properties. Here we describe a general approach to designing transmembrane β-barrel pores with different diameters and pore geometries. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic characterization show that the designs are stably folded with structures resembling those of the design models. The designs have distinct conductances that correlate with their pore diameter, ranging from 110 picosiemens (~0.5 nanometer pore diameter) to 430 picosiemens (~1.1 nanometer pore diameter). Our approach opens the door to the custom design of transmembrane nanopores for sensing and sequencing applications.",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces the repression of protein synthesis throughout the cell. Attempts to understand how localized stress leads to widespread repression have been limited by difficulties in resolving translation rates at the subcellular level. Here, using live-cell imaging of reporter mRNA translation, we unexpectedly found that during ER stress, active translation at mitochondria was significantly protected. The mitochondrial protein ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3A (ATAD3A) interacted with protein kinase RNA–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and mediated this effect on localized translation by competing for binding with PERK’s target, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). PERK-ATAD3A interactions increased during ER stress, forming mitochondria-ER contact sites. Furthermore, ATAD3A binding attenuated local PERK signaling and rescued the expression of some mitochondrial proteins. Thus, PERK-ATAD3A interactions can control translational repression at a subcellular level, mitigating the impact of ER stress on the cell.",

For 230 fisheries worldwide, we contrasted stock biomass estimates at the time of assessment with updated hindcast estimates modeled for the same year in later assessments to evaluate systematic over- or underestimation. For stocks that were overfished, low value, or located in regions with rising temperatures, historical biomass estimates were generally overstated compared with updated assessments. Moreover, rising trends reported for overfished stocks were often inaccurate. With consideration of bias identified retrospectively, 85% more stocks than currently recognized have likely collapsed below 10% of maximum historical biomass. The high uncertainty and bias in modeled stock estimates warrants much greater precaution by managers.",

    "abstract": "The calcium (Ca 2+ ) sensor ROD1 (RESISTANCE OF RICE TO DISEASES1) is a master regulator of immunity in rice. By screening suppressors of rod1 mutants, we show that ROD1 governs immune homeostasis by surveilling the activation of a canonical immune pathway. Mutations in OsTIR ( TIR-only protein ), OsEDS1 ( enhanced disease susceptibility 1 ), OsPAD4 ( phytoalexin deficient 4 ), and OsADR1 ( activated disease resistance 1 ) all abolish enhanced disease resistance of rod1 plants. OsTIR catalyzes the production of second messengers 2′-(5″-phosphoribosyl)-5′-adenosine monophosphate (pRib-AMP) and diphosphate (pRib-ADP), which trigger formation of an OsEDS1-OsPAD4-OsADR1 (EPA) immune complex. ROD1 interacts with OsTIR and inhibits its enzymatic activity, whereas mutation of ROD1 leads to constitutive activation of the EPA complex. Thus, we unveil an immune network that fine-tunes immune homeostasis and multipathogen resistance in rice.",

We observed emergent interface-induced superconductivity in these heterostructures and demonstrated the co-occurrence of superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and topological band structure in the magnetic TI layer—the three essential ingredients of chiral topological superconductivity (TSC). The unusual coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity is accompanied by a high upper critical magnetic field that exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit for conventional superconductors at low temperatures. These magnetic TI/FeTe heterostructures with robust superconductivity and atomically sharp interfaces provide an ideal wafer-scale platform for the exploration of chiral TSC and Majorana physics.",

In mice navigating a linear track, we observed location-specific eCB signaling in hippocampal CA1 place cells, and this was detected both in the postsynaptic membrane and the presynaptic inhibitory axons. All-optical in vivo investigation of synaptic responses revealed that postsynaptic depolarization was followed by a suppression of inhibitory synaptic potentials. Furthermore, interneuron-specific cannabinoid receptor deletion altered place cell tuning. Therefore, rapid, postsynaptic, activity-dependent eCB signaling modulates inhibitory synapses on a timescale of seconds during behavior.",

In the current work, we demonstrated a ladder-like polyethylene architecture through solution polymerization of ethylene and less than 1 mole % of α,ω-dienes, using a dual-chain catalyst. The ladder-branching mechanism requires catalysts with two growing polymer chains on the same metal center, thus enchaining the diene without the requirement of a steady-state concentration of pendant vinyl groups. Molecular weight distributions lacking a high–molecular weight tail, distinctive Mark-Houwink signatures, nuclear magnetic resonance characterization, and shear and extensional rheology consistent with highly branched polyethylene architectures are described. This approach represents an industrially viable solution-polymerization process capable of producing controlled long-chain branched polyethylene with rheological properties comparable to those of LDPE or its blends with linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).",

Previous studies of cortical connectivity have mostly been carried out in rodents; whether the principles established therein also apply to the evolutionarily expanded human cortex is unclear. We studied network properties within the human temporal cortex using samples obtained from brain surgery. We analyzed multineuron patch-clamp recordings in layer 2-3 pyramidal neurons and identified substantial differences compared with rodents. Reciprocity showed random distribution, synaptic strength was independent from connection probability, and connectivity of the supragranular temporal cortex followed a directed and mostly acyclic graph topology. Application of these principles in neuronal models increased dimensionality of network dynamics, suggesting a critical role for cortical computation.",

However, whether noise sound waves are intrinsically harmful for developing young—or merely disturb parents—and the fitness consequences of early exposure remain unknown. Here, by only manipulating the offspring, we show that sole exposure to noise in early life in zebra finches has fitness consequences and causes embryonic death during exposure. Exposure to pre- and postnatal traffic noise cumulatively impaired nestling growth and physiology and aggravated telomere shortening across life stages until adulthood. Consistent with a long-term somatic impact, early life noise exposure, especially prenatally, decreased individual offspring production throughout adulthood. Our findings suggest that the effects of noise pollution are more pervasive than previously realized.",

    "abstract": "Despite identifying El Niño events as a factor in dengue dynamics, predicting the oscillation of global dengue epidemics remains challenging. Here, we investigate climate indicators and worldwide dengue incidence from 1990 to 2019 using climate-driven mechanistic models. We identify a distinct indicator, the Indian Ocean basin-wide (IOBW) index, as representing the regional average of sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean. IOBW is closely associated with dengue epidemics for both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The ability of IOBW to predict dengue incidence likely arises as a result of its effect on local temperature anomalies through teleconnections. These findings indicate that the IOBW index can potentially enhance the lead time for dengue forecasts, leading to better-planned and more impactful outbreak responses.",

    "abstract": "Reproduction includes two energy investments—the energy in the offspring and the energy expended to make them. The former is well understood, whereas the latter is unquantified but often assumed to be small. Without understanding both investments, the true energy costs of reproduction are unknown. We present a framework for estimating the total energy costs of reproduction by combining data on the energy content of offspring (direct costs) and the metabolic load of bearing them (indirect costs). We find that direct costs typically represent the smaller fraction of the energy expended on reproduction. Mammals pay the highest reproductive costs (excluding lactation), ~90% of which are indirect. Ectotherms expend less on reproduction overall, and live-bearing ectotherms pay higher indirect costs compared with egg-layers. We show that the energy demands of reproduction exceed standard assumptions.",

    "abstract": "After infection of B cells, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) engages host pathways that mediate cell proliferation and transformation, contributing to the propensity of the virus to drive immune dysregulation and lymphomagenesis. We found that the EBV protein EBNA2 initiates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo biosynthesis by driving expression of the metabolic enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in infected B cells. Virus-enforced NAD production sustained mitochondrial complex I activity, to match adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production with bioenergetic requirements of proliferation and transformation. In transplant patients, IDO1 expression in EBV-infected B cells, and a serum signature of increased IDO1 activity, preceded development of lymphoma. In humanized mice infected with EBV, IDO1 inhibition reduced both viremia and lymphomagenesis. Virus-orchestrated NAD biosynthesis is therefore a druggable metabolic vulnerability of EBV-driven B cell transformation, opening therapeutic possibilities for EBV-related diseases.",

The compositions of those planets are largely unknown but are expected to relate to the protoplanetary disk in which they form. We used James Webb Space Telescope mid-infrared spectroscopy to investigate the chemical composition of the planet-forming disk around ISO-ChaI 147, a 0.11-solar-mass star. The inner disk has a carbon-rich chemistry; we identified emission from 13 carbon-bearing molecules, including ethane and benzene. The high column densities of hydrocarbons indicate that the observations probe deep into the disk. The high carbon-to-oxygen ratio indicates radial transport of material within the disk, which we predict would affect the bulk composition of any planets forming in the disk.",

Conventional approaches to tailoring thermal emission using metamaterials are hampered both by the limited spatial resolution of the required subwavelength material structures and by the materials’ strong absorption in the infrared. In this work, we demonstrate an approach based on the concept of topology. By changing a single parameter of a multilayer coating, we were able to control the reflection topology of a surface, with the critical point of zero reflection being topologically protected. The boundaries between subcritical and supercritical spatial domains host topological interface states with near-unity thermal emissivity. These topological concepts enable unconventional manipulation of thermal light for applications in thermal management and thermal camouflage.",

Quantum chemical calculations revealed the most preferred sites for [Al(CH 3 ) 2 ] + abstraction (a change in Gibbs free energy of 0.0 kilocalories per mole).

In addition to current-induced transverse spin current, the presence of a coexisting out-of-plane spin current confirms that both conventional and collinear spin Hall conductivities exist in these low-dimensional crystals.",

In this work, we assess its linkage to asynchronous development of bipolar ice sheets by synthesizing Pleistocene mid- to high-latitude proxy records linked to hemispheric ice sheet evolution. Our results indicate substantial growth of the Antarctic Ice Sheets (AISs) at 2.0 to 1.25 million years ago, preceding the rapid expansion of Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheets after ~1.25 million years ago. Proxy-model comparisons suggest that AIS and associated Southern Ocean sea ice expansion can induce northern high-latitude cooling and enhanced moisture transport to the Northern Hemisphere, thus triggering the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The dynamic processes involved are crucial for assessing modern global warming that is already inducing asynchronous bipolar melting of ice sheets.",

We experimentally produced and characterized more than 100 proteins. Three high-resolution crystal structures and two cryo–electron microscopy density maps of designed single-chain proteins comprising up to 1000 amino acids validate the accuracy of the method. Our pipeline can also be used to design synthetic protein-protein interactions, as validated experimentally by a set of protein heterodimers. Relaxed sequence optimization offers attractive performance with respect to designability, scope of applicability for different design problems, and scalability across protein sizes.",

We annealed nanometer-thick gold (Au) nanoparticles between two substrates of exfoliated hexagonal molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) with varying orientation of their basal planes with a mutual twist angle ranging from 0° to 60°. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that Au aligns midway between the top and bottom MoS 2 when the twist angle of the bilayer is small (<~7°). For larger twist angles, Au has only a small misorientation with the bottom MoS 2 that varies approximately sinusoidally with twist angle of the bilayer MoS 2 . Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis further reveals a periodic strain variation (<|±0.5%|) in the Au nanodisks associated with the twisted epitaxy, consistent with the Moiré registry of the two MoS 2 twisted layers.",

    "abstract": "Vocal production learning (“vocal learning”) is a convergently evolved trait in vertebrates. To identify brain genomic elements associated with mammalian vocal learning, we integrated genomic, anatomical, and neurophysiological data from the Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) with analyses of the genomes of 215 placental mammals. First, we identified a set of proteins evolving more slowly in vocal learners. Then, we discovered a vocal motor cortical region in the Egyptian fruit bat, an emergent vocal learner, and leveraged that knowledge to identify active cis-regulatory elements in the motor cortex of vocal learners. Machine learning methods applied to motor cortex open chromatin revealed 50 enhancers robustly associated with vocal learning whose activity tended to be lower in vocal learners. Our research implicates convergent losses of motor cortex regulatory elements in mammalian vocal learning evolution.",

Using a nanoscale scanning magnetometer, we imaged a distinctive hydrodynamic transport pattern—stationary current vortices—in a monolayer graphene device at room temperature. By measuring devices with increasing characteristic size, we observed the disappearance of the current vortex and thus verified a prediction of the hydrodynamic model. We further observed that vortex flow is present for both hole- and electron-dominated transport regimes but disappears in the ambipolar regime. We attribute this effect to a reduction of the vorticity diffusion length near charge neutrality. Our work showcases the power of local imaging techniques for unveiling exotic mesoscopic transport phenomena.",

In this work, we implemented a super-resolution technique that localizes and arranges atoms on a sub–50-nm scale, without any fundamental limit in resolution. We demonstrate this technique by creating a bilayer of dysprosium atoms and observing dipolar interactions between two physically separated layers through interlayer sympathetic cooling and coupled collective excitations. At 50-nm distance, dipolar interactions are 1000 times stronger than at 500 nm. For two atoms in optical tweezers, this should enable purely magnetic dipolar gates with kilohertz speed.",

The reaction establishes γ-tertiary and α-quaternary stereocenters simultaneously in up to >99% enantiomeric excess, providing access to a wide range of cyclic chiral synthons and bioactive molecules. The sequential enantioselective editing of two methylene C–H bonds can be achieved by using chiral ligands with opposite configuration to construct carbocycles containing three chiral centers. Enantioselective remote δ-C−H (hetero)arylation is also realized to establish δ-stereocenters that are particularly challenging to access using classical methodologies.",

Previously unknown anatomy includes a soft-tissue labrum attached to the hypostome, a slit-like mouth, and distinctive cephalic feeding appendages. Our findings resolve controversy over whether the trilobite hypostome is the labrum or incorporates it and establish crown-group euarthropod homologies in trilobites.

We integrated the metabolism of the crotonyl-CoA/ethyl-malonyl-CoA/hydroxybutyryl-CoA cycle with cell-free protein synthesis using recombinant elements. Our network produces the amino acid glycine from CO 2 and incorporates it into target proteins following DNA-encoded instructions. By orchestrating ~50 enzymes we established a basic cell-free operating system in which genetically encoded inputs into a metabolic network are programmed to activate feedback loops allowing for self-integration and (partial) self-regeneration of the complete system.",

We found that a neuron’s eligibility to be recruited into the memory trace depends on its epigenetic state prior to encoding. Principal neurons in the mouse lateral amygdala display intrinsic chromatin plasticity, which when experimentally elevated favors neuronal allocation into the encoding ensemble. Such chromatin plasticity occurred at genomic regions underlying synaptic plasticity and was accompanied by increased neuronal excitability in single neurons in real time. Lastly, optogenetic silencing of the epigenetically altered neurons prevented memory expression, revealing a cell-autonomous relationship between chromatin plasticity and memory trace formation. These results identify the epigenetic state of a neuron as a key factor enabling information encoding.",

We found notable complexity in the initial rupture stages. A strong fault asperity, which remained unbroken in preceding seismic swarms, slowed down the rupture. Then, a second rupture initiated at the opposite edge of the asperity, and the asperity succumbed to double-pincer rupture fronts. The failure of this high-stress drop asperity drove the earthquake into a large-scale event. Our observations help unravel the crucial role of fault asperities in controlling swarm migration and rupture propagation and underscore the need for detailed seismological and interdisciplinary studies to assess seismic risk in swarm-prone regions.",

For island endemics, proportional losses have been even greater. Projected future extinctions of more than 1000 species over the next two centuries will incur further substantial reductions in functional and phylogenetic diversity.

ILC2s expanded and produced IL-13 in the developing brain meninges. Loss of ILC2s or IL-13 signaling to interneurons decreased inhibitory, but not excitatory, cortical synapses. Conversely, ILC2s and IL-13 were sufficient to increase inhibitory synapses. Loss of this signaling pathway led to selective impairments in social interaction.

Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced type 2 diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35 and 20% and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years, respectively. Protection was evident with in utero exposure and increased with postnatal sugar restriction, especially after 6 months, when eating of solid foods likely began.

The growth–defense trade-off hypothesis predicts costs associated with defense investment to generate variation in these traits. Our analysis comparing features of the intracellular immune-receptor repertoires with trait data of 187 species shows that in wild plants, the size of the molecular defense repertoire correlates negatively with growth. By contrast, we do not find evidence for a growth–defense trade-off in agricultural plants.

In this work, we report the noncovalent synthesis of unprecedented plastics that are mechanically strong yet metabolizable under biologically relevant conditions owing to their dissociative nature with electrolytes. Salt-bridging sodium hexametaphosphate with di- or tritopic guanidinium sulfate in water forms a cross-linked supramolecular network, which is stable unless electrolytes are resupplied. This unusual stability is caused by a liquid-liquid phase separation that expels sodium sulfate, generated upon salt bridging, into a water-rich phase. Drying the remaining condensed liquid phase yields glassy plastics that are thermally reshapable, such as thermoplastics, and usable even in aqueous media with hydrophobic parylene C coating. This approach can be extended to polysaccharide-based supramolecular plastics that are applicable for three-dimensional printing.",

It contains a high density of straight, selective nanochannels, enabling the preferential transport of aromatic molecules. Compared with traditional mixed-matrix membranes with random orientations, the OMP membrane improves the pervaporation separation index for aromatic-aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures with C 6 and C 7 compounds, surpassing the performance of existing membranes by 3 to 10 times. This high performance demonstrates the potential of OMP membranes for hydrocarbon molecular separation and their application in the value-added separation of naphtha feedstocks.",

However, new aircraft-based measurements revealed total gas-phase organic carbon emissions that exceed oil sands industry–reported values by 1900% to over 6300%, the bulk of which was due to unaccounted-for intermediate-volatility and semivolatile organic compounds. Measured facility-wide emissions represented approximately 1% of extracted petroleum, resulting in total organic carbon emissions equivalent to that from all other sources across Canada combined. These real-world observations demonstrate total organic carbon measurements as a means of detecting unknown or underreported carbon emissions regardless of chemical features. Because reporting gaps may include hazardous, reactive, or secondary air pollutants, fully constraining the impact of anthropogenic emissions necessitates routine, comprehensive total organic carbon monitoring as an inherent check on mass closure.",

However, the influence of genetic variation in immunosurveillance on cancer risk is not well understood. Leveraging population-level data from the UK Biobank and FinnGen, we show that heterozygosity at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -II loci is associated with reduced lung cancer risk in smokers. Fine-mapping implicated amino acid heterozygosity in the HLA -II peptide binding groove in reduced lung cancer risk, and single-cell analyses showed that smoking drives enrichment of proinflammatory lung macrophages and HLA -II+ epithelial cells. In lung cancer, widespread loss of HLA -II heterozygosity (LOH) favored loss of alleles with larger neopeptide repertoires. Thus, our findings nominate genetic variation in immunosurveillance as a critical risk factor for lung cancer.",

Pollen tubes of newly polyploid A. arenosa grow slowly, have aberrant anatomy and disrupted physiology, often burst prematurely, and have altered gene expression. These phenotypes recover in evolved polyploids. We also show that gametophytic (pollen tube) genotypes of two tip-growth genes under selection in natural tetraploid A. arenosa are strongly associated with pollen tube performance in the tetraploid.

The method works particularly well with neural network ansätze, and by combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer ansätze, we can accurately recover excitation energies and oscillator strengths on a range of molecules. We achieve accurate vertical excitation energies on benzene-scale molecules, including challenging double excitations. Beyond the examples presented in this work, we expect that this technique will be of interest for atomic, nuclear, and condensed matter physics.",

As atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide doubled from about 410 to about 860 ppm (parts per million) in the latest Permian, the meridional overturning circulation collapsed, the Hadley cell contracted, and El Niños intensified. The resultant deforestation, reef demise, and plankton crisis marked the start of a cascading environmental disaster. Reduced carbon sequestration initiated positive feedback, producing a warmer hothouse and, consequently, stronger El Niños. The compounding effects of elevated climate variability and mean state warming led to catastrophic but diachronous terrestrial and marine losses.",

We demonstrate an alternative pathway, where hydrogenation of layered transition metal oxide cathodes induces self-discharge through hydrogen transfer from carbonate solvents to delithiated oxides. In self-discharged cathodes, we further observe opposing proton and lithium ion concentration gradients, which contribute to chemical and structural heterogeneities within delithiated cathodes, accelerating degradation. Hydrogenation occurring in delithiated cathodes may affect the chemo-mechanical coupling of layered cathodes as well as the calendar life of lithium-ion batteries.",

We report that Arabidopsis Decapping 5 (DCP5) functions as a multifunctional cytoplasmic osmosensor that senses and responds to extracellular hyperosmolarity. DCP5 harbors a plant-specific intramolecular crowding sensor (ICS) that undergoes conformational change and drives phase separation in response to osmotically intensified molecular crowding. Upon hyperosmolarity exposure, DCP5 rapidly and reversibly assembles to DCP5-enriched osmotic stress granules (DOSGs), which sequestrate plenty of mRNA and regulatory proteins, and thus adaptively reprograms both the translatome and transcriptome to facilitate plant osmotic stress adaptation. Our findings uncover a cytoplasmic osmosensing mechanism mediated by DCP5 with plant-specific molecular crowding sensitivity and suggest a stress sensory function for hyperosmotically induced stress granules.",

However, natural gene diversity accumulates slowly and likely excludes large regions of functional sequence space, limiting the information that is encoded and extractable. We introduce upgraded orthogonal DNA replication (OrthoRep) systems that radically accelerate the evolution of chosen genes under selection in yeast. When applied to a maladapted biosynthetic enzyme, we obtained collections of extensively diverged sequences with patterns that revealed structural and environmental constraints shaping the enzyme’s activity. Our upgraded OrthoRep systems should support the discovery of factors influencing gene evolution, uncover previously unknown regions of fitness landscapes, and find broad applications in biomolecular engineering.",

One feature thereof is the hyperutilization of codons that lack genome-encoded Watson-Crick transfer RNAs (tRNAs), instead relying on the posttranscriptional tRNA modification inosine (I34), which expands the decoding capacity of specific tRNAs through wobbling. Antibody-secreting cells had increased I34 levels and were more reliant on I34 for protein production than naïve B cells. Furthermore, antibody I34-dependent codon usage may influence B cell passage through regulatory checkpoints. Our work elucidates the interface between the tRNA pool and protein production in the immune system and has implications for the design and selection of antibodies for vaccines and therapeutics.",

Using quantitative super-resolution imaging, we identified two discrete populations of chromatin-bound cohesin in postreplicative human cells. Whereas most complexes appear dimeric, cohesin that localized to sites of sister chromatid cohesion and associated with sororin was exclusively monomeric. The monomeric stoichiometry of sororin:cohesin complexes demonstrates that sister chromatid cohesion is conferred by individual cohesin rings, a key prediction of the proposal that cohesion arises from the co-entrapment of sister DNAs.",

Here, we demonstrate that an HMG-box gene acts as the male-determining factor in brown algae, mirroring the role HMG-box genes play in sex determination in animals. Over a billion-year evolutionary timeline, these lineages have independently co-opted the HMG box for male determination, representing a paradigm for evolution’s ability to recurrently use the same genetic “toolkit” to accomplish similar tasks.",

However, their molecular interaction with F-actin and their mechanism of action remain unclear. In this work, we present high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures of F-actin barbed ends bound by three distinct formins, revealing a common asymmetric formin conformation imposed by the filament. Formation of new intersubunit contacts during actin polymerization sterically displaces formin and triggers its translocation. This “undock-and-lock” mechanism explains how actin-filament growth is coordinated with formin movement. Filament elongation speeds are controlled by the positioning and stability of actin-formin interfaces, which distinguish fast and slow formins. Furthermore, we provide a structure of the actin-formin-profilin ring complex, which resolves how profilin is rapidly released from the barbed end during filament elongation.",

In this work, we report a year-long, nationwide study of diarrheal disease patients in Bangladesh. Among cholera patients, we quantified Vibrio cholerae (prey) and its virulent phages (predators) using metagenomics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction while accounting for antibiotic exposure using quantitative mass spectrometry. Virulent phage (ICP1) and antibiotics suppressed V. cholerae to varying degrees and were inversely associated with severe dehydration depending on resistance mechanisms. In the absence of antiphage defenses, predation was “effective,” with a high predator:prey ratio that correlated with increased genetic diversity among the prey. In the presence of antiphage defenses, predation was “ineffective,” with a lower predator:prey ratio that correlated with increased genetic diversity among the predators. Phage-bacteria coevolution within patients should therefore be considered in the deployment of phage-based therapies and diagnostics.",

Because of the favorable reactivity that often cannot be achieved with other aryl(pseudo)halides, diazonium chemistry continues to grow. Facile extrusion of dinitrogen contributes to the desired reactivity but is also reason for safety concerns. Explosions have occurred since the discovery of these reagents and still result in accidents. In this study, we report a diazonium chemistry paradigm shift based on nitrate reduction using thiosulfate or dihalocuprates as electron donors that avoids diazonium accumulation. Because nitrate reduction is rate-limiting, aryldiazoniums are produced as fleeting intermediates, which results in a safer and often more efficient deaminative halogenation in a single step from anilines.",

Only 10.4% of caQTLs are shared between neurons and non-neurons, which supports cell type–specific genetic regulation of the brain regulome. Incorporating allele-specific chromatin accessibility improves statistical fine-mapping and refines molecular mechanisms that underlie disease risk.

In all cases, the substrate displays the same structural features: a transmembrane α-helix, a three-residue linker, and a β-strand that forms a hybrid β-sheet with presenilin 1 (PS1). Proteolytic cleavage occurs just ahead of the substrate β-strand. Each cleavage is followed by unwinding and translocation of the substrate α-helix by one turn and the formation of a new β-strand. This mechanism is consistent with existing biochemical data and may explain the cleavages of other substrates by γ-secretase.",

The chirality of WS 2 ribbon was defined by substrate couplings into tunable armchair, zigzag, and chiral species, and the polarity direction was determined by the ribbon-precursor interfacial energy along a coherent direction.

BAT thermogenesis is considered an overarching mammalian trait, but its evolutionary origin is unknown. We show that adipose tissue of marsupials, which diverged from eutherian mammals ~ 150 million years ago, expresses a nonthermogenic UCP1 variant governed by a partial transcriptomic BAT signature similar to that found in eutherian beige adipose tissue. We found that the reconstructed UCP1 sequence of the common eutherian ancestor displayed typical thermogenic activity, whereas therian ancestor UCP1 is nonthermogenic. Thus, mammalian adipose tissue thermogenesis may have evolved in two distinct stages, with a prethermogenic stage in the common therian ancestor linking UCP1 expression to adipose tissue and thermal stress. We propose that in a second stage, UCP1 acquired its thermogenic function specifically in eutherians, such that the onset of mammalian BAT thermogenesis occurred only after the divergence from marsupials.",

The prokaryotic Argonaute protein DdmE uses a DNA guide to target plasmid DNA. The structure of the DdmDE complex, validated by in vivo mutational studies, shows that DNA binding by DdmE triggers disassembly of the DdmD dimer and loading of monomeric DdmD onto the nontarget DNA strand. In vitro studies indicate that DdmD translocates in the 5′-to-3′ direction, while partially degrading the plasmid DNA.

This bradycardia was prevented by inactivating anterior cingulate cortical (ACC) neurons projecting to the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VMT). Theta-rhythm stimulation of the ACC-to-VMT pathway replicated the bradycardia.

Currently, successful examples rely primarily on either intramolecular variants or cyclic imine equivalents. To unlock the full synthetic potential of aza Paternò–Büchi reactions, it is essential to extend the reaction to acyclic imine equivalents. Here, we report that matching of the frontier molecular orbital energies of alkenes with those of acyclic oximes enables visible light–mediated aza Paternò–Büchi reactions through triplet energy transfer catalysis. The utility of this reaction is further showcased in the synthesis of epi- penaresidin B. Density functional theory computations reveal that a competition between the desired [2+2]-cycloaddition and alkene dimerization determines the success of the reaction. Frontier orbital energy matching between the reactive components lowers transition-state energy (Δ G ǂ ) values and ultimately promotes reactivity.",

We demonstrate that the correlation of an axon branch’s activity with neighboring axons or postsynaptic neurons predicts whether the branch will be added, stabilized, or eliminated. Desynchronizing individual axons from their local networks, changing the pattern of correlated activity, or blocking N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors all significantly altered single-axon morphology.

We synthesized bivalent molecules that link ligands of the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These molecules relocalized CDK9 to BCL6-bound DNA and directed phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. The resulting expression of pro-apoptotic, BCL6-target genes caused killing of diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells and specific ablation of the BCL6-regulated germinal center response. Genomics and proteomics corroborated a gain-of-function mechanism in which global kinase activity was not inhibited but rather redirected. Thus, kinase inhibitors can be used to context-specifically activate transcription.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggested that the copy number of the human salivary amylase gene, AMY1 , correlates with starch-rich diets. However, evolutionary analyses are hampered by the absence of accurate, sequence-resolved haplotype variation maps. We identified 30 structurally distinct haplotypes at nucleotide resolution among 98 present-day humans, revealing that the coding sequences of AMY1 copies are evolving under negative selection. Genomic analyses of these haplotypes in archaic hominins and ancient human genomes suggest that a common three-copy haplotype, dating as far back as 800,000 years ago, has seeded rapidly evolving rearrangements through recurrent nonallelic homologous recombination. Additionally, haplotypes with more than three AMY1 copies have significantly increased in frequency among European farmers over the past 4000 years, potentially as an adaptive response to increased starch digestion.",

    "abstract": "Ixotrophy is a contact-dependent predatory strategy of filamentous bacteria in aquatic environments for which the molecular mechanism remains unknown. We show that predator-prey contact can be established by gliding motility or extracellular assemblages we call “grappling hooks.” Cryo–electron microscopy identified the grappling hooks as heptamers of a type IX secretion system substrate. After close predator-prey contact is established, cryo–electron tomography and functional assays showed that puncturing by a type VI secretion system mediated killing. Single-cell analyses with stable isotope–labeled prey revealed that prey components are taken up by the attacker. Depending on nutrient availability, insertion sequence elements toggle the activity of ixotrophy. A marine metagenomic time series shows coupled dynamics of ixotrophic bacteria and prey. We found that the mechanism of ixotrophy involves multiple cellular machineries, is conserved, and may shape microbial populations in the environment.",

We further explored the regulatory roles of the immune system on aging and pinpointed specific age-related cell population expansions that are lymphocyte dependent.

Here, we show that perivascular fibroblasts in the corpora cavernosa support vasodilation by reducing norepinephrine availability. The effect on penile blood flow depends on the number of fibroblasts, which is regulated by erectile activity. Erection dynamically alters the positional arrangement of fibroblasts, temporarily down-regulating Notch signaling. Inhibition of Notch increases fibroblast numbers and consequently raises penile blood flow. Continuous Notch activation lowers fibroblast numbers and reduces penile blood perfusion. Recurrent erections stimulate fibroblast proliferation and limit vasoconstriction, whereas aging reduces the number of fibroblasts and lowers penile blood flow. Our findings reveal adaptive, erectile activity-dependent modulation of penile blood flow by fibroblasts.",

Although these scaling patterns are ubiquitous, how they arise is poorly understood. To explain these patterns, we used an eco-evolutionary predator–prey model parameterized using data for phytoplankton and zooplankton. We show that allometric scaling relationships at lower levels of biological organization, such as body-size scaling of nutrient uptake and predation, give rise to scaling relationships at the food web and ecosystem levels. Our predicted macroecological scaling exponents agree well with observed values across ecosystems. Our findings explicitly connect scaling relationships at different levels of biological organization to ecological and evolutionary mechanisms, yielding testable hypotheses for how observed macroecological patterns emerge.",

We developed an assay to detect neotelomere formation at Cas9- or I-SceI–induced DSBs in human cells. Telomerase added telomeric repeats to DSBs, leading to interstitial telomeric repeat insertions or the formation of functional neotelomeres accompanied by terminal deletions. The threat that telomerase poses to genome integrity was minimized by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase signaling, which inhibited telomerase at resected DSBs. In addition to acting at resected DSBs, telomerase used the extruded strand in the Cas9 enzyme-product complex as a primer for neotelomere formation. We propose that although neotelomere formation is detrimental in normal human cells, it may allow cancer cells to escape from breakage-fusion-bridge cycles.",

Earlier attempts to selectively synthesize pantetheine failed, leading to suggestions that “simpler” thiols must have preceded pantetheine at the origin of life. In this work, we report high-yielding and selective prebiotic syntheses of pantetheine in water. Chemoselective multicomponent aldol, iminolactone, and aminonitrile reactions delivered spontaneous differentiation of pantoic acid and proteinogenic amino acid syntheses, as well as the dihydroxyl, gem-dimethyl, and β-alanine-amide moieties of pantetheine in dilute water. Our results are consistent with a role for canonical pantetheine at the outset of life on Earth.",

We report James Webb Space Telescope and Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations of a FUV-irradiated protoplanetary disk in the Orion Nebula. Emission lines are detected from the PDR; modeling their kinematics and excitation allowed us to constrain the physical conditions within the gas. We quantified the mass-loss rate induced by the FUV irradiation and found that it is sufficient to remove gas from the disk in less than a million years. This is rapid enough to affect giant planet formation in the disk.",

In this study, we identify ELKIN1 as an ion channel likely gated by mechanical force, necessary for normal touch sensitivity in mice. Touch insensitivity in Elkin1 −/− mice was caused by a loss of mechanically activated currents (MA currents) in around half of all sensory neurons activated by light touch (low-threshold mechanoreceptors). Reintroduction of Elkin1 into sensory neurons from Elkin1 −/− mice restored MA currents. Additionally, small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown of ELKIN1 from induced human sensory neurons substantially reduced indentation-induced MA currents, supporting a conserved role for ELKIN1 in human touch. Our data identify ELKIN1 as a core component of touch transduction in mice and potentially in humans.",

We show using direct numerical simulations with spatial resolutions of 12288 2 × 384 points that rotating and stratified flows can support a bidirectional cascade of energy, in three dimensions, with a ratio of Rossby to Froude numbers comparable to that of Earth’s atmosphere. Our results establish that, in dry atmospheres, spontaneous order can arise through an inverse cascade to the largest spatial scales.",

By tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of a pulsed electron wave packet diffracted by a 60-femtosecond (where one femtosecond = 10 −15 seconds) standing wave pulse in a pump-probe scheme, we observed time-dependent diffraction patterns. The fringe spacing in the observed pattern differs from that generated by the conventional Kapitza-Dirac effect. By exploiting this time-resolved diffraction scheme, we can access the time evolution of the phase properties of a free electron and potentially image ionic potentials and electronic decoherences.",

One potential origin is the growth of less-massive black holes merging with stars and compact objects within globular clusters (GCs). However, previous simulations have indicated that this process only produces IMBHs under 500 M ⊙ before gravitational wave recoil ejects them from the GC. We performed star-by-star simulations of GC formation, finding that high-density star formation in a GC’s parent giant molecular cloud can produce sufficient mergers of massive stars to overcome that mass threshold. We conclude that GCs can form with IMBHs more than 10 3 M ⊙⨀ , which is sufficiently massive to be retained within the GC even with the expected gravitational wave recoil.",

    "abstract": "Understanding cellular architectures and their connectivity is essential for interrogating system function and dysfunction. However, we lack technologies for mapping the multiscale details of individual cells and their connectivity in the human organ–scale system. We developed a platform that simultaneously extracts spatial, molecular, morphological, and connectivity information of individual cells from the same human brain. The platform includes three core elements: a vibrating microtome for ultraprecision slicing of large-scale tissues without losing cellular connectivity (MEGAtome), a polymer hydrogel–based tissue processing technology for multiplexed multiscale imaging of human organ–scale tissues (mELAST), and a computational pipeline for reconstructing three-dimensional connectivity across multiple brain slabs (UNSLICE). We applied this platform for analyzing human Alzheimer’s disease pathology at multiple scales and demonstrating scalable neural connectivity mapping in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "The human mitochondrial genome encodes crucial oxidative phosphorylation system proteins, pivotal for aerobic energy transduction. They are translated from nine monocistronic and two bicistronic transcripts whose native structures remain unexplored, posing a gap in understanding mitochondrial gene expression. In this work, we devised the mitochondrial dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (mitoDMS-MaPseq) method and applied detection of RNA folding ensembles using expectation-maximization (DREEM) clustering to unravel the native mitochondrial messenger RNA (mt-mRNA) structurome in wild-type (WT) and leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat–containing protein (LRPPRC)–deficient cells. Our findings elucidate LRPPRC’s role as a holdase contributing to maintaining mt-mRNA folding and efficient translation. mt-mRNA structural insights in WT mitochondria, coupled with metabolic labeling, unveil potential mRNA-programmed translational pausing and a distinct programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Our data define a critical layer of mitochondrial gene expression regulation. These mt-mRNA folding maps provide a reference for studying mt-mRNA structures in diverse physiological and pathological contexts.",

In this work, we show wide resistance plateaus in kink states—a manifestation of the quantum valley Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene—quantized to the predicted value at zero magnetic field. The plateau resistance has a very weak temperature dependence up to 50 kelvin and is flat within a dc bias window of tens of millivolts. We demonstrate the electrical operation of a topology-controlled switch with an on/off ratio of 200. These results demonstrate the robustness and tunability of the kink states and its promise in constructing electron quantum optics devices.",

In this work, we report the “PKZILLAs,” massive P. parvum polyketide synthase (PKS) genes that have evaded previous detection. PKZILLA-1 and -2 encode giant protein products of 4.7 and 3.2 megadaltons that have 140 and 99 enzyme domains. Their predicted polyene product matches the proposed pre-prymnesin precursor of the 90-carbon–backbone A-type prymnesins. We further characterize the variant PKZILLA-B1, which is responsible for the shorter B-type analog prymnesin-B1, from P. parvum RCC3426 and thus establish a general model of haptophyte polyether biosynthetic logic. This work expands expectations of genetic and enzymatic size limits in biology.",

Here, we quantify the biodiversity changes associated with the MSC based on a compilation of the Mediterranean fossil record.

Upon bacteriophage infection, a template region of this RNA is reverse transcribed into an array of tandem repeats that reconstitute a promoter and open reading frame, allowing expression of a toxic repetitive protein and an abortive infection response. Biochemical reconstitution of this activity and cryo–electron microscopy provide a molecular basis for repeat synthesis.

We measured the spatial cognitive abilities and tracked the life span of 227 mountain chickadees ( Poecile gambeli ) in their natural environment and found that individuals with better spatial learning and memory abilities involved in food caching lived longer. These results confirm that enhanced cognitive abilities can be associated with longer life in wild animals and that selection on cognitive abilities can lead to increased life span.",

Recently discovered global epistasis, in which the fitness effects of mutations scale with the fitness of the background genotype, can improve predictions, but how the environment modulates this scaling is unknown. We measured the fitness effects of ~100 insertion mutations in 42 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in six laboratory environments and found that the global epistasis scaling is nearly invariant across environments. Instead, the environment tunes one global parameter, the background fitness at which most mutations switch sign. As a consequence, the distribution of mutational effects is predictable across genotypes and environments. Our results suggest that the effective dimensionality of genotype-to-phenotype maps across environments is surprisingly low.",

Hepatic branch vagotomy also prevents food intake disruptions induced by high-fat diet feeding and reduces body weight gain. Our findings reveal a homeostatic feedback signal that relies on communication between the liver and the brain to control circadian food intake patterns. This identifies the hepatic vagus nerve as a potential therapeutic target for obesity in the setting of chronodisruption.",

The lipase-like proteins EDS1 and PAD4 transduce immune signals from sensor TIR-NLRs to a helper NLR called ADR1, which executes immune function. We report the structure and function of an Arabidopsis EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 (EPA) heterotrimer in complex with pRib-AMP/ADP activated by plant or bacterial TIR signaling. 2′cADPR can be hydrolyzed into pRib-AMP and thus activate EPA signaling. Bacterial TIR domains producing 2′cADPR also activate EPA function. Our findings suggest that 2′cADPR may be the storage form of the unstable signaling molecule pRib-AMP.",

We then combined >35 billion positions from 176,000 ships to produce a global estimate of whale-ship collision risk. Shipping occurs across 92% of whale ranges, and <7% of risk hotspots contain management strategies to reduce collisions. Full coverage of hotspots could be achieved by expanding management over only 2.6% of the ocean’s surface.

However, the impact of nutrient metabolism on epigenetic modifications that control TEX differentiation remains unclear. We showed that TEX cells shifted from acetate to citrate metabolism by down-regulating acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) while maintaining ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) activity. This metabolic switch increased citrate-dependent histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferase KAT2A-ACLY interactions, at TEX signature genes while reducing acetate-dependent histone acetylation, dependent on p300-ACSS2 complexes, at effector and memory T cell genes. Nuclear ACSS2 overexpression or ACLY inhibition prevented TEX differentiation and enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses. These findings unveiled a nutrient-instructed histone code governing CD8 + T cell differentiation, with implications for metabolic- and epigenetic-based T cell therapies.",

Comparative analyses suggest that this new trait arose convergently through “spontaneous coincidence” of the required trait combination, rather than directional selection in the component traits.

However, straying from the MEP—roaming—has been recognized as an unconventional reaction mechanism and found to occur in both the ground and first excited states.

We report a dissociation channel to produce electronically excited fragments, S( 1 D)+O 2 (a 1 Δ g ), from SO 2 photodissociation in highly excited states. The results revealed two dissociation pathways: One proceeds through the MEP to produce vibrationally colder O 2 (a 1 Δ g ) and the other yields vibrationally hotter O 2 (a 1 Δ g ) by means of a roaming pathway involving an intramolecular O abstraction during reorientation motion. Such roaming dynamics may well be the rule rather than the exception for molecular photodissociation through highly excited states.",

Some NLRs are encoded in tightly linked co-regulated head-to-head genes whose products function together as pairs. We uncover the oligomerization requirements for different Arabidopsis paired CHS3-CSA1 alleles. These pairs form resting-state heterodimers that oligomerize into complexes distinct from NLRs analyzed previously. Oligomerization requires both conserved and allele-specific features of the respective CHS3 and CSA1 Toll-like interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains. The receptor kinases BAK1 and BIRs inhibit CHS3-CSA1 pair oligomerization to maintain the CHS3-CSA1 heterodimer in an inactive state. Our study reveals that paired NLRs hetero-oligomerize and likely form a distinctive “dimer of heterodimers” and that structural heterogeneity is expected even among alleles of closely related paired NLRs.",

In this work, we show that cytoplasmic incompatibility factor A (CifA) and B (CifB) proteins, encoded by prophage WO of the endosymbiont Wolbachia, alter long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and DNA during Drosophila sperm development to establish a paternal-effect embryonic lethality known as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CifA is a ribonuclease (RNase) that depletes a spermatocyte lncRNA important for the histone-to-protamine transition of spermiogenesis. Both CifA and CifB are deoxyribonucleases (DNases) that elevate DNA damage in late spermiogenesis. lncRNA knockdown enhances CI, and mutagenesis links lncRNA depletion and subsequent sperm chromatin integrity changes to embryonic DNA damage and CI. Hence, prophage proteins interact with eukaryotic macromolecules during gametogenesis to create a symbiosis that is fundamental to insect evolution and vector control.",

However, these modes cannot be reconfigured after fabrication because they are fixed by the resonator’s physical geometry. In this work, we propose a Moiré speedup dispersion tuning method that enables a microresonator device to operate in any of three modes. Electrical tuning of Vernier coupled rings switches operating modality to Brillouin laser, bright microcomb, and dark microcomb operation on demand using the same hybrid-integrated device. Brillouin phase matching and microcomb operation across the telecom C-band is demonstrated. Likewise, by using a single-pump wavelength, the operating mode can be switched. As a result, one universal design can be applied across a range of applications. The device brings flexible mixed-mode operation to integrated photonic circuits.",

When two droplets approach one another, the thin film that separates them invariably becomes unstable, causing the droplets to coalesce. The only known way to avoid this instability is through addition of a third component, typically a surfactant, which stabilizes the thin film at its equilibrium thickness. We report the observation that a thin fluid film of oil separating two water droplets can lead to an adhesive interaction between the droplets. Moreover, this interaction prevents their coalescence over timescales of several weeks, without the use of any surfactant or solvent.",

    "abstract": "Liver mitochondria play a central role in metabolic adaptations to changing nutritional states, yet their dynamic regulation upon anticipated changes in nutrient availability has remained unaddressed. Here, we found that sensory food perception rapidly induced mitochondrial fragmentation in the liver through protein kinase B/AKT (AKT)–dependent phosphorylation of serine 131 of the mitochondrial fission factor (MFFS131). This response was mediated by activation of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)–expressing neurons. A nonphosphorylatable MFF S131G knock-in mutation abrogated AKT-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in vitro. In vivo, MFF S131G knock-in mice displayed altered liver mitochondrial dynamics and impaired insulin-stimulated suppression of hepatic glucose production. Thus, rapid activation of a hypothalamus–liver axis can adapt mitochondrial function to anticipated changes of nutritional state in control of hepatic glucose metabolism.",

We prepared the initial nuclear spins in KRb (potassium-rubidium) in an entangled state by lowering the magnetic field to where the spin-spin interaction dominates and characterized the preserved coherence in nuclear spin wave function after the reaction. We observed an interference pattern that is consistent with full coherence at the end of the reaction, suggesting that entanglement prepared within the reactants could be redistributed through the atom-exchange process.",

In this study, we report on a register that uses both optical tweezers and optical lattices to deterministically assemble a two-dimensional array of atoms in an optical cavity. Harnessing a single atom–addressing beam, we stimulate the emission of a photon from each atom and demonstrate multiplexed atom-photon entanglement with a generation-to-detection efficiency approaching 90%.

CA1 neurons and assemblies that increased their activity during learning were reactivated during SWRs but inhibited during BARRs. The initial increase in reactivation during SWRs returned to baseline through sleep. This trend was abolished by silencing CCK+ basket cells during BARRs, resulting in higher synchrony of CA1 assemblies and impaired memory consolidation.",

Although the drying influence of global warming is well established, the role of existing drylands in their own expansion is relatively unknown. In this work, by tracking the air flowing over drylands, we show that the warming and drying of that air contributes to dryland expansion in the downwind direction. As they dry, drylands contribute less moisture and more heat to downwind humid regions, reducing precipitation and increasing atmospheric water demand, which ultimately causes their aridification. In ~40% of the land area that recently transitioned from a humid region into a dryland, self-expansion accounted for >50% of the observed aridification. Our results corroborate the urgent need for climate change mitigation measures in drylands to decelerate their own expansion.",

We determined the structure of ATP synthase within mitochondria of the unicellular flagellate Polytomella by electron cryo-tomography and subtomogram averaging at up to 4.2-angstrom resolution, revealing six rotary positions of the central stalk, subclassified into 21 substates of the F 1 head. The Polytomella ATP synthase forms helical arrays with multiple adjacent rows defining the cristae ridges. The structure of ATP synthase under native operating conditions in the presence of a membrane potential represents a pivotal step toward the analysis of membrane protein complexes in situ.",

The billion-molecule docking found PAMs with a 2.7-fold higher hit rate than the million-molecule library, with hits up to 37-fold more potent. Structure-based optimization led to nanomolar leads. In ex vivo organ assays, one of these PAMs was 100-fold more potent than the standard of care, cinacalcet, and reduced serum PTH levels in mice without the hypocalcemia typical of CaSR drugs.

In this work, we disclose a facile oxidative addition and decarbonylation sequence that forms monoalkylnickel(II) intermediates through a nonradical process. The key ligand, bis(4-methylpyrazole)pyridine, accelerates decarbonylation, stabilizes the alkylnickel(II) intermediate, and destabilizes off-cycle nickel(0) carbonyl species.

PBP2a can replace the transpeptidase activity of the endogenous and essential PBP2 but not that of PBP1, which is responsible for the distinctive native septal peptidoglycan architecture. Successful division without PBP1 activity requires the alternative division mode and is enabled by several possible chromosomal potentiator ( pot ) mutations.

    "abstract": "An important challenge in enantioselective catalysis is developing strategies for the precise synthesis of neighboring congested all-carbon quaternary stereocenters. The well-defined transition states of [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements and their underlying stereospecificity render them powerful tools for the synthesis of such arrays. However, this type of pericyclic reaction remains notoriously difficult to catalyze, especially in an enantioselective fashion. Herein, we describe an enantioselective reductive Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement catalyzed by chiral 1,3,2-diazaphospholene-hydrides. This developed transformation enables full control of the two newly formed acyclic stereogenic centers, leading to amides with vicinal all-carbon quaternary-tertiary or quaternary-quaternary carbon atoms.",

Using data from 19 sites across 22 degrees of longitude along the tree line of northern Alaska, we show a stronger temporal correlation of tree ring growth with open water uncovered by retreating Arctic sea ice than with air temperature. Spatially, our results suggest that tree growth, recruitment, and range expansion are causally linked to open water through associated warmer temperatures, deeper snowpacks, and improved nutrient availability. We apply a meta-analysis to 82 circumarctic sites, finding that proportionally more tree lines have advanced where proximal to ongoing sea ice loss. Taken together, these findings underpin how and where changing sea ice conditions facilitate high-latitude forest advance.",

The key gene for gramine formation has remained elusive, hampering breeding initiatives. In this work, we report that a gene encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP76M57, which we name AMI synthase (AMIS), enables the production of gramine in Nicotiana benthamiana , Arabidopsis thaliana , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . We reconstituted gramine production in the gramine-free barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) variety Golden Promise and eliminated it from cultivar Tafeno by Cas-mediated gene editing. In vitro experiments unraveled that an unexpected cryptic oxidative rearrangement underlies this noncanonical conversion of an amino acid to a chain-shortened biogenic amine. The discovery of the genetic basis of gramine formation now permits tailor-made optimization of gramine-linked traits in barley by plant breeding.",

The life span of nuclear RNAs, which are critical for proper chromatin architecture and transcription regulation, has not been determined in adult tissues. In this work, we identified and characterized nuclear RNAs that do not turn over for at least 2 years in a subset of postnatally born cells in the mouse brain. These long-lived RNAs were stably retained in nuclei in a neural cell type–specific manner and were required for the maintenance of heterochromatin. Thus, the life span of neural cells may depend on both the molecular longevity of DNA for the storage of genetic information and also the extreme stability of RNA for the functional organization of chromatin.",

The single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) phage PP7 binds to T4P and is brought to the cell surface through pilus retraction. Using fluorescence microscopy, we discovered that PP7 detaches T4P, which impairs cell motility and restricts the pathogen’s virulence. Using cryo–electron microscopy, mutagenesis, optical trapping, and Langevin dynamics simulation, we resolved the structure of PP7, T4P, and the PP7/T4P complex and showed that T4P detachment is driven by the affinity between the phage maturation protein and its bound pilin, plus the pilus retraction force and speed, and pilus bending. Pilus detachment may be widespread among other ssRNA phages and their retractile pilus systems and offers new prospects for antibacterial prophylaxis and therapeutics.",

Gamma-ray spectra of long GRBs are smooth, typically modeled by joint power-law segments describing a continuum, with no detected spectral lines. We report a significant (>6σ) narrow emission feature at ~10 mega–electron volts (MeV) in the spectrum of the bright GRB 221009A. Over 80 seconds, it evolves in energy (~12 to ~6 MeV) and in luminosity (~1.1 to <0.43 × 10 50 erg second −1 ) but has a constant width of ~1 MeV. We interpret this feature as a blueshifted spectral line produced by the annihilation of electron-positron pairs, potentially in the same location responsible for emitting the brightest GRB pulses.",

Mantle composition and evolution have been primarily inferred by surface sampling and indirect methods. We recovered a long (1268-meter) section of serpentinized abyssal mantle peridotite interleaved with thin gabbroic intrusions. We find depleted compositions with notable variations in mantle mineralogy controlled by melt flow. Dunite zones have predominantly intermediate dips, in contrast to the originally steep mantle fabrics, indicative of oblique melt transport. Extensive hydrothermal fluid-rock interaction is recorded across the full depth of the core and is overprinted by oxidation in the upper 200 meters. Alteration patterns are consistent with vent fluid composition in the nearby Lost City hydrothermal field.",

However, whether it shapes coping strategies when facing future threats remains unknown. We found that mice that briefly observe a conspecific being harmed become resilient, withstanding behavioral despair after an adverse experience. Photometric recordings during negative emotional contagion revealed increased serotonin (5-HT) release in the lateral habenula. Whereas 5-HT and emotional contagion reduced habenular burst firing, limiting 5-HT synthesis prevented burst plasticity. Enhancing raphe-to-habenula 5-HT was sufficient to recapitulate resilience. In contrast, reducing 5-HT release in the habenula made witnessing a conspecific in distress ineffective to promote the resilient phenotype after adversity. These findings reveal that 5-HT supports vicarious emotions and leads to resilience by tuning definite patterns of habenular neuronal activity.",

Yet, other environmental changes may affect the geographical distribution of species in unexpected ways. Here, we quantify multidecadal shifts in the distribution of European forest plants and link these shifts to key drivers of forest biodiversity change: climate change, atmospheric deposition (nitrogen and sulfur), and forest canopy dynamics. Surprisingly, westward distribution shifts were 2.6 times more likely than northward ones. Not climate change, but nitrogen-mediated colonization events, possibly facilitated by the recovery from past acidifying deposition, best explain westward movements. Biodiversity redistribution patterns appear complex and are more likely driven by the interplay among several environmental changes than due to the exclusive effects of climate change alone.",

Treating germ-free mice with N -oleoylarginine and N -oleolyhistidine, major products of FAAH OEA metabolism, markedly affected expression of intestinal immune function pathways. Administering MDCF to Bangladeshi children considerably reduced fecal OEA, a satiety factor whose levels were negatively correlated with abundance and expression of their F. prausnitzii FAAH. This enzyme, structurally and catalytically distinct from mammalian FAAH, is positioned to regulate levels of a variety of bioactive molecules.",

However, devising strategies to introduce two distinct amines selectively in the construction of unsymmetrical ureas remains a challenge. In this work, we use a synchronous recognition strategy that takes advantage of radical and nucleophilic activation to discriminate between secondary and primary amines. Specifically, a copper catalyst preferentially oxidizes secondary amines to radical species, whereas a cobalt catalyst carbonylates primary amines to produce cobalt amides. Coupling these fragments by cooperative catalysis produces unsymmetrical ureas with high selectivity, as showcased by the modification of 41 biologically active compounds and six drugs.",

But the fabrication of miniature, soft iontronic devices according to modular designs has not been achieved. In this work, we report the use of surfactant-supported assembly of freestanding microscale hydrogel droplets to construct various iontronic modules, circuits, and biointerfaces. Chemical modifications of silk fibroin produced a pair of oppositely charged hydrogels. Microscale assembly of various combinations of hydrogel droplets produced iontronic diodes, npn- and pnp-type transistors, and diverse reconfigurable logic gates. Through the incorporation of poly(amino acid)s, we have demonstrated a droplet-based synthetic synapse with ionic polymer–mediated long-term plasticity. Further, our iontronic transistor can serve as a biocompatible sensor to record electrophysiological signals from sheets of human cardiomyocytes, paving a way to the building of miniature bioiontronic systems.",

In this work, we used single-nuclei transcriptomics to dissect the contributions of sex chromosomes and gonads in demyelination and AD. In a mouse model of demyelination, we identified the roles of sex chromosomes and gonads in modifying microglia and oligodendrocyte responses before and after myelin loss. In an AD-related mouse model expressing APOE4, XY sex chromosomes heightened interferon (IFN) response and tau-induced demyelination. The X-linked gene, Toll-like receptor 7 ( Tlr7 ), regulated sex-specific IFN response to myelin. Deletion of Tlr7 dampened sex differences while protecting against demyelination. Administering TLR7 inhibitor mitigated tau-induced motor impairment and demyelination in male mice, indicating that Tlr7 plays a role in the male-biased type I Interferon IFN response in aging- and AD-related demyelination.",

We report on the direct observation of resonant electric dipole-dipole interactions in a cubic array of atoms in the many-excitation limit. The interactions produce spatially dependent cooperative Lamb shifts when spectroscopically interrogating the millihertz-wide optical clock transition in strontium-87. We show that the ensemble-averaged shifts can be suppressed below the level of evaluated systematic uncertainties for optical atomic clocks. Additionally, we demonstrate that excitation of the atomic dipoles near a Bragg angle can enhance these effects by nearly an order of magnitude compared with nonresonant geometries. Our work demonstrates a platform for precise studies of the quantum many-body physics of spins with long-range interactions mediated by propagating photons.",

Anthropogenically enhanced oxidants [ozone (O 3 ) and nitrate radicals (NO 3 )] rapidly degrade floral scents, potentially reducing pollinator attraction to flowers. However, the physiological and behavioral impacts on pollinators and plant fitness are unknown. Using a nocturnal flower-moth system, we found that atmospherically relevant concentrations of NO 3 eliminate flower visitation by moths, and the reaction of NO 3 with a subset of monoterpenes is what reduces the scent’s attractiveness. Global atmospheric models of floral scent oxidation reveal that pollinators in certain urban areas may have a reduced ability to perceive and navigate to flowers. These results illustrate the impact of anthropogenic pollutants on an animal’s olfactory ability and indicate that such pollutants may be critical regulators of global pollination.",

Upon fertilization, the cell cycle resumes. Successful development requires that male and female gametes are in the same phase of the cell cycle. The molecular mechanisms that reinstate cell division in a fertilization-dependent manner are poorly understood in both animals and plants. Using Arabidopsis , we show that a sperm-derived signal induces the proliferation of a female gamete, the central cell, precisely upon fertilization. The central cell is arrested in S phase by the activity of the RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED1 (RBR1) protein. Upon fertilization, delivery of the core cell cycle component CYCD7;1 causes RBR1 degradation and thus S phase progression, ensuring the formation of functional endosperm and, consequently, viable seeds.",

We used data from an 8-year camera-trap survey, GPS-collared herbivores, and fecal DNA metabarcoding to analyze the timing, arrival order, and interactions among migratory grazers in Serengeti National Park. Temporal grazing succession is characterized by a “push-pull” dynamic: Competitive grazing nudges zebra ahead of co-migrating wildebeest, whereas grass consumption by these large-bodied migrants attracts trailing, small-bodied gazelle that benefit from facilitation. “Natural experiments” involving intense wildfires and rainfall respectively disrupted and strengthened these effects. Our results highlight a balance between facilitative and competitive forces in co-regulating large-scale ungulate migrations.",

We present the successful synthesis of a metal-free 2D layered perovskite, denoted as the Choi-Loh van der Waals phase (CL-v phase), with the chemical formula A 2 B 2 X 4 , where A represents a larger-sized cation compared to B and X denotes an anion. The CL-v phase exhibits a van der Waals gap enabled by interlayer hydrogen bonding and can be exfoliated or grown as molecularly thin 2D organic crystals. The dielectric constants of the CL-v phase range from 4.8 to 5.5 and we demonstrate their potential as gate dielectrics for thin-film transistors.",

Using cryo–electron microscopy, we solved the structure of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase bound to a negatively supercoiled minicircle DNA. We show how DNA gyrase captures a DNA crossover, revealing both conserved molecular grooves that accommodate the DNA helices. Together with molecular tweezer experiments, the structure shows that the DNA crossover is of positive chirality, reconciling the binding step of gyrase-mediated DNA relaxation and supercoiling in a single structure.",

N-803+bNAbs treatment induced immune activation and transient viremia but only limited reductions in the SHIV reservoir. Upon ART discontinuation, viral rebound occurred in all animals, which was followed by durable control in approximately 70% of all N-803+bNAb–treated macaques. Viral control was correlated with the reprogramming of CD8 + T cells by N-803+bNAb synergy. Thus, complete eradication of the replication-competent viral reservoir is likely not a prerequisite for the induction of sustained remission after discontinuation of ART.",

We use meteorite data to show that the implantation occurred >60 million years (Myr) after the Solar System began to form. Combining this constraint with a previous upper limit derived from Jupiter’s trojan asteroids, we conclude that the orbital instability occurred 60 to 100 Myr after the beginning of Solar System formation.

By integrating quantitative behavioral data from 57 cichlid species (702 wild-caught individuals) with high-resolution ecomorphological and genomic information, we show that exploratory behavior is linked to macrohabitat niche adaptations in Tanganyikan cichlids. Furthermore, we uncovered a correlation between the genotypes at a single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the AMPA glutamate-receptor regulatory gene cacng5b and variation in exploratory tendency.

We found that this mechanism was still required in G 2 -arrested cells to prevent cell cycle exit after the S phase. This mechanism revealed a role for CDK4/6 in maintaining the G 2 state, challenging the notion that the cell cycle is irreversible and that cells do not require mitogens after passing the restriction point. Exit from G 2 occurred during ribotoxic stress and was actively mediated by stress-activated protein kinases. Upon relief of stress, a significant fraction of cells underwent a second round of DNA replication that led to whole-genome doubling.",

    "abstract": "Tumors with the same diagnosis can have different molecular profiles and response to treatment. It remains unclear when and why these differences arise. Somatic genomic aberrations occur within the context of a highly variable germline genome. Interrogating 5870 breast cancer lesions, we demonstrated that germline-derived epitopes in recurrently amplified genes influence somatic evolution by mediating immunoediting. Individuals with a high germline-epitope burden in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ ERBB2 ) are less likely to develop HER2-positive breast cancer compared with other subtypes. The same holds true for recurrent amplicons defining three aggressive estrogen receptor (ER)–positive subgroups. Tumors that overcome such immune-mediated negative selection are more aggressive and demonstrate an “immune cold” phenotype. These data show that the germline genome plays a role in dictating somatic evolution.",

The molar entropy of disorder can be defined by Boltzmann’s formula Δ S d = R ln( W d ), where W d is the increase in the number of microscopic states, so far inaccessible experimentally. We found that the Arrhenius frequency factor A of the electron diffraction signal decay provides W d through an experimental equation A = A INT W d , where A INT is an inelastic scattering cross section. The method connects Clausius and Boltzmann experimentally and supplements the Clausius approach, being applicable to a femtogram quantity of thermally unstable and biomolecular crystals. The data also showed that crystal disordering and crystallization of melt are reciprocal, both governed by the entropy change but manifesting in opposite directions.",

However, cell-intrinsic predeterminants controlling these single-cell decisions remain enigmatic. We found that the subcellular architectures of naïve CD8 T cells, defined by the presence (T Ø ) or absence (T O ) of nuclear envelope invaginations, changed with maturation, activation, and differentiation. Upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, naïve T Ø cells displayed increased expression of the early-response gene Nr4a1 , dependent upon heightened calcium entry. Subsequently, in vitro differentiation revealed that T Ø cells generated effector-like cells more so compared with T O cells, which proliferated less and preferentially adopted a memory-precursor phenotype.

We discovered a layered cortical cytoskeleton and membrane architecture that enables hyperextensions through the folding and unfolding of cellular-scale origami. Physical models of this curved crease origami display topological singularities, including traveling developable cones and cytoskeletal twisted domain walls, which provide geometric control of hyperextension. Our work unravels how cell geometry encodes behavior in single cells and provides inspiration for geometric control in microrobotics and deployable architectures.",

In rice with clear nodes and internodes, we found that one subclade of class I knotted1-like homeobox ( KNOX1 ) genes for shoot meristem indeterminacy restricts node differentiation and allows internode formation by repressing YABBY genes for leaf development and genes from another node-specific KNOX1 subclade. YABBY s promote nodal vascular differentiation and limit stem elongation. YABBY and node-specific KNOX1 genes specify the pulvinus, which further elaborates the nodal structure for gravitropism. Notably, this KNOX1 subclade organization is specific to seed plants. We propose that nodes and internodes are distinct domains specified by YABBY – KNOX1 cross-regulation that diverged in early seed plants.",

In this work, we report a technique to overcome this issue through self-purifying release of the DEL after magnetic bead–based synthesis. Both the first and last building blocks of each assembled library member were linked to the beads by tethers that could be cleaved by mutually orthogonal chemistry. Sequential cleavage of the first and last tether, with washing in between, ensured that the final library comprises only the fully complete compounds. The outstanding purity attained by this approach enables a direct correlation of chemical display and encoding, allows for an increased chemical reaction scope, and facilitates the use of more diversity elements while achieving greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios in selections.",

Phage-derived elements are frequently strain specific in their killing activity, although there is limited evidence that this specificity drives bacterial population dynamics. Here, we identified intact phage and their derived elements in a metapopulation of wild plant–associated Pseudomonas genomes. We discovered that the most abundant viral cluster encodes a phage remnant resembling a phage tail called a tailocin, which bacteria have co-opted to kill bacterial competitors. Each pathogenic Pseudomonas strain carries one of a few distinct tailocin variants that target the variable polysaccharides in the outer membrane of co-occurring pathogenic Pseudomonas strains. Analysis of herbarium samples from the past 170 years revealed that the same tailocin and bacterial receptor variants have persisted in Pseudomonas populations. These results suggest that tailocin genetic diversity can be mined to develop targeted “tailocin cocktails” for microbial control.",

Guided by our in vivo observations, we modeled hibernation with a newly generated little brown bat ( Myotis lucifugus ) keratinocyte cell line. We uncovered the stealth intracellular lifestyle of P. destructans , which inhibits apoptosis of keratinocytes and spreads through the cells by two epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–dependent mechanisms: active penetration during torpor and induced endocytosis during arousal. Melanin of endocytosed P. destructans blocks endolysosomal maturation, facilitating P. destructans survival and germination after return to torpor. Blockade of EGFR aborts P. destructans entry into keratinocytes.",

We report here that highly acidic and confined imidodiphosphorimidate catalysts do not catalyze this reaction under homogeneous conditions.

Herein, we leveraged a mild and selective protonolysis strategy to achieve samarium-catalyzed, intermolecular reductive cross-coupling of ketones and acrylates with broad scope. The modularity of our approach allows rational control of selectivity based on solvent, p K a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant), and the samarium coordination sphere and provides a basis for future developments in catalytic and electrocatalytic lanthanide chemistry.",

A general cross-coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary aliphatic alcohols with terminal olefins to furnish >130 ethers is achieved. The mild conditions tolerate functionality that is prone to substitution, elimination, and epimerization and achieve site selectivity in polyol settings. Mechanistic studies support the hypothesis that the ligand’s geometry and electronics direct positioning of the phosphate anion at the π-allyl-palladium terminus, facilitating the phosphate’s hydrogen-bond acceptor role toward the alcohol. Ligand-directed counteranion positioning in cationic transition metal catalysis has the potential to be a general strategy for promoting challenging bimolecular reactivity.",

We applied HACE to identify mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) that confer kinase inhibitor resistance, to dissect the impact of individual variants in splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1)–dependent missplicing, and to evaluate noncoding variants in a stimulation-dependent immune enhancer of CD69.

The experimental results enable no less than a unification of insertion and supercapacitive storage, the first being dominant for thick films, the latter for thin films or negligible electronic conductivity.

Testing MSB in a myotubular myopathy model that is driven by loss of MTM1 —the phosphatase antagonist of VPS34—we show that dietary MSB improved muscle histology and function and extended life span.

Solute segregation triggering phase transitions at GBs has been suggested theoretically to offer different pathways to design interfaces, but an understanding of their intrinsic atomistic nature is missing. We combined atomic resolution electron microscopy and atomistic simulations to discover that iron segregation to GBs in titanium stabilizes icosahedral units (“cages”) that form robust building blocks of distinct GB phases. Owing to their five-fold symmetry, the iron cages cluster and assemble into hierarchical GB phases characterized by a different number and arrangement of the constituent icosahedral units. Our advanced GB structure prediction algorithms and atomistic simulations validate the stability of these observed phases and the high excess of iron at the GB that is accommodated by the phase transitions.",

Overfishing the largest species in nearshore and pelagic habitats risks loss of ecomorphotypes and a 5 to 22% erosion of functional diversity. Extinction risk is higher in countries with large human coastal populations but lower in nations with stronger governance, larger economies, and greater beneficial fisheries subsidies. Restricting fishing (including incidental catch) and trade to sustainable levels combined with prohibiting retention of highly threatened species can avert further depletion, widespread loss of population connectivity, and top-down predator control.",

Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate these immune responses by presenting luminal antigens to CD4 + T cells and inducing their differentiation into regulatory (peripheral regulatory T cell) or inflammatory [T helper (Th) cell] subsets. We used a proximity labeling method (LIPSTIC) to identify APCs that presented dietary antigens under tolerizing and inflammatory conditions and to understand cellular mechanisms by which tolerance to food is induced and can be disrupted by infection. Helminth infections disrupted tolerance induction proportionally to the reduction in the ratio between tolerogenic APCs—including migratory dendritic cells (cDC1s) and Rorγt + APCs—and inflammatory APCs, which were primarily cDC2s. These inflammatory cDC2s expanded by helminth infection did not present dietary antigens, thus avoiding diet-specific Th2 responses.",

However, very few of the known materials have the required phase transition in the temperature regions necessary for domestic refrigeration or air conditioning. We introduce organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) as a new family of BC materials. OIPCs display subambient transition temperatures, so-called “colossal” entropy changes (92 to 240 joules per kilogram per kelvin), and a high sensitivity to pressure, up to 23.7 kelvin per kilobar. The BC responses achieved with these prototype OIPC-BCs are tunable through structural modification of the ions; this wide matrix of possible combinations of structure and function indicates the scope of OIPCs as a new class of material for efficient and sustainable cooling technologies.",

Male resource competition results in a feedback loop that magnifies the importance of early contingency and pushes individuals onto divergent, self-reinforcing life trajectories, while the same process appears absent in females. Our results indicate that the strength of sexual selection may be self-limiting, and they highlight the potential for contingency to lead to differences in life outcomes, even in the absence of any underlying differences in ability (“merit”).",

However, biogeochemical models lack observational data, leading to oversimplified representation of carbon cycling by migrating organisms, such as Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ). Using a numerical model informed by 1 year of acoustic observations in the East Antarctic, we estimated the total particulate organic carbon (POC) flux from krill fecal pellets to be 9.68 milligrams of carbon per square meter per day (mg C m −2 day −1 ). A maximum of 25% of krill migrated to depths >200 m with a strong seasonality component, transporting <10% of the total krill POC flux (1.28 mg C m −2 day −1 ) to the deep ocean. Accurate carbon flux estimates are essential to inform climate policy and mitigation strategies, and models that include vertical migration will overestimate carbon export if this seasonality is not captured.",

As more high-quality genomes become available, we urgently need discordance-aware methods to infer the tree directly from a multiple genome alignment. In this study, we introduce Coalescence-Aware Alignment-Based Species Tree Estimator (CASTER), a theoretically justified site-based method that eliminates the need to predefine recombination-free loci. CASTER is scalable to hundreds of mammalian whole genomes. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of CASTER in simulations that include recombination and apply CASTER to several biological datasets, showing that its per-site scores can reveal both biological and artifactual patterns of discordance across the genome.",

After movement cessation, replays avoided the animal’s previous path for 3 seconds. Chains of replays avoided self-repetition over a shorter timescale. We used a continuous attractor model of neural activity to demonstrate that neuronal fatigue both generates replay sequences and produces self-avoidance over the observed timescales. In addition, replay of past experience became predominant later into the stopping period, in a manner requiring cortical input. These results indicate a mechanism for replay generation that unexpectedly constrains which sequences can be produced across time.",

Protection was antibody dose–dependent yet independent of Fc-mediated effector functions at the dose tested. Macaques receiving MEDI8852 at 10 milligrams per kilogram or higher had negligible impairment of respiratory function after infection, whereas control animals were not protected from severe disease and fatality.

We report a rare example of a statistical kinetics study showing that for nanoparticles on a bulk Al(OH) 3 surface, this phase transition occurs nondeterministically through an ergodic equilibrium through the molten state, and the memory of the lattice orientation is lost in this process. The rate of the interconversion was found to be insensitive to the electron dose rate, and this process had a small Gibbs free energy of activation.

We achieve this in a material-like robotic collective by modulating the interunit tangential forces to control topological rearrangements of units within a tightly packed structure. This allows local control of rigidity transitions between solid and fluid-like states in the collective and enables spatiotemporal control of shape and strength. We demonstrate structure-forming and healing and show the collective supporting 700 newtons (500 times the weight of a robot) before “melting” under its own weight.",

Promoters such as cesium, rhenium, and molybdenum each add a few percent of selectivity enhancements to achieve 90% overall, but their codependence on Cl makes optimizing and understanding their function complex. We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O 2 ) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O 2 on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity.",

We found that self-peptide–specific T reg cells were dispensable for the control of T conv cells of matched specificity at homeostasis. However, they were required to control such T conv cells and prevent autoimmunity toward the prostate after exposure to elevated self-peptide during infection. Notably, the T reg cell response to self-peptide did not affect protective T conv cell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide. Thus, self-peptide–specific T reg cells promoted self-nonself discrimination during infection by selectively controlling T conv cells of shared self-specificity.",

With an unsupervised deep denoising framework, we observed metal nanoparticle surfaces (platinum nanoparticles on cerium oxide) in a gas environment with time resolutions down to 10 milliseconds at a moderate electron dose. On this timescale, many nanoparticle surfaces continuously transition between ordered and disordered configurations. Stress fields can penetrate below the surface, leading to defect formation and destabilization, thus making the nanoparticle fluxional.

    "abstract": "Atmospheric organic aerosols (OAs) influence Earth’s climate by absorbing sunlight. However, the link between their evolving composition and their absorptive effects is unclear. We demonstrate that brown nitrogen (BrN), the absorptive nitrogenous component of OAs, dominates their global absorption. Using a global model, we quantified BrN abundance, tracked its optical evolution with chemical aging, and assessed its radiative absorption. BrN contributes 76% of OAs’ surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs’ absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN. BrN represents 18% of the global absorptive direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols, with biomass burning being the largest contributor. Our research establishes a nitrogen-centric framework for attributing the climate impacts of OAs.",

    "abstract": "Inferring cellular and molecular dynamics of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions from postmortem tissue collected decades after onset is challenging. Using magnetic resonance image (MRI)–guided spatiotemporal RNA profiling in marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), we mapped lesion dynamics and modeled molecular perturbations relevant to MS. Five distinct lesion microenvironments emerged, involving neuroglial responses, tissue destruction and repair, and brain border regulation. Before demyelination, MRI identified a high ratio of proton density–weighted signal to T 1 relaxation time, capturing early hypercellularity, and elevated astrocytic and ependymal senescence signals marked perivascular and periventricular areas that later became demyelination hotspots. As lesions expanded, concentric glial barriers formed, initially dominated by proliferating and diversifying microglia and oligodendrocyte precursors, later replaced by monocytes and lymphocytes. We highlight SERPINE1 + astrocytes as a signaling hub underlying lesion onset in both marmoset EAE and MS.",

In this study, we present ribosome expansion microscopy (RiboExM) to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique (ALIBi) to probe their composition. We generated a super-resolution ribosomal map, revealing subcellular translational hotspots and enrichment of 60 S subunits near polysomes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that Lsg1 tethers 60 S to the ER and regulates translation of select proteins. Additionally, we discovered ribosome heterogeneity at mitochondria guiding translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Lastly, we visualized ribosomes in neurons, revealing a dynamic switch between monosomes and polysomes in neuronal translation. Together, these approaches enable exploration of ribosomal localization and composition at unprecedented resolution.",

To elucidate how G4s induce replication fork arrest, we characterized fork collisions with preformed G4s in the parental DNA using reconstituted yeast and human replisomes. We demonstrate that a single G4 in the leading strand template is sufficient to stall replisomes by arresting the CMG helicase. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of stalled yeast and human CMG complexes reveal that the folded G4 is lodged inside the central CMG channel, arresting translocation. The G4 stabilizes the CMG at distinct translocation intermediates, suggesting an unprecedented helical inchworm mechanism for DNA translocation. These findings illuminate the eukaryotic replication fork mechanism under normal and perturbed conditions.",

In this work, we report on the direct growth of close-packed SWNT arrays on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, demonstrating high alignment and uniform chirality within each array. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that a self-assembly growth mechanism resulted from the intertube van der Waals attraction and the ultralow sliding friction of SWNTs on the atomically flat hBN substrate. Field-effect transistors constructed from the grown SWNT array exhibit high performance at room temperature, with mobilities of up to 2000 square centimeters per volt per second, on/off ratios of ~10 7 , and a maximum current density of ~6 milliamperes per micrometer.",

    "abstract": "The ozonolytic deconstruction of aromatics remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet π,π* state over the n,π* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes.",

By applying new theory to data on 84,695 plant, animal, and protist assemblages, we show that the general positive effect of species richness on stocks of biomass, as well as much of the variation in the strength and sign of this effect, is predicted by a fundamental macroecological quantity: the scaling of species abundance with body mass. Standing biomass increases with richness when large-bodied species are numerically rare but is independent of richness when species size and abundance are uncoupled. These results suggest a new fundamental law in the structure of ecological communities and show that the impacts of changes in species richness on biomass are predictable.",

Neurons with a remote history of activity coinciding with memory acquisition showed no strong preference for wiring with each other. Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes.

The resultant complexion-stabilized nanoscale precipitates provide excellent thermal stability, strength, and creep resistance.

For illustration, in this study, we achieved a high energy density of 215.8 joules per cubic centimeter with an efficiency of 80.7% at a high electric field of 7.4 megavolts per centimeter in a DNP structure–designed PbZr 0.53 Ti 0.47 O 3 -MgO film.

Leveraging population genetics principles, we fine-mapped about 22,000 chromatin accessibility–associated genetic variants with widespread cell type–specific effects. Variants in TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR–binding sites were the most prevalent determinants of chromatin accessibility. Finally, integrating chromatin accessibility–associated variants, organismal trait variation, and population differentiation revealed how local adaptation has rewired regulatory networks in unique cellular contexts to alter maize flowering.",

This state is predicted to feature perfect Coulomb drag, where a current in one layer is accompanied by an equal but opposite current in the other. We used an optical technique to probe the electrical transport of correlated electron-hole bilayers based on MoSe 2 /hBN/WSe 2 heterostructures. We observed perfect Coulomb drag in the excitonic insulator phase at low temperatures; the counterflow resistance of interlayer excitons remained finite. These results indicate the formation of an exciton gas that does not condense into a superfluid. Our work demonstrates that dynamic optical spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for probing exciton transport behavior in correlated electron-hole fluids.",

    "abstract": "Excitonic insulators (EIs) are a solid-state prototype for bosonic phases of matter that can support charge-neutral exciton currents. However, demonstration of exciton transport in EIs is difficult. In this work, we show that the strong interlayer excitonic correlation at equal electron and hole densities in MoSe 2 /WSe 2 double layers separated by a 2-nanometer barrier yields perfect Coulomb drag under zero magnetic field: A charge current in one layer induces an equal but opposite drag current in the other layer at low temperatures. The drag current ratio remains above 0.9 up to about 20 kelvin. As exciton density increases above the Mott density, the excitons dissociate into an electron-hole plasma abruptly, and only frictional drag is observed. Our experiment may lead to the realization of exciton circuitry and superfluidity.",

Gravitational microlensing is sensitive to exoplanets on wide orbits. We observed the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0007, which indicates an exoplanet with a planet-to-star mass ratio roughly double the Earth-Sun mass ratio, on an orbit longer than Saturn’s. We combined this event with a larger sample from a microlensing survey to determine the distribution of mass ratios for planets on wide orbits. We infer that there are ~0.35 super-Earth planets per star on Jupiter-like orbits. The observations are most consistent with a bimodal distribution, with separate peaks for super-Earths and gas giants. We suggest that this reflects differences in their formation processes.",

We modeled eco-evolutionary dynamics under preindustrial, contemporary, and projected climates using up to 9 years of fitness data from 102,272 transplants (115 source populations) of Boechera stricta in five common gardens. Climate change endangers locally adapted populations and reduces genotypic variation in long-term population growth rate, suggesting limited adaptive potential. Upslope migration could stabilize high-elevation populations and preserve low-elevation ecotypes, but unassisted gene flow modeled with genomic data is too spatially restricted. Species distribution models failed to capture current dynamics and likely overestimate persistence under intermediate emissions scenarios, highlighting the importance of modeling evolutionary processes.",

Although Gauss incompatibility has long been recognized as the source of morphing in naturally growing slender organs, here we show that the growth profile of rose petals remains Gauss compatible. Their distinctive shape emerges from a different type of geometric incompatibility, the Mainardi-Codazzi-Peterson (MCP) incompatibility, which leads to the formation of localized cusps along the petal margins. We validated this mechanism in model disc petals theoretically, computationally, and experimentally. Our study reveals distinct morphological regimes, ranging from smooth edges to cusp-forming configurations, and demonstrates how stress focusing at cusps influences subsequent petal growth. These findings position MCP incompatibility as a generic mechanism for cusp formation in both natural and manmade self-morphing sheets.",

Mobile integrons (MIs) are borne on plasmids, acting as a vehicle for hundreds of antimicrobial resistance genes among key pathogens. These elements also carry gene cassettes of unknown function ( gcu s) whose role and adaptive value remain unexplored. In this work, we show that gcu s encode phage resistance systems, many of which are newly discovered. Bacteriophage resistance integron cassettes (BRiCs) can be combined and mixed with resistance cassettes to produce multiphage or drug and phage resistance. The fitness costs of BRiCs are variable and dependent on the genetic context and can be modulated by changing the order of cassettes in the array. Hence, MIs act as highly mobile, low-cost defense islands.",

While mobile integrons are well known for spreading antibiotic resistance genes, the functions of the hundreds of cassettes carried by sedentary integrons remain largely unexplored. We show that many of these cassettes encode small variants of known antiphage systems that favor their inclusion in the integron. We also demonstrate that nearly 10% of the integron cassettes in the pandemic Vibrio cholerae strain encode novel antiphage functions. Most of these novel systems have little or no similarity to previously known ones, with several providing defense through cell lysis or growth arrest. Our work highlights the stabilization and prevalence of small antiphage systems within integrons, making them an untapped biobank of defense mechanisms.",

Synthetic methods that transpose existing substituents on saturated heterocycles to multiple peripheral positions are therefore highly valuable. In this work, we report a formal 1,2-acyl transposition through the photochemical exchange of the C 2 –C 3 positions of C 2 -acylated dihydrobenzofurans. This strategy relies on an unusual photochemical isomerization of the dihydrobenzofuran core to a highly electrophilic spiro-cyclopropane intermediate that is then intercepted by a halide nucleophile. A variety of aryl ketones are transposed using 370-nanometer centered irradiation. Additionally, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides can be transposed using 310-nanometer centered irradiation. This work highlights the power of a skeletal rearrangement to achieve a net peripheral modification.",

TC IV were almost exclusively present within mesenteric lymph nodes, suggesting that their presence underlies the phenomenon of oral tolerance. A wave of TC IV differentiation in the periweaning period was associated with a window of opportunity for enhanced pT reg cell generation in response to food antigens. Our findings indicate that TC IV may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of food-associated allergic and inflammatory diseases.",

In two randomized, open-label phase 1 human clinical trials, IAVI G002 in the United States and IAVI G003 in Rwanda and South Africa (IAVI, International Aids Vaccine Initiative), we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-encoded nanoparticles as priming immunogens (both trials) and first-boosting immunogens (IAVI G002). The vaccines were generally safe and well tolerated, except that 18% of IAVI G002 participants experienced skin reactions. Priming induced bnAb precursors with substantial frequencies and SHM; heterologous boosting elicited increased SHM, affinity, and neutralization activity toward bnAb development; and elicited antibodies exhibited precise bnAb structural mimicry. The results establish clinical proof of concept that heterologous boosting can advance bnAb precursor maturation and demonstrate bnAb priming in Africa, where the HIV burden is highest.",

In this study, we generated 2723 high-coverage whole-genome sequences from the Brazilian population, including urban, rural, and riverine communities representing diverse ethnic backgrounds. We reveal the impressive genomic diversity of Brazilians, identifying >8 million previously unknown variants, including 36,637 predicted deleterious and potentially affecting population health. We found a positive correlation between these deleterious variants and ancestry. Brazilian genomes are a global haplotype mosaic shaped by nonrandom mating, with peak admixture in the 18th and 19th centuries. Within this diversity, ancestry-specific haplotypes exhibit an uneven spatiotemporal distribution. We also identified putatively selected genes in this diverse population, primarily linked to fertility, immune response, and metabolic traits.",

The identification of AMELY-specific peptides enabled us to assign two specimens to male individuals, whereas semiquantitative mass spectrometric data analysis attributed the other two to females. A single amino acid polymorphism and the enamel-dentine junction shape variation indicated potential subgroups present within southern African Paranthropus . This study demonstrates how palaeoproteomics can help distinguish sexual dimorphism from other sources of variation in African Early Pleistocene hominins.",

In this work, we examined germline structural variants (SVs) as risk factors for pediatric extracranial solid tumors using germline genome sequencing of 1765 affected children, their 943 unaffected parents, and 6665 adult controls. We discovered a sex-biased association between very large (>1 megabase) germline chromosomal abnormalities and increased risk of solid tumors in male children. The overall impact of germline SVs was greatest in neuroblastoma, where we uncovered burdens of ultrarare SVs that cause loss of function of highly expressed, mutationally constrained genes, as well as noncoding SVs predicted to disrupt chromatin domain boundaries. Collectively, we estimate that rare germline SVs explain 1.1 to 5.6% of pediatric cancer liability, establishing them as an important component of disease predisposition.",

In this work, we identified a previously unrecognized hormone-releasing mechanism in the pituitary of the Japanese rice fish (medaka) induced by light. Ca 2+ imaging analysis revealed that melanotrophs, a type of pituitary endocrine cell that secretes melanocyte-stimulating hormone, robustly increase the concentration of intracellular Ca 2+ during short-wavelength light exposure. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule that drives this response. Knocking out opn5m attenuated melanogenesis by reducing tyrosinase expression in the skin. Our findings suggest a mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary melanotrophs triggers a pathway that might contribute to protection from ultraviolet radiation in medaka.",

We found that creosote-adapted woodrats have elevated gene dosage across multiple biotransformation enzyme families. These duplication events occurred independently across species and substantially increase expression of biotransformation genes, especially within the glucuronidation pathway. We propose that increased gene dosage resulting from duplication is an important mechanism by which animals initially adapt to novel environmental pressures.",

We used biophysical models (validated by 2685 field observations) to test this hypothesis for 10 ecologically diverse lizards in African and Australian deserts. Historical warming (1950–2020) has been more intense in Africa than in Australia, translating to an energetic squeeze for African diurnal species. Although no net impact on Australian diurnal species was observed, warming generated an energetic “relief” (by increasing foraging time) for nocturnal species. Future warming impacts will be more severe in Africa than in Australia, requiring increased rates of food intake (+10% per hour active for diurnal species). The effects of climate warming on desert lizard energy budgets will thus be species-specific but potentially predictable.",

In mice, reward and its prediction activate the SVTg, and SVTg stimulation leads to place preference, reduced anxiety, and accumbal dopamine release. Mice self-stimulate the SVTg, which can also be activated directly by the neocortex, resulting in effective inhibition of the lateral habenula, a region associated with depression. This mechanism may also explain why SVTg suppression induces aversion and increases fear. The translational relevance of these findings is supported by evidence in the rat, monkey, and human brainstem, establishing SVTg as a key hub for reward processing, emotional valence, and motivation.",

To address these challenges, we developed Genome-Shuffle-seq, a method that enables the multiplex generation and mapping of thousands of SVs (deletions, inversions, translocations, and extrachromosomal circles) throughout mammalian genomes. We also demonstrate the co-capture of SV identity with single-cell transcriptomes, facilitating the measurement of SV impact on gene expression. We anticipate that Genome-Shuffle-seq will be broadly useful for the systematic exploration of the functional consequences of SVs on gene expression, the chromatin landscape, and three-dimensional nuclear architecture, while also initiating a path toward a minimal mammalian genome.",

The density of mutations allowed mapping of putative essential domains within genes, providing a completely new level of genome annotation for any Plasmodium species. Although gene essentiality was largely conserved across P. knowlesi , Plasmodium falciparum , and rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei , a large number of shared genes are differentially essential, revealing species-specific adaptations. Our results indicated that Plasmodium essential gene evolution was conditionally linked to adaptive rewiring of metabolic networks for different hosts.",

However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power owing to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations revealed a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow, over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, the ice quake cascades appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude with those measured geodetically, providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations.",

These two archetypes also form on eukaryotic exogenous sequences, depend on sequence composition, and can be predicted using neural networks trained on the native genome.

We demonstrate that a wide-ranging carnivore—the northern elephant seal—can serve as an ecosystem sentinel for the twilight zone. We link ocean basin–scale foraging success with oceanographic indices to estimate twilight zone fish abundance five decades into the past, and into the future. We discovered that a small variation in maternal foraging success amplified into larger changes in offspring body mass and enormous variation in first-year survival and recruitment. Worsening oceanographic conditions could shift predator population trajectories from current growth to sharp declines. As ocean integrators, wide-ranging predators could reveal impacts of future anthropogenic change on open ocean ecosystems.",

Herein, we report the discovery of an organometallic “berkelocene” complex prepared from 0.3 milligrams of berkelium-249. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction shows a tetravalent berkelium ion between two substituted cyclooctatetraene ligands, resulting in the formation of berkelium–carbon bonds. The coordination in berkelocene resembles that of uranocene, and calculations show that the berkelium 5f orbitals engage in covalent overlap with the δ-symmetry orbitals of the cyclooctatetraenide ligand π system. Charge transfer from the ligands is diminished relative to uranocene and other actinocenes, which maximizes contributions from the stable, half-filled 5f 7 configuration of tetravalent berkelium.",

    "abstract": "Long interspersed element–1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons are the only active autonomous transposable elements in humans. They propagate by reverse transcribing their messenger RNA into new genomic locations by a process called target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). In this work, we present four cryo–electron microscopy structures of the human LINE-1 TPRT complex, revealing the conformational dynamics of open reading frame 2 protein (ORF2p) and its extensive remodeling of the target DNA for TPRT initiation. We observe nicking of the DNA second strand during reverse transcription of the first strand. Structure prediction identifies high-confidence binding sites for LINE-1–associated factors—namely proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPC1)—on ORF2p. Together with our structural data, this suggests a mechanism by which these factors regulate retrotransposition and supports a model for TPRT that accounts for retrotransposition outcomes observed in cells.",

    "abstract": "Global change drives biodiversity shifts worldwide, but these shifts are poorly understood in highly diverse tropical regions. In tropical mountains, plants are mostly expected to migrate upslope in response to warming. To assess this, we analyze shifts in elevation ranges of species in Mesoamerican cloud forests using three decades of species’ occurrence records. Our findings reveal a mean upslope shift of 1.8 to 2.7 meters per year since 1979 driven by the upslope retreat of the less thermophilic montane species. These shifts are mostly accompanied by retreating lower and upper edges attributed to varying degrees of species’ exposure to deforestation and climate change. Our results highlight the vulnerability of cloud forests under global change and the urgency to increase monitoring of species’ responses.",

We demonstrated a TiCoSb-based PE sensor with a large voltage response and capable of charging a capacitor.

Sunlight induces substantial and consistent N 2 O production under oxic abiotic conditions in fresh and marine waters. We measured photochemical N 2 O production rates using isotope tracers and determined that nitrite is the main substrate and that nitrate can also contribute after being photoreduced to nitrite. Additionally, this N 2 O production was strongly correlated to the radiation dose. Photochemodenitrification exceeded biological N 2 O production in surface waters. Although previously overlooked, this process may contribute considerably to global N 2 O emissions through its occurrence in fresh and marine surface waters.",

Integrated modeling identified 154 different axonemal proteins inside and outside the DMT and, together with genetic and proteomic interrogation, revealed conserved and trypanosome-specific foundations of flagellum assembly and motility. We captured axonemal dynein motors in their pre–power stroke state. Comparing atomic models between pre– and post–power strokes defined how dynein structural changes drive sliding of adjacent DMTs during flagellar beating.

Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry.",

We argue that any ability to alter dives based upon direct perception of oxygen should have been strongly selected for. We exposed diving seals to inhaled gas mixes that were experimentally altered to affect circulating levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Dive duration was positively correlated with circulating oxygen levels but unaffected by carbon dioxide levels and pH. These results suggest that seals do cognitively perceive circulating oxygen and use this to alter dive behavior.",

This revealed that effective apoplastic blockage in the endodermis is important for root-to-shoot signals underlying nodulation. Our findings further revealed that in nodules, the genetic machinery for Casparian strip formation is shared with roots. Apoplastic blockage controls the metabolic source-sink status required for nitrogen fixation.

It often causes premature failure of structural materials, and enhancing ratcheting resistance is a challenge in materials engineering. We demonstrate superior ratcheting resistance in high-strength austenitic stainless steel with a gradient hierarchy of dislocation cells. The ratcheting rate is two to four orders of magnitude lower than for coarse-grained counterparts. Its resistance results from sustained microstructural refinement through deformation-induced coherent martensitic transformations to hexagonal close-packed nanolayers within stable dislocation cells. The progressively refined microstructure mitigates cyclic softening and suppresses strain localization during stress cycling, thus reducing ratcheting strain. The gradient dislocation architecture represents a promising design for high-strength, ratcheting-resistant materials.",

These translocations differ in size and origin on each mountain, but they overlap partially and involve some of the same gene regions. Moreover, this structural variation is subject to divergent selection and arose without introgression between species. Our results show how the origin of structural variation provides a mechanism for repeated bouts of adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Successful cancer immunotherapy requires a patient to mount an effective immune response against tumors; however, many cancers evade the body’s immune system. To investigate the basis for treatment failure, we examined spontaneous mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with either an inflamed T cell–rich or a noninflamed T cell–deprived tumor microenvironment (TME). Our studies reveal that erythropoietin (EPO) secreted by tumor cells determines tumor immunotype. Tumor-derived EPO autonomously generates a noninflamed TME by interacting with its cognate receptor EPOR on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). EPO signaling prompts TAMs to become immunoregulatory through NRF2-mediated heme depletion. Removing either tumor-derived EPO or EPOR on TAMs leads to an inflamed TME and tumor regression independent of genotype, owing to augmented antitumor T cell immunity. Thus, the EPO/EPOR axis functions as an immunosuppressive switch for antitumor immunity.",

Whereas most anti-CRISPRs described to date are proteins, recently described small RNAs called RNA anti-CRISPRs (rAcrs) have sequence homology to CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and displace them from cognate Cas nucleases. In this work, we report the discovery of rAcrVIA1—a plasmid-encoded small RNA that inhibits the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 system in its natural host, Listeria seeligeri . We solved the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the Cas13-rAcr complex, which revealed that rAcrVIA1 adopts a fold nearly identical to crRNA despite sharing negligible sequence similarity. Collectively, our findings expand the diversity of rAcrs and reveal an example of immune antagonism through RNA structural mimicry.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic defense-associated reverse transcriptases (DRTs) were recently identified with antiviral functions; however, their functional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here we show that DRT9 forms a hexameric complex with its upstream noncoding RNA (ncRNA) to mediate antiphage defense by inducing cell growth arrest through abortive infection. Upon phage infection, the phage-encoded ribonucleotide reductase NrdAB complex increases intracellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate levels, activating DRT9 to synthesize long, polyadenylate [poly(A)]–rich single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), which likely sequesters the essential phage single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein and disrupts phage propagation. We further determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the DRT9-ncRNA hexamer complex, providing mechanistic insights into its cDNA synthesis. These findings highlight the diversity of RT-based antiviral defense mechanisms, expand our understanding of RT biological functions, and provide a structural basis for developing DRT9-based biotechnological tools.",

In this work, we discovered a principle that can establish the 3D glomerular map of the fly antennal lobe by reducing the higher dimensionality serially to 1D projections. During development, olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons first contact their partner projection neuron dendrites on the spherical surface of the antennal lobe, regardless of whether the adult glomeruli lie near the surface or inside. Along this 2D surface, axons of each ORN type take a specific, arc-shaped trajectory that precisely intersects with their partner dendrites. Altering axon trajectories compromises synaptic partner matching. A 3D search is thus reduced to one dimension, simplifying partner matching.",

Ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses has been proposed to be a key synaptic substrate for antidepressant action. Here, we found that ketamine-induced CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation could be augmented by transiently increasing extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activity through pharmacological inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases 6 (DUSP6). The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of acute ketamine treatment were extended by DUSP6 inhibition for up to 2 months. The selective deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in excitatory neurons abolished these DUSP6 inhibition–mediated synaptic and behavioral effects. These data suggest that ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects can be sustained by selectively targeting downstream intracellular signaling.",

In contrast, locomotion in artificial systems often depends on centralized processors. Here, we introduce a rapid and autonomous locomotion strategy with synchronized gaits emerging through physical interactions between self-oscillating limbs and the environment, without control signals. Each limb is a single soft tube that only requires a constant flow of air to perform cyclic stepping motions at frequencies reaching 300 hertz. Physical synchronization of several of these self-oscillating limbs enables locomotion speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than those of comparable state-of-the-art robots. Through body-environment dynamics, these seemingly simple devices exhibit autonomy, including obstacle avoidance, amphibious gait transitions, and phototaxis.",

These bnAb precursors, which target the CD4 receptor binding site, had undergone somatic hypermutation characteristic of the VRC01-class. A subset of isolated VRC01-class monoclonal antibodies neutralized wild-type pseudoviruses and was structurally extremely similar to bnAb VRC01. These results further support germline-targeting approaches for human HIV vaccine design and demonstrate atomic-level manipulation of B cell responses with rational vaccine design.",

Pervasive species redistribution poses substantial threats to mountain ecosystems, a phenomenon sometimes described as an “escalator to extinction,” primarily through mountaintop extinctions, range shift gaps (i.e., rapid shifts of suitable temperatures getting ahead of narrow-range species’ upper limits), and lowland biodiversity attrition, yet empirical evidence remains scarce. In this study, our analysis of 8800 records of historical and modern elevational range limits for 440 animal and 1629 plant species revealed little evidence supporting the proposed threats. Observed changes largely fell within random expectations, accounting for geometric constraints. Although delayed mountaintop extinctions point to accumulating extinction debt, concurrent range expansions of both narrow-range and lowland species suggest thermal niche underfilling, processes that collectively drive biotic homogenization across biologically complex mountain ecosystems.",

Further, we show that manipulating this pathway potently regulates neuronal circuit activity and animal behavior. This gating mechanism is conserved in cultured primary mammalian astrocytes, suggesting that it might be an ancient feature of astrocyte circuit function. Our work establishes a mechanism by which astrocytes dynamically respond to and modulate neuronal activity in different brain regions and in different behavioral states.",

Individual nucleoprotein subunits are connected by a flexible tail loop that inserts into a conserved pocket in its neighbor. We visualize the viral polymerase in RNP at different functional states, revealing how it accesses the RNA template while maintaining the double-helical architecture of RNP by strand sliding.

    "abstract": "Hydrogen-like light muonic ions, in which one negative muon replaces all of the electrons, are extremely sensitive probes of nuclear structure. Using pulsed laser spectroscopy, we have measured three 2 S -2 P transitions in the muonic helium-3 (μ 3 He + ) ion, an ion formed by a negative muon and bare helium-3 nucleus. This allowed us to extract the Lamb shift, the 2 P fine structure splitting, and the 2 S -hyperfine splitting in μ 3 He + . Comparing these measurements with theory, we determined the root-mean-square charge radius of the helion ( 3 He nucleus) to be r h = 1.97007(94) fm, in good agreement with the value from elastic electron scattering but a factor 15 more accurate. Our results represent benchmarks for few-nucleon theories and open the way for precision quantum electrodynamics tests in He atoms and ions.",

    "abstract": "A stellar common envelope occurs in a binary system when the atmosphere of an evolving star expands to encompass an orbiting companion object. Such systems are predicted to evolve rapidly, ejecting the stellar envelope and leaving the companion in a tighter orbit around a stripped star. We used radio timing to identify a pulsar, PSR J1928+1815, with a spin period of 10.55 ms in a compact binary system with an orbital period of 3.60 hours. The companion star has 1.0 to 1.6 solar masses, eclipses the pulsar for about 17% of the orbit, and is undetected at other wavelengths, so it is most likely a stripped helium star. We interpret this system as having recently undergone a common envelope phase, producing a compact binary.",

    "abstract": "Several bacterial pathogens have transitioned from tick-borne to louse-borne transmission, which often involves genome reduction and increasing virulence. However, the timing of such transitions remains unclear. We sequenced four ancient Borrelia recurrentis genomes, the agent of louse-borne relapsing fever, dating from 2300 to 600 years ago. We estimated the divergence from its closest tick-borne relative to 6000 to 4000 years ago, which suggests an emergence coinciding with human lifestyle changes such as the advent of wool-based textiles. Pan-genome analysis indicated that much of the evolution characteristic of B. recurrentis had occurred by ~2300 years ago, though further gene turnover, particularly in plasmid partitioning, persisted until ~1000 years ago. Our findings provide a direct genomic chronology of the evolution of this specialized vector-borne pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Emotional responses to sensory experience are central to the human condition in health and disease. We hypothesized that principles governing the emergence of emotion from sensation might be discoverable through their conservation across the mammalian lineage. We therefore designed a cross-species neural activity screen, applicable to humans and mice, combining precise affective behavioral measurements, clinical medication administration, and brain-wide intracranial electrophysiology. This screen revealed conserved biphasic dynamics in which emotionally salient sensory signals are swiftly broadcast throughout the brain and followed by a characteristic persistent activity pattern. Medication-based interventions that selectively blocked persistent dynamics while preserving fast broadcast selectively inhibited emotional responses in humans and mice. Mammalian emotion appears to emerge as a specifically distributed neural context, driven by persistent dynamics and shaped by a global intrinsic timescale.",

Depletion in the copy number of the plasmid-encoded virulence gene pla occurred in later-dated strains of the first and second pandemics, yet the biological relevance of the pla deletion has been difficult to test. We identified modern Y. pestis strains that independently acquired the same pla depletion as ancient strains and herein show that excision of pla from the multicopy pPCP1 plasmid is accompanied by the integration of a separate full pPCP1 harboring pla into the single-copy pCD1 plasmid, reducing pla dosage. Moreover, we demonstrate that this depletion decreases the mortality of mice in models of bubonic plague but not in the pneumonic and septicemic forms of the disease. We hypothesize that pla depletion may have been selectively advantageous in bubonic plague, owing to rodent fragmentation after pandemic-induced mortality.",

Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we developed an interfacial self-regulation concept in which a deformable secondary phase dynamically aggregates at the interface in response to local electro-chemo-mechanical stimuli, enhancing contact. The stripping of a lithium electrode that contains 5 to 20 mole % electrochemically inactive sodium domains causes spontaneous sodium accumulation across the interface, with the sodium deforming to attain intimate electrical contact without blocking lithium transport. This process, characterized with operando x-ray tomography and electron microscopy, mitigates voiding and improves cycling at low stack pressures. The counterintuitive strategy of adding electrochemically inactive alkali metal to improve performance demonstrates the utility of interfacial self-regulation for solid-state batteries.",

We discovered that bacteria can overcome this limitation by acquiring nutrients by lysing neighboring cells through contact-dependent antagonism. Using single-cell live imaging and isotopic markers, we found that during starvation, the type VI secretion system (T6SS) lysed neighboring cells and thus provided nutrients from lysing cells for growth. Genomic adaptations in antagonists, characterized by a reduced metabolic gene repertoire, and the previously unexplored distribution of the T6SS across bacterial taxa in natural environments suggest that bacterial antagonism may contribute to nutrient transfer within microbial communities in many ecosystems.",

From a circuit screen in mice, we identified a group of thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) neurons activated during sleep deprivation (SD) and required for sleep homeostasis. Optogenetic activation of RE neurons leads to an unusual phenotype: presleep behaviors (grooming and nest organizing) followed by prolonged, intense sleep that resembles RS. Inhibiting RE activity during SD impairs subsequent RS, which suggests that these neurons signal sleep need. RE neurons act upstream of sleep-promoting zona incerta cells, and SD triggers plasticity of this circuit to strengthen their connectivity. These findings reveal a circuit mechanism by which sleep need transforms the functional coupling of a sleep circuit to promote persistent, deep sleep.",

Computational mining approaches using structure- and surface-based matchmaking algorithms predict more than 1600 CRBN-compatible G-loop proteins across the human proteome, including the newly discovered helical G-loop motif, and identify the noncanonical neosubstrate binding mode of VAV1 that engages CRBN through a molecular surface mimicry mechanism.

BioEmu integrates over 200 milliseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, static structures and experimental protein stabilities using novel training algorithms. It captures diverse functional motions—including cryptic pocket formation, local unfolding, and domain rearrangements—and predicts relative free energies with 1 kcal/mol accuracy compared to millisecond-scale MD and experimental data. BioEmu provides mechanistic insights by jointly modelling structural ensembles and thermodynamic properties.

In macaque monkeys trained in a high risk–high return (HH) versus low risk–low return (LL) choice task, we found that the reversible pharmacological inactivation of ventral Brodmann area 6 (area 6V) impaired the risk dependency of decision-making. Selective optogenetic activation of the mesofrontal pathway from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral aspect of 6V resulted in stronger preference for HH, whereas activation of the pathway from the VTA to the dorsal aspect of 6V led to LL preference. Finally, computational decoding captured the modulations of behavioral preference. Our results suggest that VTA inputs to area 6V determine the decision balance between HH and LL.",

    "abstract": "Path dependence influences macroevolutionary predictability by constraining potential outcomes after critical evolutionary junctions. Although it has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments, path dependence is difficult to demonstrate in natural systems because of a lack of independent replicates. Here, we show that two types of distributed visual systems recently evolved twice within chitons, demonstrating rapid and path-dependent evolution of a complex trait. The type of visual system that a chiton lineage can evolve is constrained by the number of openings for sensory nerves in its shell plates. Lineages with more openings evolve visual systems with thousands of eyespots, whereas those with fewer openings evolve visual systems with hundreds of shell eyes. These macroevolutionary outcomes shaped by path dependence are both deterministic and stochastic because possibilities are restricted yet not entirely predictable.",

In this work, we report the 3.3-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of the fully assembled human minor spliceosome pre-B complex. The atomic model includes U11 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), U12 snRNP, and U4atac/U6atac.U5 tri-snRNP. U11 snRNA is recognized by five U11-specific proteins (20K, 25K, 35K, 48K, and 59K) and the heptameric Sm ring. The 3′ half of the 5′-splice site forms a duplex with U11 snRNA; the 5′ half is recognized by U11-35K, U11-48K, and U11 snRNA. Two proteins, CENATAC and DIM2/TXNL4B, specifically associate with the minor tri-snRNP. A structural analysis uncovered how two conformationally similar tri-snRNPs are differentiated by the minor and major prespliceosomes for assembly.",

While budding yeast control chromosome inheritance through ~125-base pair DNA sequence-defined centromeres, mammals and many other eukaryotes use large, epigenetic centromeres. Harnessing centromere epigenetics permits human artificial chromosome (HAC) formation but is not sufficient to avoid rampant multimerization of the initial DNA molecule upon introduction to cells. We describe an approach that efficiently forms single-copy HACs. It employs a ~750-kilobase construct that is sufficiently large to house the distinct chromatin types present at the inner and outer centromere, obviating the need to multimerize. Delivery to mammalian cells is streamlined by employing yeast spheroplast fusion. These developments permit faithful chromosome engineering in the context of metazoan cells.",

Despite this, approximately 7% of massive stars have observed magnetic fields, the origin of which is debated. We used multi-epoch interferometric and spectroscopic observations to characterize HD 148937, a binary system of two massive stars. We found that only one star is magnetic and that it appears younger than its companion. The system properties and a surrounding bipolar nebula can be reproduced with a model in which two stars merged (in a previous triple system) to produce the magnetic massive star.

The isotopic composition of Io’s inventory of volatile chemical elements, including sulfur and chlorine, reflects its outgassing and mass-loss history and thus records information about its evolution. We used submillimeter observations of Io’s atmosphere to measure sulfur isotopes in gaseous sulfur dioxide and sulfur monoxide, and chlorine isotopes in gaseous sodium chloride and potassium chloride. We find 34 S/ 32 S = 0.0595 ± 0.0038 (equivalent to δ 34 S = +347 ± 86‰), which is highly enriched compared to average Solar System values and indicates that Io has lost 94 to 99% of its available sulfur. Our measurement of 37 Cl/ 35 Cl = 0.403 ± 0.028 (δ 37 Cl = +263 ± 88‰) shows that chlorine is similarly enriched. These results indicate that Io has been volcanically active for most (or all) of its history, with potentially higher outgassing and mass-loss rates at earlier times.",

Genetic screening in zebrafish revealed that loss of function of the transmembrane protein Cachd1 resulted in right-sided habenula neurons adopting left-sided identity. Cachd1 is expressed in neuronal progenitors, functions downstream of asymmetric environmental signals, and influences timing of the normally asymmetric patterns of neurogenesis. Biochemical and structural analyses demonstrated that Cachd1 can bind simultaneously to Lrp6 and Frizzled family Wnt co-receptors. Consistent with this, lrp6 mutant zebrafish lose asymmetry in the habenulae, and epistasis experiments support a role for Cachd1 in modulating Wnt pathway activity in the brain. These studies identify Cachd1 as a conserved Wnt receptor–interacting protein that regulates lateralized neuronal identity in the zebrafish brain.",

We combined precise biochemical definition of complex I catalysis with high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures in the phospholipid bilayer of coupled vesicles to reveal the mechanism of the transition into the dormant state, modulated by membrane interactions. By implementing a versatile membrane system to unite structure and function, attributing catalytic and regulatory properties to specific structural states, we define how a conformational switch in complex I controls its physiological roles.",

Integration of these datasets with single-cell chromatin profiles showed that active enhancers with bidirectional RNA transcription are highly cell type–specific and that disease heritability is strongly enriched in these enhancers. The resulting cell type–resolved multimodal atlas of bidirectionally transcribed enhancers, which we linked with promoters using fine-scale chromatin contact maps, enabled us to systematically interpret genetic variants associated with a range of immune-mediated diseases.",

Pcdhα genes are arranged in clusters and exhibit a range of expression profiles, from stochastic to deterministic. Because Pcdhα promoters have high sequence identity and share distal enhancers, how distinct neurons choose which gene to express remains unclear. We show that the interplay between multiple enhancers, epigenetics, and genome folding orchestrates differential readouts of the locus across neurons. The probability of Pcdhα promoter choice depends on enhancer/promoter encounters catalyzed by cohesin, whose extrusion trajectories determine the likelihood that an individual promoter can “escape” heterochromatin-mediated silencing. We propose that tunable locus-specific regulatory elements and cell type–specific cohesin activity underlie the generation of cellular diversity by Pcdh genes.",

Animal lifespan was significantly extended, TIPs conditionally replicated and were continually detected for >6 months, and sequencing data showed no evidence of viral escape.

A combination of super-resolution microscopy and platinum-replica electron microscopy on cultured neurons revealed that AIS clathrin-coated pits form within “clearings”, circular areas devoid of actin-spectrin mesh. Actin-spectrin scaffold disorganization increased clathrin-coated pit formation. Cargo uptake and live-cell imaging showed that AIS clathrin-coated pits are particularly stable. Neuronal plasticity-inducing stimulation triggered internalization of the clathrin-coated pits through polymerization of branched actin around them.

We show that the pseudogap forms both at weak coupling, when the magnetic correlation length is large, and at strong coupling, when it is shorter.

The mathematical model predicted that increased synaptic strength promotes the neuronal “down state” and raises the delta power. Our molecular tool (synapse-targeted chemically induced translocation of Kalirin-7, SYNCit-K), which induces dendritic spine enlargement and synaptic potentiation through chemically induced translocation of protein Kalirin-7, demonstrated that synaptic potentiation of excitatory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) increases nonrapid eye movement sleep amounts and delta power.

Despite decades of research, the dominant mechanisms underlying grain rotation remain enigmatic. We present direct evidence that grain rotation occurs through the motion of disconnections (line defects with step and dislocation character) along grain boundaries in platinum thin films. State-of-the-art in situ four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) observations reveal the statistical correlation between grain rotation and grain growth or shrinkage. This correlation arises from shear-coupled grain boundary migration, which occurs through the motion of disconnections, as demonstrated by in situ high-angle annular dark-field STEM observations and the atomistic simulation–aided analysis. These findings provide quantitative insights into the structural dynamics of nanocrystalline materials.",

Nonetheless, these geometries can be distorted, leading to heightened reactivity of the π-bond. Although π-bond–containing compounds with bent geometries are well utilized in synthetic chemistry, the corresponding leveraging of π-bond–containing compounds that display twisting or pyramidalization remains underdeveloped. We report a study of perhaps the most notorious class of geometrically distorted molecules that contain π-bonds: anti-Bredt olefins (ABOs). ABOs have been known since 1924, and conventional wisdom maintains that ABOs are difficult or impossible to access. We provide a solution to this long-standing problem. Our study also highlights the strategic manipulation of compounds that display considerable distortion arising from the presence of geometrically constrained π-bonds.",

We established the merged-net approach, proffering optimal balance between designability and complexity, as a systematic solution for the rational assembly of multicomponent structures. In this work, by methodically mapping node-net relationships among 53 basic edge-transitive nets, we conceived a signature net map to identify merging net pairs, resulting in the enumeration of 53 merged nets. We developed a practical design algorithm and proposed more than 100 multicomponent metal-organic framework platforms. The effectiveness of this approach is commended by the successful synthesis of four classes of materials, which is based on merging three-periodic nets with the four possible net periodicities. The construction of multicomponent materials based on derived nets of merged nets highlights the potential of the merged-net approach in accelerating the discovery of intricate reticular materials.",

We isolated the specific neurons modulated by a psychedelic to determine their role in driving behavior. Using a light- and calcium-dependent activity integrator, we genetically tagged psychedelic-responsive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that the psychedelic drove network-level activation of multiple cell types beyond just those expressing 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors. We labeled psychedelic-responsive mPFC neurons with an excitatory channelrhodopsin to enable their targeted manipulation. We found that reactivation of these cells recapitulated the anxiolytic effects of the psychedelic without driving its hallucinogenic-like effects. These findings reveal essential insight into the cell-type–specific mechanisms underlying psychedelic-induced behavioral states.",

This limitation has been overcome in electromagnetic resonators by coupling them to other strongly nonlinear quantum systems such as atoms and superconducting qubits. We demonstrate the realization of the single-phonon nonlinear regime in a solid-state mechanical system. The single-phonon anharmonicity in our system exceeds the decoherence rate by a factor of 6.8, allowing us to use it as a mechanical qubit and demonstrate initialization, readout, and single-qubit gates. Our approach provides a powerful quantum acoustics platform for quantum simulations, sensing, and information processing.",

We hypothesized that free diffusion from random noise could generate shape-matched binders for challenging targets and tested this approach on TNFR1. We obtain designs with low picomolar affinity whose specificity can be completely switched to other family members using partial diffusion. Designs function as antagonists or as superagonists when presented at higher valency for OX40 and 4-1BB. The ability to design high-affinity and high-specificity antagonists and agonists for pharmacologically important targets in silico presages a coming era in protein design in which binders are made by computation rather than immunization or random screening approaches.",

However, conventional soft materials are typically limited to a single, unidirectional deformation unless complex hybrid constructs are used. We exploited the combination of mesogen self-assembly, polymer chain elasticity, and polymerization-induced stress to design liquid crystalline elastomers that exhibit two mesophases: chevron smectic C (cSmC) and smectic A (SmA). Inducing the cSmC-SmA–isotropic phase transition led to an unusual inversion of the strain field in the microstructure, resulting in opposite deformation modes (e.g., consecutive shrinkage or expansion and right-handed or left-handed twisting and tilting in opposite directions) and high-frequency nonmonotonic oscillations. This ambidirectional movement is scalable and can be used to generate Gaussian transformations at the macroscale.",

We report new evidence for tropical oxygenation during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a warming event that serves as a geologic analog to anthropogenic warming. Foraminifera-bound nitrogen isotopes indicate that the tropical North Pacific oxygen-deficient zone contracted during the PETM. A concomitant increase in foraminifera size implies that oxygen availability rose in the shallow subsurface throughout the tropical North Pacific. These changes are consistent with ocean model simulations of warming, in which a decline in biological productivity allows tropical subsurface oxygen to rise even as global ocean oxygen declines. The tropical oxygen increase may have helped avoid a mass extinction during the PETM.",

Here, we show that females of the egg-laying caecilian amphibian Siphonops annulatus provide similarly lipid-rich milk to altricial hatchlings during parental care. We observed that for 2 months, S. annulatus babies ingested milk released through the maternal vent seemingly in response to tactile and acoustic stimulation by the babies. The milk, composed mainly of lipids and carbohydrates, originates from the maternal oviduct epithelium’s hypertrophied glands. Our data suggest lactation in this oviparous nonmammalian species and expand the knowledge of parental care and communication in caecilians.",

The Gifsy-1 prophage terminase protein, whose canonical function is to process phage DNA for packaging in the virus head, unexpectedly acts as a transfer ribonuclease (tRNase) under oxidative stress, cleaving the anticodon loop of tRNA Leu . The ensuing RNA fragmentation compromises bacterial translation, intracellular survival, and recovery from oxidative stress in the vertebrate host. S. enterica adapts to this transfer RNA (tRNA) fragmentation by transcribing the RNA repair Rtc system. The counterintuitive translational arrest provided by tRNA cleavage may subvert prophage mobilization and give the host an opportunity for repair as a way of maintaining bacterial genome integrity and ultimately survival in animals.",

By examining longitudinal data from 196 radio-tagged southern sea otters ( Enhydra lutris nereis ), we found that tool-using individuals, particularly females, gained access to larger and/or harder-shelled prey. These mechanical advantages translated to reduced tooth damage during food processing. We also found that tool use diminishes trade-offs between access to different prey, tooth condition, and energy intake, all of which are dependent on the relative prey availability in the environment. Tool use allowed individuals to maintain energetic requirements through the processing of alternative prey that are typically inaccessible with biting alone, suggesting that this behavior is a necessity for the survival of some otters in environments where preferred prey are depleted.",

The lattice of the water island was incommensurate with the graphene surface but commensurate with the boron nitride surface owing to different surface electrostatics. The area-normalized static friction on the graphene diminished as the island area was increased by a power of ~–0.58, suggesting superlubricity behavior. By contrast, the friction on the boron nitride appeared insensitive to the area.

Mef2d-deletion from ILC2s and/or T cells specifically protected against an allergen lung challenge. Mef2d repressed Regnase-1 endonuclease expression to enhance IL-33 receptor production and IL-33 signaling and acted downstream of calcium-mediated signaling to translocate NFAT1 to the nucleus to promote type-2 cytokine-mediated immunity.",

Our cryo–electron microscopy studies show that, within the NuA4/TIP60 complex, the E1A binding protein P400 (EP400) subunit serves as a scaffold holding the different functional modules in specific positions, creating a distinct arrangement of the actin-related protein (ARP) module. EP400 interacts with the transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP) subunit by using a footprint that overlaps with that of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, preventing the formation of a hybrid complex. Loss of the TRRAP subunit leads to mislocalization of NuA4/TIP60, resulting in the redistribution of H2A.Z and its acetylation across the genome, emphasizing the dual functionality of NuA4/TIP60 as a single macromolecular assembly.",

The Ctf18-RFC PCNA loader, a replication factor C (RFC) variant, is specific to the leading-strand Pol (Polε). We reveal here the underlying mechanism of Ctf18-RFC specificity to Polε using cryo–electron microscopy and biochemical studies. We found that both Ctf18-RFC and Polε contain specific structural features that direct PCNA loading onto DNA. Unlike other clamp loaders, Ctf18-RFC has a disordered ATPase associated with a diverse cellular activities (AAA+) motor that requires Polε to bind and stabilize it for efficient PCNA loading. In addition, Ctf18-RFC can pry prebound Polε off of DNA, then load PCNA onto DNA and transfer the PCNA-DNA back to Polε. These elements in both Ctf18-RFC and Polε provide specificity in loading PCNA onto DNA for Polε.",

During DNA replication, CENP-A nucleosomes undergo dilution. To preserve centromere identity, correct amounts of CENP-A must be restored in a cell cycle–controlled manner orchestrated by the Mis18 complex (Mis18α-Mis18β-Mis18BP1). We demonstrate here that PLK1 interacts with the Mis18 complex by recognizing self-primed phosphorylations of Mis18α (Ser 54 ) and Mis18BP1 (Thr 78 and Ser 93 ) through its Polo-box domain. Disrupting these phosphorylations perturbed both centromere recruitment of the CENP-A chaperone HJURP and new CENP-A loading. Biochemical and functional analyses showed that phosphorylation of Mis18α and PLK1 binding were required to activate Mis18α-Mis18β and promote Mis18 complex-HJURP interaction. Thus, our study reveals key molecular events underpinning the licensing role of PLK1 in ensuring accurate centromere inheritance.",

The mechanism of Pi efflux, activated by inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs), has remained unclear. This study presents cryo–electron microscopy structures of XPR1 in multiple conformations, revealing a transmembrane pathway for Pi export and a dual-binding activation pattern for PP-IPs. A canonical binding site is located at the dimeric interface of Syg1/Pho81/XPR1 (SPX) domains, and a second site, biased toward PP-IPs, is found between the transmembrane and SPX domains. By integrating structural studies with electrophysiological analyses, we characterized XPR1 as an inositol phosphates (IPs)/PP-IPs–activated phosphate channel. The interplay among its transmembrane domains, SPX domains, and IPs/PP-IPs orchestrates the conformational transition between its closed and open states.",

We designed probes targeting >2000 gene regions to generate a dated evolutionary tree for 475 fungi and combined it with a similarly generated tree for 276 ants. We found that fungus-ant agriculture originated ~66 million years ago when the end-of-Cretaceous asteroid impact temporarily interrupted photosynthesis, causing global mass extinctions but favoring the proliferation of fungi. Subsequently, ~27 million years ago, one ancestral fungal cultivar population became domesticated, i.e., obligately mutualistic, when seasonally dry habitats expanded in South America, likely isolating the cultivar population from its free-living, wet forest–dwelling conspecifics. By revealing these and other major transitions in fungus-ant coevolution, our results clarify the historical processes that shaped a model system for nonhuman agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen atom abstraction is an important elementary chemical process but is very difficult to carry out enantioselectively. We have developed catalysts, readily derived from the Cinchona alkaloid family of natural products, which can achieve this by virtue of their chiral amine structure. The catalyst, following single-electron oxidation, desymmetrizes meso -diols by selectively abstracting a hydrogen atom from one carbon center, which then regains a hydrogen atom by abstraction from a thiol. This results in an enantioselective epimerization process, forming the chiral diastereomer with high enantiomeric excess. Cyclic and acyclic 1,2-diols are compatible, as are acyclic 1,3-diols. Additionally, we demonstrate the viability of combining our approach with carbon-carbon bond formation in Giese addition. Given the increasing number of synthetic methods involving hydrogen atom transfer steps, we anticipate that this work will have a broad impact in the field of enantioselective radical chemistry.",

However, little is known about the mechanism behind the abundant presence of T H 1-T reg cells in the TME. We demonstrate that selective depletion of arginase I (Arg1)–expressing tumor-associated macrophages (Arg1 + TAMs) inhibits tumor growth and concurrently reduces the ratio of T H 1-T reg cells in the TME. Arg1 + TAMs secrete the chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4), which reinforces interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–induced T reg cell polarization into T H 1-T reg cells in a manner dependent on CXCR3 and the IFN-γ receptor. Both genetic PF4 inactivation and PF4 neutralization hinder T H 1-T reg cell accumulation in the TME and reduce tumor growth. Collectively, our study highlights the importance of Arg1 + TAM–produced PF4 for high T H 1-T reg cell levels in the TME to suppress antitumor immunity.",

Slow decoding during translation promotes association of CCR4-NOT with ribosomes, accelerating mRNA degradation. We applied selective ribosome profiling to further investigate the determinants of CCR4-NOT recruitment to ribosomes in mammalian cells. This revealed that specific arginine codons in the P-site are strong signals for ribosomal recruitment of human CNOT3, a CCR4-NOT subunit. Cryo–electron microscopy and transfer RNA (tRNA) mutagenesis demonstrated that the D-arms of select arginine tRNAs interact with CNOT3 and promote its recruitment whereas other tRNA D-arms sterically clash with CNOT3. These effects link codon content to mRNA stability. Thus, in addition to their canonical decoding function, tRNAs directly engage regulatory complexes during translation, a mechanism we term P-site tRNA-mediated mRNA decay.",

We found that this “stem cell collision” generates an injury-induced tissue niche containing keratin 5 + epithelial cells and plastic Pdgfra + mesenchymal cells. Single-cell analysis revealed that the injury-induced niche is governed by mesenchymal proliferation and Notch signaling, which suppressed Wnt/Fgf signaling in the injured niche. Conversely, loss of Notch signaling rewired alveolar signaling patterns to promote functional regeneration and gas exchange. Signaling patterns in injury-induced niches can differentiate fibrotic from degenerative human lung diseases through altering the direction of Wnt/Fgf signaling. Thus, we have identified an injury-induced niche in the lung with the ability to discriminate human lung disease phenotypes.",

These adaptations are supported in part by experience-dependent activation of immediate-early response genes, such as Npas4 (neuronal PAS domain protein 4). Here we show that a conserved long noncoding enhancer RNA (lnc-eRNA), transcribed from an activity-sensitive enhancer, produces DNA:RNA hybrid R-loop structures that support three-dimensional chromatin looping between enhancer and proximal promoter and rapid Npas4 gene induction. Furthermore, in mouse models, Npas4 lnc-eRNA and its R-loop are required for the development of behavioral adaptations produced by chronic psychosocial stress or cocaine exposure, revealing a potential role for this regulatory mechanism in the transmission of emotional experiences.",

However, most individuals exhibit a more robust response to one of these strains and thus are vulnerable to infection by others. By studying a monozygotic twin cohort, we found that although prior exposure is a factor, host genetics are a stronger driver of subtype bias to influenza viral strains. We found that covalent coupling of heterologous hemagglutinin (HA) from different viral strains could largely eliminate subtype bias in an animal model and in a human tonsil organoid system. We proposed that coupling of heterologous antigens improves antibody responses across influenza strains by broadening T cell help, and we found that using this approach substantially improved the antibody response to avian influenza HA.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research on the infamous antinutritional steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) in Solanaceae plants have provided deep insights into their metabolism and roles. However, engineering SGAs in heterologous hosts has remained a challenge. We discovered that a protein evolved from the machinery involved in building plant cell walls is the crucial link in the biosynthesis of SGAs. We show that cellulose synthase–like M [GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM15 (GAME15)] functions both as a cholesterol glucuronosyltransferase and a scaffold protein. Silencing GAME15 depletes SGAs, which makes plants more vulnerable to pests. Our findings illuminate plant evolutionary adaptations that balance chemical defense and self-toxicity and open possibilities for producing steroidal compounds in heterologous systems for food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal theta-phase precession is involved in spatiotemporal coding and in generating multineural spike sequences, but how precession originates remains unresolved. To determine whether precession can be generated directly in hippocampal area CA1 and disambiguate multiple competing mechanisms, we used closed-loop optogenetics to impose artificial place fields in pyramidal cells of mice running on a linear track. More than one-third of the CA1 artificial fields exhibited synthetic precession that persisted for a full theta cycle. By contrast, artificial fields in the parietal cortex did not exhibit synthetic precession. These findings are incompatible with precession models based on inheritance, dual-input, spreading activation, inhibition-excitation summation, or somato-dendritic competition. Thus, a precession generator resides locally within CA1.",

    "abstract": "Most health care providers in developing countries know that oral rehydration salts (ORS) are a lifesaving and inexpensive treatment for child diarrhea, yet few prescribe it. This know-do gap has puzzled experts for decades. Using randomized experiments in India, we estimated the extent to which ORS underprescription is driven by perceptions that patients do not want ORS, provider’s financial incentives, and ORS stock-outs (out-of-stock events). Patients expressing a preference for ORS increased ORS prescribing by 27 percentage points. Eliminating stock-outs increased ORS provision by 7 percentage points. Removing financial incentives did not affect ORS prescribing on average but did increase ORS prescribing at pharmacies. We estimate that perceptions that patients do not want ORS explain 42% of underprescribing, whereas stock-outs and financial incentives explain only 6 and 5%, respectively.",

In this work, we show how several thousand axonal growth cones self-pattern without target-dependent guidance during neural superposition wiring in Drosophila . Ablation of all target lamina neurons or loss of target adhesion prevents the stabilization but not the development of the pattern. Intravital imaging at the spatiotemporal resolution of growth cone dynamics in intact pupae and data-driven dynamics simulations reveal a mechanism by which >30,000 filopodia do not explore potential targets, but instead simultaneously generate and navigate a dynamic filopodial meshwork that steers growth directions. Hence, a guidance mechanism can emerge from the interactions of the axons being guided, suggesting self-organization as a more general feature of brain wiring.",

Here we realize momentum-exchange interactions in which pairs of atoms exchange their momentum states by collective emission and absorption of photons from a common cavity mode, a process equivalent to a spin-exchange or XX collective Heisenberg interaction. The momentum-exchange interaction leads to an observed all-to-all Ising-like interaction in a matter-wave interferometer. A many-body energy gap also emerges, effectively binding interferometer matter-wave packets together to suppress Doppler dephasing in analogy to Mössbauer spectroscopy. The tunable momentum-exchange interaction expands the capabilities of quantum interaction–enhanced matter-wave interferometry and may enable the realization of exotic behaviors, including simulations of superconductors and dynamical gauge fields.",

    "abstract": "Meningomyelocele is one of the most severe forms of neural tube defects (NTDs) and the most frequent structural birth defect of the central nervous system. We assembled the Spina Bifida Sequencing Consortium to identify causes. Exome and genome sequencing of 715 parent-offspring trios identified six patients with chromosomal 22q11.2 deletions, suggesting a 23-fold increased risk compared with the general population. Furthermore, analysis of a separate 22q11.2 deletion cohort suggested a 12- to 15-fold increased NTD risk of meningomyelocele. The loss of Crkl , one of several neural tube–expressed genes within the minimal deletion interval, was sufficient to replicate NTDs in mice, where both penetrance and expressivity were exacerbated by maternal folate deficiency. Thus, the common 22q11.2 deletion confers substantial meningomyelocele risk, which is partially alleviated by folate supplementation.",

In this work, we provide a potential account of the roots of this resilience based on observations with 10 congenitally blind children who gained sight late in life. Several months or years following their sight-restoring surgeries, the removal of color cues markedly reduced their recognition performance, whereas age-matched normally sighted children showed no such decrement. This finding may be explained by the greater-than-neonatal maturity of the late-sighted children’s color system at sight onset, inducing overly strong reliance on chromatic cues. Simulations with deep neural networks corroborate this hypothesis. These findings highlight the adaptive significance of typical developmental trajectories and provide guidelines for enhancing machine vision systems.",

However, decomposition rates are highly variable and large-scale patterns and drivers of this process remain poorly understood. Using a cellulose-based assay to reflect the primary constituent of plant detritus, we generated a predictive model (81% variance explained) for cellulose decomposition rates across 514 globally distributed streams. A large number of variables were important for predicting decomposition, highlighting the complexity of this process at the global scale. Predicted cellulose decomposition rates, when combined with genus-level litter quality attributes, explain published leaf litter decomposition rates with high accuracy (70% variance explained). Our global map provides estimates of rates across vast understudied areas of Earth and reveals rapid decomposition across continental-scale areas dominated by human activities.",

We demonstrate a TC by using driven-dissipative condensates of microcavity exciton-polaritons, spontaneously formed from an incoherent particle bath. The TC phases are controlled by the power of a continuous-wave nonresonant optical drive exciting the condensate and the interaction with cavity phonons. Those phases are, for increasing power, Larmor-like precession of the condensate pseudo-spins—a signature of continuous TC; locking of the frequency of precession to self-sustained coherent phonons—stabilized TC; and doubling of TC’s period by phonons—a discrete TC with continuous excitation. These results establish microcavity polaritons as a platform for the investigation of time-broken symmetry in nonhermitian systems.",

    "abstract": "One of Earth’s most fundamental climate shifts, the greenhouse-icehouse transition 34 million years ago, initiated Antarctic ice sheet buildup, influencing global climate until today. However, the extent of the ice sheet during the Early Oligocene Glacial Maximum (~33.7 to 33.2 million years ago) that immediately followed this transition—a critical knowledge gap for assessing feedbacks between permanently glaciated areas and early Cenozoic global climate reorganization—is uncertain. In this work, we present shallow-marine drilling data constraining earliest Oligocene environmental conditions on West Antarctica’s Pacific margin—a key region for understanding Antarctic ice sheet evolution. These data indicate a cool-temperate environment with mild ocean and air temperatures that prevented West Antarctic Ice Sheet formation. Climate–ice sheet modeling corroborates a highly asymmetric Antarctic ice sheet, thereby revealing its differential regional response to past and future climatic change.",

    "abstract": "Diazo compounds and organic azides are widely used as reagents for accessing valuable molecules in multiple areas of fundamental and applied chemistry. Their capacity to undergo versatile chemical transformations arises from the reactive nature of an incipient dinitrogen molecule at the terminal position. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)–stabilized diazoborane—a boron-centered analog of organic azides and diazoalkanes. The diazoborane displays a strong tendency to release dinitrogen, thus serving as a borylene source, in analogy to organic azides and diazoalkanes serving as nitrene and carbene sources, respectively. Also reminiscent of diazoalkane and organic azide reactivity, the diazoborane serves as a 1,3-dipole that undergoes uncatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition with an unactivated terminal alkyne, affording a five-membered heterocycle after a two-step rearrangement.",

Unlike somatic cells, which preferentially mis-segregate larger chromosomes, aged oocytes preferentially mis-segregate smaller chromosomes through unclear processes. Here, we provide a comprehensive three-dimensional chromosome identifying-and-tracking dataset throughout meiosis I in live mouse oocytes. This analysis reveals a prometaphase pathway that actively moves smaller chromosomes to the inner region of the metaphase plate. In the inner region, chromosomes are pulled by stronger bipolar microtubule forces, which facilitates premature chromosome separation, a major cause of segregation errors in aged oocytes. This study reveals a spatial pathway that facilitates aneuploidy of small chromosomes preferentially in aged eggs and implicates the role of the M phase in creating a chromosome size–based spatial arrangement.",

Cas13s share limited sequence similarity, hindering discovery of related or ancestral systems. To address this, we developed an automated structural-search pipeline to identify an ancestral clade of Cas13 (Cas13an) and further trace Cas13 origins to defense-associated ribonucleases. Despite being one-third the size of other Cas13s, Cas13an mediates robust programmable RNA depletion and defense against diverse bacteriophages. However, unlike its larger counterparts, Cas13an uses a single active site for both CRISPR RNA processing and RNA-guided cleavage, revealing that the ancestral nuclease domain has two modes of activity. Discovery of Cas13an deepens our understanding of CRISPR-Cas evolution and expands opportunities for precision RNA editing, showcasing the promise of structure-guided genome mining.",

Bidirectional neural activity manipulations in pups revealed that widespread connectivity of preweaning ZI SST neurons to sensory, emotional, and cognitive brain centers mediates two key adaptive functions associated with maternal presence: the reduction of behavior distress and the facilitation of learning.

Measuring the time to achieve an electron count threshold rather than waiting a predefined constant time improves the information obtained per electron. The microscope was made to respond to these events by blanking the beam, thus reducing the overall dose required. This approach automatically apportions dose to achieve a given signal-to-noise ratio in each pixel, eliminating excess dose that is associated with diminishing returns of information. We demonstrate the wide applicability of our approach to beam-sensitive materials by imaging biological tissue and zeolite.",

We show that the tumor suppressor Merlin, an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway, localizes to both cell junctions and medial apical cortex in Drosophila epithelia, with the latter forming solid-like condensates that activate Hippo signaling. Merlin condensation required phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P)–mediated plasma membrane targeting and was antagonistically controlled by Pez and cytoskeletal tension through plasma membrane PI4P regulation. The solid-like material properties of Merlin condensates are essential for physiological function and protect the condensates against external perturbations. Collectively, these findings uncover an essential role for solid-like condensates in normal physiology and reveal regulatory mechanisms for their formation and disassembly.",

The biological mechanisms underpinning these dynamics remain elusive, particularly concerning how shifts in the composition of memory-encoding neuronal ensembles influence the evolution of a memory over time. By targeting developmentally distinct subpopulations of principal neurons, we discovered that memory encoding resulted in the concurrent establishment of multiple memory traces in the mouse hippocampus. Two of these traces were instantiated in subpopulations of early- and late-born neurons and followed distinct reactivation trajectories after encoding. The divergent recruitment of these subpopulations underpinned gradual reorganization of memory ensembles and modulated memory persistence and plasticity across multiple learning episodes. Thus, our findings reveal profound and intricate relationships between ensemble dynamics and the progression of memories over time.",

We measured how the kinetic and total energies evolve after quenching the confining potential. Although the bare interactions are attractive, the atoms behave as if they repel each other: Their kinetic energy paradoxically decreases as the gas is compressed. The missing “phantom” energy is quantified by benchmarking our experimental results against generalized hydrodynamics calculations. We present evidence that the missing kinetic energy is carried by undetected, very high momentum atoms.",

We found that the minor poles formed in multiple kinetochore clusters contribute to the generation of multipolar intermediates. We further determined the essential roles of HAUS6, KIF11, and KIF18A in spindle bipolarization and identified mutations in these genes in infertile patients characterized by oocyte or embryo defects.

While these compounds act on numerous central and peripheral pain pathways, the neuroanatomical substrate for opioid analgesia is not fully understood. By means of single-cell transcriptomics and manipulation of morphine-responsive neurons, we have identified an ensemble of neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) that regulates mechanical nociception in mice. Among these, forced activation or silencing of excitatory RVM BDNF projection neurons mimicked or completely reversed morphine-induced mechanical antinociception, respectively, via a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)–dependent mechanism and activation of inhibitory spinal galanin-positive neurons. Our results reveal a specific RVM-spinal circuit that scales mechanical nociception whose function confers the antinociceptive properties of morphine.",

Centromere maintenance requires CENP-A to be actively replenished by dedicated protein machinery in the early G 1 phase of the cell cycle to compensate for its dilution after DNA replication. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) limit CENP-A deposition to once per cell cycle and function as negative regulators outside of early G 1 . Antithetically, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) promotes CENP-A deposition in early G 1 , but the molecular details of this process are still unknown. We reveal here a phosphorylation network that recruits PLK1 to the deposition machinery to control a conformational switch required for licensing the CENP-A deposition reaction. Our findings clarify how PLK1 contributes to the epigenetic maintenance of centromeres.",

The wood had near-perfect preservation, with carbon loss less than 5% compared to a modern sample. The lack of decay is likely due to the low permeability of the compact clay soil at the burial site. Our observation suggests a hybrid nature-engineering approach for carbon removal by burying woody biomass in similar anoxic environments. We estimate a global sequestration potential of up to 10 gigatonnes CO 2 per year with existing technology at a low cost of $30 to $100 per tonne after optimization.",

We investigated mental sorting using high-throughput electrophysiological recordings in the frontal cortex of macaque monkeys, who memorized and sorted spatial sequences in forward or backward orders according to visual cues. We discovered that items at each ordinal rank in WM were encoded in separate rank-WM subspaces and then, depending on cues, were maintained or reordered between the subspaces, accompanied by two extra temporary subspaces in two operation steps. Furthermore, the cue activity served as an indexical signal to trigger sorting processes. Thus, we propose a complete conceptual framework, where the neural landscape transitions in frontal neural states underlie the symbolic system for mental programming of sequence WM.",

    "abstract": "The recent capability to measure thousands of plasma proteins from a tiny blood sample has provided a new dimension of expansive data that can advance our understanding of human health. For example, the company SomaLogic has developed the means to measure more than 10,000 proteins and Thermo Fisher’s Olink assays over 5400 proteins from as little as 2 μl. When these rich data are integrated with other layers of information from large patient cohorts, such as the UK Biobank’s genetic, health, and lifestyle information from half a million participants, we get new insights about the underpinnings of disease, the aging process, and the potential ability to forecast an individual’s health trajectory.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a 1-year lagged extratropical response to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in observational analyses and climate models. The response maps onto the Arctic Oscillation and is strongest in the North Atlantic, where it resembles the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Unexpectedly, these 1-year lagged teleconnections are at least as strong as the better-known simultaneous winter connections. However, the 1-year lagged response is opposite in sign to the simultaneous response such that 1 year later, El Niño is followed by a positive NAO, whereas La Niña is followed by a negative NAO. The lagged response may also interfere with simultaneous ENSO teleconnections. We show here that these effects are unlikely to be caused by residual aliasing of ENSO cycles; rather, slowly migrating atmospheric angular momentum anomalies explain both the sign and the timing of the extratropical response. Our results have implications for understanding ENSO teleconnections, explaining observed extratropical climate variability and interpreting seasonal to interannual climate predictions.",

    "abstract": "Observations of pathogen community structure provide evidence for both the coexistence and replacement of related strains. Despite many studies of specific host-pathogen systems, a unifying framework for predicting the outcomes of interactions among pathogens has remained elusive. We address this gap by developing a pathogen invasion theory (PIT) based on modern ecological coexistence theory and testing the resulting framework against empirical systems. Across major human pathogens, PIT predicts near-universal mutual susceptibility of one strain to invasion by another strain. However, predicting co-circulation from mutual invasion also depends on the degree to which susceptible abundance is reduced below the invasion threshold by overcompensatory epidemic dynamics, and the time it takes for susceptibles to replenish. The transmission advantage of an invading strain and the strength and duration of immunity are key determinants of susceptible dynamics. PIT unifies existing ideas about pathogen co-circulation, offering a quantitative framework for predicting the emergence of novel pathogen strains.",

Synthesis science breakthroughs have been key to the realization of quantum dot technologies, but important group III–group V semiconductors, including colloidal gallium arsenide (GaAs), still cannot be synthesized with existing approaches. The high-temperature molten salt colloidal synthesis introduced in this work enables the preparation of previously intractable colloidal materials. We directly nucleated and grew colloidal quantum dots in molten inorganic salts by harnessing molten salt redox chemistry and using surfactant additives for nanocrystal shape control. Synthesis temperatures above 425°C are critical for realizing photoluminescent GaAs quantum dots, which emphasizes the importance of high temperatures enabled by molten salt solvents. We generalize the methodology and demonstrate nearly a dozen III-V solid-solution nanocrystal compositions that have not been previously reported.",

We report that ribozyme cleavage of two separate mRNAs activated their scarless trans-ligation and translation into full-length protein in eukaryotic cells, a process that we named StitchR (for Stitch RNA). Optimization of StitchR activity in mammalian cells resulted in a ~900-fold increase in protein expression that approached levels observed for genes expressed from single vectors. We demonstrate that StitchR can be harnessed for effective dual adeno-associated virus gene therapies to correct muscular dystrophies by restoring large functional muscle proteins to endogenous levels in vivo.",

New analyses show that this is observed repeatedly across multiple contemporaneous sites in the eastern Turkana Basin.

However, the identity of the effector gene regulating melanic wing color within this locus remains unknown. We show that none of the four candidate protein-coding genes within this locus, including cortex , serve as major effectors. Instead, a microRNA (miRNA), mir-193 , serves as the major effector across three deeply diverged lineages of butterflies, and its role is conserved in Drosophila . In Lepidoptera, mir-193 is derived from a gigantic primary long noncoding RNA, ivory , and it functions by directly repressing multiple pigmentation genes. We show that a miRNA can drive repeated instances of adaptive evolution in animals.",

Our analysis revealed that the vast majority of Neanderthal gene flow is attributable to a single, shared extended period of gene flow that occurred between 50,500 to 43,500 years ago, as evidenced by ancestry correlation, colocalization of Neanderthal segments across individuals, and divergence from the sequenced Neanderthals. Most natural selection—positive and negative—on Neanderthal variants occurred rapidly after the gene flow.

These changes result in a significant upstream shift in streamflow experienced by about 29% of the global land surface. We found the most changes in the smallest steams in our study: increases in erosion potential (approximately 5% increase in stream power), flood frequency (approximately 42% increase in 100-year floods), and likely nutrient dynamics (altered seasonal flow regimes). We revealed these changes using “detail at scale” by mapping millions of individual rivers. Widely adopting this approach could reveal other changes to the hydrosphere.",

We demonstrated that E-TC mito repurposes molecules traditionally associated with E-TC nuc to regulate mitochondrial DNA expression in areas closely linked to synaptic activation. The effectiveness of E-TC mito weakens with age, contributing to age-related neurological deficits in mice. Boosting brain E-TC mito in aged animals ameliorated these impairments, offering a potential target to counteract age-related cognitive decline.",

Here, we applied a validated and weighted ensemble of global hydrological and climate models to estimate present and future areas of hydroclimatic suitability for malaria transmission. With explicit surface water representation, we predict a net decrease in areas suitable for malaria transmission from 2025 onward, greater sensitivity to future greenhouse gas emissions, and different, more complex, malaria transmission patterns. Areas of malaria transmission that are projected to change are smaller than those estimated by precipitation-based estimates but are associated with greater changes in transmission season lengths.",

We leveraged two decades of behavioral research coupled with historical DNA analysis to reveal that coevolution with hosts underpins speciation in brood-parasitic bronze-cuckoos. At a macroevolutionary scale, we show that highly virulent brood-parasitic taxa have higher speciation rates and are more likely to speciate in sympatry than less-virulent and nonparasitic relatives. We reveal the microevolutionary process underlying speciation: Hosts reject cuckoo nestlings, which selects for mimetic cuckoo nestling morphology. Where cuckoos exploit multiple hosts, selection for mimicry drives genetic and phenotypic divergence corresponding to host preference, even in sympatry. Our work elucidates perhaps the most common, but poorly characterized, evolutionary process driving biological diversification.",

    "abstract": "In addition to their intrinsic rewarding properties, opioids can also evoke aversive reactions that protect against misuse. Cellular mechanisms that govern the interplay between opioid reward and aversion are poorly understood. We used whole-brain activity mapping in mice to show that neurons in the dorsal peduncular nucleus (DPn) are highly responsive to the opioid oxycodone. Connectomic profiling revealed that DPn neurons innervate the parabrachial nucleus (PBn). Spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomics resolved a population of PBn-projecting pyramidal neurons in the DPn that express μ-opioid receptors (μORs). Disrupting μOR signaling in the DPn switched oxycodone from rewarding to aversive and exacerbated the severity of opioid withdrawal. These findings identify the DPn as a key substrate for the abuse liability of opioids.",

    "abstract": "Animals can adjust their diet to maximize energy or nutritional intake. For example, birds often target fruits that match their beak size because those fruits can be consumed more efficiently. We hypothesized that pressure to optimize diet—measured as matching between fruit and beak size—increases under stressful environments, such as those that determine species’ range edges. Using fruit-consumption and trait information for 97 frugivorous bird and 831 plant species across six continents, we demonstrate that birds feed more frequently on closely size-matched fruits near their geographic range limits. This pattern was particularly strong for highly frugivorous birds, whereas opportunistic frugivores showed no such tendency. These findings highlight how frugivore interactions might respond to stressful conditions and reveal that trait matching may not predict resource use consistently.",

Paleozoic fossils trace crown mollusks to forms exhibiting a combination of biomineralized shells and sclerites (e.g., scales, spines, and spicules). We describe a shell-less, Cambrian stem mollusk, Shishania aculeata gen. et sp. nov., with conical, hollow chitinous sclerites and a smooth girdle, broad foot, and mantle cavity. The sclerites have a microstructure of narrow canals consistent with the impressions of chaetal microvilli found in annelids and brachiopods. Shishania sclerites provide a morphological stepping stone between typical chaetae (chitinous bristles) and the external organic part of aculiferan sclerites that encloses a mineralized body. This discovery reinforces a common origin of lophotrochozoan chaetae and the biomineralized aculiferan sclerites, suggesting that the mollusk ancestor was densely covered with hollow chitinous chaetae.",

We show that functional nucleotide-diphosphate-heptose biosynthetic enzymes (HBEs) are distributed widely in bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. We identified a conserved STT R5 motif as a hallmark of heptose nucleotidyltransferases that can synthesize not only ADP-heptose but also cytidine-diphosphate (CDP)– and uridine-diphosphate (UDP)–heptose. Both CDP- and UDP-heptoses are agonists that trigger stronger alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1)–dependent immune responses than ADP-heptose in human and mouse cells and mice. We also produced ADP-heptose in archaea and verified its innate immune agonist functions. Hence, the β- d - manno -heptoses are cross-kingdom, small-molecule, pathogen-associated molecular patterns that activate the ALPK1-dependent innate immune signaling cascade.",

Here, we present a modular flow platform that streamlines the synthesis of heteroatom-CF 3 motifs. Our method uses readily available organic precursors in combination with cesium fluoride as the primary fluorine source, facilitating the rapid generation of N -trifluoromethyl(R) [NCF 3 (R)], SCF 3 (trifluoromethylthio), and OCF 3 (trifluoromethoxy) anions on demand without reliance on perfluoroalkyl precursor reagents. This strategy offers a more environmentally friendly synthesis of trifluoromethyl(heteroatom)–containing molecules, with the potential for scalability in manufacturing processes facilitated by flow technology.",

Morphological differences are consistent across years and are clear even among groups with territories a few meters apart. These repeatable differences are not explained by among-group variation in local weather conditions, bird size, tree height, or patterns of genetic relatedness. Architectural styles are also robust to the immigration of birds from other groups.",

    "abstract": "During discourse comprehension, every new word adds to an evolving representation of meaning that accumulates over consecutive sentences and constrains the next words. To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word “she,” to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves. We recorded from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. Cells that were selective to a particular noun were later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells’ preferred noun. These results imply that concept cells contribute to a rapid and dynamic semantic memory network that is recruited during language comprehension.",

A mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon is obscured by the biological richness of these aggregates and a lack of direct observation of their sedimentation physics. Utilizing a scale-free vertical tracking microscopy in a field setting, we present microhydrodynamic measurements of freshly collected marine snow aggregates from sediment traps. Our observations reveal hitherto-unknown comet-like morphology arising from fluid-structure interactions of transparent exopolymer halos around sinking aggregates. These invisible comet tails slow down individual particles, greatly increasing their residence time. Based on these findings, we constructed a reduced-order model for the Stokesian sedimentation of these mucus-embedded two-phase particles, paving the way toward a predictive understanding of marine snow.",

    "abstract": "How living systems achieve precision in form and function despite their intrinsic stochasticity is a fundamental yet ongoing question in biology. We generated morphomaps of preimplantation embryogenesis in mouse, rabbit, and monkey embryos, and these morphomaps revealed that although blastomere divisions desynchronized passively, 8-cell embryos converged toward robust three-dimensional shapes. Using topological analysis and genetic perturbations, we found that embryos progressively changed their cellular connectivity to a preferred topology, which could be predicted by a physical model in which actomyosin contractility and noise facilitate topological transitions, lowering surface energy. This mechanism favored regular embryo packing and promoted a higher number of inner cells in the 16-cell embryo. Synchronized division reduced embryo packing and generated substantially more misallocated cells and fewer inner-cell–mass cells. These findings suggest that stochasticity in division timing contributes to robust patterning.",

Using genome, transcriptome, and proteome analysis of Hypsibius henanensis sp. nov. , we explored the molecular basis contributing to radiotolerance in this organism. A putatively horizontally transferred gene, DOPA dioxygenase 1 ( DODA1 ), responds to radiation and confers radiotolerance by synthesizing betalains—a type of plant pigment with free radical–scavenging properties. A tardigrade-specific radiation-induced disordered protein, TRID1, facilitates DNA damage repair through a mechanism involving phase separation. Two mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly proteins, BCS1 and NDUFB8, accumulate to accelerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) regeneration for poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and subsequent poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)–mediated DNA damage repair. These three observations expand our understanding of mechanisms of tardigrade radiotolerance.",

We found that in mice, transection of the anterior commissure (AC), which connects the rostroventral forebrain, impaired avoidant behaviors. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the mouse projects to the contralateral nucleus accumbens (NAc) through the AC, independent of its ipsilateral projections. Aversive stimuli activated contralateral BLA-NAc projections. Positive stimuli, however, activated ipsilateral projections. Selective activation of contralateral BLA-NAc projections activated D2-positive medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs), reduced NAc dopamine levels, and caused aversion, whereas selective activation of ipsilateral BLA-NAc projections activated D1-MSNs, increased NAc dopamine levels, and induced reward. The contralateral BLA-AC-NAc pathway is crucial for encoding negative valence, demonstrating distinct functions of intra- and interhemispheric circuits in brain physiology.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in RNA analysis have deepened our understanding of cellular states in biological tissues. However, a substantial gap remains in integrating RNA expression data with spatial context across organs, primarily owing to the challenges associated with RNA detection within intact tissue volumes. Here, we developed Tris buffer–mediated retention of in situ hybridization chain reaction signal in cleared organs (TRISCO), an effective tissue-clearing method designed for whole-brain spatial three-dimensional (3D) RNA imaging. TRISCO resolved several crucial issues, including the preservation of RNA integrity, achieving uniform RNA labeling, and enhancing tissue transparency. We tested TRISCO using a broad range of cell-identity markers, noncoding and activity-dependent RNAs, within diverse organs of varying sizes and species. TRISCO thus emerges as a powerful tool for single-cell, whole-brain, 3D imaging that enables comprehensive transcriptional spatial analysis across the entire brain.",

    "abstract": "Although cumulative culture is a hallmark of hominin evolution, its origins can be traced back to our common ancestor with chimpanzees. Here, we investigated the evolutionary origins of chimpanzee cumulative culture and why it remained incipient. To trace cultural transmission among the four chimpanzee subspecies, we compared population networks based on genetic markers of recent migration and shared cultural traits. We show that limited levels of group connectivity favored the emergence of a few instances of cumulative culture in chimpanzees. As in humans, cultural complexification likely happened in steps, with transmission between populations, incremental changes, and repurposing of technologies. We propose that divergence in social patterns led to increased mobility between groups in the genus Homo , resulting in irreversible dependence on cultural exchange and complexification.",

To colonize, a symbiont must locate its niche and sustain growth within the gut. Adhesins are bacterial cell surface proteins that facilitate attachment to host tissues and are often virulence factors for opportunistic pathogens. However, the attachments are often transient and nonspecific, and additional mechanisms are required to sustain infection. In this work, we use live imaging of individual symbiotic bacterial cells colonizing the gut of living Drosophila melanogaster to show that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum specifically recognizes the fruit fly foregut as a distinct physical niche. L. plantarum establishes stably within its niche through host-specific adhesins encoded by genes carried on a colonization island. The adhesin binding domains are conserved throughout the Lactobacillales, and the island also encodes a secretion system widely conserved among commensal and pathogenic bacteria.",

RAD51 recombinase, the central component of several crucial processes in repairing DNA and protecting genome integrity, forms filaments on DNA, which are tightly regulated. One of these RAD51 regulators is FIGNL1 (fidgetin-like 1), which prevents RAD51 genotoxic chromatin association in normal cells and persistent RAD51 foci upon DNA damage. The cryogenic electron microscopy–imaged structure of FIGNL1 in complex with RAD51 reveals that FIGNL1 forms a nonplanar hexamer and encloses RAD51 N terminus in the FIGNL1 hexamer pore. Mutations in pore loop or catalytic residues of FIGNL1 render it defective in filament disassembly and are lethal in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our study reveals a distinct mechanism for removing RAD51 from bound substrates and provides the molecular basis for FIGNL1 in maintaining genome stability.",

The joint NASA–CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales) Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission uses phase-coherent, wide-swath radar altimetry to measure ocean surface heights at high precision. We show that 1 year of SWOT data offers more detailed information than 30 years of satellite nadir altimetry in marine gravity, enabling the detection of intricate seafloor structures at 8-kilometer spatial resolution.

Distinct allotype pairs, however, differ in the extent to which they bind shared sets of peptides. We developed a functional divergence metric that measures pairwise complementarity of allotype-associated peptide binding profiles. Greater functional divergence for pairs of HLA-A and/or HLA-B allotypes was associated with slower AIDS progression and independently with enhanced viral load control. The metric predicts immune breadth at the peptide level rather than gene level and redefines HLA heterozygosity as a continuum differentially affecting disease outcome. Functional divergence may affect response to additional infections, vaccination, immunotherapy, and other diseases where HLA heterozygote advantage occurs.",

We found that the lipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) expressed on germinal center (GC) B cells is essential for the production of high-affinity antibodies. Mechanistically, Gb3 bound and disengaged CD19 from its chaperone CD81, permitting CD19 to translocate to the B cell receptor complex to trigger signaling. Moreover, Gb3 regulated major histocompatibility complex class II expression to increase diversity of T follicular helper and GC B cells reactive with subdominant epitopes. In influenza infection, elevating Gb3, either endogenously or exogenously, promoted broadly reactive antibody responses and cross-protection. These data demonstrate that Gb3 determines the affinity and breadth of B cell immunity and has potential as a vaccine adjuvant.",

The drift reversal corresponded to a band transfer between a band with Chern number C = +1 and another with C = –1 through a gapless edge mode, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence for noninteracting particles. Nonzero repulsive Hubbard interactions led to the emergence of an additional edge in the system through a mechanism in which pairs of fermions are split.",

Using anatomical and functional approaches in mice, we reveal that odor-driven activity propagates to a large part of the cortex during the first postnatal week and enhances whisker-evoked activation of primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1). This effect disappears in adult animals, in line with the loss of excitatory connectivity from olfactory cortex to wS1. By performing neonatal odor deprivation, followed by electrophysiological and behavioral work in adult animals, we identify a key transient regulation of nasal chemosensory information necessary for the development of wS1 sensory-driven dynamics and somatosensation. Our work uncovers a cross-modal critical window for nasal chemosensation–dependent somatosensory functional maturation.",

The present-day Greenland Ice Sheet calving of icebergs is comparable to that of a mid-range Heinrich event. As the future Greenland Ice Sheet recedes from marine-terminating outlets, its iceberg calving likely will not persist long enough for icebergs alone to cause catastrophic disruption to the Atlantic overturning circulation, although the accelerating Greenland runoff and continued global warming remain threats to the circulation stability.",

Annual killifish embryogenesis, however, challenges prepatterning models as blastomeres disperse and then aggregate to form the germ layers and body axes. We show that huluwa , a prepatterning factor thought to break symmetry by stabilizing β-catenin, is truncated and inactive in Nothobranchius furzeri . Nuclear β-catenin is not selectively stabilized on one side of the blastula but accumulates in cells forming the aggregate. Blocking β-catenin activity or Nodal signaling disrupts aggregate formation and germ layer specification. Nodal signaling coordinates cell migration, establishing an early role for this signaling pathway. These results reveal a surprising departure from established mechanisms of axis formation: Huluwa-mediated prepatterning is dispensable, and β-catenin and Nodal regulate morphogenesis.",

However, we found that particulate Zn changes from Zn bound to phosphoryls in cells to recalcitrant inorganic pools that include biogenic silica, clays, and iron, manganese, and aluminum oxides in the Southern Ocean water column. The abundances of inorganic pools increase with depth and are the only phases preserved in sediments. Changes in the particulate-Zn speciation influence Zn bioavailability and explain the decoupling of Zn and phosphorus and the correlation of Zn and silicon in the water column. These findings reveal a new dimension to the ocean Zn cycle, implicating an underappreciated role of inorganic Zn particles and their impact on biological productivity.",

These genetic elements are common in viruses, but whether they confer a selective advantage is unclear. In this work, we studied intron-encoded homing endonuclease gp210 in bacteriophage ΦPA3 and found that it contributes to viral competition by interfering with the replication of a coinfecting phage, ΦKZ. We show that gp210 targets a specific sequence in ΦKZ, which prevents the assembly of progeny viruses. This work demonstrates how a homing endonuclease can be deployed in interference competition among viruses and provide a relative fitness advantage. Given the ubiquity of homing endonucleases, this selective advantage likely has widespread evolutionary implications in diverse plasmid and viral competition as well as virus-host interactions.",

Typically, site selectivity is achieved by minimizing kinetic complexity by using protecting groups to suppress reactivity at undesired sites (substrate control) or by using catalysts with tailored shapes to drive reactivity at the desired site (catalyst control). We propose “network control,” a contrasting paradigm that exploits hidden interactions between rate constants to greatly amplify modest intrinsic biases and enable precise multisite editing. When network control is applied to the photochemical isomerization of hexoses, six of the eight possible diastereomers can be selectively obtained. The amplification effect can be viewed as a mesoscale phenomenon between the limiting regimes of kinetic control in simple chemical systems and metabolic regulation in complex biological systems.",

We reversed these jumps through microwave-driven transitions, which resulted in a 20-fold improvement in the time the molecule dwells in a chosen state. The measured transition rates showed anisotropy in the thermal environment, pointing to the possibility of using single molecules as in situ probes for the strengths of ambient fields.

    "abstract": "The entorhinal cortex represents allocentric spatial geometry and egocentric speed and heading information required for spatial navigation. However, it remains unclear whether it contributes to the prediction of an animal’s future location. We discovered grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) that have grid fields representing future locations during goal-directed behavior. These predictive grid cells represented prospective spatial information by shifting their grid fields against the direction of travel. Predictive grid cells discharged at the trough phases of the hippocampal CA1 theta oscillation and, together with other types of grid cells, organized sequences of the trajectory from the current to future positions across each theta cycle. Our results suggest that the MEC provides a predictive map that supports forward planning in spatial navigation.",

    "abstract": "The functions of proteins generally depend on their assembly into complexes. During evolution, some complexes have transitioned from homomers encoded by a single gene to heteromers encoded by duplicate genes. This transition could occur without adaptive evolution through intermolecular compensatory mutations. Here, we experimentally duplicated and evolved a homodimeric enzyme to determine whether and how this could happen. We identified hundreds of deleterious mutations that inactivate individual homodimers but produce functional enzymes when coexpressed as duplicated proteins that heterodimerize. The structure of one such heteromer reveals how both losses of function are buffered through the introduction of asymmetry in the complex that allows them to subfunctionalize. Constructive neutral evolution can thus occur by gene duplication followed by only one deleterious mutation per duplicate.",

    "abstract": "New memories are integrated into prior knowledge of the world. But what if consecutive memories exert opposing demands on the host brain network? We report that acquiring a robust (food-context) memory constrains the mouse hippocampus within a population activity space of highly correlated spike trains that prevents subsequent computation of a flexible (object-location) memory. This densely correlated firing structure developed over repeated mnemonic experience, gradually coupling neurons in the superficial sublayer of the CA1 stratum pyramidale to whole-population activity. Applying hippocampal theta-driven closed-loop optogenetic suppression to mitigate this neuronal recruitment during (food-context) memory formation relaxed the topological constraint on hippocampal coactivity and restored subsequent flexible (object-location) memory. These findings uncover an organizational principle for the peer-to-peer coactivity structure of the hippocampal cell population to meet memory demands.",

    "abstract": "Photoperiodic time measurement is the ability of plants and animals to measure differences in day versus night length (photoperiod) and use that information to anticipate critical seasonal transformations, such as annual temperature cycles. This timekeeping phenomenon triggers adaptive responses in higher organisms, such as gonadal stimulation, flowering, and hibernation. Unexpectedly, we observed this capability in cyanobacteria—unicellular prokaryotes with generation times as short as 5 to 6 hours. Cyanobacteria exposed to short, winter-like days developed enhanced resistance to cold mediated by desaturation of membrane lipids and differential programs of gene transcription, including stress response pathways. As in eukaryotes, this photoperiodic timekeeping required an intact circadian clockwork and developed over multiple cycles of photoperiod. Therefore, photoperiodic timekeeping evolved in much simpler organisms than previously appreciated and enabled genetic responses to stresses that recur seasonally.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality.",

Gravitational-wave detectors use photons to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors and so are affected by the SQL. We investigated the performance of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) after the experimental realization of frequency-dependent squeezing designed to surpass the SQL. For the LIGO Livingston detector, we found that the upgrade reduces quantum noise below the SQL by a maximum of three decibels between 35 and 75 hertz while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, increasing the overall detector sensitivity during astrophysical observations.",

A successful activation strategy would necessitate a bathochromic shift in the absorbance profile, an increase in triplet diradical lifetime, and ease of further functionalization. We present a single-flask transformation of carboxylic acids to acyl phosphonates that can access synthetically useful triplet diradicals under visible light or near-ultraviolet irradiation. The use of phosphorus circumvents unproductive Norrish type I processes, promoting selectivity that enables hydrogen-atom transfer reactivity. Use of this strategy promotes the efficient scaffold remodeling of carboxylic acids through various annulation, contraction, and expansion manifolds.",

Lavas from individual eruptions are often chemically homogeneous, suggesting that they derive from single, well-mixed magma reservoirs. The 2023 to 2024 eruptions at Sundhnúksgígar in the Svartsengi volcanic system in Iceland provide an opportunity to observe the behavior of a mid-crustal magma domain at high spatial and temporal resolution by detailed sampling and geochemical characterization. We observed substantial mantle-derived geochemical variability in the products erupted in the first hours of the December 2023 and January, February, and March to May 2024 eruptions, indicating that the eruptions derived from multiple magma reservoirs, which mineral-melt equilibration pressures place in the mid crust. The unusual presence of geochemical heterogeneity in the mid-crustal magma domain provides insights into how dynamic and complex mid-crustal magma domains can be.",

Complementary chemical, molecular, and genomics analyses revealed that MED6-189 targets the parasite apicoplast and acts by inhibiting lipid biogenesis and cellular trafficking. Genetic analyses revealed that a mutation in PfSec13 , which encodes a component of the parasite secretory machinery, reduced susceptibility to the drug.

    "abstract": "Tree growth and longevity trade-offs fundamentally shape the terrestrial carbon balance. Yet, we lack a unified understanding of how such trade-offs vary across the world’s forests. By mapping life history traits for a wide range of species across the Americas, we reveal considerable variation in life expectancies from 10 centimeters in diameter (ranging from 1.3 to 3195 years) and show that the pace of life for trees can be accurately classified into four demographic functional types. We found emergent patterns in the strength of trade-offs between growth and longevity across a temperature gradient. Furthermore, we show that the diversity of life history traits varies predictably across forest biomes, giving rise to a positive relationship between trait diversity and productivity. Our pan-latitudinal assessment provides new insights into the demographic mechanisms that govern the carbon turnover rate across forest biomes.",

Deep (239×) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of brain neurons from 61 SCZ cases and 25 controls postmortem identified mutations occurring during prenatal neurogenesis. SCZ cases showed increased somatic variants in open chromatin, with increased mosaic CpG transversions (CpG>GpG) and T>G mutations at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) overlapping open chromatin, a result not seen in controls. Some of these variants alter gene expression, including SCZ risk genes and genes involved in neurodevelopment. Although these mutational processes can reflect a difference in factors indirectly involved in disease, increased somatic mutations at developmental TFBSs could also potentially contribute to SCZ.",

Here, we report pathogenic variants in the core protein-folding machinery TRiC/CCT in individuals with brain malformations, intellectual disability, and seizures. The chaperonin TRiC is an obligate hetero-oligomer, and we identify variants in seven of its eight subunits, all of which impair function or assembly through different mechanisms. Transcriptome and proteome analyses of patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrate the various consequences of TRiC impairment. The results reveal an unexpected and potentially widespread role for protein folding in the development of the central nervous system and define a disease spectrum of “TRiCopathies.”",

We report a synthetic strategy for (−)-cylindrocyclophane A that uses 10 C−H functionalization reactions, resulting in a streamlined route with high enantioselectivity and efficiency (17 steps). The use of chiral dirhodium tetracarboxylate catalysis enabled the C–H functionalization of primary and secondary positions, which was complemented by palladium-catalyzed C(sp 2 )–C(sp 2 ) cross-couplings, resulting in the rapid formation of the macrocyclic core and all stereocenters with high regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity. The use of a late-stage palladium-catalyzed fourfold C(sp 2 )–H acetoxylation installed the bis-resorcinol moieties. This research exemplifies how multilaboratory collaborations can produce substantial modernizations of complex total synthesis endeavors.",

In this study, we utilized pump-probe polarization spectroscopy to initialize and track electron spin coherence in a molecule. Designed to efficiently couple spins to light, aqueous potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) enabled detection of few-picosecond free-induction decay at room temperature and micromolar concentrations. Viscosity was found to strongly vary decoherence lifetimes. This approach has improved the experimental time resolution by up to five orders of magnitude, making it possible to observe molecular electron spin coherence in a system that only exhibits coherence below 25 kelvin with traditional techniques.",

    "abstract": "RNA splicing enables the functional adaptation of cells to changing contexts. Impaired splicing has been associated with diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and cellular responses remain poorly understood. In this work, we report that deficiency of ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39) in human cell lines, zebrafish larvae, and mice led to impaired spliceosome assembly and a cytotoxic splicing profile characterized by the use of cryptic 5′ splice sites. Disruptive cryptic variants evaded messenger RNA (mRNA) surveillance pathways and were translated into misfolded proteins, which caused proteotoxic aggregates, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and, ultimately, cell death. The detrimental consequence of splicing-induced proteotoxicity could be mitigated by up-regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system and selective autophagy. Our findings provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of spliceosome-associated diseases.",

This expression leads to oriented cell divisions in the RAM through SHORT ROOT (SHR) and cell cycle regulators. We further show that the RAM has distinct juvenile and adult phases typed by morphological and molecular characteristics and that SPL factors are crucially required for this transition in Arabidopsis and rice ( Oryza sativa ). In summary, we provide molecular insights into the age-dependent morphological changes occurring in the RAM during phase change.",

It remains unknown whether adaptation can keep pace with warming and maintain reef functioning. We have developed an eco-evolutionary metapopulation model for Acropora , an ecologically important yet thermally sensitive coral taxon. We found that, although corals have some adaptation capacity, they will suffer severe heatwave-induced declines over the coming decades. For a future in which emissions lead to ~3°C of global warming, natural selection could allow populations to persist, albeit in severely depleted states with elevated extinction risk and potential loss of ecosystem functioning. Yet, for thermally sensitive coral populations to thrive beyond 2050, there must be rapid reductions of greenhouse gas emissions that limit global warming to 2°C.",

The mechanism by which the transcription machinery coordinates the deposition of H3K36me3 is not well understood. Here we provide cryo–electron microscopy structures of mammalian RNA polymerase II–DSIF-SPT6-PAF1c-TFIIS-IWS1-SETD2-nucleosome elongation complexes, revealing that the transcription machinery regulates H3K36me3 deposition by SETD2 on downstream and upstream nucleosomes. SPT6 binds the exposed H2A-H2B dimer during transcription, and the SPT6 death-like domain mediates an interaction with SETD2 bound to a nucleosome upstream of RNA polymerase II.",

We introduce a model-driven design platform that demonstrates rapid synthetic vascular model generation alongside multifidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations and three-dimensional bioprinting. Key algorithmic advances accelerate vascular generation 230-fold and enable application to arbitrarily complex shapes. We demonstrate that organ-scale vascular network models can be generated and used to computationally vascularize >200 engineered and anatomic models. Synthetic vascular perfusion improves cell viability in fabricated living-tissue constructs. This platform enables the rapid, scalable vascular model generation and fluid physics analysis for biomanufactured tissues that are necessary for future scale-up and production.",

Sensory feedback tunes this vestibulo-ocular reflex throughout life. We studied the functional development of vestibulo-ocular reflex circuit components in the larval zebrafish, with and without sensation. Blind fish stabilize gaze normally, and neural responses to body tilts mature before behavior. In contrast, synapses between motor neurons and the eye muscles mature with a time course similar to behavioral maturation. Larvae without vestibular sensory experience, but with mature neuromuscular junctions, had a strong vestibulo-ocular reflex. Development of the neuromuscular junction, and not sensory experience, therefore determines the rate of maturation of an ancient behavior.",

Presynaptic teneurins mediate excitatory synapse organization by binding to postsynaptic latrophilins; however, the mechanism of action of teneurins, driven by extracellular domains evolutionarily derived from bacterial toxins, remains unclear. In this work, we show that only the intracellular sequence, a dimerization sequence, and extracellular bacterial toxin–derived latrophilin-binding domains of Teneurin-3 are required for synapse organization, suggesting that teneurin-induced latrophilin clustering mediates synaptogenesis. Intracellular Teneurin-3 sequences capture liquid-liquid phase-separated presynaptic active zone scaffolds, enabling us to reconstitute an entire synaptic junction from purified proteins in which trans-synaptic teneurin-latrophilin complexes recruit phase-separated pre- and postsynaptic specializations.",

We conducted a deuterium labeling experiment to determine whether elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), warming, and drought impact soil water storage and transport in a temperate grassland. Elevated CO 2 created a wetter rootzone compared with ambient conditions, whereas warming decreased soil moisture. Soil water remained well mixed in all global change treatments except for summer drought combined with warming and elevated CO 2 . These combined treatments caused the grassland to conserve water and restricted soil water flow to large, rapidly draining pores without mixing with small, slowly draining pores. Our results suggest that drought in a warmer, more CO 2 -rich climate can severely alter grassland ecohydrology by constraining postdrought soil water flow and grassland water use.",

It is often assumed that by helping to mitigate climate change, these strategies indirectly benefit biodiversity. Here, we modeled the climate and habitat requirements of 14,234 vertebrate species and show that the impact of these strategies on species’ habitat area tends not to arise through climate mitigation, but rather through habitat conversion. Across locations, reforestation tends to provide species more habitat through both land-cover change and climate mitigation, whereas habitat loss from afforestation and bioenergy cropping typically outweighs the climate mitigation benefits. This work shows how and where land-based mitigation strategies can be deployed without inadvertently reducing the area of habitat for global biodiversity.",

In Eif2s3y , Uty , and Zfy2 deletants, spermatogenesis was impaired. We found that Uty regulates spermatogonial proliferation, revealed a role for Zfy2 in promoting meiotic sex chromosome pairing, and uncovered unexpected effects of Y genes on the somatic testis transcriptome. In the remaining single Y-gene deletants, spermatogenesis appeared unperturbed, but testis transcription was still altered. Multigene deletions, including a human-infertility AZFa model, exhibited phenotypes absent in single Y deletants. Thus, Y genes may regulate spermatogenesis even if they show no phenotypes when deleted individually. This study advances our knowledge of Y evolution and infertility and provides a resource to dissect Y-gene functions in other tissues.",

In this study, we found that the transcription factor Casz1 is crucial for early IHC fate consolidation and for OHC survival during mouse development. Loss of Casz1 resulted in transdifferentiation of IHCs into OHCs, without affecting OHC production. However, long-term OHC survival was compromised in Casz1 mutant mice. In addition, the transcription factor Gata3 was down-regulated in Casz1 -deleted IHCs, and overexpressing Gata3 partially rescued IHC properties, OHC numbers, and hearing in Casz1 -deleted mice. Thus, Casz1 plays critical roles in early IHC fate stabilization and OHC survival and could potentially provide a lead for therapies aimed at regenerating both IHCs and OHCs.",

These symmetries often determine the system topology, which is made ever more complex with increased dimensionality. Quasicrystals have neither translational nor global rotational symmetry, yet they intrinsically inhabit a higher-dimensional space in which symmetry resurfaces. Here, we discovered topological charge vectors in four dimensions (4D) that govern the real-space topology of 2D quasicrystals and reveal their inherent conservation laws. We demonstrate control over the topology in pentagonal plasmonic quasilattices, mapped by both phase-resolved and time-domain near-field microscopy, showing that their temporal evolution continuously tunes the 2D projections of their distinct 4D topologies. Our work provides a route to experimentally probe the thermodynamic properties of quasicrystals and topological physics in 4D and above.",

At least one order is relevant to social scientists studying political communication because it aims to “ restore freedom of speech and end federal censorship ” in online forums. At first glance, this is a laudable endeavor; who would disagree with bolstering freedom of speech? On closer inspection, however, this order is unlikely to live up to its stated intent.

Twelve years of university field trial and farm survey data from 10 US Corn Belt states indicate that maize hybrids expressing toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt maize) exhibited declining protection from rootworm feeding with increased planting while pest pressures simultaneously decreased. The analysis revealed a tendency to overplant Bt maize, leading to substantial economic losses; this was particularly striking in eastern Corn Belt states. Our findings highlight the need to go beyond the “tragedy of the commons” perspective to protect sustainable use of Bt and other crop biotechnology resources.

In this work, we analyze 573 new and published genomes, focusing on traditional varieties from the Americas and wild relatives from herbaria, to reveal the effects of this shift to clonality. We observe kinship over large distances, maintenance of high genetic diversity, intergenerational heterozygosity enrichment, and genomic mosaics of identity-by-descent haploblocks that connect all manioc worldwide.

Changing the location of production to regions of lower water stress would alleviate current exceedances of water constraints; however, considering economic factors shows that this is not always feasible. Future demand for geological resources is expected to require a considerable increase in water consumption.

Radiators (Borneo) generate and distribute diversity, incubators (Indochina, New Guinea, and Sulawesi) produce diversity in isolation, corridors (Java, Maluku, Sumatra, and the Thai-Malay Peninsula) connect neighboring regions, and accumulators (Australia, India, Palawan, and the Philippines) acquire diversity generated elsewhere.

    "abstract": "Pelage coloration, which serves numerous functions, is crucial to the evolution of behavior, physiology, and habitat preferences of mammals. However, little is known about the coloration of Mesozoic mammaliaforms that coevolved with dinosaurs. In this study, we used a dataset of melanosome (melanin-containing organelle) morphology and quantitatively measured hair colors from 116 extant mammals to reliably reconstruct the coloration of six Mesozoic mammaliaforms, including a previously undescribed euharamiyidan. Unlike the highly diverse melanosomes discovered in feathered dinosaurs, hairs in six mammaliaforms of different lineages and diverse ecomorphotypes showed uniform melanosome geometry, corresponding to dark-brown coloration consistent with crypsis and nocturnality. Our results suggest that the melanosome variation and color expansion seen in extant mammals may have occurred during their rapid radiation and diversification after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.",

    "abstract": "In the developing mammalian heart, the endocardium and the myocardium are separated by so-called cardiac jelly. Communication between the endocardium and the myocardium is essential for cardiac morphogenesis. How membrane-localized receptors and ligands achieve interaction across the cardiac jelly is not understood. Working in developing mouse cardiac morphogenesis models, we used a variety of cellular, imaging, and genetic approaches to elucidate this question. We found that myocardium and endocardium interacted directly through microstructures termed tunneling nanotube–like structures (TNTLs). TNTLs extended from cardiomyocytes (CMs) to contact endocardial cells (ECs) directly. TNTLs transported cytoplasmic proteins, transduced signals between CMs and ECs, and initiated myocardial growth toward the heart lumen to form ventricular trabeculae-like structures. Loss of TNTLs disturbed signaling interactions and, subsequently, ventricular patterning.",

    "abstract": "Horses are among nature’s greatest athletes, yet the ancestral molecular adaptations fueling their energy demands are poorly understood. Within a clinically important pathway regulating redox and metabolic homeostasis (NRF2/KEAP1), we discovered an ancient mutation—conserved in all extant equids—that increases mitochondrial respiration while decreasing tissue-damaging oxidative stress. This mutation is a de novo premature opal stop codon in KEAP1 that is translationally recoded into a cysteine through previously unknown mechanisms, producing an R15C mutation in KEAP1 that is more sensitive to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. This recoding enables increased NRF2 activity, which enhances mitochondrial adenosine 5′-triphosphate production and cellular resistance to oxidative damage. Our study illustrates how recoding of a de novo stop codon, a strategy thought restricted to viruses, can facilitate adaptation in vertebrates.",

To address this, research in quantum optics has explored filtering techniques such as photon ancillas and Rydberg atom blockade to restore entangled states. We introduce an approach to entanglement retrieval that exploits the features of non-Hermitian systems. By designing an anti–parity-time two-state guiding configuration, we demonstrate efficient extraction of entanglement from any input state. This filter is implemented on a lossless waveguide network and achieves near-unity fidelity under single- and two-photon excitation and is scalable to higher photon levels, remaining robust against decoherence during propagation.

Combining lysosomal proteomics with functional genomic datasets, we identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP; formerly phospholipase B domain–containing 1) as the hydrolase most tightly associated with elevated endocytosis. Untargeted metabolomics and biochemical reconstitution demonstrated that LyLAP is a processive monoaminopeptidase with preference for amino-terminal leucine. This activity was necessary and sufficient for the breakdown of hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP was up-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which relies on macropinocytosis for nutrient uptake. In PDA cells, LyLAP ablation led to the buildup of undigested hydrophobic peptides, lysosomal membrane damage, and growth inhibition. Thus, LyLAP enables lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins and protects lysosomal integrity in highly endocytic cancer cells.",

Compared with a white driver traveling the same speed, we find that racial or ethnic minority drivers are 24 to 33% more likely to be cited for speeding and pay 23 to 34% more money in fines.

In this work, we report structures of imitation switch (ISWI) bound to the nucleosome during active ATP hydrolysis and remodeling, revealing conformational transitions of the remodeling motor across the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) cycle. The DNA strands were distorted accordingly, showing one full base-pair bulge and a loss of histone contact at the site of motor binding in the adenosine diphosphate* (ADP*) and apo* (unbound) states. We also identified several important elements for regulation of the remodeling activity. Notably, an enzyme conformation exiting the remodeling cycle reveals a linker DNA–sensing brake mechanism. Together, our findings elucidate a multistate model of ISWI action, providing a comprehensive mechanism of DNA translocation and regulation underpinning chromatin remodeling.",

To investigate their regulation, we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens with in vitro–transcribed mRNAs in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) were identified as mediators of LNP uptake and endosomal escape, respectively. TRIM25—an RNA binding E3 ubiquitin ligase—emerged as a key suppressor inducing turnover of both linear and circular mRNAs. The endoribonucleases N4BP1 and KHNYN, along with the antiviral protein ZAP, act redundantly in TRIM25-dependent surveillance. TRIM25 specifically targets mRNAs delivered by endosomes, and its RNA affinity increases at acidic pH, suggesting activation by protons released from ruptured endosomes. N 1 -methylpseudouridine modification reduces TRIM25’s RNA binding, helping RNAs evade its suppressive effect. This study comprehensively maps cellular pathways regulating LNP-mRNAs, offering insights into RNA immunity and therapeutics.",

CXCR3 expression by CD8 T cells was required for their hours-long reengagement with DCs in specific subfollicular niches in lymph nodes.

Birth canal phenotypes showed sex-specific genetic architecture, aligning with reproductive function. Larger birth canals were linked to slower walking pace and reduced back pain but increased hip osteoarthritis risk, whereas narrower birth canals were associated with reduced pelvic floor disorder risk but increased obstructed labor risk. Lastly, genetic correlation between birth canal and head widths provides evidence of coevolution between the human pelvis and brain, partially mitigating the dilemma.",

Although translation- and transcription-related genes often cluster near the origin of replication, the extent of positional biases across gene families remains unclear. We hypothesized that natural selection broadly favors specific chromosomal positions to optimize growth rate–dependent expression. Analyzing 910 bacterial species and proteomics data from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis , we found that about two-thirds of bacterial gene families are positionally biased. Natural selection drives genes mainly toward the origin or terminus of replication, with the strongest selection in fast-growing species. Our findings reveal chromosomal positioning as a fundamental mechanism for coordinating gene expression with growth rate, highlighting evolutionary constraints on bacterial genome architecture.",

Glycosyrin inhibits the plant-secreted β-galactosidase BGAL1, which would otherwise initiate the release of immunogenic peptides from bacterial flagellin. Here, we report the structure, biosynthesis, and multifunctional roles of glycosyrin. High-resolution cryo–electron microscopy and chemical synthesis revealed that glycosyrin is an iminosugar with a five-membered pyrrolidine ring and a hydrated aldehyde that mimics monosaccharides. Glycosyrin biosynthesis was controlled by virulence regulators, and its production is common in bacteria and prevents flagellin recognition and alters the extracellular glycoproteome and metabolome of infected plants. These findings highlight a potentially wider role for glycobiology manipulation by plant pathogens across the plant kingdom.",

LFDAS revealed distinct strain responses from nine intrusive events, six resulting in fissure eruptions. Geodetic inversion of LFDAS strain reveals detailed magmatic intrusions, with inferred dike volume rate peaking systematically 15 to 22 min before the onset of each eruption. Our results demonstrate DAS’s potential for a dense strainmeter array, enabling high-resolution, nearly real-time imaging of subsurface quasistatic deformations. In active volcanic regions, LFDAS recordings can offer critical insights into magmatic evolution, eruption forecasting, and hazard assessment.",

    "abstract": "Organic farming is often considered to be more sustainable than conventional farming. However, both farming systems comprise highly variable management practices. In this study, we show that in organic and conventional arable fields, the multifunctionality of soils decreases with increasing agricultural management intensity. Soil organic carbon content and bacterial biomass, respectively, were the strongest abiotic and biotic predictors of soil multifunctionality. Greater soil multifunctionality was associated with less-frequent inversion tillage and higher frequency of grass-legume cover cropping, and organic farming did not outperform conventional farming. Our results suggest that reducing management intensity will enhance soil multifunctionality in both conventional and organic farming. This implies that, in contexts where high-yielding, high-intensity agriculture prevails, the paradigm of sustainable intensification should be replaced by “productive deintensification.”",

This study pinpoints the exact locations of aluminum atoms in ZSM-5 structures—a key zeolite catalyst. Aluminum siting governs catalytic efficiency in acid and redox processes. Anomalous x-ray powder diffraction (AXRPD) at the aluminum K-edge probes the long-range order of aluminum atoms within the ZSM-5 frameworks, precisely quantifying both isolated aluminum atoms and Al(-O-Si-O-) x Al sequences (aluminum pairs). Supported by nuclear magnetic resonance studies, AXRPD unambiguously determines the crystallographic organization of aluminum pairs, recognized spectroscopically as α, β, and γ sites, linking their distribution to superior catalytic activity in propene oligomerization. This combined approach provides essential insights for optimizing zeolite catalysts and enhancing their performance.",

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.",

Using molecular insights into dietary fiber metabolism by the human gut microbiota, we designed a targeted drug delivery system, called GlycoCaging, that is based on bespoke glycoconjugates of a complex plant oligosaccharide. GlycoCaging of exemplar anti-inflammatory drugs enabled release of active molecules triggered by specific glycosidases of autochthonous gut bacteria. GlycoCaging ensured that drug efficacy was potentiated, and off-target effects were eliminated in murine models of inflammatory bowel disease. Biochemical and metagenomic analyses of gut microbiota of individual humans confirmed the broad applicability of this strategy.",

    "abstract": "During tissue formation, dynamic cell shape changes drive morphogenesis while asymmetric divisions create cellular diversity. We found that the shifts in cell morphology that shape tissues could concomitantly act as conserved instructive cues that trigger asymmetric division and direct core identity decisions underpinning tissue building. We performed single-cell morphometric analyses of endothelial and other mesenchymal-like cells. Distinct morphological changes switched cells to an “isomorphic” mode of division, which preserved pre-mitotic morphology throughout mitosis. In isomorphic divisions, interphase morphology appeared to provide a geometric code defining mitotic symmetry, fate determinant partitioning, and daughter state. Rab4-positive endosomes recognized this code, allowing them to respond to pre-mitotic morphology and segregate determinants accordingly. Thus, morphogenetic shape change sculpts tissue form while also generating cellular heterogeneity, thereby driving tissue assembly.",

Here we use a degenerate Fermi gas loaded into a three-dimensional optical lattice to study the effect of a tunable Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. The clock laser introduces a spin-orbit coupling spiral phase and breaks the isotropy of superexchange interactions, leading to XXZ-type spin anisotropy. By tuning the lattice confinement and applying imaging spectroscopy, we map out favorable atomic coherence regimes. We transition through various interaction regimes and observe coherent superexchange, tunable through on-site interaction and site-to-site energy shift, affecting the Ramsey fringe contrast over timescales >1 second. This study lays the groundwork for using a three-dimensional optical lattice clock to probe quantum magnetism and spin entanglement.",

We quantify the strength of molecular interactions across more than six orders of magnitude in affinity constant and track reactions in real time. Highly parallel measurements on individual molecules serve to characterize sample-state heterogeneity at the highest resolution, offering predictive input to model three-dimensional structure.

By contrast, the skyrmion formation mechanism in centrosymmetric materials remains elusive. Here, we reveal the intrinsic electronic structure of the centrosymmetric GdRu 2 Si 2 by selectively measuring magnetic domains using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We found robust Fermi surface (FS) nesting, consistent with the magnetic modulation q -vector detected by the previous resonant x-ray scattering measurements. The pseudogap opens at the nested FS portions, which vary for different magnetic domains. The anomalous pseudogap disconnects the FS to generate Fermi arcs with twofold symmetry. These results indicate that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction plays a decisive role in generating the screw spin modulation responsible for the skyrmion formation in GdRu 2 Si 2 . Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexible nature of magnetism in GdRu 2 Si 2 by manipulating magnetic domains with magnetic field and temperature cyclings, providing potential future applications for data storage and processing devices.",

We show that dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), a volatile compound that attracts saprophilous pollinators, is produced by a disulfide synthase (DSS) in the plant genus Asarum (Aristolochiaceae). DSS is derived from methanethiol oxidase (MTOX), an enzyme conserved among animals and plants, and similar DSS enzymes have independently evolved in two other plant genera. Three amino acid changes shared among the DSSs of independent origins were sufficient to cause a functional switch between MTOX and DSS. The small number of amino acid changes and the co-option of a highly conserved enzyme may explain why DMDS-emitting flowers are widespread among floral mimics.",

Bulk and interface characterizations by multimodal synchrotron x-ray probes and cryo–transmission electron microscopy show that the in situ segregated lithium halide interfacial layers substantially boost effective ion transport and suppress the volume change of bulk chalcogen cathodes.

At low densities, the Wigner solid forms nanocrystalline domains pinned by local disorder. It exhibits a quantum densification behavior with increased densities in the solid phase.

We silenced the translation of specific mitochondrial mRNAs in living human cells by delivering synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras. This approach allowed us to perform a comprehensive temporal monitoring of cellular responses. Our study provides insights into mitochondrial translation, its integration into cellular physiology, and provides a strategy to address mitochondrial gene expression in living cells.

Whereas BRCA1-BARD1 alleviates the CST-imposed EXO1 blockade, it has little effect on BLM-DNA2 restriction. CST mutants impaired for DNA binding or BLM–EXO1 interaction exhibit a hyper-resection phenotype and render BRCA1-deficient cells resistant to poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Our findings mechanistically define the crucial role of CST in DNA DSB repair pathway choice and have implications for understanding cancer therapy resistance stemming from dysfunction of the 53BP1 axis.",

In this work, we show that this competitive cancellation is essential for understanding computation in the cerebellum. In marmosets, we identified a vector for each Purkinje cell (P cell) along which its spikes displaced the eyes. Two spikes in two different P cells produced superposition of their vectors. In the resulting population activity, the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. Mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands and the goal of the movement. Molecular layer interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P cell population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped.",

Extending the same concept to molecular separation of organic solvents would be a key enabler for the decarbonization of the chemical and petrochemical industries through energy-efficient crude or biocrude oil fractionation. Here, we report a molecular engineering approach based on acid-catalyzed interfacial polymerization for efficient hydrocarbon separation. The design strategies include (i) changing the linkage from amide to imine and (ii) subsequent introduction of shape-persistent units such as triptycene and spirobifluorene. The prepared polyimine membranes exhibit ultrahigh microporosity and enhanced swelling and plasticization resistance compared with conventional polyamide counterparts. These membranes, which feature fast and selective transport of hydrocarbons, including multicomponent and industrially relevant mixtures, outperform commercial and state-of-the-art benchmark membranes.",

We generated a global-scale understanding of marine heteroprokaryotic functional biogeography by synthesizing genetic sequencing data with a mechanistic marine ecosystem model. We incorporated heteroprokaryotic diversity into the trait-based model along two axes: substrate lability and growth strategy. Using genetic sequences along three ocean transects, we compiled 21 heteroprokaryotic guilds and estimated their degree of optimization for rapid growth (copiotrophy). Data and model consistency indicated that gradients in grazing and substrate lability predominantly set biogeographical patterns, and we identified deep-ocean “slow copiotrophs” whose ecological interactions control the surface accumulation of dissolved organic carbon.",

However, the extent to which these turf algae alter the surrounding chemical environment or affect the rebound potential of kelp forests (through chemically mediated interactions) remains unknown. Here, we used underwater visual surveys, comprehensive chemical profiling, and laboratory experiments to reveal that turf algae release bioactive compounds into the water that fundamentally alter the reef “chemical landscape” and directly suppress kelp recruitment. Therefore, our study reveals that chemical ecology is critical in shaping modern kelp forest ecosystems and their resilience. Further, it demonstrates that reversing climate-driven state shifts will require not only curbing global carbon emissions but also implementing targeted local interventions that break harmful ecological feedback loops and foster recovery.",

We estimate that glaciers globally will lose 39 (range, 15 to 55)% of their mass relative to 2020, corresponding to a global mean sea-level rise of 113 (range, 43 to 204) mm even if temperatures stabilized at present-day conditions. Under the +1.5°C Paris Agreement goal, more than twice as much global glacier mass remains at equilibration (53% versus 24%) compared with the warming level resulting from current policies (+2.7°C by 2100 above preindustrial).

In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band, which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor and also distinguish a chiral from a nonchiral Δ k through enhanced s-wave proximity. In this study, we used s-wave superconductive scan tips and detected intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe 2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging revealed subgap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a -axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity signifies that Δ k of UTe 2 is a nonchiral state: B 1 u , B 2 u , or B 3 u . However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a axis is internodal, then a nonchiral B 3 u state is the most consistent for UTe 2 .",

By screening 389 ancient and 408 contemporary samples, we have expanded the genetic data available for the species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed distinct human-infecting clades of M. lepromatosis , with one dominating North America since colonial times.

Most investment focused on reactive law enforcement—rangers, tracking dogs, access controls, and detection cameras—which helped achieve >700 poacher arrests. Yet we found no statistical evidence that these interventions reduced poaching (horn demand, wealth inequality, embedded criminal syndicates, and corruption likely combine to drive even high-risk poaching). By contrast, reducing poacher reward through dehorning (2284 rhinos across eight reserves) achieved large (~78%) and abrupt reductions in poaching using 1.2% of the budget. Some poaching of dehorned rhinos continued because poachers targeted horn stumps and regrowth, signaling the need for regular dehorning alongside judicious use of law enforcement.",

In this work, we fabricated a subretinal nanoprosthesis using tellurium nanowire networks (TeNWNs) that converts light of both the visible and near-infrared–II spectra into electrical signals. The broad-spectrum coverage is made possible by a combination of narrow bandgaps, strong absorption, and engineered asymmetries. Implanted into blind mice, the TeNWNs restored pupillary reflexes and enabled visually cued learning under visible and near-infrared 1550-nanometer light. In nonhuman primates, TeNWNs elicited robust retina-derived neural responses, confirming biocompatibility and feasibility. By restoring lost photosensitivity and extending vision to near-infrared, this nanoprosthesis offers a promising approach for restoring vision.",

    "abstract": "The melanocortin system centrally regulates energy homeostasis, with key components such as melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and adenylyl cyclase 3 (ADCY3) in neuronal primary cilia. Mutations in MC4R and ADCY3 as well as ciliary dysfunction lead to obesity, but how melanocortin signaling works in cilia remains unclear. Using mouse random germline mutagenesis, we identified two missense mutations in G protein–coupled receptor 45 (Gpr45) that lead to obesity through hyperphagia. GPR45 was expressed in paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), where it localized to cilia and recruited Gα s to increase ciliary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) via ADCY3. GPR45 colocalized with MC4R in PVH cilia and promoted ciliary MC4R activation. Loss of GPR45 in the PVH or MC4R + neurons caused obesity. These findings establish GPR45 as a key regulator of the ciliary melanocortin system, bridging MC4R and ADCY3.",

We found that circulating taurine concentrations increased or remained unchanged with age in three geographically distinct human cohorts as well as in nonhuman primates and mice when measured longitudinally (repeatedly in the same population) or cross-sectionally (sampling distinct populations at various ages). Moreover, considerable variability was observed in associations between taurine and age-related changes in health outcomes pertaining to gross motor function and energy homeostasis. Our results suggest that changes in circulating taurine are not a universal feature of aging and that its pleiotropic effects may be dependent on the temporal and physiological context of each individual.",

In a 100-square-centimeter, scaled-up CO 2 RR membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with single serpentine flow channels, the acid humidification method achieved the 4500 hours of stability milestone at 100 mA cm −2 without compromising the CO faradaic efficiency, whereas a conventional water-humidified CO 2 feed only operated stably for ~80 hours. The acid-humidified CO 2 approach was extended to bismuth, copper, and zinc catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Jaundice is a common presentation of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which arises from the accumulation of circulating bilirubin. It is not understood whether it represents an adaptive or maladaptive response to Plasmodium spp. infection. We found that asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in humans was associated with a higher ratio of unconjugated over conjugated bilirubin and parasite burden compared with symptomatic malaria. Genetic suppression of bilirubin synthesis by biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) increased parasite virulence and malaria mortality in mice. Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in plasma, through genetic inhibition of hepatic conjugation by UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), was protective against malaria in mice. Unconjugated bilirubin inhibited P. falciparum proliferation in red blood cells by a mechanism that suppressed mitochondrial pyrimidine synthesis. Moreover, unconjugated bilirubin inhibited hemozoin crystallization and compromised the parasite’s food vacuole. Hence, jaundice appears to represent a metabolic response to Plasmodium spp. infection that limits malaria severity.",

Here we present an evaluation of nitrogen fixation for inland and coastal waters. We demonstrate that water column and sediment nitrogen fixation is ubiquitous across these diverse aquatic habitats, with rates ranging six orders of magnitude. We conservatively estimate that, despite accounting for less than 10% of the global surface area, inland and coastal aquatic systems fix 40 (30 to 54) teragrams of nitrogen per year, equivalent to 15% of the nitrogen fixed on land and in the open ocean. Inland systems contribute more than half of this biological nitrogen fixation.",

By querying 1375 genomes of the species-rich Malawi cichlid fish radiation, we discovered five large inversions segregating in the benthic subradiation that each suppress recombination over more than half a chromosome. Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagic Diplotaxodon through admixture, whereas the others established early in the deep benthic clade. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage, and a notable excess of protein changing substitutions points toward selection on neurosensory, physiological, and reproductive genes. These results indicate that repeated interplay between depth adaptation and sex-specific selection on large inversions has been central to the evolution of this iconic system.",

We find that plastic bag policies lead to a 25 to 47% decrease in plastic bags as a share of total items collected at cleanups relative to areas without policies, with taxes possibly further reducing shoreline litter. At a time when many jurisdictions are considering bag policies, while others are preemptively prohibiting them, our study provides evidence that they mitigate shoreline plastic pollution.",

Sourness, one of the primary tastes, is aversive in mammals, whereas many birds frequently consume acidic fruits, suggesting a potential tolerance. Our study uncovers a mechanism enabling avian sour tolerance that involves changes to the sour receptor [otopetrin 1 (OTOP1)]. We demonstrate that sour tolerance is a conserved trait in birds, with avian OTOP1 exhibiting acid-induced inhibition and OTOP1 modulation affecting sour perception and tolerance. Ancestral reconstruction reveals that the increase in acid tolerance may have evolved at the same point in the songbird phylogeny as the regain of sweet sensing in this clade. This shift might have enabled songbirds to feed on a wider range of fruits, affecting the evolution and diversification of the songbird radiation.",

Using satellite observations of ocean chlorophyll a (Chl) concentration, we show that the surface ocean experienced a poleward greening from 2003 to 2022. Contemporaneously, the subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere experienced a decrease in Chl. As such, the latitudinal disparity in Chl, as documented by an inequality index, has been increasing over the past two decades, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Rising water temperatures may primarily influence the Chl trends. The increasing Chl inequality—marked by “greener green and bluer blue” waters—has the potential to cascade to higher trophic levels, with implications for the fisheries and economies of coastal nations.",

Despite the transformative impact, visible-light photoredox catalysis remains constrained by the thermodynamic limits of photon energy and inefficiencies arising from unproductive back electron transfer, both of which become particularly pronounced in thermodynamically demanding reactions. In this work, we introduce an organic photoredox catalyst system that overcomes these obstacles to drive chemical transformations that require super-reducing capabilities. This advancement is accomplished by coupling the energy of two photons into a single chemical reduction, whereas inefficiencies from back electron transfer are mitigated through a distinct proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism embedded in the catalyst design. The super-reducing capabilities of this organic catalyst system are demonstrated through efficient application in a broad scope of challenging arene reductions.",

These tLNPs reprogrammed CD8 + T cells in both healthy donor and autoimmune patient samples, and in vivo dosing resulted in tumor control in humanized mice and B cell depletion in cynomolgus monkeys. In cynomolgus monkeys, the reconstituted B cells after depletion were predominantly naïve, suggesting an immune system reset.

    "abstract": "Many questions remain regarding Earth’s earliest crust owing to the rarity of Hadean (>4.03 billion-year-old) rocks and minerals. The Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt (NGB) in Canada may be the only known remnant of Hadean crust, although its age is debated, ranging from ≥3.75 to 4.3 billion years old. Mafic intrusions within this belt were specifically sampled and analyzed to investigate the timing of their magmatic differentiation. Correlations between samarium/neodymium (Sm/Nd) and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 142 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios correspond to ages of 4157 ± 174 and 4196 − 81 + 53 million years for the long-lived 147 Sm- 143 Nd and the short-lived 146 Sm- 142 Nd systems, respectively. The age agreement between both extant and extinct radiogenic systems, in rocks related through igneous fractionation, is compelling evidence for preservation of Hadean rocks in the NGB, opening a rare window into Earth’s earliest times.",

However, understanding how animals leverage refractive index differences for dynamic color changes and then translating such insight into tunable optical devices remains challenging. We experimentally and computationally demonstrated that iridescent cells (iridophores) containing Bragg reflectors with sinusoidal-wave (rugate) refractive index profiles enable squid dorsal mantle tissues to reversibly transition between nearly transparent and vibrantly colored states. We then drew inspiration from these findings for the design and development of iridophore-inspired multispectral composite materials with tunable visible and infrared functionalities. Our study provides insight into squid dynamic structural coloration mechanisms and furnishes a technology for camouflage, heat management, display, and sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "West Anatolia has been a crucial yet elusive element in the Neolithic expansion from the Fertile Crescent to Europe. In this work, we describe the changing genetic and cultural landscapes of early Holocene West Anatolia using 30 new paleogenomes. We show that Neolithization in West Anatolia was a multifaceted process, characterized by the assimilation of Neolithic practices by local foragers, the influx of eastern populations, and their admixture, with their descendants subsequently establishing Neolithic Southeast Europe. We then coanalyzed genetic and cultural similarities across early Holocene Anatolian and Aegean Neolithic villages using 58 material culture elements. Cultural distances among villages correlate with their spatial distances but not with their genetic distances after controlling for geography. This suggests that cultural change was often decoupled from genetically visible mobility.",

    "abstract": "Combining 131 paleogenomes with bioarchaeological and archaeological data, we studied social organization and gendered practices in Çatalhöyük East Mound (7100 to 5950 BCE), a major Neolithic settlement in Central Anatolia. In early Çatalhöyük, burials in the same building were frequently close genetic relatives, suggesting that houses were used by biological family members. In later periods, however, individuals buried in the same building were often genetically unrelated, despite sharing similar diets. We found no indication of sex-biased mobility into Çatalhöyük. Meanwhile, in all periods, within-building genetic connections were predominantly maternal rather than paternal. Burials of female subadults also received a higher frequency of gifts than male subadults. Our results reveal how kinship practices changed while specific practices prioritizing female lines persisted for 1000 years at Neolithic Çatalhöyük.",

The coseismic slip was adjacent to the 1996 Hyuga-nada earthquake source. The afterslip resolved near the hypocenter area and in the downdip extension of the mainshock, reaching M w 6.7 on 16 September 2024. Leading up to the earthquake, the recurrence interval for SSEs in the preslip area shortened from an average of 2 years, estimated from observations over the past 30 years, to 1 year, consistent with simulations in which the weakening of the Nankai megathrust was attributed to the cause.",

In this work, we analyze formation pore pressure records from three offshore borehole observatories at the Nankai subduction zone, Honshu, Japan, to capture detailed slip-time histories of two slow slip events (SSEs) along the outermost reaches of the plate boundary. Slip initiates ~30 kilometers landward of the trench; migrates seaward at 1 to 2 kilometers per day to within a few kilometers of, and possibly breaching, the trench; and coincides with the onset and migration of tremor and/or very-low-frequency earthquakes. The SSE source region lies in a zone of high pore fluid pressure and low stress, which provides clear observational evidence linking these factors to shallow slow earthquakes.",

However, existing protocols for generating random unitaries require long evolution times and deep circuits. In this work, we prove that local quantum circuits can form random unitaries in extremely low depth on any geometry. These shallow circuits have low complexity and create only short-range correlations, yet are indistinguishable from random unitaries with exponential complexity. This finding contrasts sharply with classical systems, in which a long evolution time is required to appear random. Our results have widespread applications across quantum science, from device benchmarking to quantum advantages. Moreover, they reveal that fundamental physical properties—including evolution time, causal structure, and phases of matter—are provably hard to learn.",

Its monoallelic mutation causes CSF1R-associated microgliopathy (CAMP), a major form of adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) and a fatal neurological disease without clinical cure. We developed mouse models harboring human hotspot mutations of CAMP and replaced CSF1R-deficient microglia with CSF1R-normal cells through microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT), which attenuated pathology in mice. We further demonstrated that, in the context of CSF1R deficiency, traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) in ALSP functions similarly to Mr BMT, efficiently replacing microglia and reducing disease progression. We then replaced CSF1R-deficient microglia in eight patients by tBMT. The disease progression was halted during the 24-month follow-up. Together, microglia replacement corrects pathogenic mutations and halts disease progression in mice and humans.",

This Fe-catalyzed method harnesses α-Cl radicals and couples an exceptionally wide array of carbenes in (2+1) cyclopropanations and σ-bond insertions. This mild, robust, and electronically tunable synthetic method facilitated the development of a better classification system for catalytic metal carbenes (validated by both kinetic and thermodynamic quantification), as well as a carbene “click-like” reaction and aqueous adaptation for chemical biology applications.",

With this approach, the targets were obtained in 17 to 19 steps, 12 to 13 purifications, and 0.5 to 3.5% overall yield. The structure of an advanced intermediate was elucidated by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) analysis.

    "abstract": "Animal body-size variation influences multiple processes in marine ecosystems, but habitat heterogeneity has prevented a comprehensive assessment of size across pelagic (midwater) and benthic (seabed) systems along anthropic gradients. In this work, we derive fish size indicators from 17,411 stereo baited-video deployments to test for differences between pelagic and benthic responses to remoteness from human pressures and effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs). From records of 823,849 individual fish, we report divergent responses between systems, with pelagic size structure more profoundly eroded near human markets than benthic size structure, signifying greater vulnerability of pelagic systems to human pressure. Effective protection of benthic size structure can be achieved through MPAs placed near markets, thereby contributing to benthic habitat restoration and the recovery of associated fishes. By contrast, recovery of the world’s largest and most endangered fishes in pelagic systems requires the creation of highly protected areas in remote locations, including on the High Seas, where protection efforts lag.",

    "abstract": "Spinal circuits are central to movement adaptation, yet the mechanisms within the spinal cord responsible for acquiring and retaining behavior upon experience remain unclear. Using a simple conditioning paradigm, we found that dorsal inhibitory neurons are indispensable for adapting protective limb-withdrawal behavior by regulating the transmission of a specific set of somatosensory information to enhance the saliency of conditioning cues associated with limb position. By contrast, maintaining previously acquired motor adaptation required the ventral inhibitory Renshaw cells. Manipulating Renshaw cells does not affect the adaptation itself but flexibly alters the expression of adaptive behavior. These findings identify a circuit basis involving two distinct populations of spinal inhibitory neurons, which enables lasting sensorimotor adaptation independently from the brain.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary histories of major clades, including mammals, often comprise changes in their diversification dynamics, but how these changes occur remains debated. We combined comprehensive phylogenetic and fossil information in a new “birth-death diffusion” model that provides a detailed characterization of variation in diversification rates in mammals. We found an early rising and sustained diversification scenario, wherein speciation rates increased before and during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary. The K-Pg mass extinction event filtered out more slowly speciating lineages and was followed by a subsequent slowing in speciation rates rather than rebounds. These dynamics arose from an imbalanced speciation process, with separate lineages giving rise to many, less speciation-prone descendants. Diversity seems to have been brought about by these isolated, fast-speciating lineages, rather than by a few punctuated innovations.",

We combined a new budget of radiocarbon produced by nuclear bomb testing in the 1960s with model simulations to evaluate carbon cycling in terrestrial vegetation. We found that most state-of-the-art vegetation models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project underestimated the radiocarbon accumulation in vegetation biomass. Our findings, combined with constraints on vegetation carbon stocks and productivity trends, imply that net primary productivity is likely at least 80 petagrams of carbon per year presently, compared with the 43 to 76 petagrams per year predicted by current models. Storage of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial vegetation is likely more short-lived and vulnerable than previously predicted.",

However, the possibilities of harnessing topological structures to process quantum information with linear optics, through the quantum interference of photons, remain largely uncharted. Here, we present a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference effect of topological origin. We show that this interference of photon pairs—ranging from constructive to destructive—is solely determined by a synthetic magnetic flux, rendering it resilient to errors on a fundamental level. Our implementation establishes a quantized flux that facilitates exclusively destructive quantum interference. Our findings pave the way toward the development of next-generation photonic quantum circuitry and scalable quantum computing protected by virtue of topologically robust quantum gates.",

We reveal the highly heterogeneous electric-field–driven responses of intra- and interlaminate PNDs and establish their correlation with the local strain and the nature of the PND walls. Our observations highlight the critical role of hierarchical lattice organizations on macroscopic material properties and provide guiding principles for the understanding and design of relaxors and a wide range of quantum and functional materials.",

In this work, we present insights that we obtained using daily data from the National Health Service COVID-19 app for England and Wales and that we shared with health authorities in almost real time. Our indicator of the reproduction number R ( t ) was available days earlier than other estimates, with an innovative capability to decompose R ( t ) into contact rates and probabilities of infection. When Omicron arrived, the main epidemic driver switched from contacts to transmissibility. We separated contacts and transmissions by day of exposure and setting and found pronounced variability over days of the week and during Christmas holidays and events. For example, during the Euro football tournament in 2021, days with England matches showed sharp spikes in exposures and transmissibility. Digital contact-tracing technologies can help control epidemics not only by directly preventing transmissions but also by enabling rapid analysis at scale and with unprecedented resolution.",

In contrast to phase-vortex beams, our electrons maintained a flat de Broglie wave but obtained their chirality from the shape of their expectation value in space and time. Measurements of wave function densities by attosecond gating revealed the three-dimensional shape of coils and double coils with left-handed or right-handed pitch. Engineered elementary particles with such or related chiral geometries should be useful for applications in chiral sensing, free-electron quantum optics, particle physics or electron microscopy.",

Almost all current global chemistry models calculate about 15% too much OH and thus too rapid methane loss. Methane is a short-lived climate forcer, critical to achieving global warming targets, and this error affects our model projections of climate change. New observations of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet region (290 to 350 nanometers) imply reductions in sunlight with key photolysis rates decreasing by 8 to 12% in the near-surface tropical atmosphere. Incorporation of this new mechanism in a chemistry-transport model reduces OH and methane loss by only 4%, but combined with other proposed mechanisms, such as tropospheric halogen chemistry (7%), we may be able to resolve this conundrum.",

Our data indicate that the Chicxulub impactor was a carbonaceous-type asteroid, which had formed beyond the orbit of Jupiter. The five other impact structures have isotopic signatures that are more consistent with siliceous-type asteroids, which formed closer to the Sun. The ancient spherule layer samples are consistent with impacts of carbonaceous-type asteroids during Earth’s final stages of accretion.",

We adapted RNA interactome capture to mouse male germ cells, building an RBP atlas characterized by multiple layers of dynamics along spermatogenesis. Trapping of RNA–cross-linked peptides showed that the glutamic acid–arginine (ER) patch, a residue-coevolved polyampholytic element present in coiled coils, enhances RNA binding of its host RBPs. Deletion of this element in NONO (non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein) led to a defective mitosis-to-meiosis transition due to compromised NONO-RNA interactions. Whole-exome sequencing of over 1000 infertile men revealed a prominent role of RBPs in the human genetic architecture of male infertility and identified risk ER patch variants.",

Innovative strategies that reverse such couplings in a precise and on-demand manner, enabling a click-clip sequence, would greatly expand the technique’s versatility. Herein, a click and clip reaction pair is demonstrated by manipulation of a sulfilimine linkage. Phenothiazines and amines are rapidly and quantitatively coupled through oxidative sulfilimine bond formation with N-bromosuccinimide, and the resulting sulfilimine bromides then undergo quantitative reversion to the phenothiazines and amines through photoreduction at 380 nanometers. This protocol enables fabrication of depolymerizable macromolecules and reversible modification of aminosaccharides, demonstrating high selectivity and efficiency for manipulating sulfilimine linkages in complex systems.",

We investigated germline mutations in GNAI2 , which encodes G αi2 , a key component in heterotrimeric G protein signal transduction usually thought to regulate adenylyl cyclase–mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. Patients with activating G αi2 mutations had clinical presentations that included impaired immunity. Mutant G αi2 impaired cell migration and augmented responses to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. We found that mutant G αi2 influenced TCR signaling by sequestering the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–activating protein RASA2, thereby promoting RAS activation and increasing downstream extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT S6 signaling to drive cellular growth and proliferation.",

XIST , RSX , and roX2 regulate X chromosomes in placental mammals, marsupials, and Drosophila , respectively. Because the green anole ( Anolis carolinensis ) shows complete dosage compensation of its X chromosome, we tested whether a lncRNA was involved. We found an ancient lncRNA, MAYEX , that gained male-specific expression more than 89 million years ago. MAYEX evolved a notable association with the acetylated histone 4 lysine 16 (H4K16ac) epigenetic mark and the ability to loop its locus to the totality of the X chromosome to increase expression levels. MAYEX is the first lncRNA in reptiles linked to a dosage compensation mechanism that balances the expression of sex chromosomes.",

We generated a series of mutants and screened them in vitro to assess their potential for forming a stable pre-F.

    "abstract": "Diverging from conventional cell division models, plant cells undergo incomplete division to generate plasmodesmata communication bridges between daughter cells. Although fundamental for plant multicellularity, the molecular events leading to bridge stabilization, as opposed to severing, remain unknown. Using electron tomography, we mapped the transition from cell plate fenestrae to plasmodesmata. We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) connects daughter cells across fenestrae, and as the cell plate matures, fenestrae contract, causing the plasma membrane (PM) to mold around constricted ER tubes. The ER’s presence prevents fenestrae fusion, forming plasmodesmata, whereas its absence results in closure. The ER-PM protein tethers MCTP3, MCTP4, and MCTP6 further stabilize nascent plasmodesmata during fenestrae contraction. Genetic deletion in Arabidopsis reduces plasmodesmata formation. Our findings reveal how plants undergo incomplete division to promote intercellular communication.",

However, the lack of extensive and large-scale geodetic networks near such seismic events hinders our thorough understanding of the large-scale crustal deformation resulting from earthquakes. Using Türkiye’s extensive and continuous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) network during the moment magnitude 7.8 and 7.6 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes on 6 February 2023, we show that large earthquakes can induce far-field crustal deformations (>700 kilometers), exceeding current predictions from elastic dislocation models. They can lead to the mobilization of tectonic plates and the triggering of far-field earthquakes, which carries profound implications for seismic hazard assessments and necessitates a new perspective on crustal deformation and earthquake mechanics.",

Inhibition of reverse transcriptase or deficiency for cGAS or STING had little or no effect on hematopoiesis in nonpregnant mice but depleted HSCs and erythroid progenitors in pregnant mice, reducing red blood cell counts. Retrotransposons and IFN-regulated genes were also induced in mouse HSCs after serial bleeding and, in human HSCs, during pregnancy.

In silico analyses have revealed hundreds of mobile genetic elements shared between these species, yet little is known about the phenotypes they encode, their effects on fitness, or pleiotropic consequences for the recipient’s genome. In this work, we show that acquisition of a ubiquitous integrative conjugative element (ICE) encoding a type VI secretion system (T6SS) shuts down the native T6SS of Bacteroides fragilis . Despite inactivating this T6SS, ICE acquisition increases the fitness of the B. fragilis transconjugant over its progenitor by arming it with the new T6SS. DNA transfer causes the strain to change allegiances so that it no longer targets ecosystem members with the same element yet is armed for communal defense.",

The SRHP demonstrates a cooling of 8.8 kelvin below ambient temperature in 30 seconds and delivers a maximum specific cooling power of 1.52 watts per gram. The temperature lift of the SRHP is 14.2 kelvin. These results underscore the potential of the compact solid-state cooling mechanism to address the increasing need for localized thermal management.",

We show that bats can identify their location after translocation and conduct several-kilometer map-based navigation using solely echolocation. This proposition was further supported by a large-scale echolocation model disclosing how bats use environmental acoustic information to perform acoustic cognitive map–based navigation. We also demonstrate that navigation is improved when using both echolocation and vision.",

The somatosensory mechanisms that underlie this behavior are unclear. We report that Piezo2-dependent mechanosensation mediates wet dog shakes evoked by water or oil droplets applied to back hairy skin of mice. Unmyelinated C-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) were activated by oil droplets, and their optogenetic activation elicited wet dog shakes. Ablation of C-LTMRs attenuated this behavior. Moreover, C-LTMRs synaptically couple to spinoparabrachial neurons, and optogenetically inhibiting spinoparabrachial neuron synapses and excitatory neurons in the parabrachial nucleus impaired both oil droplet– and C-LTMR–evoked wet dog shakes. Thus, a C-LTMR–spinoparabrachial pathway promotes wet dog shakes for removal of water and mechanical irritants from back hairy skin.",

Here, we describe a switch from glutamine catabolism to synthesis required for erythroid cell maturation. Glutamine synthetase (GS), one of the oldest functioning genes in evolution, is activated during erythroid maturation to detoxify ammonium generated from heme biosynthesis, which is up-regulated to support hemoglobin production. Loss of GS in mouse erythroid precursors caused ammonium accumulation and oxidative stress, impairing erythroid maturation and recovery from anemia. In β-thalassemia, GS activity is inhibited by protein oxidation, leading to glutamate and ammonium accumulation, whereas enhancing GS activity alleviates the metabolic and pathological defects. Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved metabolic adaptation that could potentially be leveraged to treat common red blood cell disorders.",

In bacteria, the small ribosomal subunit (30 S ) is recruited to many mRNAs through base pairing with the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and RNA binding by ribosomal protein bS1. Translation can initiate on nascent mRNAs, and RNA polymerase (RNAP) can promote the recruitment of the pioneering 30 S . Here, we examined 30 S recruitment to nascent mRNAs using cryo–electron microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence colocalization, and in-cell cross-linking mass spectrometry. We show that bS1 delivers the mRNA to the ribosome for SD duplex formation and 30 S activation. Additionally, bS1 and RNAP stimulate translation initiation. Our work provides a mechanistic framework for how the SD duplex, ribosomal proteins, and RNAP cooperate in 30 S recruitment to mRNAs and establish transcription-translation coupling.",

This “perceptein” circuit combines weighted input summation through reversible binding interactions with self-activation and mutual inhibition through irreversible proteolytic cleavage. These interactions collectively generate a large repertoire of distinct protein species stemming from up to eight coexpressed starting protein species. The complete system achieves multi-output signal classification with tunable decision boundaries in mammalian cells and can be used to conditionally control cell death.

    "abstract": "Modern medicinal chemists are targeting more complex molecules to address challenging biological targets, which leads to synthesizing structures with higher sp 3 character (Fsp 3 ) to enhance specificity as well as physiochemical properties. Although traditional flat, high-fraction sp 2 molecules, such as pyridine, can be decorated through electrophilic aromatic substitution and palladium (Pd)–based cross-couplings, general strategies to derivatize three-dimensional (3D) saturated molecules are far less developed. In this work, we present an approach for the rapid, modular, enantiospecific, and diastereoselective functionalization of piperidine (saturated analog of pyridine), combining robust biocatalytic carbon-hydrogen oxidation with radical cross-coupling. This combination is directly analogous to electrophilic aromatic substitution followed by Pd-couplings for flat molecules, streamlining synthesis of 3D molecules. This study offers a generalizable strategy for accessing complex architectures, appealing to both medicinal and process chemists.",

BBR from nanostructured filaments with twisted geometry from nanocarbon or metal has strong ellipticity from 500 to 3000 nanometers. The submicrometer-scale chirality of these filaments satisfies the dimensionality requirements imposed by fluctuation-dissipation theorem and requires symmetry breaking in absorptivity and emissivity according to Kirchhoff’s law. The resulting BBR shows emission anisotropy and brightness exceeding those of conventional chiral photon emitters by factors of 10 to 100. The helical structure of these filaments enables precise spectral tuning of the chiral emission, which can be modeled using electromagnetic principles and chirality metrics. Encapsulating nanocarbon filaments in refractive ceramics produces highly efficient, adjustable, and durable chiral emitters capable of functioning at extreme temperatures previously considered unattainable.",

The magnitude of this cooling remains uncertain in part owing to the averaged representation of microphysical processes, such as the droplet-to-drizzle transition in global climate models (GCMs). Current GCMs parameterize cloud droplet size distributions as broad, cloud-averaged gammas. Using digital holographic measurements of discrete stratocumulus cloud volumes, we found cloud droplet size distributions to be narrower at the centimeter scale, never resembling the cloud average. These local distributions tended to form pockets of similar-looking cloud regions, each characterized by a size distribution shape that is diluted to varying degrees. These observations open the way for new modeling representations of microphysical processes.",

Although power is challenging to study with real-world data, a distinctive dataset allowed us to do so within the critical context of doctor-patient relationships. Using 1.5 million quasi-random assignments in US military emergency departments, we examined how power differentials between doctor and patient (measured by using differences in military ranks) affect physician behavior. Our findings indicate that power confers nontrivial advantages: “High-power” patients (who outrank their physician) receive more resources and have better outcomes than equivalently ranked “low-power” patients. Patient promotions even increase physician effort. Furthermore, low-power patients suffer if their physician concurrently cares for a high-power patient. Doctor-patient concordance on race and sex also matters. Overall, power-driven variation in behavior can harm the most vulnerable populations in health care settings.",

We created gene expression networks from hundreds of mouse tissue samples (both normal and tumor) and integrated these with lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-seq, to identify convergence of cell states in premalignant tumor cells expressing markers of lineage plasticity and drug resistance. Two of these cell states representing multilineage plasticity or proliferation were inversely correlated, suggesting a mutually exclusive relationship. Treatment of carcinomas in vivo with chemotherapy repressed the proliferative state and activated multilineage plasticity whereas inhibition of differentiation repressed plasticity and potentiated responses to cell cycle inhibitors. Manipulation of this cell state transition point may provide a source of potential combinatorial targets for cancer therapy.",

The prevailing view is that in the free troposphere, new particles are formed predominantly in convective cloud outflows. We present another mechanism using global observations. We find that during stratospheric air intrusion events, the mixing of descending ozone-rich stratospheric air with more moist free tropospheric background results in elevated hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations. Such mixing is most prevalent near the tropopause where the sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) mixing ratios are high. The combination of elevated SO 2 and OH levels leads to enhanced sulfuric acid concentrations, promoting particle formation. Such new particle formation occurs frequently and over large geographic regions, representing an important particle source in the midlatitude free troposphere.",

We observed the propagation speed of this electrical tree type to exceed 10 million meters per second. These results identify substantial gaps in the understanding of dielectric breakdown, and filling these gaps is paramount to the design and engineering of dielectric materials that are less susceptible to electrostatic discharge failure.",

In this interaction, the hosts must regulate nodule numbers and distribution patterns to control the degree of symbiosis and maintain root growth functions. The host response to symbiotic bacteria occurs discontinuously but repeatedly at the region behind the tip of the growing roots. Here, live-imaging and transcriptome analyses revealed oscillating host gene expression with approximately 6-hour intervals upon bacterial inoculation. Cytokinin response also exhibited a similar oscillation pattern. Cytokinin signaling is crucial to maintaining the periodicity, as observed in cytokinin receptor mutants displaying altered infection foci distribution. This periodic regulation influences the size of the root region responsive to bacteria, as well as the nodulation process progression.",

We found that a subset of HSCs displays macrophage-associated markers on their cell surface. Although fully functional, these HSCs are selectively niche-retained as opposed to stem cells lacking macrophage markers, which exit the BM upon forced mobilization. Macrophage markers on HSCs could be acquired through direct transfer by trogocytosis, regulated by receptor tyrosine-protein kinase C-Kit (CD117), from BM-resident macrophages in mouse and human settings. Our study provides proof of concept that adult stem cells utilize trogocytosis to rapidly establish and activate function-modulating molecular mechanisms.",

Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can elicit plant defenses, but whether such ecological functions persist after they form SOAs was previously unknown. Here we show that Scots pine seedlings damaged by large pine weevils feeding on their roots release HIPVs that trigger defenses in neighboring conspecific plants. The biological activity persisted after HIPVs had been oxidized to form SOAs, which was indicated by receivers displaying enhanced photosynthesis, primed volatile defenses, and reduced weevil damage. The elemental composition and quantity of SOAs likely determines their biological functions. This work demonstrates that plant-derived SOAs can mediate interactions between plants, highlighting their ecological significance in ecosystems.",

However, no evaluation of these bans exists. We compile a comprehensive waste dataset covering 36 US states between 1996 and 2019 to evaluate the first five implemented state-level bans. Contrary to policy-makers’ expectations, we can reject aggregate waste reductions higher than 3.2%, and we cannot reject a zero-null aggregate effect. Moreover, we cannot reject a zero-null effect for any other state except Massachusetts, which gradually achieved a 13.2% reduction.

Using mouse models of the TF Nr5a2 , we show that Nr5a2 −/− embryos arrest at the early morula stage and exhibit altered lineage specification, frequent mitotic failure, and substantial chromosome segregation defects. Although NR5A2 plays a minor but measurable role during zygotic genome activation, it predominantly acts as a master regulator at the eight-cell stage, controlling expression of lineage-specifying TFs and genes involved in mitosis, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair. We conclude that NR5A2 coordinates proliferation, genome stability, and lineage specification to ensure correct morula development.",

Hormone release is controlled through metabolite-sensing proteins. Low expression, interspecies differences, and the existence of multiple EEC subtypes have posed challenges to the study of these sensors. We describe differentiation of stomach EECs to complement existing intestinal organoid protocols. CD200 emerged as a pan-EEC surface marker, allowing deep transcriptomic profiling from primary human tissue along the stomach-intestinal tract. We generated loss-of-function mutations in 22 receptors and subjected organoids to ligand-induced secretion experiments. We delineate the role of individual human EEC sensors in the secretion of hormones, including GLP-1. These represent potential pharmacological targets to influence appetite, bowel movement, insulin sensitivity, and mucosal immunity.",

We relate insect and spider richness to biomass and PUFA-mass from stream and terrestrial communities encompassing nine land uses.

In terrestrial systems, human-dominated areas have lower biomass and PUFA-mass than more natural areas, even at equivalent levels of richness.

    "abstract": "Bright dipolar excitons, which contain electrical dipoles and have high oscillator strength, are an ideal platform for studying correlated quantum phenomena. They usually rely on carrier tunneling between two quantum wells or two layers to hybridize with nondipolar excitons to gain oscillator strength. In this work, we uncovered a new type of bright infrared dipolar exciton by stacking 90°-twisted black phosphorus (BP) structures. These excitons, inherent to the reconstructed band structure, exhibit high oscillator strength. Most importantly, they inherit the linear polarization from BP, which allows light polarization to be used to select the dipole direction. Moreover, the dipole moment and resonance energy can be widely tuned by the thickness of the BP. Our results demonstrate a useful platform for exploring tunable correlated dipolar excitons.",

    "abstract": "Parrots produce stunning plumage colors through unique pigments called psittacofulvins. However, the mechanism underlying their ability to generate a spectrum of vibrant yellows, reds, and greens remains enigmatic. We uncover a unifying chemical basis for a wide range of parrot plumage colors, which result from the selective deposition of red aldehyde- and yellow carboxyl-containing psittacofulvin molecules in developing feathers. Through genetic mapping, biochemical assays, and single-cell genomics, we identified a critical player in this process, the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2 , which oxidizes aldehyde psittacofulvins into carboxyl forms in late-differentiating keratinocytes during feather development. The simplicity of the underlying molecular mechanism, in which a single enzyme influences the balance of red and yellow pigments, offers an explanation for the exceptional evolutionary lability of parrot coloration.",

    "abstract": "Wood constitutes the largest reservoir of terrestrial biomass. Composed of xylem, it arises from one side of the vascular cambium, a bifacial stem cell niche that also produces phloem on the opposing side. It is currently unknown which molecular factors endow cambium stem cell identity. Here we show that TRACHEARY ELEMENT DIFFERENTIATION INHIBITORY FACTOR (TDIF) ligand–activated PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM (PXY) receptors promote the expression of CAMBIUM-EXPRESSED AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE (CAIL) transcription factors to define cambium stem cell identity in the Arabidopsis root. By sequestrating the phloem-originated TDIF, xylem-expressed PXY confines the TDIF signaling front, resulting in the activation of CAIL expression and stem cell identity in only a narrow domain. Our findings show how signals emanating from cells on opposing sides ensure robust yet dynamically adjustable positioning of a bifacial stem cell layer.",

In this study, we experimentally tested passive and active restoration strategies to recover taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of woody plants within 52 tree islands established in an oil palm landscape. Large tree islands and higher initial planted diversity catalyzed diversity recovery, particularly functional diversity at the landscape level. At the local scale, results demonstrated that greater initial planting diversity begets greater diversity of native recruits, overcoming limitations of natural recruitment in highly modified landscapes. Establishing large and diverse tree islands is crucial for safeguarding rare, endemic, and forest-associated species in oil palm landscapes.",

Current approaches, while successful, require laborious experimentation or large sample sizes. To elucidate shared determinants of antimalarial resistance that can empower in silico inference, we examined the genomes of 724 Plasmodium falciparum clones, each selected in vitro for resistance to one of 118 compounds. We identified 1448 variants in 128 recurrently mutated genes, including drivers of antimalarial multidrug resistance. In contrast to naturally occurring variants, those selected in vitro are more likely to be missense or frameshift, involve bulky substitutions, and occur in conserved, ordered protein domains. Collectively, our dataset reveals mutation features that predict drug resistance in eukaryotic pathogens.",

To develop new small-molecule approaches, we investigated the state of BCL11A protein in erythroid cells. We report that tetramer formation mediated by a single zinc finger (ZnF0) is required for production of steady-state protein. Beyond its role in protein stability, the tetramer state is necessary for γ-globin gene repression, because an engineered monomer fails to engage a critical co-repressor complex. These aspects of BCL11A protein production identify tetramer formation as a vulnerability for HbF silencing and provide opportunities for drug discovery.",

Recently created large-scale marine protected areas are potentially big enough to protect highly migratory species such as tuna, possibly leading to increases in abundance (a conservation benefit) and consequent spillover near protected area boundaries (an economic benefit). Using publicly available data from nine large-scale marine protected areas across the Pacific and Indian oceans, we find that catch-per-unit-effort in tuna purse seine fisheries has increased by an average of 12 to 18% near protected area boundaries, and this increase declines with distance from the boundaries. The increase is larger for bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ) than for skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus pelamis ), in line with fisheries science simulation models.",

Protein complex function can be modulated by RNA molecules that provide allosteric regulation or act as molecular guides or scaffolds. We hypothesized that RNA plays a role in organizing MAVS signaling platforms. We found that MAVS, through its central intrinsically disordered domain, directly interacted with the 3′ untranslated regions of cellular messenger RNAs. Elimination of RNA by ribonuclease treatment disrupted the MAVS signalosome, including RNA-modulated MAVS interactors that regulate RLR signaling and viral restriction, and inhibited phosphorylation of transcription factors that induce interferons. This work uncovered a function for cellular RNA in promoting signaling through MAVS and highlights generalizable principles of RNA regulatory control of immune signaling complexes.",

Observing quantum collective phenomena with macroscopic mechanical oscillators has been impeded by the stringent requirement that oscillators be identical. We demonstrate the quantum regime for collective motion of N = 6 mechanical oscillators, a hexamer, in a superconducting circuit optomechanical platform. By increasing the optomechanical couplings, the system transitions from individual to collective motion, characterized by a N enhancement of cavity-collective mode coupling, akin to superradiance of atomic ensembles. Using sideband cooling, we prepare the collective mode in the quantum ground state and measure its quantum sideband asymmetry, with zero-point motion distributed across distant oscillators. This regime of optomechanics opens avenues for studying multipartite entanglement, with potential advances in quantum metrology.",

In subsurface environments, methane often exhibits equilibrium isotopic signals, but the equilibration process has never been demonstrated in the laboratory. We cocultured a hydrogenotrophic methanogen with an H 2 -producing bacterium under conditions (55°C, 10 megapascals) simulating a methane-bearing subsurface. This resulted in near-complete reversibility of methanogenesis, leading to equilibria for both hydrogen and carbon isotopes. The methanogen not only equilibrated kinetic isotope signals of initially produced methane but also modified the isotope signals of amended thermogenic methane. These findings suggest that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis can overwrite the isotope signals of subsurface methane, distorting proxies for its origin and formation temperature—insights crucial for natural gas exploration.",

In this work, we examine how the nutrient stream changed over the Younger Dryas climate reversal that marked the transition out of the last ice age. Gulf Stream nutrient content decreased, and oxygen content increased at the Florida Straits during this time of weakened AMOC. The decreased nutrient stream was accompanied by a reduction in biological productivity at higher latitudes in the North Atlantic, which supports the link postulated in theoretical and modeling studies.",

The vegetation response to LIP-induced perturbations may affect the efficiency of the carbon-climate regulation system and the post-LIP climate evolution. Using an eco-evolutionary vegetation model, we demonstrate here that the vegetation’s climate adaptation capacity, through biological evolution and geographic dispersal, is a major determinant of the severity and longevity of LIP-induced hyperthermals and can promote the emergence of a new climatic steady state. Proxy-based temperature reconstructions of the Permian-Triassic, Triassic-Jurassic, and Paleocene-Eocene hyperthermals match the modeled trajectories of bioclimatic disturbance and recovery. We conclude that biological vegetation dynamics shape the multimillion-year Earth system response to sudden carbon degassing and global warming episodes.",

    "abstract": "Skin identity is controlled by intrinsic features of the epidermis and dermis and their interactions. Modifying skin identity has clinical potential, such as the conversion of residual limb and stump (nonvolar) skin of amputees to pressure-responsive palmoplantar (volar) skin to enhance prosthesis use and minimize skin breakdown. Greater keratin 9 ( KRT9 ) expression, higher epidermal thickness, keratinocyte cytoplasmic size, collagen length, and elastin are markers of volar skin and likely contribute to volar skin resiliency. Given fibroblasts’ capacity to modify keratinocyte differentiation, we hypothesized that volar fibroblasts influence these features. Bioprinted skin constructs confirmed the capacity of volar fibroblasts to induce volar keratinocyte features. A clinical trial of healthy volunteers demonstrated that injecting volar fibroblasts into nonvolar skin increased volar features that lasted up to 5 months, highlighting a potential cellular therapy.",

Tumor chromatin accessibility is strongly influenced by copy number alterations that can be used to identify subclones, yet underlying cis-regulatory landscapes retain cancer type–specific features. Using organ-matched healthy tissues, we identified the “nearest healthy” cell types in diverse cancers, demonstrating that the chromatin signature of basal-like–subtype breast cancer is most similar to secretory-type luminal epithelial cells. Neural network models trained to learn regulatory programs in cancer revealed enrichment of model-prioritized somatic noncoding mutations near cancer-associated genes, suggesting that dispersed, nonrecurrent, noncoding mutations in cancer are functional. Overall, these data and interpretable gene regulatory models for cancer and healthy tissue provide a framework for understanding cancer-specific gene regulation.",

Despite this, our understanding of the processes that control lipid degradation is limited. We combined nanolipidomics and imaging to study the bacterial degradation of diverse algal lipid droplets and found that bacteria isolated from marine particles exhibited distinct dietary preferences, ranging from selective to promiscuous degraders. Dietary preference was associated with a distinct set of lipid degradation genes rather than with taxonomic origin. Using synthetic communities composed of isolates with distinct dietary preferences, we showed that lipid degradation is modulated by microbial interactions. A particle export model incorporating these dynamics indicates that metabolic specialization and community dynamics may influence lipid transport efficiency in the ocean’s mesopelagic zone.",

An estimated area ranging from ~17 million acres (19%) to nearly all 90 million acres of nontidal wetlands in the conterminous United States could be without federal protections, and variability in state protections creates hotspots of risk.

We forecasted the acoustic structure of songs for a set of possible evolutionary futures (successive droughts spurring increasingly large beaks) and, in a field assay, presented resulting song simulations to territorial males. We found that responses to songs dropped off after six simulated drought events, to degrees roughly comparable to drops in response to songs that diverged through cultural drift and acoustic adaptation. Our results support, in Darwin’s finches, the feasibility and mechanistic bases of an ecological speciation hypothesis.",

Across countries ( N = 6150) and diverse subgroups within countries, people similarly emphasized free and fair elections and civil liberties as being the key determinants of democracy.

We performed multielectrode recording in macaque visual and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while animals performed a visual discrimination task before and after non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Although sleep induces synchronized fluctuations in population activity across cortical areas, the post-sleep population activity became more desynchronized relative to the pre-sleep state. The changes after sleep were correlated with an increase in information encoded in population activity in each area and improved behavioral performance. Electrically stimulating visual cortex at 4 hertz emulated the beneficial effects of sleep on network and perceptual performance. A large-scale neural network model indicated that asymmetric depression of local intracortical synapses is consistent with the observed changes in neural activity after sleep.",

The hippocampus is hypothesized to bind together otherwise abstract combinations of stimuli to represent such latent contexts, to support the process of hidden state inference. Yet evidence for a role of the hippocampus in hidden state inference remains limited. We found that the ventral hippocampus is required for mice to perform hidden state inference during a two-armed bandit task. Hippocampal neurons differentiate the two abstract contexts required for this strategy in a manner similar to the differentiation of spatial locations, and their activity is essential for appropriate dopamine dynamics. These findings offer insight into how latent contextual information is used to optimize decisions, and they emphasize a key role for the hippocampus in hidden state inference.",

We developed and deployed a chemically induced proximity system to identify key elements of this quality control pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans . Persistence of the polo-like kinase PLK-2 at pairing centers—specialized chromosome regions that interact with the nuclear envelope—induced apoptosis of oocytes in response to phosphorylation and destabilization of the nuclear lamina.

In this work, we investigated a host-parasitoid system in which pea aphid hosts rapidly evolve resistance to Aphidius ervi parasitoids. Field data and mathematical simulations showed that heterogeneity in parasitoid dispersal can generate variation in parasitism-mediated selection on hosts through time and space. Experiments showed how evolutionary trade-offs plus moderate host dispersal across this selection mosaic cause host-parasitoid coexistence and maintenance of genetic variation in host resistance. Our results show how dispersal can stabilize both the ecological and evolutionary components of eco-evolutionary dynamics.",

Selection favored alleles originating from climates similar to that of Davis and targeted loci contributing to reproductive development, including the barley diversification loci Vrs1 , HvCEN , Ppd-H1 , and Vrn-H2 .

Narrow linewidths allowed low-field magnetic circular dichroism at room temperature, used to sense Earth-scale magnetic fields.

After considering all the known ordering tendencies in tandem with the phase diagram, we hypothesize that the normal-state gap in the underdoped n-type cuprates originates from Cooper pairing.

    "abstract": "Macroscopic properties of materials stem from fundamental atomic-scale details, yet for insulators, resolving surface structures remains a challenge. We imaged the basal (0001) plane of α–aluminum oxide (α-Al 2 O 3 ) using noncontact atomic force microscopy with an atomically defined tip apex. The surface formed a complex ( 31 × 31 ) R ±9° reconstruction. The lateral positions of the individual oxygen and aluminum surface atoms come directly from experiment; we determined with computational modeling how these connect to the underlying crystal bulk. Before the restructuring, the surface Al atoms assume an unfavorable, threefold planar coordination; the reconstruction allows a rehybridization with subsurface O that leads to a substantial energy gain. The reconstructed surface remains stoichiometric, Al 2 O 3 .",

    "abstract": "Faithful chromosome segregation requires biorientation, where the pair of kinetochores on the chromosome establish bipolar microtubule attachment. The integrity of the kinetochore, a macromolecular complex built on centromeric DNA, is required for biorientation, but components sufficient for biorientation remain unknown. Here, we show that tethering the outer kinetochore heterodimer NDC80-NUF2 to the surface of apolar microbeads establishes their biorientation-like state in mouse cells. NDC80-NUF2 microbeads align at the spindle equator and self-correct alignment errors. The alignment is associated with stable bipolar microtubule attachment and is independent of the outer kinetochore proteins SPC24-SPC25, KNL1, the Mis12 complex, inner kinetochore proteins, and Aurora. Larger microbeads align more rapidly, suggesting a size-dependent biorientation mechanism. This study demonstrates a biohybrid kinetochore design for synthetic biorientation of microscale particles in cells.",

In this work, we show that the Ser 23/24 -encoding exon 3 of TNNI3 was pseudoexonized multiple times in shrews and moles to mimic Ser 23/24 phosphorylation without adrenergic stimulation, facilitating the evolution of exceptionally high resting heart rates (~1000 beats per minute). We further reveal alternative exon 3 splicing in distantly related bat families and confirm that both cTnI splice variants are incorporated into cardiac myofibrils. Because exon 3 of human TNNI3 exhibits a relatively low splice strength score, our findings offer an evolutionarily informed strategy to excise this exon to improve diastolic function during heart failure.",

We determined the magnetic field distribution with altitude in the corona and monitored the evolution at different latitudes over multiple solar rotations. The field strength between 1.05 and 1.60 solar radii varies from <1 to ~20 gauss. A signature of active longitudes appears in the coronal magnetic field measurements.

Contrary to the prevailing view of N-glycosylation as a housekeeping function, we identified an ER pathway that modulates the activity of OST-A. Genetic analyses linked OST-A to HSP90B1, an ER chaperone for membrane receptors, and CCDC134, an ER luminal protein. During its translocation into the ER, an N-terminal peptide in HSP90B1 templates the assembly of a translocon complex containing CCDC134 and OST-A that protects HSP90B1 during folding, preventing its hyperglycosylation and degradation. Disruption of this pathway impairs WNT and IGF1R signaling and causes the bone developmental disorder osteogenesis imperfecta. Thus, N-glycosylation can be regulated by specificity factors in the ER to control cell surface receptor signaling and tissue development.",

How substrates are released from SRP at the ER to subsequently access translocation factors is not well understood. We found that TMEM208 can engage the substrate binding domain of SRP to accelerate release of its bound cargo. Without TMEM208, slow cargo release resulted in excessive synthesis of downstream polypeptide before engaging translocation factors. Delayed access to translocation machinery caused progressive loss of insertion competence, particularly for multipass membrane proteins, resulting in their impaired biogenesis. Thus, TMEM208 facilitates prompt cargo handover from the targeting to translocation machinery to minimize biogenesis errors and maintain protein homeostasis.",

We report monthly resolved records of coral skeleton–bound nitrogen isotopes (CS-δ 15 N) to reconstruct denitrification in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) ODZ over the last 80 years. The data indicate strong decadal variation in ETNP denitrification, with maxima during the cool North Pacific phase of Pacific Decadal Variability. The maxima in denitrification (and thus oxygen deficiency) were likely due to stronger upwelling that enhanced productivity leading to greater oxygen demand in the thermocline. Prior findings of multidecadal-to-centennial ODZ trends were likely biased by this variability. ODZ evolution over the next century will depend on how global warming interacts with the decadal oscillations.",

The decision to hatch is often carefully timed to coincide with favorable conditions that will improve survival through early life stages. However, how the relevant cues are relayed to trigger hatching remains unknown. In this work, we show that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Trh) is the neuroendocrine activator of hatching in zebrafish. To elicit hatching, Trh neurons form a transient circuit that deposits the peptide into the embryo’s circulation. Trh also activates hatching in a distantly related fish species that separated more than 200 million years ago. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved neuroendocrine circuit that controls a major life event in oviparous fish species.",

We assembled and passaged dozens of diverse phage communities on a single, nonevolving strain of Escherichia coli until the phage communities reached equilibrium. In all cases, we found that two or more phage species coexisted stably, despite competition for a single, clonal host population. Phage coexistence was supported through host phenotypic heterogeneity, whereby bacterial cells adopting different growth phenotypes served as niches for different phage species. Our experiments reveal that a rich community ecology of bacteriophages can emerge on a single bacterial host.",

It is unknown whether the Sun can generate superflares and, if so, how often they might occur. We used photometry from the Kepler space observatory to investigate superflares on other stars with Sun-like fundamental parameters. We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56,450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies >10 34 erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability. The resulting stellar superflare frequency-energy distribution is consistent with an extrapolation of the Sun’s flare distribution to higher energies, so we suggest that both are generated by the same physical mechanism.",

Recent studies have shown that a diverse collection of B cells, producing antibodies with a wide spectrum of different affinities, is selected into the plasma cell (PC) pathway. How affinity-permissive selection enables PC affinity maturation remains unknown. We found that PC precursors (prePCs) expressing high-affinity antibodies received higher levels of T follicular helper cell (T FH cell)–derived help and divided at higher rates compared with their lower-affinity counterparts once they left the germinal center. Our findings indicate that differential cell division by selected prePCs accounts for how diverse precursors develop into a PC compartment that mediates serological affinity maturation.",

We realized periodic vortices in hydrodynamic metamaterials and created a bilayer moiré superlattice by stacking and twisting two such vortex fluids. We observed energy delocalization and localization when the twist angles, respectively, result in the Pythagorean and non-Pythagorean triples in the fluidic moiré superlattice. Anomalous localization was found even in commensurate moiré fluids with large lattice constants that satisfy Pythagorean triples. Our work reports the moiré phenomena in fluids and opens an unexpected door to controlling the energy transfer, mass transport, and particle navigation through the elaborate dynamics of vortices in fluidic moiré superlattices.",

In this work, we used triggered anyon pulses incident on a QPC in a filling factor ν = 1/3 FQH fluid to investigate anyon tunneling in the time domain. We observed that braiding increases the tunneling timescale, which is set by the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension that characterizes the edge-state dynamics.

Determining causation has been obstructed by a poor understanding of their ecology. Using dental microwear texture analysis, we show that most members of Australia’s richest Pleistocene kangaroo assemblage had diets that were much more generalized than their craniodental anatomy implies. Mixed feeding across most kangaroos pinpoints dietary breadth as a key behavioral adaptation to climate-driven fluctuations in vegetation structure, dispelling the likelihood that late Pleistocene climatic variation was a primary driver of their disappearance.",

    "abstract": "The requirement for C 2 H 2 concentrations below 2 parts per million (ppm) in gas streams for C 2 H 4 polymerization necessitates its semihydrogenation to C 2 H 4 . We demonstrate selective chemical looping combustion of C 2 H 2 in C 2 H 4 -rich streams by Bi 2 O 3 as an alternative catalytic pathway to reduce C 2 H 2 concentration below 2 ppm. Bi 2 O 3 combusts C 2 H 2 with a first-order rate constant that is 3000 times greater than the rate constant for C 2 H 4 combustion. In successive redox cycles, the lattice O of Bi 2 O 3 can be fully replenished without discernible changes in local Bi coordination or C 2 H 2 combustion selectivity. Heterolytic activation of C–H bonds across Bi–O sites and the higher acidity of C 2 H 2 results in lower barriers for C 2 H 2 activation than C 2 H 4 , enabling selective catalytic hydrocarbon combustion leveraging differences in molecular deprotonation energies.",

    "abstract": "Although the dynamics of collisions between a molecule and a solid surface are ultimately quantum mechanical, decohering effects owing to the large number of interacting degrees of freedom typically obscure the wavelike nature of these events. However, a partial decoupling of internal molecular motion from external degrees of freedom can reveal striking interference effects despite significant momentum exchange between the molecule and the bath of surface vibrations. We report state-prepared and state-resolved measurements of methane scattering from a room-temperature gold surface that demonstrate total destructive interference between molecular states related by a reflection symmetry operation. High-contrast interference effects prevail for all processes investigated, including vibrationally excited and vibrationally inelastic collisions. The results demonstrate the distinctly quantum mechanical effect of discrete symmetries in molecular collision dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a heritable disease, but its genetic basis is incompletely understood. Canine population history facilitates trait mapping. We performed a canine genome-wide association study for body condition score—a measure of obesity—in 241 Labrador retrievers. Using a cross-species approach, we showed that canine obesity genes are also associated with rare and common forms of obesity in humans. The lead canine association was within the gene DENN domain containing 1B ( DENND1B ). Each copy of the alternate allele was associated with ~7% greater body fat. We demonstrate a role for this gene in regulating signaling and trafficking of melanocortin 4 receptor, a critical controller of energy homeostasis. Thus, canine genetics identified obesity genes and mechanisms relevant to both dogs and humans.",

We identified several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria and Streptomyces . Although these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, substantially influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.",

We developed a highly efficient strategy, Perturb-multiome, to simultaneously profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single cells with CRISPR-mediated perturbation of master transcription factors (TFs). We examined the connection between TFs, accessible regions, and gene expression across the genome throughout hematopoietic differentiation. We discovered that variants within TF-sensitive accessible chromatin regions in erythroid differentiation, although representing <0.3% of the genome, show a ~100-fold enrichment for blood cell phenotype heritability, which is substantially higher than that for other accessible chromatin regions. Our approach facilitates large-scale mechanistic understanding of phenotype-associated genetic variants by connecting key cis-regulatory elements and their target genes within gene regulatory networks.",

Incomplete penetrance of GBA1 variants suggests that additional genes contribute to PD and DLB manifestation. By using a pooled genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified copper metabolism MURR1 domain–containing 3 (COMMD3) protein, a component of the COMMD/coiled-coil domain–containing protein 22 (CCDC22)/CCDC93 (CCC) and Commander complexes, as a modifier of GCase and lysosomal activity. Loss of COMMD3 increased the release of lysosomal proteins through extracellular vesicles, leading to their impaired delivery to endolysosomes and consequent lysosomal dysfunction. Rare variants in the Commander gene family were associated with increased PD risk. Thus, COMMD genes and related complexes regulate lysosomal homeostasis and may represent modifiers in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with lysosomal dysfunction.",

We found that Cat1 provides immunity by cleaving and depleting oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) molecules from the infected host, inducing a growth arrest that prevents viral propagation. Cat1 forms dimers that stack upon each other to generate long filaments that are maintained by bound cOA ligands, with stacked TIR domains forming the NAD + cleavage catalytic sites. Furthermore, Cat1 filaments assemble into distinct trigonal and pentagonal networks that enhance NAD + degradation. Cat1 presents an unprecedented chemistry and higher-order protein assembly for the CRISPR-Cas response.",

This Hawaiian lineage also boasts an unprecedented and macabre practice of decorating its portable larval home with the body parts of the spider prey it harvests from the web where it resides. Phylogenomic data suggest that the origin of this unique spider cohabitant is at least six million years old, more than one million years older than Hawaii’s current high islands. After decades of searching, only one species has been discovered, and it is restricted to 15 square kilometers of a single mountain range on the island of Oʻahu, meaning that other members of the lineage have disappeared from older islands. Conservation action to save this globally unique lineage is imperative and overdue.",

The biophysical properties that these polymeric scaffolds require for signal transduction are not clearly defined. Here, we engineered single-component DF signalosomes. We found that functionality depends on the stability provided by the DF polymer, which could also be achieved with a bacterial DF domain, a synthetic filament-forming domain, and amyloid-like sequences. This demonstrates the importance of polymer stability and inducibility irrespective of the motif’s origin. By varying the number of included TRAF6 interaction motifs, we demonstrate that avidity is a tunable property that can control the amplitude of signaling outputs. This work lays out a reductionist framework to elucidate the required signaling properties through polymeric scaffolds by adjusting their assembly kinetics, stability, and avidity.",

Using a carcinogen-induced model of LUSC with no added genetic hits or cell type bias, we found that carcinogen exposure leads to non-neutral competition among basal cells, aberrant clonal expansions, and basal cell mobilization along the airways. Ultimately, preinvasive lesions developed from a few highly mutated clones that dominate most of the bronchial tree. Multisite sequencing in human patients confirmed the presence of clonally related preinvasive lesions across distinct airway regions. Our work identifies a transition in basal cell clonal dynamics, and an associated shift in basal cell fate, as drivers of field cancerization in the lung.",

By measuring shot noise resulting from the collisions, we unveil fundamental characteristics of colliding electrons, highlighting the complementarity between the indistinguishable and distinguishable parts of their wave functions.

    "abstract": "De novo design of protein catalysts with high efficiency and stereoselectivity provides an attractive approach toward the design of environmentally benign catalysts. Here, we design proteins that incorporate histidine-ligated synthetic porphyrin and heme ligands. Four of 10 designed proteins catalyzed cyclopropanation with an enantiomeric ratio greater than 99:1. A second class of proteins were designed to catalyze a silicon-hydrogen insertion and were optimized by directed evolution in whole cells. The evolved proteins incorporated features unlikely to be generated by computational design alone, including a proline in an α helix. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that as the proteins evolved toward higher activity, their conformational ensembles narrowed to favor more productive conformations. Our work demonstrates that efficient de novo protein catalysts are designable and should be useful for manifold chemical processes.",

    "abstract": "We present results from a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh that introduced operational practices to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions in 276 “zigzag” brick kilns. Of all intervention kilns, 65% adopted the improved practices. Treatment assignment reduced energy use by 10.5% ( P -value <0.001) and decreased CO 2 and PM 2.5 emissions by 171 and 0.45 metric tons, respectively, per kiln per year. Valuing the CO 2 reductions using a social cost of carbon of 185 USD per metric ton, we find that the social benefits outweigh costs by a factor of 65 to 1. The intervention, which required no new capital investment, also decreased fuel costs and increased brick quality. Our results demonstrate the potential for privately profitable, as well as publicly beneficial, improvements to address environmental problems in informal industries.",

However, despite their importance, the conservation of grassy ecosystems—compared with that of forests—has been neglected around the world, leading to a greater loss rate than forest ecosystems in many regions . Here, we examine this bias in public conservation discourse and policies that give priority to forests and neglect the conservation of grassy ecosystems worldwide. We argue that grassy ecosystems need stronger legal safeguards and global recognition to match forest conservation efforts.",

In this work, we apply Indigenous and Western scientific methods, including genomics and isotope profiling, on fossils from across Beringia to explore the effect of climate change on horses. We find that Late Pleistocene horses from Alaska and northern Yukon are related to populations from Eurasia and crossed the Bering land bridge multiple times during the last glacial interval. We also find deeply divergent lineages north and south of the American ice sheets that genetically influenced populations across Beringia and into Eurasia. As climate warmed and horses entered the ice-free corridor connecting Beringia and midcontinental America, restricted mobility and food availability impeded population growth. Our combined Western and Indigenous framework offers critical guidance for wildlife conservation amid ongoing climate change.",

Our analysis demonstrates that West Siberian ancestry, represented by the Kets and Nenets, contributed to the genetic ancestry of most Siberian populations. West Beringians, including the Koryaks, Inuit, and Luoravetlans, exhibit genetic adaptation to Arctic climate, including medically relevant variants. In South America, early migrants split into four groups—Amazonians, Andeans, Chaco Amerindians, and Patagonians—~13,900 years ago. Their longest migration led to population decline, whereas settlement in South America’s diverse environments caused instant spatial isolation, reducing genetic and immunogenic diversity. These findings highlight how population history and environmental pressures shaped the genetic architecture of human populations across North Asia and South America.",

Type 2 cytokines amplified NMU and CGRPβ expression in PSNs both in vitro and in vivo, and this was abrogated by PSN-specific Il13ra1 deletion. Deletion of Il13ra1 in PSNs impaired host defense to the gastrointestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus and blunted muscularis immune responses. Co-administration of NMU23 and CGRPβ rescued helminth clearance deficits and restored anti-helminth immunity, highlighting the essential bidirectional neuroimmune cross-talk regulating intestinal type 2 inflammation.",

Several of these giants have vanished within the past 130,000 years, but the timing and macroevolutionary drivers behind this pattern of rise and collapse remain unclear for some megaherbivore lineages. Using trait modeling that combines total-evidence evolutionary trees and a comprehensive size dataset, we show that sloth body mass evolved with major lifestyle shifts and that most terrestrial lineages reached their largest sizes through slower evolutionary rates compared with extant arboreal forms. Size disparity increased during the late Cenozoic climatic cooling, but paleoclimatic changes do not explain the rapid extinction of ground sloths that started approximately 15,000 years ago. Their abrupt demise suggests human-driven factors in the decline and extinction of ground sloths.",

This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrated. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we performed mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection through local shelving into motional superposition states. We lastly entangled the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generated hyperentanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.",

However, early mammalian embryos lack efficient spindle assembly mechanisms, and it remains unclear how error-free chromosome segregation is achieved. In this work, we imaged early mouse embryos and identified a network of nuclear actin cables that organize prophase chromosomes at the nuclear periphery. Following nuclear envelope breakdown, the network contracts and gathers chromosomes toward the cell center. Network contraction was driven by filament disassembly in a myosin II–independent manner. Additionally, we identified a network of branched actin filaments that attenuates metaphase spindle elongation. We also visualized nuclear actin in human embryos, suggesting a conserved role for actin in ensuring mitotic fidelity during early mammalian development.",

However, plants acclimate their respiratory response to temperature on longer timescales, potentially weakening the carbon-climate feedback. The magnitude of this acclimation is uncertain despite its importance for predicting future climate change. We develop an optimality-based theory dynamically linking stem respiration with leaf water supply to predict its thermal acclimation. We show that the theory accurately reproduces observations of spatial and seasonal change. We estimate the global value for current annual stem CO 2 efflux as 27.4 ± 5.9 PgC. By 2100, incorporating thermal acclimation reduces projected stem respiration without considering acclimation by 24 to 46%, thus reducing land ecosystem carbon emissions.",

Moreover, they exhibit notable mechanical properties, with an excellent modulus of resilience reaching 40 megajoules per cubic meter. High-pressure experiments reveal an intriguing transformation of the 1D-HEO nanoribbons from orthorhombic to cubic structures at 15 gigapascals followed by the formation of fully amorphous HEOs above 30 gigapascals, which are recoverable to ambient conditions. These transformations introduce additional entropy (structural disorder) besides configurational entropy. This finding offers a way to create low-dimensional, resilient, and high-entropy materials.",

Using ~700 accessions across Asia, we show that the initial domestication happened three to five thousand years ago in central Japan during the Jomon period, followed by a range expansion into China and secondary hybridization with Chinese wild populations. We mapped, validated, and dated key genes associated with seed coat color evolution ( VaPAP1 for loss of mottled black and VaANR1 for gain of red colors). The frequency increases of variants affecting key domestication syndrome substantially predated the wild-cultigen divergence. Together, our results resolve the conflict between genetic and archaeological evidence about adzuki origins and reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of archaeobotanically unobservable traits, consistent with a role of early weak selection during domestication.",

BRAF regulation, involving monomeric autoinhibition and activation by dimerization, has been intensely scrutinized, but mechanisms enabling oncogenic mutants to evade regulation remain unclear. By using cryo–electron microscopy, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, including the common V600E variant. These mutations disrupted wild-type BRAF's autoinhibited state, mediated by interactions between the cysteine-rich domain and kinase domain, thereby shifting the kinase domain into a preactivated conformation. This structural change likely results from helix αC displacement. PLX8394, a BRAF inhibitor that stabilizes helix αC in an inactive conformation, restored the autoinhibited conformation of oncogenic BRAF, explaining the properties of this class of compounds.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic moments of bound-electron systems are a sensitive tool for testing fundamental interactions. The g factors of lithium-like ions have been rigorously studied in recent years, enabling insights into the relativistic interelectronic effects. In this work, we present the g -factor measurement of lithium-like tin, accurate to 0.5 parts per billion, as well as ab initio theoretical calculations that include an advanced treatment of the interelectronic interaction. We further improved the prediction by using the experimental result for the hydrogen-like tin g factor, inferring from it the unknown higher-order quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects. The observed agreement independently confirms the revised theory at a previously inaccessible high atomic number Z of 50, where QED effects are considerably larger.",

    "abstract": "Diapause is a common seasonal adaptive strategy that regulates annual timing in insects. Very few causal loci underlying diapause variation have yet been identified. By leveraging cross-mapping and genome-wide association analysis, we identified the N terminus of the clock protein CYCLE as a major causal effector underlying embryonic diapause differences in the silk moth. We found that the nondiapause phenotype in polyvoltine strains results from a specific deletion that disrupts an alternative isoform of CYCLE. We further demonstrated that different CYCLE isoforms contribute to a functional diversity in modulating circadian rhythms and diapause, which has been preserved in Lepidoptera for at least 110 million years. Our study proposes a model that explains how adaptive phenotypes can evolve rapidly without affecting related essential functions.",

    "abstract": "Polar ecosystems are structured and enriched by birds, which nest there seasonally and serve as keystone ecosystem members. Despite the ecological importance of polar birds, the origins of high-latitude nesting strategies remain obscured by a sparse fossil record. We report an extreme-latitude Arctic avialan assemblage from the Prince Creek Formation of Alaska—the northernmost Late Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystem. Numerous three-dimensionally preserved fossils constitute one of the most taxonomically rich Late Cretaceous avialan assemblages, including members of Hesperornithes, Ichthyornithes, and near-crown or crown birds (Neornithes), recording a previously undocumented interval in avialan evolution. Abundant perinatal fossils represent the oldest evidence of birds nesting at polar latitudes, which demonstrates that birds began using seasonal polar environments for breeding during the Cretaceous, long before their modern descendants.",

We addressed this issue by isolating defective octahedra at the perovskite surface using a vapor-deposited polydentate ligand. Surface octahedra isolation suppresses ion migration into the charge transport layer and reduces surface ionic defects, modulating the kinetics of ion migration during light-dark cycles. Our 785-square-centimeter industrial-scale perovskite solar modules achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.6%. Our modules demonstrated enhanced diurnal stability, retaining more than 97% of their initial PCE even after 101 light-dark cycles at 50°C. Our perovskite modules maintained stable power output during 45 days of outdoor operation under severe summer conditions, exhibiting stability comparable with that of the reference silicon cell.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) involves the recognition of preexisting modifications by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which recruits the methyltransferase suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1) to methylate the adjacent newly incorporated histones, establishing a positive feedback loop. However, how this positive feedback is restricted to maintain H3K9me3 homeostasis remains largely unknown. We performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5 ASB7 E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3. ASB7 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 and promotes SUV39H1 degradation. During mitosis, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylates ASB7, preventing its interaction with SUV39H1, leading to SUV39H1 stabilization and H3K9me3 restoration. Our findings reveal a dynamic circuit involving HP1, SUV39H1, and ASB7 that governs H3K9me3 homeostasis, ensuring faithful epigenetic inheritance and preventing excessive heterochromatin formation.",

Here, we describe PromoterAI, a deep neural network that accurately identifies non-coding promoter variants which dysregulate gene expression. We show that promoter variants with predicted expression-altering consequences produce outlier expression at both RNA and protein levels in thousands of individuals, and that these variants experience strong negative selection in human populations. We observe that clinically relevant genes in rare disease patients are enriched for such variants and validate their functional impact through reporter assays. Our estimates suggest that promoter variation accounts for 6% of the genetic burden associated with rare diseases.",

Here, we describe expansion in situ genome sequencing (ExIGS), a technology that enables sequencing of genomic DNA and super-resolution localization of nuclear proteins in single cells. Applying ExIGS to progeria-derived fibroblasts revealed that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant chromatin regulation that may erode cell identity. Lamin was found to generally repress transcription, suggesting that variation in nuclear morphology may affect gene regulation across tissues and aged cells. These results demonstrate that ExIGS may serve as a generalizable platform with which to link nuclear abnormalities to gene regulation, offering insights into disease mechanisms.",

To effectively manage carbon and nitrogen in China, we developed a comprehensive model for quantifying their fluxes, investigating their interplay across 16 human and natural subsystems. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrogen losses in China increased 2.3-fold and carbon emissions surged 6.5-fold. Integrated carbon and nitrogen management holds the potential for a 74% reduction in nitrogen losses to air and water and a 91% decrease in carbon emissions to the atmosphere by 2060. Compared with separate control of carbon or nitrogen, integrated management delivers an additional reduction of 1.8 million tons of nitrogen and 26.5 million tons of carbon by 2060, bringing out a 37% decrease in unit abatement cost and a net societal benefit of 1384 billion USD.",

Recent LIDAR (light detection and ranging) and excavation data have uncovered densely clustered ancient agricultural raised garden bed ridges covering an expanse far greater than previously realized. These raised agricultural fields are deeply enmeshed in the broader cultural landscape, as ceremonial and other features were also found. Our results demonstrate a rich anthropogenic landscape created by small-scale ancestral Menominee communities, located near the northern limits of maize agriculture. The excellent preservation of this site is exceptional in eastern North America and suggests that the precolonial landscape was more anthropogenically influenced than currently recognized.",

We assembled a multi-taxa tracking dataset (11 million geopositions from 15,845 tracked individuals across 121 species) to provide a global assessment of space use of highly mobile marine megafauna, showing that 63% of the area that they cover is used 80% of the time as important migratory corridors or residence areas. The GBF 30% threshold (Target 3) will be insufficient for marine megafauna’s effective conservation, leaving important areas exposed to major anthropogenic threats. Coupling area protection with mitigation strategies (e.g., fishing regulation, wildlife-traffic separation) will be essential to reach international goals and conserve biodiversity.",

However, thriving populations of aerobic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in AMZs challenge this assumption and remain unexplained. Using theory and modeling, we show how periodic oxygen intrusions sustain aerobic NOB in AMZs alongside more competitive aerobic heterotrophs. Ecological theory, supported by numerical simulations and genomics, frames NOB as opportunists exploiting a fleeting supply of oxygen. Consistent with in situ observations, simulated NOB contribute substantially to total oxygen consumption at AMZ boundaries, which implies that NOB may provide a major stabilizing feedback to AMZs. Fine-scale ocean currents increase the metabolic diversity in AMZs, which could stabilize AMZ volume under climate change.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) plays a crucial role in a variety of brain functions through intricate interactions with other neuromodulators and intracellular signaling pathways. However, studying these complex networks has been hindered by the challenge of detecting multiple neurochemicals in vivo simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we developed a single-protein chemigenetic DA sensor, HaloDA1.0, which combines a cpHaloTag–chemical dye approach with the G protein–coupled receptor activation–based (GRAB) strategy, providing high sensitivity for DA, subsecond response kinetics, and a far-red to near-infrared spectral range. When used together with existing green and red fluorescent neuromodulator sensors, calcium indicators, cyclic adenosine 5′-monophosphate sensors, and optogenetic tools, HaloDA1.0 showed high versatility for multiplex imaging in cultured neurons, brain slices, and behaving animals, facilitating in-depth studies of dynamic neurochemical networks.",

Most models of the corona extrapolate its magnetic field from that measured on the photosphere (the Sun’s optical surface) over a full 27-day solar rotational period, providing a time-stationary approximation. We present a model of the corona that evolves continuously in time, by assimilating photospheric magnetic field observations as they become available. This approach reproduces dynamical features that do not appear in time-stationary models. We used the model to predict coronal structure during the total solar eclipse of 8 April 2024 near the maximum of the solar activity cycle. There is better agreement between the model predictions and eclipse observations in coronal regions located above recently assimilated photospheric data.",

    "abstract": "Retrons are antiphage defense systems that produce multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) and hold promises for genome engineering. However, the mechanisms of defense remain unclear. The Retron-Septu system uniquely integrates retron and Septu antiphage defenses. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal asymmetric nucleoprotein complexes comprising a reverse transcriptase (RT), msDNA (a hybrid of msdDNA and msrRNA), and two PtuAB copies. msdDNA and msrRNA are essential for assembling this complex, with msrRNA adopting a conserved lariat-like structure that regulates reverse transcription. Notably, the assembled Retron-Septu complex is inactive, with msdDNA occupying the PtuA DNA-binding site. Activation occurs upon disassembly, releasing PtuAB, which degrades single-stranded DNA to restrict phage replication. This “arrest-and-release” mechanism underscores the dynamic regulatory roles of msDNA, advancing our understanding of antiphage defense strategies.",

Currently, the sulfur analogs are almost exclusively prepared by de novo synthesis; the existing approach to swap carbon with sulfur is inefficient and involves stoichiometric mercury reagents. In this study, we report a two-step carbonyl-to-sulfur (CO-to-S) atom swap approach, enabled by a rationally designed N ′-alkyl-hydrazonamide (NAHA) reagent that promotes forming pre-aromatic intermediates twice sequentially by different mechanisms, thereby achieving homolytic cleavage of both α-C−C bonds of the ketone substrates. A Ts−S−Ts (Ts, p -toluenesulfonyl) reagent mediates this process through successive intermolecular and intramolecular alkyl radical trapping by the central sulfur. This method shows a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity, providing a streamlined route to sulfur-containing scaffolds from readily available ketones.",

We dissected this sequence-catalysis landscape’s topology, navigability, and mechanistic underpinnings, revealing catalytically heterogeneous neighborhoods organized by domain architecture. These results challenge long-standing hypotheses in enzyme adaptation, demonstrating that thermophilic enzymes are not universally slower than their mesophilic counterparts. Semisupervised models that combine our data with the rich sequence representations from large protein language models predict orthologous ADK-sequence catalytic parameters better than existing approaches. Our work demonstrates a promising strategy for dissecting sequence-catalysis landscapes across enzymatic evolution, opening previously unexplored avenues for enzyme engineering and functional prediction.",

We found viral peptides originating from detected noncanonical ORFs presented on class-I human leukocyte antigen in infected cells and hundreds of upstream ORFs that likely modulate translation initiation of viral proteins.

    "abstract": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are prevalent DNA structures that regulate transcription but also threaten genome stability. How G4 dynamics are controlled remains poorly understood. Here, we report that RNA transcripts govern G4 landscapes through coordinated G-loop assembly and disassembly. G-loop assembly involves activation of the ATM and ATR kinases, followed by homology-directed invasion of RNA opposite the G4 strand mediated by BRCA2 and RAD51. Disassembly of the G-loop resolves the G4 structure through DHX36-FANCJ–mediated G4 unwinding, which triggers nucleolytic incision and subsequent hybrid strand renewal by DNA synthesis. Inhibition of G-loop disassembly causes global G4 and R-loop accumulation, leading to transcriptome dysregulation, replication stress, and genome instability. These findings establish an intricate G-loop assembly-disassembly mechanism that controls G4 landscapes and is essential for cellular homeostasis and survival.",

This Earth energy imbalance has strengthened over the period 2001 to 2023 with satellite data. Here, we show that low climate sensitivity models fail to reproduce the trend in Earth energy imbalance, particularly in the individual longwave and shortwave contributions to the imbalance trend. The inability to produce a strong positive shortwave and strong negative longwave Earth energy imbalance trend is found to be a robust feature in the low climate sensitivity models, especially for models with a climate sensitivity below 2.5 kelvin. The negative longwave contribution to Earth energy imbalance is driven by surface temperature increases and is therefore most pronounced in high climate sensitivity models, whereas the shortwave contribution is generally positive and amplified by greater surface warming.",

    "abstract": "Crystalline solids are governed by universal structure-property relationships derived from their crystal symmetry, leading to paradigmatic rules on what properties they can and cannot exhibit. A long-held structure-property relationship is that centrosymmetric crystals cannot differentially absorb circularly polarized light. In this study, we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and characterization of the centrosymmetric material Li 2 Co 3 (SeO 3 ) 4 , which violates this relationship not by defying symmetry-imposed selection rules but by invoking a photophysical process not previously characterized for crystalline solids. This process originates from an interference between linear dichroism and linear birefringence, referred to as LD-LB, and involves strong chiroptical signals that invert upon sample flipping. In addition to enabling a chiroptical response under centrosymmetry, this process opens up photonic engineering opportunities based on crystalline solids.",

Here, we report that interlayer charge-transfer doping in type III van der Waals heterostructures can be greatly modulated by an external gate to realize a hyperdoping effect. Systematic gated-Hall measurements revealed that the modulated carrier density is about five times that of the gate capacitive charge, achieving an ultrahigh 2D hole density of 1.49 × 10 14 per square centimeter, far exceeding the maximum possible electrostatic doping limit imposed by typical dielectric breakdown. The highly efficient hole-doping enables high-performance p-type 2D transistors with an ultralow contact resistance of ~0.041 kilohm micrometers and a record-high ON-state current density of ~2.30 milliamperes per micrometer.",

In this study, we used a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, that probes these low-energy excitations. We illustrated the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extracted the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings. The ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves, whereas in the antiferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities. Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the excitation spectrum of a many-body system.",

    "abstract": "Translation termination is essential in all living organisms because it ensures that proteins have lengths strictly defined by their genes. This universal process is mediated by peptide release factors (RFs) that recognize stop codons and catalyze the hydrolysis of peptidyl transfer RNA (peptidyl-tRNA) on the ribosome, presumably by activating a water molecule. We report structures of the bacterial ribosome in complex with peptidyl-tRNA and RFs in the prepeptide release state. No hydrolytic water molecule was seen in the peptidyl transferase center. Instead, RFs induced rearrangements of the peptidyl-tRNA adenine 76 (A76) ribose pucker that orient the 2′-OH for the nucleophilic attack onto the neighboring carbonyl group. These findings suggest a catalytic mechanism of RF-mediated peptide release and provide a structural basis for the universal conservation of the catalytic domain in peptide RFs.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing can detail these constraints by systematically profiling homologous cells. The conserved invariant embryonic lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae makes them ideal for comparing cell type gene expression across evolution. Measuring the spatiotemporal divergence of gene expression across embryogenesis, we find a high level of similarity in gene expression programs between species despite tens of millions of years of evolutionary divergence. Nonetheless, thousands of genes show divergence in their cell type specific expression patterns, with enrichment for functions in environmental response and behavior. Neuronal cell types show higher divergence than others such as the intestine and germline. This work identifies likely constraints on the evolution of developmental gene expression.",

We found that the exposure data required for retrospective risk assessment were available for less than 1% of chemicals with potential environmental concern ( n ≈ 297,000). In contrast to the situation with persistent and often inorganic contaminants in the 1970s, current monitoring schemes lack control of a much larger number of organic chemicals and their degradates.

We investigated basal forebrain cholinergic neurons modulating olfactory bulb (OB) circuits in mice. The activity of cholinergic feedback axons in OB correlated with orofacial movements, with little responses to passively experienced odors. When mice engaged in an olfactory task, OB cholinergic axons rapidly shifted their response patterns from movement correlated to odor aligned. This response shift was absent in cholinergic axons projecting to the dorsal cortex during olfactory task engagement, and in OB, during an auditory task. Inactivation of OB-projecting cholinergic neurons impaired olfactory task performance and reduced odor responses in OB granule cells. Thus, the cholinergic system dynamically modulates sensory processing in a modality-specific and context-dependent manner.",

In contrast, Class 2 mutations induce intra-luminal plasticity by reprogramming differentiated luminal cells into a progenitor-like state through activation of KLF5 and AP-1 neo-enhancer circuitries, which enables enhanced survival and proliferation even under castrate androgen levels. Our findings establish FOXA1 as a multifaceted oncogene, with distinct mutational classes divergently evolving to drive prostate tumorigenesis or therapy-resistant progression.",

Switching on Aldh1a2 or RA supplementation reactivated regeneration. Evolutionary inactivation of multiple Aldh1a2-linked regulatory elements accounted for the deficient Aldh1a2 expression upon injury in mice and rats. Furthermore, the activation of Aldh1a2 by a single rabbit enhancer was sufficient to improve ear pinna regeneration in transgenic mice.

The more than 250 fossil beaks of 40 species show that squids originated and rapidly radiated by 100 million years ago. Our data suggest that the radical shift from heavily shelled, slowly moving cephalopods to soft-bodied forms did not result from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction (66 million years ago). Early squids had already formed large populations, and their biomass exceeded that of ammonites and fishes. They pioneered the modern-type marine ecosystem as intelligent, fast swimmers.",

European ash tree ( Fraxinus excelsior ) populations have recently come under strong selection by the invasive fungal pathogen Hymenoscyphus fraxineus . Using genomic prediction models based on field trial phenotypes and 7985 loci, we show a shift in genomically estimated breeding values in an ancient woodland, between adult trees established before the epidemic started and juvenile trees established since. Using simulations, we estimate that natural selection has eliminated 31% of the juvenile population. Thus, we document a highly polygenic heritable microevolutionary adaptive change over a single generation in the wild.",

    "abstract": "Our experience of the world is a continuous stream of events that must be segmented and organized at multiple timescales. The neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. In this work, we simultaneously recorded hundreds to thousands of neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex of freely behaving rats. Neural population activity drifted continuously along a one-dimensional manifold during all behaviors and behavioral states, including sleep, which points to an intrinsic origin of the drift. In awake animals, boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in population dynamics, which segmented the neural activity into temporal units. During tasks with recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the drift, encoding event information across multiple timescales. The results identify a hierarchical coding scheme for organizing events in time.",

Its formation from ammonia and carbon dioxide requires either high pressures and temperatures or, under milder conditions, catalysts or additional reagents. In this study, we observed the spontaneous formation of urea under ambient conditions from ammonia and carbon dioxide in the surface layer of aqueous droplets. Single, optically trapped droplets were probed by using Raman bands as markers. We found the surface layer to act like a microscopic flow reactor, with chemical gradients providing access to unconventional reaction pathways. This observation revealed a general mechanistic scheme for distinctive droplet chemistry. Interfacial chemistry is a possible nonenergetic route for urea formation under prebiotic conditions.",

We identified carboxylation of MAVS by vitamin K (VK)–dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), which was unexpected owing to the reported membrane topology of GGCX. We found that GGCX could undergo topology inversion to carboxylate MAVS within the cytoplasm. This carboxylation enhanced the ability of MAVS to induce type I interferons while suppressing the induction of apoptosis. Genetic knockout of GGCX, a VK-free diet, or depletion of VK by inhibiting VK epoxide reductase 1 with warfarin increased viral susceptibility in mice. Thus, we identified a MAVS regulatory mechanism—the existence of cytoplasmic protein carboxylation and topological inversion of GGCX—and demonstrated how modulating VK levels may influence antiviral defense.",

We report an assemblage of 35 wooden implements from the site of Gantangqing in southwestern China, which was found associated with stone tools, antler billets (soft hammers), and cut-marked bones and is dated from ~361,000 to ~250,000 years at a 95% confidence interval. The wooden implements include digging sticks and small, complete, hand-held pointed tools. The sophistication of many of these tools offsets the seemingly “primitive” aspects of stone tool assemblages in the East Asian Early Paleolithic. This discovery suggests that wooden implements might have played an important role in hominin survival and adaptation in Middle Pleistocene East Asia.",

Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate that strong dipole-dipole interactions between neighboring disulfonyl groups induce ferroelectric ordering in the condensed state, which can be tailored by changing the R group: ferroelectric for R = −H or relaxor ferroelectric for R = −CH 3 . At low electric fields, the relaxor polymer exhibits electroactuation and electrocaloric performance comparable with those of state-of-the-art PVDF-based tetrapolymers.",

This particular membrane forms within an electric double layer in water constructed by voltage application without supporting electrolytes—in which deprotonated resorcinol and an aldehyde react three-dimensionally with a self-termination mechanism—and is spontaneously released when the voltage bias is removed. Initially rigid with a Young’s modulus of 8.9 gigapascals, this membrane reversibly regains flexibility (0.5 gigapascals) upon wetting and can be used as a large-area membrane for separations. Its shape-persistent carbonization made it possible to yield ultrathin (~22-nanometer) nanoporous carbon membranes.",

Using a global analysis of terrestrial vertebrates, we reveal clear and consistent relationships between energy-related factors and species richness. Our findings clarify existing ecological theory and illustrate how adopting a climate space perspective advances biodiversity research, providing critical insights into biodiversity patterns and their responses to environmental change.",

This extensive sequence divergence makes comparative analyses between centromeres challenging. In this study, we identified a chromosome-specific architectural pattern across the human genome, defined by the conserved spacing of a functionally relevant centromeric DNA motif. The distribution of these sites along chromosome arms constitutes the human “centeny map.” By using a custom Genomic Centromere Profiling (GCP) pipeline, we leveraged the motif’s position, orientation, and organization to construct structural models that enable reclassification of human chromosomal clusters, detection of centromere expansion, and identification of structural variants and misassembled regions. The high-resolution maps derived from this pattern not only provide a framework for comparative analysis of centromeres across evolution and disease but also offer a new dimension for chromosome annotation, assembly, and characterization.",

Optogenetic reactivation of social memories of females, but not males, induced place preference. Ablation of the upstream hippocampal dorsal CA2 region or the medial amygdala disrupted the representation of sex and the sexual dichotomy of social memory valence. Thus, vCA1 neurons use dual coding schemes to represent the identities and social properties of familiar conspecifics as a cohesive memory.",

We also identified ZFP91 as a representative Zincore client, binding the conserved promoter motif CTTTAAR. Cryo–electron microscopy of a Zincore-ZFP91-DNA complex revealed a SEPHS1 arginine clamp to recognize the DNA-bound zinc finger domains.

We developed a spectral analysis–based approach that provides detailed estimates of the timescales at which vegetation tracks climate change, from 10 1 to 10 5 years. We report dynamic similarity of vegetation and climate even at centennial frequencies (149 −1 to 18,012 −1 year −1 , that is, one cycle per 149 to 18,012 years). A breakpoint in vegetation turnover (797 −1 year −1 ) matches a breakpoint between stochastic and autocorrelated climate processes, suggesting that ecological dynamics are governed by climate across these frequencies. Heightened vegetation turnover at millennial frequencies (4650 −1 year −1 ) highlights the risk of abrupt responses to climate change, whereas vegetation-climate decoupling at frequencies >149 −1 year −1 may indicate long-lasting consequences of anthropogenic climate change for ecosystem function and biodiversity.",

However, their impact on the system’s many-body electronic phase diagram remains largely unexplored. We present local compressibility measurements revealing numerous incompressible states resulting from supermoiré-lattice-scale isospin symmetry breaking driven by strong interactions. By using the supermoiré lattice occupancy as a probe of isospin symmetry, we observe an unexpected doubling of the miniband filling near ν = − 2 , possibly indicating a hidden phase transition or normal-state pairing proximal to the superconducting phase. Our work establishes supermoiré lattices as a tunable parameter for designing quantum phases and an effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in moiré materials.",

    "abstract": "The anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1) is essential for embryogenesis and the survival of many cell types that tolerate loss of its relatives, BCL-XL and BCL-2. Apoptosis-unrelated roles of MCL-1 in metabolism may contribute to this requirement, though their relevance for embryogenesis and postnatal life remains unclear. We hypothesized that BCL-XL and BCL-2 may substitute MCL-1’s anti-apoptotic but not its apoptosis-unrelated functions. Replacing MCL-1 with BCL-XL or BCL-2 supported embryo development by rescuing the Mcl-1 −/− preimplantation lethality. Mcl-1 Bcl-xL/Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1 Bcl-2/Bcl-2 mice were born on a mixed background, though they showed metabolic defects. Thus MCL-1’s apoptosis-unrelated functions appear critical in later development, with BCL-XL, but not BCL-2, partially compensating. These findings clarify MCL-1’s distinct physiological roles, critically informing MCL-1 inhibitor development as cancer therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) synthesizes telomeric repeats at chromosome ends using a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and a telomerase RNA (hTR in humans). Previous structural work showed that human telomerase is typically monomeric, containing a single copy of TERT and hTR. Evidence for dimeric complexes exists, although the composition, high-resolution structure, and function remain elusive. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a human telomerase dimer bound to telomeric DNA. The structure reveals a 26-subunit assembly and a dimerization interface mediated by the Hinge and ACA box (H/ACA) RNP of telomerase. Premature aging disease mutations map to this interface. Disrupting dimer formation affects RNP assembly, bulk telomerase activity, and telomere maintenance in cells. Our findings address a long-standing enigma surrounding the telomerase dimer and suggest a role for the dimer in telomerase assembly.",

We found that macrophage-derived oncostatin M (OSM) counteracted the pathological effects of type I interferon (IFN-I) during infection and damage in mice. At baseline, OSM-deficient mice exhibited altered alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cell states. In response to influenza or viral mimic challenge, mice lacking OSM exhibited heightened IFN-I responses and increased mortality. OSM delivery to the lung induced ATII proliferation and was sufficient to protect deficient mice against morbidity. Furthermore, OSM promoted organoid formation despite the growth-inhibitory effects of IFN-I.

Mitochondria harbor a host of intrinsic antioxidant defenses, but the contribution of extrinsic, nonmitochondrial antioxidant mechanisms is less well understood. We found a direct role for peroxisomes in maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis through contact-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer. We found that ACBD5 and PTPIP51 form a contact between peroxisomes and mitochondria. The percentage of these contacts increased during mitochondrial oxidative stress and helped to maintain mitochondrial health through the transfer of mitochondrial ROS to the peroxisome lumen.

In this work, we integrate extensive genomic information with hydrography and water mass age to delineate microbial taxonomic and functional boundaries across the South Pacific. Prokaryotic richness steeply increases with depth in the surface ocean, which forms a so-called phylocline, below which, richness is consistently high, dipping slightly in highly aged water. Reconstructed genomes self-organize into six spatially distinct taxonomic cohorts and 10 functionally distinct biomes that are primarily structured by wind-driven circulation at the surface and density-driven circulation at depth. Overall, water physicochemistry, modulated at depth by water age, drives microbial diversity patterns and functional potential in the pelagic ocean.",

Each observation has received its own tailored explanation involving multiple genetic and evolutionary causes. In this work, we show that these empirical patterns all emerge from a single theory for sex chromosome evolution incorporating the coevolution of cis- and trans-acting regulators of gene expression and leading to systematic misexpression of dosage-compensated genes in heterogametic F1 hybrids, for both young and old sex chromosomes.",

In this study, we probed channel-pattern origins by mapping thread dynamics along 84 rivers from 36 years of global satellite imagery using particle image velocimetry. Results show that single-thread channels originate from a balance between lateral erosion and accretion, which enables a thread to migrate while maintaining equilibrium width. In contrast, multithread channels originate from imbalance—erosion outpaces accretion in individual threads, causing threads to repeatedly widen and split. Thread-width imbalance provides a mechanistic explanation for how multithread channels develop on Earth and other planets and, in application, can help lower the cost of nature-based river restoration projects.",

We combined isotope labeling, computed-tomography three-dimensional models, behavioral field experiments, and mathematical models to show that Squamellaria plant hosts reduce conflict among their multiple ant symbiont species by offering nesting sites (domatia) divided into compartments with separate entrances. As long as compartmentalization is maintained, different symbiont species can peacefully coexist, but experimental removal of compartment walls leads to deadly conflicts. Modeling suggests that compartmentalization optimizes nutritional benefits by increasing the time during which domatia harbor large ant colonies. These results reveal a conflict-reduction mechanism that allows hosts to take advantage of unrelated symbionts, which may be widespread in multipartner mutualisms.",

Spatially broad DA release has been extensively characterized, but how DA transmission affects striatal function at a subcellular scale remains poorly understood. Using 2P imaging and whole-cell electrophysiology, we defined the spatiotemporal properties of DA transmission onto striatal indirect pathway spiny projection neurons. Sparse activation of DA release sites evoked localized DA signals, producing spatially discrete, D2 receptor–mediated responses across dendrites. The spatiotemporal properties of DA receptor signaling differed between downstream intracellular pathways. We propose that membrane-delimited Gβγ signaling occurs in parallel to intracellular second messenger pathways, but on different spatial and temporal scales, providing a mechanism for precise decoding of DA signals by striatal neurons.",

However, the Schottky gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. We used a ferroic HfO 2 - ZrO 2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway for improved performance in transistors based on 2DEG.",

They act by increasing the binding affinity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase α (PI3Kα) catalytic subunit p110α to canonical small guanosine triphosphatase RAS proteins and to RRAS, RRAS2, and MRAS by three orders of magnitude. The compounds bind to the RAS-binding domain of p110α, stabilizing the secondary structures of the PI3Kα in a RAS-binding conformation and forming direct interactions with RAS residues tyrosine-40 and arginine-41. In vivo, D927 mimicked the effects of insulin: It rapidly lowered blood glucose concentrations, enhanced glucose metabolism in normal and Zucker fatty rats, and improved hyperglycemia in models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, even in insulin-deficient diabetic animals.",

Vast numbers of amino acid combinations constitute stable protein cores and surfaces. However, alternative cores frequently disrupt protein function by indirect allosteric effects. Both protein stability and binding can be predicted using simple additive energy models with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. Indeed, energy models trained on one protein can predict functional cores and surfaces across more than a billion years of evolution, with only rare energetic couplings that we experimentally identify limiting the transplantation of cores between highly diverged proteins. Our results reveal the simple energetic architecture of proteins and suggest that allostery is an important constraint on sequence evolution.",

    "abstract": "Mutant RAS proteins are among the most prevalent drivers of human cancer, and the glycine to aspartic acid mutation at codon 12 (G12D) is the most common variant. Mutation-selective covalent inhibitors spare RAS in healthy tissue and enable extended pharmacodynamic effect, but covalent targeting of RAS G12D is hindered by low nucleophilicity and high proteomic abundance of carboxylic acids. We overcame these challenges with compounds that bind cyclophilin A (CYPA) to create a neomorphic protein-protein interface between CYPA and active RAS that enables selective, enzyme-like rate enhancement of the covalent reaction between D12 and electrophilic warheads with exceptionally low intrinsic reactivity. This approach yielded orally bioavailable compounds with marked antitumor activity in multiple preclinical models of KRAS G12D cancers, including the investigational agent zoldonrasib (RMC-9805) currently undergoing clinical evaluation (NCT06040541).",

    "abstract": "The year 2023 witnessed an extraordinary surge in marine heatwaves (MHWs) across Earth’s oceans, setting new records in duration, extent, and intensity, with MHW activity totaling 53.6 billion °C days square kilometer—more than three standard deviations above the historical norm since 1982. Notable events include the North Atlantic MHW (276-year return period) and the Southwest Pacific (141 years). Using ECCO2 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean-Phase II) high-resolution daily data, we conducted a mixed-layer heat budget analysis and identified region-specific drivers: enhanced shortwave flux and a shallower mixed layer in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, reduced cloud cover and increased advection in the Southwest Pacific, and oceanic advections in the Tropical Eastern Pacific. The 2023 MHWs highlight the intensifying impacts of a warm climate and the challenges in understanding extreme events.",

Proteins that recognize peptide–MHC-I (pMHCI) complexes with specificity for diseased cells could have considerable therapeutic utility. Specificity requires recognition of outward-facing amino acid residues within the disease-associated peptide as well as avoidance of extensive contacts with ubiquitously expressed MHC. We used RFdiffusion to design pMHCI-binding proteins that make extensive contacts with the peptide and identified specific binders for 11 target pMHCs starting from either experimental or predicted pMHCI structures. Upon incorporation into chimeric antigen receptors, designs for eight targets conferred peptide-specific T cell activation. Our approach should have broad utility for both protein- and cell-based pMHCI targeting.",

Here, we demonstrate atom-by-atom imaging of phasons, an ultrasoft class of moiré phonons in twisted bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ). Using ultrahigh-resolution (<15 picometers) electron ptychography, we imaged the size and shape of each atom to extract time-averaged vibrational amplitudes as a function of twist angle and position. We observed several signature properties of moiré phasons, such as increased vibrational amplitudes at solitons and AA-stacked regions. By correlating experiments with molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations, we show that phasons dominate the thermal vibrations in low-angle twisted bilayers. These results represent a powerful route to image thermal vibrations at atomic resolution, unlocking experimental studies of a thus far hidden branch of moiré phonon physics.",

The structure of the TCRm-pMHC complex at 2.05-Å resolution revealed a rigid TCR-like docking mode with an unusual degree of focus on the up-facing NY-ESO-1 side chains, suggesting the potential for reduced off-target reactivity. Indeed, a structure-informed in silico screen of 14,363 HLA-A*02 peptides correctly predicted two off-target peptides, yet our TCRm maintained peptide selectivity and cytotoxicity as a T cell engager.

By combining vessel Global Positioning System data with satellite imagery, we detected industrial fishing in 47% of coastal MPAs worldwide between 2022 and 2024, with two-thirds of vessel detections (67%) untracked by public monitoring. These untracked vessels were most prevalent (80%) in MPAs with the most restrictive management category, which aims to prohibit all extractive activities. The presence and density of fishing vessels were mainly driven by the size and remoteness of MPAs rather than their management category itself. Including untracked vessels increased estimated fishing effort within MPAs by 28%, to an average of 4 hours per square kilometer per year. These results highlight the continued presence of industrial fishing vessels in MPAs and an important gap in our understanding of fishing pressure on protected areas worldwide.",

We present a generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel effect using metasurfaces and graph theory, achieving controlled multiphoton bunching, antibunching, and entanglement across parallel Jones matrix–encoded spatial modes—all within a single-layer metasurface. A graph-theoretic dual framework is introduced that simultaneously encodes the metasurface-based multiport interferometer designs and its resulting nonclassical correlations, enabling the direct translation of linear quantum optical networks into a single-layer metasurface. We also demonstrate the ability of metasurfaces to produce multipath-entangled states and perform transformations equivalent to higher-order Hadamard interferometers. Our results underscore metasurface quantum graphs for scalable, low-decoherence quantum information infrastructure.",

To solve this problem, we focused on a puzzling behavior in the fossil record of some primates: eating graminoid plants. We report carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from fossil cercopithecid monkeys and integrate the data into a view of hominin dietary evolution, finding that changes in graminivorous behavior preceded corresponding changes in dental morphology by ~700,000 years. Decoupling diets and morphologies in time was conducive to determining when and to exploring why dietary changes helped to propel human evolution.",

Plasmodium falciparum Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 are critical for male fertility and transmission of the malaria parasite. They form a core fertilization complex, but it is unknown how they interact. We determined a cryo–electron microscopy structure of endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex showing that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14. Transgenic parasite lines with these domains removed were defective in Pfs230 gamete localization and showed reduced oocyst formation. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibited Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation, reduced transmission and structural analyses revealed their epitopes. These Pfs230 domains were targets of naturally acquired immunity and immune sera from mRNA–lipid nanoparticle immunizations blocked parasite transmission.",

Although directed movement on the molecular scale has been achieved, using it to impose specific—especially energetically disfavored—shapes on molecules and construct mechanically interlocked structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this study, we report the synthesis of a catenane enabled by a molecular motor that winds molecular strands into discrete entangled structures, each defined by a specific number of mechanical crossings. Light energy drives unidirectional motor rotation, enabling path-dependent control over a sequence of thermodynamically disfavored yet mechanically distinct and kinetically stable winding states, which are covalently captured and subsequently released to yield a catenane. This machine-directed approach offers a general proof-of-concept strategy for the template-free construction of mechanically interlocked molecules.",

Here, we used convergent evolutionary changes in hibernating lineages to define conserved cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and metabolic programs. We characterized mouse hypothalamus gene expression and chromatin dynamics across fed, fasted, and refed states and then used comparative genomics of hibernating versus nonhibernating lineages to identify cis elements with convergent changes in hibernators. Multi-omics approaches pinpointed CREs, hub genes, regulatory programs, and cell types underlying lineage divergence.

    "abstract": "Cis - regulatory elements (CREs) drive phenotypic diversity, yet how CREs are causally linked to function remains largely unclear. Our study elucidates functions for conserved cis elements associated with the evolution of mammalian hibernation and metabolic flexibility. Genomic analyses revealed topologically associated domains (TADs) enriched for convergent changes in hibernators, including the Fat Mass & Obesity ( Fto ) locus. In this TAD, we uncovered genetic circuits for metabolic responses and hibernation-linked cis elements forming regulatory contacts with neighboring genes. Deletions of individual cis elements in mice differentially altered Fto , Irx3 , and Irx5 expression, reshaping downstream gene expression programs and affecting metabolism, torpor, obesogenesis, and foraging in distinct ways. Our findings show how convergent evolution in hibernators pinpoints functional genetic mechanisms of metabolic control, with multiple effects encoded in single CREs.",

We capitalized on electrically driven surface acoustic waves and the extreme light concentration afforded by gap plasmons to achieve this goal. We placed gold nanoparticles in a particle-on-mirror configuration with a few-nanometer-thick, compressible polymer spacer. Surface acoustic waves were then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the gigahertz regime. We observed evidence that the surface acoustic waves produced mechanical deformations in the polymer and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics led to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning. Our approach provides a design strategy for electrically driven dynamic metasurfaces and fundamental explorations of high-frequency, polymer dynamics in ultraconfined geometries.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for neurodegeneration and is characterized by diverse cellular and molecular hallmarks. To understand the origin of these hallmarks, we studied the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome in the brain of short-lived killifish. We identified a cascade of events in which aberrant translation pausing led to altered abundance of proteins independently of transcriptional regulation. In particular, aging caused increased ribosome stalling and widespread depletion of proteins enriched in basic amino acids. These findings uncover a potential vulnerable point in the aging brain’s biology—the biogenesis of basic DNA and RNA binding proteins. This vulnerability may represent a unifying principle that connects various aging hallmarks, encompassing genome integrity, proteostasis, and the biosynthesis of macromolecules.",

    "abstract": "Increasing drought pressure under anthropogenic climate change may jeopardize the potential of tropical forests to capture carbon in woody biomass and act as a long-term carbon dioxide sink. To evaluate this risk, we assessed drought impacts in 483 tree-ring chronologies from across the tropics and found an overall modest stem growth decline (2.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 2.2 to 2.7%) during the 10% driest years since 1930. Stem growth declines exceeded 10% in 25% of cases and were larger at hotter and drier sites and for gymnosperms compared with angiosperms. Growth declines generally did not outlast drought years and were partially mitigated by growth stimulation in wet years. Thus, pantropical forest carbon sequestration through stem growth has hitherto shown drought resilience that may, however, diminish under future climate change.",

Here, we extend measurements of this state with fields outside of the bc crystallographic plane and reveal its core structure: The superconducting phase wraps around the b axis in a halo-like fashion and appears to be stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. This angle dependence points to a multicomponent spin-triplet order parameter with a finite angular momentum of the Cooper pairs. The pairing mechanism remains enigmatic, and UTe 2 ’s specific magnetophilic superconducting tendencies seem incompatible with existing models for field-enhanced superconductivity.",

Furthermore, we found that the sensitivities of ITF to temperature and dust are in a ratio that agrees with laboratory measurements of droplet freezing, showing that ITF can be attributed to dust aerosol.",

This enzymatic platform integrates a range of asymmetric catalysis principles, including remote stereocenter construction, stereodivergent catalysis, kinetic resolution and parallel kinetic resolution, achieving excellent diastereo- and enantiocontrol over radical intermediates.

However, limitations in historical recordkeeping and linguistic documentation have hindered the diachronic analysis of sign languages. In this work, we used computational phylogenetic methods to study family structure among 19 sign languages from deaf communities worldwide. We used phonologically coded lexical data from contemporary languages to infer relatedness and suggest that these methods can help study regular form changes in sign languages. The inferred trees are consistent in key respects with known historical information but challenge certain assumed groupings and surpass analyses made available by traditional methods. Moreover, the phylogenetic inferences are not reducible to geographic distribution but do affirm the importance of geopolitical forces in the histories of human languages.",

In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of a novel class of frequency combs, the topological frequency combs, in a two-dimensional lattice of hundreds of ring resonators that hosts fabrication-robust topological edge states with linear dispersion. By pumping these edge states, we demonstrate the generation of a nested frequency comb that shows oscillation of multiple edge state resonances across ≈40 longitudinal modes and is spatially confined at the lattice edge. Our results provide an opportunity to explore the interplay between topological physics and nonlinear frequency comb generation in a commercially available nanophotonic platform.",

    "abstract": "TnpB nucleases represent the evolutionary precursors to CRISPR-Cas12 and are widespread in all domains of life. IS605-family TnpB homologs function as programmable RNA-guided homing endonucleases in bacteria, driving transposon maintenance through DNA double-strand break–stimulated homologous recombination. In this work, we uncovered molecular mechanisms of the transposition life cycle of IS607-family elements that, notably, also encode group I introns. We identified specific features for a candidate “IStron” from Clostridium botulinum that allow the element to carefully control the relative levels of spliced products versus functional guide RNAs. Our results suggest that IStron transcripts evolved an ability to balance competing and mutually exclusive activities that promote selfish transposon spread while limiting adverse fitness costs on the host. Collectively, this work highlights molecular innovation in the multifunctional utility of transposon-encoded noncoding RNAs.",

Here, we characterize such an outer complex in a system that models the bimolecular, C-O bond–forming reaction of a phosphine oxide Lewis base with a carbenium Lewis acid. Crystallographic studies show that the C-O distance in the outer form exceeds that of the final or inner adduct by 1.1 angstroms. As the system samples the two forms of the complex, which correspond to minima on the corresponding potential energy surface, the C-O linkage switches from a secondary interaction in the outer complex to a dative bond in the inner complex. This phenomenon is harnessed as a functional feature to stabilize xanthylium-based photoredox catalysts.",

Yet direct observations from the 79 North Glacier (79NG) calving front reveal decreasing Atlantic Intermediate Water (AIW) temperatures below the ice tongue from 2018 to 2021, leading to reduced ocean heat transport. This is linked to a concurrent decrease in basal melt and thinning rates at the grounding line. The origin of this AIW cooling is traced to a slowdown of the large-scale ocean circulation in the Nordic Seas, driven by European atmospheric blocking that strengthens cold air advection from the central Arctic through the Fram Strait. Blocking has driven major ocean cooling events over the last 50 years and will remain crucial in affecting Northeast Greenland’s glaciers.",

Although metal-containing enzymes oxidize alkanes with remarkable ease and selectivity, chemical approaches have largely been limited to transition metal–based catalytic carbon–hydrogen functionalizations. Alkanes can be protonated to form pentacoordinated carbonium ions and fragmented into smaller hydrocarbons in the presence of strong Brønsted acids. However, catalytic stereocontrol over such reactions has not previously been accomplished. We show here that strong and confined acids catalyze highly enantioselective fragmentations of a variety of cyclopropanes into the corresponding alkenes, expanding the boundaries of catalytic selective alkane activation. Computational studies suggest the involvement of the long-debated cycloproponium ions.",

We show that widespread deforestation has underpinned repeated color shifts in wild insect populations. Specifically, loss of forest has led to color changes across lineages that mimic the warning coloration of a toxic forest stonefly. Predation experiments suggest that the relative fitness of color phenotypes varies between forested and deforested habitats. Genomic and coloration analyses of 1200 specimens show repeated selection at the ebony locus controlling color polymorphism across lineages. These findings represent an example of human-driven evolution linked to altered species interactions, highlighting the possibility for populations to adapt rapidly in the wake of sudden environmental change.",

We present velocity-resolved kinetics measurements for catalytic hydrogen oxidation on palladium over a wide range of surface concentrations and at high temperatures. The rates exhibit a complex dependence on oxygen coverage and step density, which can be quantitatively explained by a density functional and transition-state theory–based kinetic model involving a cooperatively stabilized configuration of at least three oxygen atoms at steps. Here, two oxygen atoms recruit a third oxygen atom to a nearby binding site to produce an active configuration that is far more reactive than isolated oxygen atoms. Thus, hydrogen oxidation on palladium provides a clear example of how reactivity can be enhanced on a working catalyst.",

This response, typical for most mammals, safeguards against short-term water deprivation but fails in the long term. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) use the short-term response during summer, whereas during winter, they lack thirst and survive without water for months. In this work, we show that long-term thirst suppression occurs despite hormonal and behavioral signs of a substantial fluid deficit and originates from hypoactivity of neurons in the circumventricular organs, which exhibit marked functional suppression during winter that blunts their sensitivity to thirst cues. Our work reveals a notable capacity of the evolutionarily conserved brain regions that control fluid homeostasis in mammals to enable long-term survival without water.",

We unravel the genetic basis of sexually selected plumage traits to investigate their effects on reproductive isolation in barn swallows. The genetic architecture of sexual traits is characterized by 12 loci on two autosomes and the Z chromosome. Sexual trait loci exhibit signatures of divergent selection in geographic isolation and barriers to gene flow in secondary contact. Linkage disequilibrium between these genes has been maintained by selection in hybrid zones beyond what would be expected under admixture alone. Our findings reveal that selection on coupled sexual trait loci promotes reproductive isolation, providing key empirical evidence for the role of sexual selection in speciation.",

The cryo–electron microscopy structures of CAAD in its apo and activated forms, together with biochemical evidence, revealed how cA 4 or cA 6 binds to the CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domain and abrogates CAAD autoinhibition, inducing substantial conformational changes that reshape the structure of CAAD and induce its deaminase activity.

In this work, we identify a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of TCR sensitivity that guides alternative splicing of TCR signaling transcripts through an evolutionarily ultraconserved poison exon (PE) in the RNA-binding protein (RBP) TRA2β in mouse and human. TRA2 β - PE splicing, seen during cancer and infection, was required for TCR-induced effector T cell expansion and function. Tra2 β-PE skipping enhanced T cell response to antigen by increasing TCR sensitivity. As antigen levels decreased, Tra2 β-PE reinclusion allowed T cell survival. Finally, we found that TRA2 β-PE was first included in the genome of jawed vertebrates that were capable of TCR gene rearrangements. We propose that TRA2 β - PE splicing acts as a gatekeeper of TCR sensitivity to shape T cell fate.",

In this work, we present observational evidence for the glaciation of supercooled liquid-water clouds at industrial aerosol hot spots at temperatures between −10° and −24°C. Compared with the nearby liquid-water clouds, shortwave reflectance was reduced by 14% and longwave radiance was increased by 4% in the glaciation-affected regions. There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness. Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles. However, rare glaciation events downwind of nuclear power plants indicate that factors other than aerosol emissions may also play a role in the observed glaciation events.",

One prevailing hypothesis for the origin of the MPT is that glacial deep ocean circulation fundamentally changed, marked by a circulation “crisis” at ~0.90 Ma (marine isotope stages 24 to 22) ( 3 ). Using high-resolution paired neodymium, carbon, and oxygen isotope data from the South Atlantic Ocean (Cape Basin) across the MPT, we find no evidence of a substantial change in deep ocean circulation. Before and during the early MPT (~1.30 to 1.12 Ma), the glacial deep ocean variability closely resembled that of the most recent glacial cycle. The carbon storage facilitated by developing deep ocean stratification across the MPT required only modest circulation adjustments.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-first-century roboticists envision robots capable of sorting objects and packaging them, of chopping vegetables and folding clothes. But although many today believe that the only factors necessary for robots to achieve dexterous manipulation are data and artificial intelligence (AI), managing all the mundane manipulations that humans perform daily requires constant adaptation to changing conditions. These operations include tasks demanding millisecond-level responses to prevent irreparable damage, such as quickly stabilizing a slipping package or halting a knife just before it cuts into a table. Although recent advances in intelligent robot control have considerably expanded—and will continue to expand—the range and complexity of tasks that robots can perform, AI, data, and control theory alone are not enough. A brain cannot manipulate items effectively without a body—and specifically hands—suited to the task.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are 21- to 22-nucleotide RNAs that guide Argonaute-class effectors to targets for repression. In this work, we uncover 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), the initiating enzyme for heme biosynthesis, as a general repressor of miRNA accumulation. Although heme is known to be a positive cofactor for the nuclear miRNA processing machinery, ALAS1—but not other heme biosynthesis enzymes—limits the assembly and activity of Argonaute complexes under heme-replete conditions. This involves a cytoplasmic role for ALAS1, previously considered inactive outside of mitochondria. Moreover, conditional depletion of ALAS activity from mouse hepatocytes increases miRNAs and enhances siRNA-mediated knockdown. Notably, because ALAS1 is the target of a Food and Drug Administration–approved siRNA drug, agents that suppress ALAS may serve as adjuvants for siRNA therapies.",

    "abstract": "Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are known for their robust topological order and possess properties that are appealing for applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. An engineered quantum platform would provide opportunities to operate FQH states without an external magnetic field and enhance local and coherent manipulation of these exotic states. We demonstrate a lattice version of photon FQH states using a programmable on-chip platform based on photon blockade and engineering gauge fields on a two-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamics system. We observe the effective photon Lorentz force and butterfly spectrum in the artificial gauge field, a prerequisite for FQH states. After adiabatic assembly of Laughlin FQH wave function of 1/2 filling factor from localized photons, we observe strong density correlation and chiral topological flow among the FQH photons. We then verify the unique features of FQH states in response to external fields, including the incompressibility of generating quasiparticles and the smoking-gun signature of fractional quantum Hall conductivity. Our work illustrates a route to the creation and manipulation of novel strongly correlated topological quantum matter composed of photons and opens up possibilities for fault-tolerant quantum information devices.",

    "abstract": "One of the biggest neurophysiological science news headlines of the 2024 summer reported a critical link between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicide, and brain injury from blast events in members of the elite US fighting force, Navy SEALS. Researchers from the Department of Defense/Uniformed Services University Brain Tissue Repository (DOD/USU BTR) had discovered a border of neural damage between the layers of white and gray matter comprising the cortical folds of service members’ brains. Described as a distinctive anatomical line of astroglial scarring along the shared junctions of gray and white cellular zones of the brain, this tissue injury was unlike that observed for concussive brain trauma. Rather, it was consistent with blast biophysics of mammalian tissues. In this new study, the damage appears to be correlated with long-term, repeated exposure to blast waves from nearby explosions or firing weapons. A cascade of progressive unexplained behaviors, cognitive decline, and severe depression in the trained fighters ensued. This analysis suggested that repetitive, impulsive pressure waves traveling through the service members’ heads and brains with each blast had compromised their cognitive centers, setting a downward trajectory in their mental and physical health.",

    "abstract": "St. Ives is an idyllic seaside town on the southwest tip of England. It is a magnet for holidaymakers and artists. In early 2023, its residents were surprised to find that their beloved bay had become the location for an experiment. A technology start-up called Planetary Technologies had gained permission from the local water company to add magnesium hydroxide to a wastewater outlet pipe and pump it a mile offshore. Some within the community were outraged to find out from a national newspaper not only about the planned release of the chemicals, but that a small test had already happened the previous September. That April 2023, more than 300 protesters gathered on the beach, some with slogans on their surfboards. Most of them were concerned about the risks to their ecosystem and its crabs, seals, and lobsters. On finding out more about the company and its ambitions, some of the protesters started to see the experiment in a new light.",
