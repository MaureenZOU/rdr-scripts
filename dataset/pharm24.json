    "abstract": "Model‐informed drug development (MIDD) is a powerful quantitative approach that plays an integral role in drug development and regulatory review. While applied throughout the life cycle of the development of new drugs, a key application of MIDD is to inform clinical trial design including dose selection and optimization. To date, physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, an established component of the MIDD toolkit, has mainly been used for assessment of drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and consequential dose adjustments in regulatory submissions. As a result of recent scientific advances and growing confidence in the utility of the approach, PBPK models are being increasingly applied to provide dose recommendations for subjects with differing ages, genetics, and disease states. In this review, we present our perspective on the current landscape of regulatory acceptance of PBPK applications supported by relevant case studies. We also discuss the recent progress and future challenges associated with expanding the utility of PBPK models into emerging areas for regulatory decision making, especially dose optimization in highly vulnerable and understudied populations and facilitating diversity in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Beta‐blockers are widely used medications for a variety of indications, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Genetic variability in pharmacokinetic (e.g., CYP2D6 ) and pharmacodynamic (e.g., ADRB1 , ADRB2 , ADRA2C , GRK4 , GRK5 ) genes have been studied in relation to beta‐blocker exposure and response. We searched and summarized the strength of the evidence linking beta‐blocker exposure and response with the six genes listed above. The level of evidence was high for associations between CYP2D6 genetic variation and both metoprolol exposure and heart rate response. Evidence indicates that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers experience clinically significant greater exposure and lower heart rate in response to metoprolol compared with those who are not poor metabolizers. Therefore, we provide therapeutic recommendations regarding genetically predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer status and metoprolol therapy. However, there was insufficient evidence to make therapeutic recommendations for CYP2D6 and other beta‐blockers or for any beta‐blocker and the other five genes evaluated (updates at www.cpicpgx.org ).",

    "abstract": "For some patients with psoriasis, orally administered small molecule inhibitors of interleukin (IL)‐17A may represent a convenient alternative to IL‐17A‐targeting monoclonal antibodies. This first‐in‐human study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and peripherally circulating IL‐17A target engagement profile of single or multiple oral doses of the small molecule IL‐17A inhibitor LY3509754 (NCT04586920). Healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive LY3509754 or placebo in sequential escalating single ascending dose (SAD; dose range 10–2,000 mg) or multiple ascending dose (MAD; dose range 100–1,000 mg daily for 14 days) cohorts. The study enrolled 91 participants (SAD, N = 51 and MAD, N = 40) aged 21–65 years (71% men). LY3509754 had a time to maximum concentration ( T max ) of 1.5–3.5 hours, terminal half‐life of 11.4–19.1 hours, and exhibited dose‐dependent increases in exposure. LY3509754 had strong target engagement, indicated by elevated plasma IL‐17A levels within 12 hours of dosing. Four participants from the 400‐mg ( n = 1) and 1,000‐mg ( n = 3) MAD cohorts experienced increased liver transaminases or acute hepatitis (onset ≥ 12 days post‐last LY3509754 dose), consistent with drug‐induced liver injury (DILI). One case of acute hepatitis was severe, resulted in temporary hospitalization, and was classified as a serious adverse event. No adverse effects on other major organ systems were observed. Liver biopsies from three of the four participants revealed lymphocyte‐rich, moderate‐to‐severe lobular inflammation. We theorize that the DILI relates to an off‐target effect rather than IL‐17A inhibition. In conclusion, despite strong target engagement and a PK profile that supported once‐daily administration, this study showed that oral dosing with LY3509754 was poorly tolerated.",

    "abstract": "Bispecific antibodies, by enabling the targeting of more than one disease‐associated antigen or engaging immune effector cells, have both advantages and challenges compared with a combination of two different biological products. As of December 2023, there are 11 U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved BsAb products on the market. Among these, 9 have been approved for oncology indications, and 8 of these are CD3 T‐cell engagers. Clinical pharmacology strategies, including dose‐related strategies, are critical for bispecific antibody development. This analysis reviewed clinical studies of all approved bispecific antibodies in oncology and identified dose‐related perspectives to support clinical dose optimization and regulatory approvals, particularly in the context of the Food and Drug Administration's Project Optimus: (1) starting doses and dose ranges in first‐in‐human studies; (2) dose strategies including step‐up doses or full doses for recommended phase 2 doses or dose level(s) used for registrational intent; (3) restarting therapy after dose delay; (4) considerations for the introduction of subcutaneous doses; (5) body weight vs. flat dosing strategy; and (6) management of immunogenicity. The learnings arising from this review are intended to inform successful strategies for future bispecific antibody development.",

    "abstract": "( R , S )‐Ketamine (ketamine) is a dissociative anesthetic that also possesses analgesic and antidepressant activity. Undesirable dissociative side effects and misuse potential limit expanded use of ketamine in several mental health disorders despite promising clinical activity and intensifying medical need. (2 R ,6 R )‐Hydroxynorketamine ( RR‐ HNK) is a metabolite of ketamine that lacks anesthetic and dissociative activity but maintains antidepressant and analgesic activity in multiple preclinical models. To enable future assessments in selected human indications, we report the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of RR‐ HNK in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (NCT04711005). A six‐level single‐ascending dose (SAD) (0.1–4 mg/kg) and a two‐level multiple ascending dose (MAD) (1 and 2 mg/kg) study was performed using a 40‐minute IV administration emulating the common practice for ketamine administration for depression. Safety assessments showed RR‐ HNK possessed a minimal adverse event profile and no serious adverse events at all doses examined. Evaluations of dissociation and sedation demonstrated that RR‐ HNK did not possess anesthetic or dissociative characteristics in the doses examined. RR‐ HNK PK parameters were measured in both the SAD and MAD studies and exhibited dose‐proportional increases in exposure. Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) measurements collected as a PD parameter based on preclinical findings and ketamine's established effect on gamma‐power oscillations demonstrated increases of gamma power in some participants at the lower/mid‐range doses examined. Cerebrospinal fluid examination confirmed RR‐ HNK exposure within the central nervous system (CNS). Collectively, these data demonstrate RR‐ HNK is well tolerated with an acceptable PK profile and promising PD outcomes to support the progression into Phase 2.",

    "abstract": "Outpatient clinical notes are a rich source of information regarding drug safety. However, data in these notes are currently underutilized for pharmacovigilance due to methodological limitations in text mining. Large language models (LLMs) like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have shown progress in a range of natural language processing tasks but have not yet been evaluated on adverse event (AE) detection. We adapted a new clinical LLM, University of California – San Francisco (UCSF)‐BERT, to identify serious AEs (SAEs) occurring after treatment with a non‐steroid immunosuppressant for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We compared this model to other language models that have previously been applied to AE detection. We annotated 928 outpatient IBD notes corresponding to 928 individual patients with IBD for all SAE‐associated hospitalizations occurring after treatment with a non‐steroid immunosuppressant. These notes contained 703 SAEs in total, the most common of which was failure of intended efficacy. Out of eight candidate models, UCSF‐BERT achieved the highest numerical performance on identifying drug‐SAE pairs from this corpus (accuracy 88–92%, macro F1 61–68%), with 5–10% greater accuracy than previously published models. UCSF‐BERT was significantly superior at identifying hospitalization events emergent to medication use ( P < 0.01). LLMs like UCSF‐BERT achieve numerically superior accuracy on the challenging task of SAE detection from clinical notes compared with prior methods. Future work is needed to adapt this methodology to improve model performance and evaluation using multicenter data and newer architectures like Generative pre‐trained transformer (GPT). Our findings support the potential value of using large language models to enhance pharmacovigilance.",

This systematic review and meta‐analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the FGF‐21 analogs, efruxifermin, pegbelfermin, and pegozafermin for MASH treatment. A comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials from five major databases was conducted. Primary efficacy outcomes focused on liver histological improvement, while secondary efficacy outcomes encompassed reductions in liver fat content and improvements in biochemical parameters. Safety outcomes examined included treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment‐related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation, and serious TEAEs. Eight eligible studies involving 963 patients were included in this review. Compared with the placebo group, the FGF‐21 analog‐treated group exhibited significantly improved primary efficacy outcomes, specifically ≥1 stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of MASH (risk ratio [RR] = 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27–2.62) and at least two‐point improvement in the non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score with no worsening of fibrosis (RR = 2.85; 95% CI = 2.06–3.95). Despite an increased risk of TEAEs (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.08–1.27) and treatment‐related adverse events (RR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.40–2.19), FGF‐21 analogs exhibited an acceptable safety profile. FGF‐21 analogs were significantly better in achieving liver histological improvements and beneficial biochemical outcomes compared with placebo, with a tolerable safety pattern. These findings shed light on the efficacy and safety of FGF‐21 analogs and provide valuable evidence for their application as MASH therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Methadone is a mu (μ) opioid receptor agonist used clinically in adults and children to manage opioid use disorder, neonatal abstinence syndrome, and acute and chronic pain. It is typically marketed as a racemic mixture of R ‐ and S ‐enantiomers. R ‐methadone has 30‐to 50‐fold higher analgesic potency than S ‐methadone, and S ‐methadone has a greater adverse effect (prolongation) on the cardiac QTc interval. Methadone undergoes stereoselective metabolism. CYP2B6 is the primary enzyme responsible for catalyzing the metabolism of both enantiomers to the inactive metabolites, S ‐ and R ‐2‐ethylidene‐1,5‐dimethyl‐3,3‐diphenylpyrrolidine ( S ‐ and R ‐EDDP). Genetic variation in the CYP2B6 gene has been investigated in the context of implications for methadone pharmacokinetics, dose, and clinical outcomes. Most CYP2B6 variants result in diminished or loss of CYP2B6 enzyme activity, which can lead to higher plasma methadone concentrations (affecting S‐ more than R‐ methadone). However, the data do not consistently indicate that CYP2B6 ‐based metabolic variability has a clinically significant effect on methadone dose, efficacy, or QTc prolongation. Expert analysis of the published literature does not support a change from standard methadone prescribing based on CYP2B6 genotype (updates at www.cpicpgx.org ).",

    "abstract": "Precision dosing, the tailoring of drug doses to optimize therapeutic benefits and minimize risks in each patient, is essential for drugs with a narrow therapeutic window and severe adverse effects. Adaptive dosing strategies extend the precision dosing concept to time‐varying treatments which require sequential dose adjustments based on evolving patient conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) naturally fits this paradigm: it perfectly mimics the sequential decision‐making process where clinicians adapt dose administration based on patient response and evolution monitoring. This paper aims to investigate the potentiality of coupling RL with population PK/PD models to develop precision dosing algorithms, reviewing the most relevant works in the field. Case studies in which PK/PD models were integrated within RL algorithms as simulation engine to predict consequences of any dosing action have been considered and discussed. They mainly concern propofol‐induced anesthesia, anticoagulant therapy with warfarin and a variety of anticancer treatments differing for administered agents and/or monitored biomarkers. The resulted picture highlights a certain heterogeneity in terms of precision dosing approaches, applied methodologies, and degree of adherence to the clinical domain. In addition, a tutorial on how a precision dosing problem should be formulated in terms of the key elements composing the RL framework (i.e., system state, agent actions and reward function), and on how PK/PD models could enhance RL approaches is proposed for readers interested in delving in this field. Overall, the integration of PK/PD models into a RL‐framework holds great promise for precision dosing, but further investigations and advancements are still needed to address current limitations and extend the applicability of this methodology to drugs requiring adaptive dosing strategies.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of precision dosing is to increase the chances of therapeutic success in individual patients. This is achieved in practice by adjusting doses to reach precision dosing targets determined previously in relevant populations, ideally with robust supportive evidence showing improved clinical outcomes compared with standard dosing. But is this implicit assumption of translatable population‐level precision dosing targets correct and the best for all patients? In this review, the types of precision dosing targets and how they are determined are outlined, problems with the translatability of these targets to individual patients are identified, and ways forward to address these challengers are proposed. Achieving improved clinical outcomes to support precision dosing over standard dosing is currently hampered by applying population‐level targets to all patients. Just as “one‐dose‐fits‐all” may be an inappropriate philosophy for drug treatment overall, a “one‐target‐fits‐all” philosophy may limit the broad clinical benefits of precision dosing. Defining individual‐level precision dosing targets may be needed for greatest therapeutic success. Superior future precision dosing targets will integrate several biomarkers that together account for the multiple sources of drug response variability.",

    "abstract": "Studies using real‐world data (RWD) can complement evidence from clinical trials and fill evidence gaps during different stages of a medicine's lifecycle. This review presents the experience resulting from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) pilot to generate RWE to support evaluations by EU regulators and down‐stream decision makers from September 2021 to February 2023. A total of 61 research topics were identified for RWE generation during this period, covering a wide range of research questions, primarily generating evidence on medicines safety (22, 36%), followed by questions on the design and feasibility of clinical trials (11, 18%), drug utilization (10, 16%), clinical management (10, 16%), and disease epidemiology. A significant number of questions were related to the pediatric population and/or rare diseases. A total of 27 regulatory‐led RWD studies have been conducted. Most studies were descriptive and aimed at estimating incidence and prevalence rates of clinical outcomes including adverse events or to evaluate medicines utilization. The review highlights key learnings to guide further efforts to enable the use and establish the value of real‐world evidence (RWE) for regulatory decisions. For instance, there is a need to access additional fit‐for‐purpose and representative data, and to explore further means to provide timely evidence that meets regulatory timelines. The need for early interactions and close collaboration with study requesters, e.g., from the Agency's scientific Committees, to better understand the research question is equally important. Finally, the review provides our perspective on the way forward to maximize the potential of regulatory‐led RWE generation.",

    "abstract": "Enpatoran is a novel, highly selective, and potent dual toll‐like receptor (TLR)7 and TLR8 inhibitor currently under development for the treatment of autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), and myositis. The ongoing phase II study (WILLOW; NCT05162586) is evaluating enpatoran for 24 weeks in patients with active SLE or CLE and is currently recruiting. To support development of WILLOW as an Asia‐inclusive multiregional clinical trial (MRCT) according to International Conference on Harmonisation E5 and E17 principles, we have evaluated ethnic sensitivity to enpatoran based on clinical pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and safety data from an ethno‐bridging study (NCT04880213), supplemented by relevant quantitative PK, PD, and disease trajectory modeling (DTM) results, and drug metabolism/disease knowledge. A single‐center, open‐label, sequential dose group study in White and Japanese subjects matched by body weight, height, and sex demonstrated comparable PK and PD properties for enpatoran in Asian vs. non‐Asian (White and other) subjects across single 100, 200, and 300 mg orally administered doses. DTM suggested no significant differences in SLE disease trajectory for Asian vs. non‐Asian individuals. Aldehyde oxidase (AOX) is considered to be a key contributor to enpatoran metabolism, and a literature review indicated no relevant ethnic differences in AOX function based on in vitro and clinical PK data from marketed drugs metabolized by AOX, supporting the conclusion of low ethnic sensitivity for enpatoran. Taken together, the inclusion of Asian patients in MRCTs including WILLOW was informed based on a Totality of Evidence approach.",

    "abstract": "Sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have demonstrated multifaceted pharmacological effects. In addition to type 2 diabetes, they are now indicated for heart failure and chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to identify novel associations between SGLT2i use and health outcomes using real‐world data. Using linked data from a nationwide diabetes registry in Australia, we compared hospitalization rates in people living with type 2 diabetes commencing treatment with SGLT2i and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor (DPP4i) between December 1, 2013, and June 30, 2019. Cause‐specific hospitalizations were categorized across three hierarchies of diagnoses (first, first three, and first four digits of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Version, Australian Modification codes). Incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each cause‐specific hospitalization were estimated using negative binomial regression. In the first hierarchy, hospitalization rates were lower across most diagnosis groups among SGLT2i initiators ( n = 99,569) compared with DPP4i initiators ( n = 186,353). In the second and third hierarchies, there were lower hospitalization rates relating to infections, anemias, and obstructive airway diseases among SGLT2i initiators compared with DPP4i initiators. These included sepsis (IRR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.51–0.72) anemia (IRR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.46–0.66), and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (IRR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.40–0.68), as well as for previously known associations (e.g., heart failure (IRR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.56–0.70)). SGLT2is have previously uncharacterized associations on a range of important clinical outcomes; validation of these associations requires further study, some of which may suggest novel benefits or new indications for SGLT2is.",

    "abstract": "Oligonucleotide therapeutics (ONTs) represent a new modality with unique pharmacological and chemical properties that modulate gene expression with a high degree of target specificity mediated by complementary Watson‐Crick base pair hybridization. To date, the proarrhythmic assessment of ONTs has been influenced by International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E14 and S7B guidance. To document current hERG/QTc evaluation practices, we reviewed US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Approval Packages (source: PharmaPendium.com ) and collated preclinical and clinical studies for 17 marketed ONTs. In addition, clinical QTc data from 12 investigational ONTs were obtained from the literature. Of the marketed ONTs, eight were tested in the hERG assay with no inhibitory effect identified at the top concentration (range: 34–3,000 μM) tested. Fourteen of the ONTs were evaluated in nonhuman primate cardiovascular studies with 11 of them in dedicated telemetry studies. No effect on QTc intervals were observed (at high exposure multiples) in all studies. Clinically, four ONTs were evaluated in TQT studies; an additional six ONTs were assessed by concentration‐QTc interval analysis, and six by routine safety electrocardiogram monitoring. None of the clinical studies identified a QTc prolongation risk; the same was true for the 12 investigational ONTs. A search of the FDA Adverse Event Database indicated no association between approved ONTs and proarrhythmias. Overall, the collective weight of evidence from 29 ONTs demonstrate no clinical proarrhythmic risk based on data obtained from ICH S7B/E14 studies. Thus, new ONTs may benefit from reduced testing strategies because they have no proarrhythmic risk, a similar cardiac safety profile as monoclonal antibodies, proteins, and peptides.",

    "abstract": "Adeno‐associated virus (AAV) vector‐based gene therapy is an innovative modality being increasingly investigated to treat diseases by modifying or replacing defective genes or expressing therapeutic entities. With its unique anatomic and physiological characteristics, the eye constitutes a very attractive target for gene therapy. Specifically, the ocular space is easily accessible and is generally considered “immune‐privileged” with a low risk of systemic side effects following local drug administration. As retina cells have limited cellular turnover, a one‐time gene delivery has the potential to provide long‐term transgene expression. Despite the initial success with voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna), the first approved retina gene therapy, there are still challenges to be overcome for successful clinical development of these products and scientific questions to be answered. The current review paper aims to integrate published experience learned thus far for AAV‐based retina gene therapy related to preclinical to clinical translation; first‐in‐human dose selection; relevant bioanalytical assays and strategies; clinical development considerations including trial design, biodistribution and vector shedding, immunogenicity, transgene expression, and pediatric populations; opportunities for model‐informed drug development; and regulatory perspectives. The information presented herein is intended to serve as a guide to inform the clinical development strategy for retina gene therapy with a focus on clinical pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "Bispecific T‐cell Engagers (TCEs) are promising anti‐cancer treatments that bind to both the CD3 receptors on T cells and an antigen on the surface of tumor cells, creating an immune synapse, leading to killing of malignant tumor cells. These novel therapies have unique development challenges, with specific safety risks of cytokine release syndrome. These on‐target adverse events fortunately can be mitigated and deconvoluted from efficacy via innovative dosing strategies, making clinical pharmacology key in the development of these therapies. This review assesses dose selection and the role of quantitative clinical pharmacology in the development of the first eight approved TCEs. Model informed drug development (MIDD) strategies can be used at every stage to guide TCE development. Mechanistic modeling approaches allow for (1) efficacious yet safe first‐in‐human dose selection as compared with in vitro minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) approach; (2) rapid escalation and reducing number of patients with subtherapeutic doses through model‐based adaptive design; (3) virtual testing of different step‐up dosing regimens that may not be feasible to be evaluated in the clinic; and (4) selection and justification of the optimal clinical step‐up and full treatment doses. As the knowledge base around TCEs continues to grow, the relevance and utilization of MIDD strategies for supporting the development and dose optimization of these molecules are expected to advance, optimizing the benefit–risk profile for cancer patients.",

Currently, the suPAR assay is not commercially available in the United States. An alternative method was needed to identify patients that best reflect the population in the clinical trial selected based on suPAR level ≥ 6 ng/mL at baseline. A machine learning approach based on data from the SAVEMORE trial was used to develop a scoring rule to identify patients who are likely to have a suPAR level ≥ 6 ng/mL at baseline. External validation of the scoring rule was conducted with data from a different trial (SAVE). This clinical scoring rule with high positive predictive value, high specificity, reasonable sensitivity, and biological relevance is expected to identify patients who are likely to have an elevated suPAR level ≥ 6 ng/mL at baseline. As such, it is included in the EUA to identify patients that fall within the authorized population for whom the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of anakinra.",

An intronic LPP variant, rs1975991, associated with reduced atorvastatin lactone AUC 0–∞ ( P = 3.8 × 10 −8 ). Three UGT1A variants linked with UGT1A3*2 associated with increased 2‐hydroxy atorvastatin lactone AUC 0–∞ ( P = 3.9 × 10 −8 ). Furthermore, a candidate gene analysis including 243 participants suggested that increased function SLCO1B1 variants and decreased activity CYP3A4 variants affect atorvastatin pharmacokinetics. Compared with individuals with normal function SLCO1B1 genotype, atorvastatin AUC 0–∞ was 145% (90% confidence interval: 98‐203%; P = 5.6 × 10 −11 ) larger in individuals with poor function, 24% (9‐41%; P = 0.0053) larger in those with decreased function, and 41% (16‐59%; P = 0.016) smaller in those with highly increased function SLCO1B1 genotype. Individuals with intermediate metabolizer CYP3A4 genotype ( CYP3A4*2 or CYP3A4*22 heterozygotes) had 33% (14‐55%; P = 0.022) larger atorvastatin AUC 0–∞ than those with normal metabolizer genotype. UGT1A3*2 heterozygotes had 16% (5‐25%; P = 0.017) smaller and LPP rs1975991 homozygotes had 34% (22‐44%; P = 4.8 × 10 −5 ) smaller atorvastatin AUC 0‐∞ than noncarriers. These data demonstrate that genetic variation in SLCO1B1 , UGT1A3 , LPP , and CYP3A4 affects atorvastatin pharmacokinetics. This is the first study to suggest that LPP rs1975991 may reduce atorvastatin exposure.

    "abstract": "Cross‐species differences in drug transport and metabolism are linked to poor translation of preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicology data to humans, often resulting in the failure of new chemical entities (NCEs) during clinical drug development. Specifically, inaccurate prediction of renal clearance and renal accumulation of NCEs due to differential abundance of enzymes and transporters in kidneys can lead to differences in pharmacokinetics and toxicity between experimental animals and humans. We carried out liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)‐based protein quantification of 78 membrane drug‐metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMETs) in the kidney membrane fractions of humans, rats, and mice for characterization of cross‐species and sex‐dependent differences. In general, majority of DMET proteins were higher in rodents than in humans. Significant cross‐species differences were observed in 30 out of 33 membrane DMET proteins quantified in all three species. Although no significant sex‐dependent differences were observed in humans, the abundance of 28 and 46 membrane proteins showed significant sex dependence in rats and mice, respectively. These cross‐species and sex‐dependent quantitative abundance data are valuable for gaining a mechanistic understanding of drug renal disposition and accumulation. Further, these data can also be integrated into systems pharmacology tools, such as physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, to enhance the interpretation of preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicological data.",

    "abstract": "The landscape of oncology drug development has witnessed remarkable advancements over the last few decades, significantly improving clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients with cancer. Project Optimus, introduced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, stands as a groundbreaking endeavor to reform dose selection of oncology drugs, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the field. To address complex dose optimization challenges, an Oncology Dose Optimization IQ Working Group was created to characterize current practices, provide recommendations for improvement, develop a clinical toolkit, and engage Health Authorities. Historically, dose selection for cytotoxic chemotherapeutics has focused on the maximum tolerated dose, a paradigm that is less relevant for targeted therapies and new treatment modalities. A survey conducted by this group gathered insights from member companies regarding industry practices in oncology dose optimization. Given oncology drug development is a complex effort with multidimensional optimization and high failure rates due to lack of clinically relevant efficacy, this Working Group advocates for a case‐by‐case approach to inform the timing, specific quantitative targets, and strategies for dose optimization, depending on factors such as disease characteristics, patient population, mechanism of action, including associated resistance mechanisms, and therapeutic index. This white paper highlights the evolving nature of oncology dose optimization, the impact of Project Optimus, and the need for a tailored and evidence‐based approach to optimize oncology drug dosing regimens effectively.",

In some cases, discrepancies between predicted and observed phenotypes (phenoconversion) may occur due to drug–drug interactions caused by concomitant medications. We conducted a prospective, exploratory study to evaluate the risk of CYP2C19 phenoconversion in genotyped healthy volunteers exposed to CYP2C19 inhibitors. Three groups of volunteers were enrolled: CYP2C19 g‐RM, g‐NM, and g‐IM (g‐ for genetically predicted). All volunteers received as CYP2C19 phenotyping substrate 10 mg omeprazole (OME) alone at the control session and in co‐administration with CYP2C19 inhibitors: voriconazole 400 mg and fluvoxamine 50 mg in second and third study sessions, respectively. Phenoconversion occurred in over 80% of healthy volunteers, with variations among genotypic groups, revealing distinct proportions in response to fluvoxamine and voriconazole. Statistically significant differences were observed in mean metabolic ratios between CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers (g‐IMs) with *1/*2 and *2/*17 genotypes, with the *2/*17 group exhibiting lower ratios, and distinctions were noted between genotypic groups, emphasizing the impact of genetic variations on drug metabolism. When reclassified according to CYP2C19 baseline‐measured phenotype into p‐RM, p‐NM, and p‐IM (p‐ for measured phenotype), we observed 100% phenoconversion of p‐RMs and a significant phenotype switch in p‐NMs, p‐IMs, and p‐PMs after fluvoxamine and voriconazole, and complete phenoconversion of p‐IMs to p‐PMs on both inhibitors, emphasizing the impact of genetic variations on the vulnerability to CYP2C19 phenoconversion and the importance of considering both genotyping and phenotyping in predicting drug response.",

    "abstract": "In the relentless pursuit of optimizing drug development, the intricate process of determining the ideal dosage unfolds. This involves “dose‐finding” studies, crucial for providing insights into subsequent registration trials. However, the challenges intensify when tackling rare diseases. The complexity arises from poorly understood pathophysiologies, scarcity of appropriate animal models, and limited natural history understanding. The inherent heterogeneity, coupled with challenges in defining clinical end points, poses substantial challenges, hindering the utility of available data. The small affected population, low disease awareness, and restricted healthcare access compound the difficulty in conducting dose‐finding studies. This white paper delves into critical dose selection aspects, focusing on key therapeutic areas, such as oncology, neurology, hepatology, metabolic rare diseases. It also explores dose selection challenges posed by pediatric rare diseases as well as novel modalities, including enzyme replacement therapies, cell and gene therapies, and oligonucleotides. Several examples emphasize the pivotal role of clinical pharmacology in navigating the complexities associated with these diseases and emerging treatment modalities.",

    "abstract": "The integration of pharmacokinetic‐pharmacodynamic (PK‐PD) modeling and simulations with artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms is one of the most attractive areas of the pharmacometric research. These hybrid techniques are currently under investigation to perform several tasks, among which precision dosing. In this scenario, this paper presents and evaluates a new framework embedding PK‐PD models into a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, Q‐learning (QL), to personalize pharmacological treatment. Each patient is represented with a set of PK‐PD parameters and has a personal QL agent which optimizes the individual treatment. In the training phase, leveraging PK‐PD simulations, the QL agent assesses different actions, defined consistently with the clinical knowledge to consider only plausible dose‐adjustments, in order to find the optimal rules. The proposed framework was evaluated to optimize the erdafitinib treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a dose‐adaptive protocol based on monitoring the levels of serum phosphate, which represent a biomarker of both treatment efficacy and toxicity. To evaluate the flexibility of the methodology, a heterogeneous virtual population of 141 patients was generated using an erdafitinib population PK (PopPK)‐PD literature model. For each patient, treatment response was simulated by using both QL‐optimized protocol and the clinical one. QL agents outperform the approved dose‐adaptive rules, increasing more than 10% the efficacy and the safety of treatment at each end point. Results confirm the great potentialities of the integration of PopPK‐PD models and RL algorithms to optimize precision dosing tasks.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) involves measuring and interpreting drug concentrations in biological fluids to adjust drug dosages. In onco‐hematology, TDM guidelines for oral molecular targeted therapies (oMTTs) are varied. This study evaluates a quantitative approach with a score to predict the clinical usefulness of TDM for oMTTs. We identified key parameters for an oMTT's suitability for TDM from standard TDM recommendations. We gathered oMTT pharmacological data, which covered exposure variability (considering pharmacokinetic (PK) impact of food and proton pump inhibitors), technical intricacy (PK linearity and active metabolites), efficacy (exposure‐response relationship), and safety (maximum tolerated dose, and exposure‐safety relationship). To assess the validity and the relevance of the score and define relevant thresholds, we evaluated molecules with prospective validation or strong recommendations for TDM, both in oncology and in other fields. By September 1, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 67 oMTTs for onco‐hematological indications. Scores ranged from 15 (acalabrutinib) to 80 (sunitinib) with an average of 48.3 and a standard deviation of 15.6. Top scorers included sunitinib, sorafenib, cabozantinib, nilotinib, and abemaciclib. Based on scores, drugs were categorized into low (< 40), intermediate (≥ 40 and < 60), and high (≥ 60) relevance for TDM. Notably, negative controls generally scored around or under 40, whereas positive controls had a high score across different indications. In this work, we propose a quantitative and reproducible score to compare the potential usefulness of TDM for oMTTs. Future guidelines should prioritize the TDM for molecules with the highest score.",

    "abstract": "Tofacitinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of kinases with a high degree of selectivity within the human genome's set of protein kinases. Currently approved formulations for tofacitinib citrate are immediate‐release (IR) tablets, modified‐release (MR) tablets, and IR solution. A once daily MR microsphere formulation was developed for use in pediatric patients. Demonstration of bioequivalence (BE) between the 10 mg once daily (q.d.) MR microsphere formulation and 5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) IR solution is needed to enable the exposure–response analyses‐based bridging to support regulatory approval. To assess BE between MR microsphere and IR solution, an innovative approach was utilized with physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) virtual BE trials (VBE) in lieu of a clinical BE trial. A PBPK model was developed to characterize the absorption of different formulations of tofacitinib using Simcyp ADAM module. VBE trials were conducted by simulating PK profiles using the verified PBPK model and integrating the clinically observed intrasubject coefficient of variation (ICV) where BE was assessed with a predetermined sample size and prespecified criteria. The VBE trials demonstrated BE between IR solution 5 mg b.i.d. and MR microsphere 10 mg q.d. after a single dose on day 1 and after multiple doses on day 5. This research presents an innovative approach that incorporates clinically observed ICV in PBPK model‐based VBE trials, which could reduce unnecessary drug exposure to healthy volunteers and streamline new formulation development strategies.",

    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), the main non‐intoxicating compound in cannabis, has been hypothesized to reduce the adverse effects of Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive and analgesic component of cannabis. This clinical trial investigated the hypothesis that CBD counteracts the adverse effects of THC and thereby potentially improves the tolerability of cannabis as an analgesic. A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, five‐way cross‐over trial was performed in 37 healthy volunteers. On each visit, a double‐placebo, THC 9 mg with placebo CBD, or THC 9 mg with 10, 30, or 450 mg CBD was administered orally. Psychoactive and analgesic effects were quantified using standardized test batteries. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed. Data were analyzed using mixed‐effects model. Co‐administration of 450 mg CBD did not reduce, but instead significantly increased subjective, psychomotor, cognitive, and autonomous effects of THC (e.g., VAS “Feeling High” by 60.5% (95% CI: 12.7%, 128.5%, P < 0.01)), whereas THC effects with 10 and 30 mg CBD were not significantly different from THC alone. CBD did not significantly enhance THC analgesia at any dose level. Administration of 450 mg CBD significantly increased AUC last of THC (AUC last ratio: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.54, 3.08, P < 0.0001) and 11‐OH‐THC (AUC last ratio: 6.24, 95% CI: 4.27, 9.12, P < 0.0001) compared with THC alone, and 30 mg CBD significantly increased AUC last of 11‐OH‐THC (AUC last ratio: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.77, P = 0.0013), and of THC (AUC last ratio: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.04, P = 0.0446). Present findings do not support the use of CBD to reduce adverse effects of oral THC or enhance THC analgesia.",

The overarching goal of this PGx implementation program was to facilitate the sustainable adoption of genotype‐guided prescribing into routine clinical care. To accomplish this goal, we pursued the following specific objectives: (i) to integrate PGx testing into existing healthcare system processes; (ii) to implement drug–gene pairs with high‐level evidence and educate providers and pharmacists on established clinical management recommendations; (iii) to engage key stakeholders, including patients to optimize the return of results for PGx testing; (iv) to reduce health disparities through the targeted inclusion of underrepresented populations; (v) and to track third‐party reimbursement. This tutorial details our multifaceted PGx implementation program, including descriptions of our interventions, the critical challenges faced, and the major program successes. By describing our experience, we aim to assist other clinical teams in achieving sustainable PGx implementation in their health systems.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to assess the quantitative performance of endogenous drug–drug interaction (DDI) biomarkers ( N 1‐methylnicotinamide (1‐NMN), N 1‐methyladenosine (m 1 A), and creatinine) for the organic cation transporters, OCT2 and MATE1/2K in the kidney. Ten healthy volunteers received cimetidine (400 and 800 mg, single dose) or dolutegravir (50 mg, twice a day) together with metformin (500 mg). Cimetidine and dolutegravir were considered to act mainly as MATE1/2K and OCT2 inhibitors, respectively. The renal clearance (CL r ) of metformin was decreased by 15.5% and 42.5% by cimetidine 400 and 800 mg, and by 26.8% and 56.9% by dolutegravir first and fifth doses, respectively. CL r ratio (CL r R) of 1‐NMN were 0.93 and 0.64 for cimetidine 400 and 800 mg, and 0.87 and 0.47 for dolutegravir first and fifth doses, respectively. CL r R of m 1 A was less than that of 1‐NMN: 1.0 and 0.80 for cimetidine 400 and 800 mg, and 0.77 and 0.71 for dolutegravir first and fifth doses, respectively. CL r of creatinine was significantly decreased only by cimetidine 800 mg. Individual CL r R of 1‐NMN and m 1 A showed a positive correlation with the corresponding CL r R of metformin with r 2 of 0.58 and 0.55, respectively. When evaluated individually, m 1 A showed a better correlation during cimetidine periods ( r 2 0.64) than 1‐NMN ( r 2 0.36), but vice versa during dolutegravir periods ( r 2 1‐NMN, 0.80; m 1 A, 0.32). These results suggest that 1‐NMN and m 1 A might be more promising than creatinine as endogenous biomarkers for quantitatively assessing the DDI potential of investigational drugs for OCT2 and MATE1/2K based on their CL r R change.",

    "abstract": "Administration of a new drug candidate in a first‐in‐human (FIH) clinical trial is a particularly challenging phase in drug development and is especially true for immunomodulators, which are a diverse and complex class of drugs with a broad range of mechanisms of action and associated safety risks. Risk is generally greater for immunostimulators, in which safety concerns are associated with acute toxicity, compared to immunosuppressors, where the risks are related to chronic effects. Current methodologies for FIH dose selection for immunostimulators are focused primarily on identifying the minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL), which has often resulted in sub‐therapeutic doses, leading to long and costly escalation phases. The Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI) – Immuno‐Safety Technical Committee (ITC) organized a project to address this issue through two complementary approaches: (i) an industry survey on FIH dose selection strategies and (ii) detailed case studies for immunomodulators in oncology and non‐oncology indications. Key messages from the industry survey responses highlighted a preference toward more dynamic PK/PD approaches as in vitro assays are seemingly not representative of true physiological conditions for immunomodulators. These principles are highlighted in case studies. To address the above themes, we have proposed a revised decision tree, which expands on the guidance by the IQ MABEL Working Group (Leach et al . 2021). This approach facilitates a more refined recommendation of FIH dose selection for immunomodulators, allowing for a nuanced consideration of their mechanisms of action (MOAs) and the associated risk‐to‐benefit ratio, among other factors.",

One reason for this lack of advancement is the complexity of obtaining regulatory endorsement for those endpoints within current US regulatory pathways. The goal of our review is to describe the two choices currently available to pharmaceutical study Sponsors: (i) they may navigate the traditional route of compiling the evidence to support the sDHT‐derived endpoint in their investigational new drug (IND) application, requiring specific expertise and substantial resources; or (ii) they may navigate the drug development tool (DDT) pathway with the goal of qualifying their sDHT‐derived endpoint as a biomarker or clinical outcome assessment applicable to a broader context of use (COU), either alone or as part of a partnership or consortium. We describe the nuances of each pathway; the evidentiary requirements for supporting an sDHT‐derived endpoint and the technology used to capture it; and the impact that an sDHT's regulatory status may have on a Sponsor's decision to use it for data capture. By systematically comparing the IND and DDT pathways, our over‐arching goals are to support the increasing deployment of sDHTs within the clinical research setting and help advance regulatory science in the field of digital medicine.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of circadian clock genes greatly amplified the study of diurnal variations impacting cancer therapy, transforming it into a rapidly growing field of research. Especially, use of chronomodulated treatment with 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) has gained significance. Studies indicate high interindividual variability (IIV) in diurnal variations in dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity – a key enzyme for 5‐FU metabolism. However, the influence of individual DPD chronotypes on chronomodulated therapy remains unclear and warrants further investigation. To optimize precision dosing of chronomodulated 5‐FU, this study aims to: (i) build physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for 5‐FU, uracil, and their metabolites, (ii) assess the impact of diurnal variation on DPD activity, (iii) estimate individual DPD chronotypes, and (iv) personalize chronomodulated 5‐FU infusion rates based on a patient's DPD chronotype. Whole‐body PBPK models were developed with PK‐Sim (R) and MoBi (R) . Sinusoidal functions were used to incorporate variations in enzyme activity and chronomodulated infusion rates as well as to estimate individual DPD chronotypes from DPYD mRNA expression or DPD enzymatic activity. Four whole‐body PBPK models for 5‐FU, uracil, and their metabolites were established utilizing data from 41 5‐FU and 10 publicly available uracil studies. IIV in DPD chronotypes was assessed and personalized chronomodulated administrations were developed to achieve (i) comparable 5‐FU peak plasma concentrations, (ii) comparable 5‐FU exposure, and (iii) constant 5‐FU plasma levels via “noise cancellation” chronomodulated infusion. The developed PBPK models capture the extent of diurnal variations in DPD activity and can help investigate individualized chronomodulated 5‐FU therapy through testing alternative personalized dosing strategies.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant focus on China's new drug lag, but relevant research is limited. This study explores the reasons for drug lag by assessing the impact of reforms in China's drug review system, particularly focusing on the influence of clinical development strategies. This study selected drugs first launched in the United States between 2017 and 2022, examining absolute and relative lag between China and the first‐launch country (including submission and review lag). These delays with drugs approved in the European Union and Japan during the same period were compared with uncover the roots of delays in China, further identifying potential factors that could reduce these delays. The results indicate that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has a longer relative lag compared with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). The submission lag time of the NMPA significantly surpasses that of the EMA and PMDA, whereas the review lag time of the NMPA exceeds that of the PMDA but falls short of the EMA. Focusing on clinical trial strategies, bridging trials and multiregional clinical trials (MRCTs) are typically required by the NMPA in East Asia, resulting in longer clinical delay time. Whereas the EMA and PMDA primarily require international MRCTs in Europe and America, with a clinical delay of < 5 months. It is evident that there is a significant gap in clinical trial durations between China and other countries. Further optimization of clinical trial management is necessary to address the lag for new drugs in China.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic neutralization of Oncostatin M (OSM) causes mechanism‐driven anemia and thrombocytopenia, which narrows the therapeutic window complicating the selection of doses (and dosing intervals) that optimize efficacy and safety. We utilized clinical data from studies of an anti‐OSM monoclonal antibody (GSK2330811) in healthy volunteers ( n = 49) and systemic sclerosis patients ( n = 35), to quantitatively determine the link between OSM and alterations in red blood cell (RBC) and platelet production. Longitudinal changes in hematopoietic variables (including RBCs, reticulocytes, platelets, erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin) were linked in a physiology‐based model, to capture the long‐term effects and variability of therapeutic OSM neutralization on human hematopoiesis. Free serum OSM stimulated precursor cell production through sigmoidal relations, with higher maximum suppression (I max ) and OSM concentration for 50% suppression (IC 50 ) for platelets (89.1% [95% confidence interval: 83.4–93.0], 6.03 pg/mL [4.41–8.26]) than RBCs (57.0% [49.7–64.0], 2.93 pg/mL [2.55–3.36]). Reduction in hemoglobin and platelets increased erythro‐ and thrombopoietin, respectively, prompting reticulocytosis and (partially) alleviating OSM‐restricted hematopoiesis. The physiology‐based model was substantiated by preclinical data and utilized in exploration of once‐weekly or every other week dosing regimens. Predictions revealed an (for the indication) unacceptable occurrence of grade 2 (67% [58–76], 29% [20–38]) and grade 3 (17% [10–25], 3% [0–7]) anemias, with limited thrombocytopenia. Individual extent of RBC precursor modulation was moderately correlated to skin mRNA gene expression changes. The physiological basis and consideration of interplay among hematopoietic variables makes the model generalizable to other drug and nondrug scenarios, with adaptations for patient populations, diseases, and therapeutics that modulate hematopoiesis or exhibit risk of anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.",

    "abstract": "A recent industry perspective published in this journal describes the benefits received by drug companies from participation in the MIDD Pilot Program. Along with the primary objectives of supporting good decision‐making in drug development, there were substantial savings in time and development costs. Furthermore, many sponsors reported qualitative benefits such as new learnings and clarity on MIDD strategies and methodology that could be applied to other development programs. Based on the success of the Pilot Program, the FDA recently announced the continuation of the MIDD Paired Meeting Program as part of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA VII). In this report, we describe the collective experiences of industry participants in the MIDD Program to date, including all aspects of the process from meeting request submission to follow‐up actions. The purpose is to provide future participants with information to optimize the value of the MIDD Program.",

    "abstract": "Although platform trials have many benefits, the complexity of these designs may result not only in increased methodological but also regulatory and ethical challenges. These aspects were addressed as part of the IMI project EU Patient‐Centric Clinical Trial Platforms (EU‐PEARL). We reviewed the available guidelines on platform trials in the European Union and the United States. This is supported and complemented by feedback received from regulatory interactions with the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration. Throughout the project we collected the needs of all relevant stakeholders including ethics committees, regulators, and health technology assessment bodies through active dialog and dedicated stakeholder workshops. Furthermore, we focused on methodological aspects and where applicable identified the corresponding guidance. Learnings from the guideline review, regulatory interactions, and workshops are provided. Based on these, a master protocol template was developed. Issues that still need harmonization or clarification in guidelines or where further methodological research is needed are also presented. These include questions around clinical trial submissions in Europe, the need for multiplicity control across the whole master protocol, the use of non‐concurrent controls, and the impact of different randomization schemes. Master protocols are an efficient and patient‐centered clinical trial design that can expedite drug development. However, they can also introduce additional operational and regulatory complexities. It is important to understand the different requirements of stakeholders upfront and address them in the trial. While relevant guidance is increasing, early dialog with relevant stakeholders can help to further support such designs.",

This study aimed to quantitatively interpret the drug–drug interactions (DDIs) of MTX mediated by drug transporters using physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. An open‐label, randomized, 4‐treatment, 6‐sequence, 4‐period crossover study was conducted to investigate the effects of rifampicin (RFP), an inhibitor of organic anionic transporting peptides (OATP) 1B1/3, and febuxostat (FBX), an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), on the pharmacokinetics of MTX in healthy volunteers. PBPK models of MTX, RFP, and FBX were developed based on in vitro and in vivo data, and the performance of the simulation results for final PBPK models was validated in a clinical study. In the clinical study, when MTX was co‐administered with RFP or FBX, systemic exposure of MTX increased by 33% and 17%, respectively, compared with that when MTX was administered alone. When MTX was co‐administered with RFP and FBX, systemic exposure increased by 52% compared with that when MTX was administered alone. The final PBPK model showed a good prediction performance for the observed clinical data. The PBPK model of MTX was well developed in this study and can be used as a potential mechanistic model to predict and evaluate drug transporter‐mediated DDIs of MTX with other drugs.",

    "abstract": "Everybody deserves access to evidence‐based information to make decisions about their health. However, in many situations, clinical trial eligibility criteria mean that specific data do not exist for certain groups of individuals. These include pregnant and breastfeeding women, children, older people, those with hepatic and renal dysfunction, those with acute severe illness, and those with multiple co‐morbidities and interacting medications. Resultantly, there may not be specific drug‐dosing information for many patients who are treated in a clinical setting. The ASCPT2024 Dolores Shockley Lecture focused on the equitable access to research with a specific focus on clinical pharmacology studies in pregnancy and breastfeeding. To ensure the safe, effective use of medication in pregnancy and breastfeeding, women should be included in clinical trials and pharmacokinetic studies when a medication is anticipated to be used in women of childbearing potential. Community groups should be involved at all stages of research to maintain transparency and trust. This ensures that local priorities are investigated, that communities understand the findings and are empowered to make evidence‐based decisions about their own medication use. Principles informing the design of such studies in pregnancy and lactation are in existence. Mathematical techniques such as physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic modeling and stochastic simulation and estimation can enhance study design, and population pharmacokinetic modeling be used to understand variability within and between individuals. Data should be made findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Information (and where necessary, training) regarding the use of these approaches should be provided to decision‐making stakeholders such as ethics committees and regulatory bodies.",

    "abstract": "Data from phase IIb/III and phase III studies were used to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of risankizumab and its exposure–response relationships for efficacy and safety in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. A two‐compartment model with first‐order absorption and elimination accurately described risankizumab pharmacokinetics. Although certain covariates, namely, body weight, serum albumin, fecal calprotectin, sex, corticosteroid use, advanced therapy inadequate response, and pancolitis, were statistically correlated with risankizumab clearance, their impact on exposure was not clinically meaningful for efficacy or safety. Phase II exposure–response analyses demonstrated that the 1,200 mg intravenous (IV) induction dose at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 achieved near maximal response for all efficacy end points, with suboptimal efficacy from the 600 mg and little added benefit from the 1,800 mg regimens, justifying 1,200 mg IV as the induction dose in the phase III study. Phase III exposure–response analyses for efficacy during induction showed statistically significant exposure–response relationships at Week 12 following 1,200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8, in line with phase IIb results. Exposure–response analyses for maintenance demonstrated modest improvement in Week 52 efficacy when increasing the subcutaneous dose from 180 mg to 360 mg with largely overlapping confidence intervals. Exposure–response analyses for safety indicated no apparent exposure‐dependent safety events over the induction or maintenance treatment. Based on these results, the recommended dosing regimen for risankizumab in UC patients is 1,200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by 180 mg or 360 mg subcutaneously at Week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter.",

    "abstract": "Sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto) has proven therapeutic effects in heart failure (HF) patients, but its impact on those with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains unclear, particularly in HF patients with coexisting end‐stage renal disease (ESRD). This study aims to assess the long‐term survival of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and coexisting ESRD treated with sacubitril/valsartan. A retrospective cohort study included 2,860 HFrEF and ESRD patients between January 2008 and December 2020. After propensity score matching, data from a sacubitril/valsartan group ( n = 61) and a candesartan or valsartan group ( n = 117) were analyzed. Patients on sacubitril/valsartan for at least 9 months had significantly lower 5‐year all‐cause mortality (39.3%) compared with the non‐sacubitril/valsartan group (54.7%) (HR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25–0.82; P = 0.0094). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improvement after 3 years in the sacubitril/valsartan group (14.51 ±18.98) was significantly greater than the non‐sacubitril/valsartan group (6.91 ±18.44) ( P = 0.0408). Average hospitalizations in sacubitril/valsartan and non‐sacubitril/valsartan groups were 1.39 and 0.97, respectively (incidence rate ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.90–2.82; P = 0.1106). Sacubitril/valsartan treatment demonstrated significantly lower 5‐year mortality rates and greater LVEF improvement in HFrEF patients with coexisting ESRD compared with candesartan or valsartan. These findings suggest that sacubitril/valsartan is a beneficial treatment option for this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Aging‐related alterations in hepatic enzyme activity, particularly of the CYP3A, significantly impact drug efficacy and safety in older adults, making it essential to understand how aging affects CYP function for optimal drug therapy. The exogenous probe substrate method, a minimally invasive approach to assess liver metabolic enzyme activity in vivo , is effective in studying these changes. Amlodipine being extensively metabolized (> 90%) in the liver, primarily via cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A was selected as a probe to investigate and quantify the factors affecting the aging‐related changes of CYP3A in the Chinese older population. Amlodipine concentration data were collected from an ongoing noninterventional clinical study conducted at Peking University Third Hospital. A physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic modeling approach, grounded in population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis, was employed to physiologically quantify the aging‐related changes in CYP3A function. A total of 132 amlodipine concentrations from 69 patients were obtained from the clinical study. PPK analysis shows that frailty phenotype but not age is a significant influence and frail patients have 37% greater plasma amlodipine exposure than nonfrail patients. This difference in CYP3A function may be attributed to a 63.2% lower CYP3A relative abundance in the frail patients, compared with that in the nonfrail patients. In the context of dose selection for older adults, focusing on frailty rather than chronological age should be recognized as a more relevant approach, because frailty might more accurately reflect the individual's biological age. Our study suggested a need to shift the research focus from chronological age to biological age.",

    "abstract": "There is an unmet need for safe and efficacious oral therapies for COVID‐19 with low potential for drug–drug interactions. Obeldesivir is an orally administered nucleoside prodrug that has shown antiviral potency in nonclinical studies against SARS‐CoV‐2 and its circulating variants. Obeldesivir is metabolized to the active nucleoside triphosphate (GS‐443902), which acts as an inhibitor of the SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting viral RNA synthesis. Here, we report the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics from a first‐in‐human, randomized, placebo‐controlled, phase I study following oral administration of obeldesivir and a phase I, open‐label absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion study following oral administration of [ 14 C]‐obeldesivir. Overall, obeldesivir was safe and well tolerated at single and multiple doses between 100 and 1,600 mg, with low potential for QT prolongation as assessed by QT‐concentration analysis. The exposures to GS‐441524 increased dose proportionally in the 100–900‐mg dose range. GS‐441524 accumulated by 35% after twice‐daily and 12% after once‐daily dosing for 5 days. Dose‐proportional increases in the intracellular concentration of GS‐443902 were also observed in peripheral blood mononuclar cells. Plasma exposure of GS‐441524 was not significantly altered by food intake. Following oral administration of [ 14 C]‐obeldesivir (500 mg; 100 μCi), the mean cumulative [ 14 C]‐dose recovery was 90.7% with 58.5% in urine and 32.2% in feces. GS‐441524 was the predominant plasma component (90% of 14 C‐area under the concentration–time curve) and was primarily eliminated via renal excretion. Collectively, data from these studies support selection of the obeldesivir 350 mg twice‐daily dosing regimen for further evaluation in phase III studies for COVID‐19.",

    "abstract": "Psychedelics have recently re‐emerged as potential treatments for various psychiatric conditions that impose major public health costs and for which current treatment options have limited efficacy. At the same time, personalized medicine is increasingly being implemented in psychiatry to provide individualized drug dosing recommendations based on genetics. This review brings together these topics to explore the utility of pharmacogenomics (a key component of personalized medicine) in psychedelic‐assisted therapies. We summarized the literature and explored the potential implications of genetic variability on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of psychedelic drugs including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, N,N ‐dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5‐methoxy‐ N,N ‐dimethyltryptamine (5‐MeO‐DMT), ibogaine and 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Although existing evidence is limited, particularly concerning pharmacodynamics, studies investigating pharmacokinetics indicate that genetic variants in drug‐metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, impact the intensity of acute psychedelic effects for LSD and ibogaine, and that a dose reduction for CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may be appropriate. Furthermore, based on the preclinical evidence, it can be hypothesized that CYP2D6 metabolizer status might contribute to altered acute psychedelic experiences with 5‐MeO‐DMT and psilocybin when combined with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. In conclusion, considering early evidence that genetic factors can influence the effects of certain psychedelics, we suggest that pharmacogenomic testing should be further investigated in clinical research. This is necessary to evaluate its utility in improving the safety and therapeutic profile of psychedelic therapies and a potential future role in personalizing psychedelic‐assisted therapies, should these treatments become available.",

Its enantiomer, esketamine ((S)‐ketamine), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EMA for patients with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) in 2019. The number of approved indications for ketamine and esketamine continues to increase, as well as the number of clinical trials. This analysis provides a quantitative overview of the use of ketamine and its enantiomers in clinical trials during 2014–2024. A total of 363 trials were manually assessed from clinicaltrial.gov with the search term “Ketamine.” The highest number of trials were found for the FDA‐approved indications: anesthesia (~22%) and pain management (~28%) for ketamine and TRD for esketamine (~29%). Clinical trials on TRD for both ketamine and esketamine also comprised a large proportion of these trials, and interestingly, have reached phase III and phase IV status. Combinatorial treatment of psychiatric disorders and non‐psychiatric conditions with pharmacological and non‐pharmacological combinations (electroconvulsive therapy, psychotherapeutic techniques, virtual reality, and transcranial magnetic stimulation) is prevalent. Sub‐anesthetic doses of ketamine may represent novel therapeutic avenues in neuropsychiatric conditions, that is, major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, where glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress are likely to be involved. The study suggests that the number of ketamine studies will continue to grow and possible ketamine variants can be approved for treatment of additional indications.",

    "abstract": "Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a Trop‐2‐directed antibody‐drug conjugate, is approved for patients with metastatic triple‐negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who received ≥2 prior systemic therapies (≥1 in metastatic setting). Exposure–response (E‐R) relationships between SG exposure and efficacy and safety outcomes were characterized in 277 patients with mTNBC using data from the phase I/II IMMU‐132‐01 and phase III ASCENT (IMMU‐132‐05) studies. Evaluated endpoints included complete response (CR), objective response rate (ORR), progression‐free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety endpoints (individual first worst grade of select adverse events (AEs)). E‐R analyses were also conducted for time to first dose reduction or delay. Patients received SG at 8 or 10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 21‐day cycle. Average SG‐related serum exposure over the treatment duration (until the event) was consistently the most significant exposure metric correlated with efficacy and safety endpoints. Higher average concentration over the treatment duration for SG (CAVG SG ) was the best predictor of CR and ORR. The model‐predicted proportions of patients with CR and ORR at 10 mg/kg were 4.26% and 32.6%, respectively. Higher CAVG for total antibody was the best predictor of OS and PFS. The model‐predicted probability of OS at 12 months at median lactate dehydrogenase (227 IU/L) was 53%. The probability of grade ≥1 evaluated AEs and the risk of dose reductions and delays significantly increased with increasing CAVG SG . The model‐predicted proportions of patients with any‐grade AEs were 35.9%, 67.4%, 64.7%, and 67.1% for vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and neutropenia, respectively (10 mg/kg dose group). Neutropenia was the only evaluated AE for which CAVG SG was significantly associated with grade ≥3 events. The clinically meaningful efficacy and manageable safety achieved with SG 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of every 21‐day cycle dosing regimen supports the appropriateness of this clinical dosage in patients with mTNBC.",

    "abstract": "Intravenous or subcutaneous routes of administration (ROAs) are common dosing routes for therapeutic proteins. Eleven therapeutic proteins with approval for one ROA have subsequently received approval for a second ROA. The clinical programs supporting the second ROA consistently leveraged data from the first ROA and included studies that characterized the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of the drug administered by the new ROA to identify an appropriate dosage regimen. The selected dosing regimen was then further evaluated in clinical trials designed with various primary end points. All programs implemented model‐informed drug development approaches to ensure that the selected regimens would achieve comparable systemic exposures (PK‐based bridging) or pharmacodynamic (PD) responses (PD‐based bridging) as the reference ROA. To support the approval of a second ROA, these programs either demonstrated noninferiority in PK, PD, and/or clinical end points for the second ROA, or established efficacy and safety through a comparison to a placebo treatment. The accumulative examples showed that clinical trials which provided the primary evidence to support approvals of the second ROA generally demonstrated noninferiority in the systemic exposures regardless of being specified as an end point or not in the study protocols. The experience to date supports the use of PK‐ and PD‐based bridging approaches not only in the selection of dosing regimens for a second ROA to be tested in clinical studies, but also for providing evidence of effectiveness to support approval, when appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Approved and emerging siRNA therapeutics are primarily designed for targeted delivery to liver where the therapeutic gene silencing effects occurs. Impairment of hepatic/renal function and its impact on siRNA pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PKs/PDs) are yet to be mechanistically evaluated to describe the unanticipated clinical observations for this novel modality. We developed pathophysiologically relevant models for organ impairment within a physiologically‐based PK‐PD (PBPK‐PD) modeling framework focusing on modality‐specific mechanistic factors to evaluate impact on siRNA PKs and PDs. PBPK‐PD models for two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved siRNAs inclisiran and vutrisiran were developed as case studies leveraging available tissue‐specific data and translated to humans. Key determinants of the clinical PK and PD of N‐acetylgalactosamine conjugated siRNAs (GalNAc‐siRNAs) with varying sequences were also identified to inform effective clinical translation strategies for emerging GalNAc‐siRNA candidates. A 30–70% reduction in hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptors concentrations still allowed for sufficient amount of free cytoplasmic siRNA for RISC‐loading to produce PD effects comparable in extent and duration to normal liver function. This included severe hepatic impairment for which no clinical data are available. Inclusion of other modality agnostic physiological changes relevant to organ impairment did not alter the findings. Changes in renal physiologies, including changes in GFR across various degrees of impairment, well predicted minimal changes in PD for inclisiran and vutrisiran. This work provides a quantitative mechanistic framework and insights on modality‐specific factors that drive clinical translation and patient/disease‐related factors that impact specific dosing considerations and clinical outcomes to help accelerate the optimal development of siRNA therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the first‐line pharmacologic treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Many patients experience side effects that are difficult to predict, are associated with significant morbidity, and can lead to treatment discontinuation. Variation in SSRI pharmacokinetics could explain differences in treatment outcomes, but this is often overlooked as a contributing factor to SSRI tolerability. This study evaluated data from 288 escitalopram‐treated and 255 sertraline‐treated patients ≤ 18 years old to develop machine learning models to predict side effects using electronic health record data and Bayesian estimated pharmacokinetic parameters. Trained on a combined cohort of escitalopram‐ and sertraline‐treated patients, a penalized logistic regression model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66–0.88), with 0.69 sensitivity (95% CI: 0.54–0.86), and 0.82 specificity (95% CI: 0.72–0.87). Medication exposure, clearance, and time since the last dose increase were among the top features. Individual escitalopram and sertraline models yielded an AUROC of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65–0.81) and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55–0.73), respectively. Post hoc analysis showed sertraline‐treated patients with activation side effects had slower clearance ( P = 0.01), which attenuated after accounting for age ( P = 0.055). These findings raise the possibility that a machine learning approach leveraging pharmacokinetic data can predict escitalopram‐ and sertraline‐related side effects. Clinicians may consider differences in medication pharmacokinetics, especially during dose titration and as opposed to relying on dose, when managing side effects. With further validation, application of this model to predict side effects may enhance SSRI precision dosing strategies in youth.",

In this study, we determined whether low‐volume sampling devices produce pharmacokinetic (PK) data comparable to conventional venipuncture for a diverse set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small molecules. We adopted an open‐label, non‐randomized, parallel‐group, single‐site study design, with four cohorts of 10 healthy subjects per arm. The study drugs, doses, and routes of administration included: crenezumab (15 mg/kg, intravenous infusion), etrolizumab (210 mg, subcutaneous), GDC‐X (oral), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, 200 mg, oral). Samples were collected after administration of a single dose of each drug using conventional venipuncture and three low‐volume capillary devices: TassoOne Plus for liquid blood, Tasso‐M20 for dry blood, both applied to the arm, and Neoteryx Mitra® for dry blood obtained from fingertips. Serum/plasma concentrations from venipuncture and TassoOne Plus samples overlapped and PK parameters were comparable for all drugs, except HCQ. After applying a baseline hematocrit value, the dry blood concentrations and PK parameters for the two monoclonal antibodies were comparable to those obtained from venipuncture. For the two small molecules, two bridging strategies were evaluated for converting dry blood concentrations to equivalent plasma concentrations. A baseline hematocrit correction and/or linear regression‐based correction was effective for GDC‐X, but not for HCQ. Additionally, the study evaluated the bioanalytical data quality and comparability from the various collection methods, as well as patient preference for the devices.",

We conducted a dog telemetry study to assess the effects on QTc of six reference compounds (five positive and one negative) previously evaluated by Darpo et al. (2015) in humans. The sensitivity of the assay to detect QTc increases was determined, and exposure–response analysis was performed, as done in clinical practice. By‐timepoint analysis showed QTc prolongation induced by moxifloxacin, dofetilide, dolasetron, ondansetron, and quinine within human relevant plasma exposures ranges. Moreover, a hysteresis was observed for quinine. As expected, levocetirizine showed no statistically significant effect on QTc across a range of exposure, well exceeding the therapeutic C max . Power analyses confirmed the study ability to detect statistically significant QTc changes of less than 10 milliseconds with 80% probability, even with a sample size as low as n = 4 animals. Finally, concentration‐QTc modeling enabled to predict the minimal plasma concentration needed to detect a 10 milliseconds QTc prolongation, including for quinine. The comparison with clinical available data supported the relevance of dogs under these experimental conditions as a robust translational predictor of drug‐induced QTc prolongation in humans as a key pillar of the integrated risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degraders (TPDs), an emerging therapeutic modality, are attracting considerable interest with the promise to address disease‐related proteins that are not druggable with conventional small molecule inhibitors. Despite their novel mechanism of action, the PK/PD relationship of degraders is still approached with a mindset deeply rooted in inhibitor drugs. Here, we establish how predictive mechanistic modeling specifically tailored to TPDs can significantly enhance the value of the available information during lead generation and optimization. By integrating the results from in vitro assays with routinely collected PK data, modeling accurately predicts degradation in vivo . These predictions transform the prioritization of compounds for in vivo studies as well as the selection of optimal dose schedules and most informative measurement time points with the least number of animals. Moreover, the comprehensive modeling framework (1) identifies the PK/PD driver of targeted protein degradation and subsequent downstream pharmacodynamic effects, and (2) uncovers the fundamental difference between degrader and inhibitor PK/PD relationships. The practical utility of our predictive modeling is demonstrated with relevant use cases. This framework will allow researchers to transition from current, mostly serendipity‐based approaches to more sound model‐informed decision making. Going forward, the presented predictive PK/PD modeling framework lays out a rational path to incorporate inter‐species differences in the pharmacology and thus promises to help with getting the dose right in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Precision dosing strategies require accounting for between‐patient variability in pharmacokinetics (PK), affecting drug exposure, and in pharmacodynamics (PD), affecting response achieved at the same drug concentration at the site of action. Although liquid biopsy for assessing different levels of molecular drug targets has yet to be established, individual characterization of drug elimination pathways using liquid biopsy has recently been demonstrated. The feasibility of applying this approach in conjunction with modeling tools to guide individual dosing remains unexplored. In this study, we aimed to individualize physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models based on liquid biopsy measurements in plasma from 25 donors with different grades of renal function who were previously administered oral midazolam as part of a microdose cocktail. Virtual twin models were constructed based on demographics, renal function, and hepatic expression of relevant pharmacokinetic pathways projected from liquid biopsy output. Simulated exposure (AUC) to midazolam was in agreement with observed data (AFE = 1.38, AAFE = 1.78). Simulated AUC variability with three dosing approaches indicated higher variability with uniform dosing (14‐fold) and stratified dosing (13‐fold) compared with individualized dosing informed by liquid biopsy (fivefold). Further, exosome screening revealed mRNA expression of 532 targets relevant to drug metabolism and disposition (169 enzymes and 361 transporters). Data related to these targets can be used to further individualize PBPK models for pathways relevant to PK of other drugs. This study provides additional verification of liquid biopsy‐informed PBPK modeling approaches, necessary to advance strategies that seek to achieve precise dosing from the start of treatment.",

Single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies assessed pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of vadadustat in healthy volunteers. A single‐dose, open‐label study was conducted in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 not on dialysis. In the SAD study, 48 healthy adult men ( n = 8/cohort) received single doses of vadadustat (80–1,200 mg) or placebo. In the MAD study, 34 healthy adult men ( n = 8–9/cohort) received daily vadadustat (500–900 mg) or placebo for 10 days. In the single‐dose CKD study, 22 male and female patients with CKD (stage 3: n = 10; stage 4: n = 12) received single doses of vadadustat (500 mg). PK parameters included plasma vadadustat; PD biomarkers were measured, including erythropoietin (EPO) levels, reticulocytes, and others. Plasma vadadustat peaked 3–4 hours after single or multiple dosing in healthy volunteers, with a mean t 1/2 of approximately 4.5 hours. In patients with CKD, plasma vadadustat peaked at 5–6 hours, with a mean t 1/2 of 7.2 (stage 3) and 8.5 (stage 4) hours. Vadadustat AUC ∞ and C max increased dose proportionally in SAD and MAD trials. In all trials, EPO concentrations increased in a dose‐related manner and returned approximately to baseline by 24 hours. Adverse events were mild and considered not study drug related.

Maximizing the use of all available data and information about the drug enables a more robust characterization of the risk–benefit profile and reduces uncertainty in both technical and regulatory success. This offers the potential to transform rare diseases drug development, where conducting large well‐controlled clinical trials is impractical and/or unethical due to a small patient population, a significant portion of which could be children. Additionally, the totality of evidence generated by model‐informed approaches can provide confirmatory evidence for regulatory approval without the need for additional clinical data. In the article, applications of novel quantitative approaches such as quantitative systems pharmacology, disease progression modeling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, modeling of real‐world data using model‐based meta‐analysis and strategies such as external control and patient‐reported outcomes as well as clinical trial simulations to optimize trials and sample collection are discussed. Specific case studies of these modeling approaches in rare diseases are provided to showcase applications in drug development and regulatory review. Finally, perspectives are shared on the future state of these modeling approaches in rare diseases drug development along with challenges and opportunities for incorporating such tools in the rational development of drug products.",

Earlier studies show that concluding on RMM effectiveness is challenging. The aim of this study was to describe reported limitations associated with RMM effectiveness assessments of industry‐sponsored PASS that did not render a conclusion. We conducted a thematic analysis of study limitations extracted from assessment reports and study reports finalized by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee between 2018 and 2021. In 39 (61.0%) of the PASS a conclusion on RMM effectiveness was drawn, where 25 (39.0%) PASS was inconclusive. Most PASS had a cross‐sectional design with surveys as primary data sources (73.4% and 65.6% respectively). Four main themes emerged: (i) survey‐specific limitations, (ii) limitations specifically related to secondary use of data, (iii) general limitations related to study design, and (iv) limitations not related to study design. In general, frequently reported limitations were survey‐related, such as selection bias or information bias. Interestingly, well‐known study limitations related to secondary use of data such as missing or misclassification of data were more often presented in inconclusive compared with conclusive PASS. Given that about 40% of PASS did not allow a conclusion on RMM effectiveness, our results suggest prioritization for strategies to mitigate limitations related to the secondary use of data at the protocol stage, for example, through feasibility assessments. Although many databases may have incomplete registration of some variables, feasibility testing prior to conducting a PASS could contribute to meeting study objectives and concluding on RMM effectiveness.",

We introduce a novel kinetics‐machine learning (kML) model that integrates baseline markers, tumor kinetics, and four on‐treatment simple blood markers (albumin, C‐reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and neutrophils). Developed for immune‐checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in non‐small cell lung cancer on three phase II trials (533 patients), kML was validated on the two arms of a phase III trial (ICI and chemotherapy, 377 and 354 patients). It outperformed the current state‐of‐the‐art for individual predictions with a test set C‐index of 0.790, 12‐months survival accuracy of 78.7% and hazard ratio of 25.2 (95% CI: 10.4–61.3, P < 0.0001) to identify long‐term survivors. Critically, kML predicted the success of the phase III trial using only 25 weeks of on‐study data (predicted HR = 0.814 (0.64–0.994) vs. final study HR = 0.778 (0.65–0.931)).

    "abstract": "Copanlisib is an intravenously administered phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, which is approved as monotherapy for relapsed follicular lymphoma in adult patients who have received at least two systemic therapies. In an April 2022 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC), the benefit–risk profile of the class PI3K inhibitors were scrutinized for use in hematological malignancies. Specifically, their unique toxicities may contribute to the high incidences in reported serious and high‐grade treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), thereby reducing their overall tolerability and potentially limiting their successful use. These tolerability concerns may be contributed by or compounded by inadequate dose optimization. The recommended dosing regimen of copanlisib 60 mg administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28‐day cycle was selected as the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) during phase I. Thus, this analysis sought to justify the copanlisib dose regimen selection. Copanlisib exposure‐efficacy relationships were considered from its large phase III trial, CHRONOS‐3, whereas copanlisib safety was investigated by pooling data across its two large clinical trials to comprehensively assess its exposure‐safety relationships. Results demonstrated a statistically significant positive linear exposure‐efficacy relationship at the MTD. Exposure‐safety analyses revealed a borderline significant linear relationship for grade ≥3 TEAEs and no significant exposure‐safety relationships for other investigated safety end points. The model‐based benefit/risk framework considered the established exposure‐response models and defined clinical utility function which confirmed the appropriateness of the copanlisib dosing regimen across the range of its achieved exposures.",

The current understanding on the impact of HMWs is mainly based on in vitro and nonclinical studies and there are only limited data available associating differences in HMWs in marketed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to clinical outcomes. Biosimilars offer a unique opportunity to study the potential association between quality parameters and clinical outcomes. We performed a retrospective evaluation to investigate the association between HMW content and reported antidrug‐antibody (ADA) incidence in 30 full‐length biosimilar mAbs approved in the European Union and the United States. Information for HMW content and ADA incidence were collected from publicly available sources. Differences in HMW content between biosimilars and their reference products (RPs) ranged from −0.75 to 1.65% with slightly higher differences observed in antineoplastic products as compared with immunosuppressant products. The difference in the ADA incidence between the RP and the biosimilar for the programs studied ranged from −11.0 to 18.5%. No association was observed between differences in HMW content and reported ADA incidence, in neither phase I nor phase III studies. Our results show that the limited differences in the content of HMWs between marketed biosimilars and reference mAbs were not associated with differences in reported immunogenicity, determined as incidence of ADAs and neutralizing ADAs in comparative clinical studies.",

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the risk of UTIs among patients who initiated SGLT‐2i treatment while taking OAB drugs. This population‐based cohort study included new‐users of SGLT‐2i or comparator antidiabetics (dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor (DPP‐4i); glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA)) with OAB drugs between 2014 and 2020 using claim data from Korea. Primary outcome was a composite UTI event composite end point comprising pyelonephritis, cystitis, and urethritis, using both inpatient and outpatient diagnoses. Propensity score fine stratification was used to adjust for potential confounding factors. Weighted hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model. In the first cohort, 796 and 9,181 new‐users of SGLT‐2i and DPP‐4i with OAB drugs were identified, respectively. This study found a similar risk of UTIs in concomitant users of SGLT‐2i and DPP‐4i (weighted HR 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 0.88–1.32) with OAB drugs. In the second cohort, 2,387 and 280 new‐users of SGLT‐2i and GLP‐1RA with OAB drugs were identified, respectively. Initiation of SGLT‐2i while on OAB treatment was not associated with increased risk of UTI (0.89, 0.50–1.60), compared with initiation of GLP‐1RA. These results show that the concomitant use of SGLT‐2i with OAB drugs was not associated with an increased risk of UTI compared with the concomitant use of DPP‐4i or GLP‐1RA with OAB drugs.",

Although a growing body of evidence has documented increasing use of DHTs in clinical trials overall, the use of DHTs in clinical trials supporting medical product development is unclear; here, we quantify the use of DHTs in clinical trials sponsored by pharmaceutical and medical device firms. Despite interest from pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers in DHTs, we find tepid uptake of DHTs in trials by these sponsor types over time. Further, to date, these sponsors have most frequently used conventional, hardware‐based technologies that have been available for many years (e.g., Holter monitors and glucose meters) rather than newer activity monitors, mobile apps, and other online‐based tools that are frequently used by non‐industry sponsors. Considering the recent and evolving nature of regulatory guidance around DHT use in clinical trials, our findings suggest that organizations pursuing product development still appear hesitant to incorporate DHTs in trials that provide the most critical evidence for regulatory review and impact how new products are used. This suggests there are likely additional opportunities for sponsors of regulated trials to incorporate (more) DHTs and patient‐centric endpoints into product development clinical trials. However, additional regulatory clarity and efforts to reduce operational barriers may be needed in order to more fully capture these opportunities.",

Here, we analyze the static models of DDGI from in vivo data and focus on the concept of phenoconversion to model inhibition and genetic polymorphisms jointly. These models are applicable to datasets where pharmacokinetic information is missing and are being used in clinical support systems and consensus dose adjustment guidelines. We show that all such models can be handled by the same formal framework, and that models that differ at first sight are all versions of the same linear phenoconversion model. This model includes the linear pharmacogenetic and inhibition models as special cases. We highlight present challenges in this endeavor and the open issues for future research in developing DDGI models for recommendation systems.",

    "abstract": "Daprodustat is the first oral hypoxia‐inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor approved recently for the treatment of anemia caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults receiving dialysis. We evaluated the role of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B‐mediated hepatic uptake transport in the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of daprodustat using in vitro and in vivo studies, and physiologically‐based PK (PBPK) modeling of its drug–drug interactions (DDIs) with inhibitor drugs. In vitro , daprodustat showed specific transport by OATP1B1/1B3 in the transfected cell systems and primary human and monkey hepatocytes. A single‐dose oral rifampin (OATP1B inhibitor) reduced daprodustat intravenous clearance by a notable 9.9 ± 1.2‐fold ( P < 0.05) in cynomolgus monkeys. Correspondingly, volume of distribution at steady‐state was also reduced by 5.0 ± 1.1‐fold, whereas the half‐life change was minimal (1.5‐fold), corroborating daprodustat hepatic uptake inhibition by rifampin. A PBPK model accounting for OATP1B‐CYP2C8 interplay was developed, which well described daprodustat PK and DDIs with gemfibrozil (CYP2C8 and OATP1B inhibitor) and trimethoprim (weak CYP2C8 inhibitor) within 25% error of the observed data in healthy subjects. About 18‐fold increase in daprodustat area under the curve (AUC) following gemfibrozil treatment was found to be associated with strong CYP2C8 inhibition and moderate OATP1B inhibition. Moreover, PK modulation in hepatic dysfunction and subjects with CKD, in comparison to healthy control, was well‐captured by the model. CYP2C8 and/or OATP1B inhibitor drugs (e.g., gemfibrozil, clopidogrel, rifampin, and cyclosporine) were predicted to perpetrate moderate‐to‐strong DDIs in healthy subjects, as well as, in target CKD population. Daprodustat can be used as a sensitive CYP2C8 index substrate in the absence of OATP1B modulation.",

Their use is accompanied by exaggerated immune responses related to T‐cell activation and cytokine elevations leading to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in some patients, which can be potentially life‐threatening. However, systematic evaluation of the risk of CRS with BCMA‐targeting BsAb and CAR‐T therapies, and comparisons across different routes of BsAb administration (intravenous (i.v.) vs. subcutaneous (s.c.)) have not previously been conducted. This study utilized a meta‐analysis approach to compare the CRS profile in BCMA‐targeting CAR‐T vs. BsAb immunotherapies administered either i.v. or s.c. in patients with RRMM. A total of 36 studies including 1,560 patients with RRMM treated with BCMA‐targeting CAR‐T and BsAb therapies were included in the analysis. The current analysis suggests that compared with BsAbs, CAR‐T therapies were associated with higher CRS incidences (88% vs. 59%), higher rates of grade ≥ 3 CRS (7% vs. 2%), longer CRS duration (5 vs. 2 days), and more prevalent tocilizumab use (44% vs. 25%). The proportion of CRS grade ≥ 3 may also be lower (0% vs. 4%) for BsAb therapies administered via the s.c. (3 studies, n = 311) vs. i.v. (5 studies, n = 338) route. This meta‐analysis suggests that different types of BCMA‐targeting immunotherapies and administration routes could result in a range of CRS incidence and severity that should be considered while evaluating the benefit–risk profiles of these therapies.",

    "abstract": "Tamoxifen is part of the standard of care of endocrine therapy for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. However, survival outcomes with tamoxifen are highly variable. The concentration of endoxifen, the 30–100 times more potent metabolite of tamoxifen and bioactivated by the CYP2D6 enzyme, has been described as the most relevant metabolite of tamoxifen metabolism. A genome‐wide association study (GWAS) was performed with the objective to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with endoxifen serum concentration levels and clinical outcome in early‐stage breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen. A GWAS was conducted in 608 women of the CYPTAM study (NTR1509/PMID: 30120701). Germline DNA and clinical and survival characteristics were readily available. Genotyping was performed on Infinium Global Screening Array (686,082 markers) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) imputation by using 1000 Genomes. Relapse‐free survival during tamoxifen (RFSt) was defined the primary clinical outcome. Endoxifen serum concentration was analyzed as a continuous variable. Several genetic variants reached genome‐wide significance ( P value: ≤5 × 10 −8 ). Endoxifen concentrations analysis identified 430 variants, located in TCF20 and WBP2NL genes (chromosome 22), which are in strong linkage disequilibrium with CYP2D6 variants. In the RFSt analysis, several SNP were identified ( LPP gene: rs77693286, HR 18.3, 95% CI: 15.2–21.1; rs6790761, OR 18.2, 95% CI: 15.5–21.1). Endoxifen concentrations have a strong association with the chromosome 22, which contains the CYP2D6 gene.",

    "abstract": "Long‐acting cabotegravir has been studied mainly in the stringent framework of clinical trials, which does not necessarily reflect the situation of people with HIV (PWH) in routine clinical settings. The present population pharmacokinetic analysis aims to build real‐world reference percentile curves of cabotegravir concentrations, accounting for patient‐related factors that may affect cabotegravir exposure. The second objective is to simulate whether dosing interval adjustments of cabotegravir could be considered in specific subpopulations. Overall, 238 PWH contributed to 1,038 cabotegravir levels (186 during the initial oral administration phase and 852 after intramuscular injection). Cabotegravir pharmacokinetics was best described using a one‐compartment model with distinct first order‐absorption for oral and intramuscular administrations, and identical volume and clearance. Our model showed almost 40% faster absorption and 30% higher clearance than previously reported, resulting in a time to steady‐state of 8 months and an elimination half‐life of 4.6 weeks for long‐acting cabotegravir. Sex and body mass index significantly influenced absorption, and bodyweight affected clearance. Model‐based simulations showed that cabotegravir trough concentrations in females were 25% lower 4 weeks after the intramuscular loading dose, but 42% higher during the late maintenance phase. Finally, simulations indicated that in females, despite significantly higher cabotegravir concentrations, longer intervals between injections may not consistently ensure levels above the 4‐fold protein‐adjusted 90% inhibitory target concentration.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac safety regulatory guidance for drug development has undergone several monumental shifts over the past decade as technological advancements, analysis models and study best practices have transformed this landscape. Once, clinical proarrhythmic risk assessment of a new chemical entity (NCE) was nearly exclusively evaluated in a dedicated thorough QT (TQT) study. However, since the introduction of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E14/S7B Q&A 5.1 and 6.1 TQT substitutions, drug developers are offered an alternative pathway to evaluate proarrhythmic risk during an ascending dose study in healthy volunteers or during a powered patient study, respectively. In addition, the findings as well as the manner in which nonclinical studies are conducted (i.e., utilizing best practices) can dictate the need for a positive control in the clinical study and/or affect the labeling outcome. Drug sponsors are now faced with the option of pursuing a dedicated TQT study or requesting a TQT substitution. Potential factors influencing the choice of pathway include the NCE mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic properties, and safety profile, as well as business considerations. This tutorial will highlight the regulatory framework for integrated arrhythmia risk prediction models to outline drug safety, delineate potential reasons why a TQT substitution request may be rejected and discuss when a standalone TQT is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Levothyroxine is one of the most prescribed drugs in the western world. Dosing is challenging due to high‐interindividual differences in effective dosage and the narrow therapeutic window. Model‐informed precision dosing (MIPD) using machine learning could assist general practitioners (GPs), but no such models exist for primary care. Furthermore, introduction of decision‐support algorithms in healthcare is limited due to the substantial gap between developers and clinicians' perspectives. We report the development, validation, and a clinical simulation trial of the first MIPD application for primary care. Stable maintenance dosage of levothyroxine was the model target. The multiclass model generates predictions for individual patients, for different dosing classes. Random forest was trained and tested on a national primary care database ( n = 19,004) with a final weighted AUC across dosing options of 0.71, even in subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH, fT4, weight, and age were most predictive. To assess the safety, feasibility, and clinical impact of MIPD for levothyroxine, we performed clinical simulation studies in GPs and compared MIPD to traditional prescription. Fifty‐one GPs selected starting dosages for 20 primary hypothyroidism cases without and then with MIPD 2 weeks later. Overdosage and underdosage were defined as higher and lower than 12.5 μg relative to stable maintenance dosage. MIPD decreased overdosage in number (30.5 to 23.9%, P < 0.01) and magnitude (median 50 to 37.5 μg, P < 0.01) and increased optimal starting dosages (18.3 to 30.2%, P < 0.01). GPs considered lab results more often with MIPD and most would use the model frequently. This study demonstrates the clinical relevance, safety, and effectiveness of MIPD for levothyroxine in primary care.",

The percentage of approvals for a biomarker‐defined population was numerically higher in accelerated approvals in comparison to regular approvals, that is, 48% vs. 40%. From 2011–2016 to 2017–2023, there was an increasing number of approvals with biomarker‐defined populations in lung and breast cancers, serving as the primary driver for the overall increase in the percentage of approvals for biomarker‐defined populations in solid tumors relative to hematological malignancies. Over the years, approvals were incorporating a more diverse collection of distinct biomarkers, from 3 in 2011 to 16 in 2022. Overall, HER2, hormone receptor (HR), EGFR, ALK, BRAF, and PD‐L1‐defined populations received the highest numbers of approvals. The FDA decision on approving a biomarker‐defined or an all‐comers population may depend on a number of factors and may evolve over time based on emerging evidence. The review discusses selected FDA approvals where a pivotal trial enrolled an all‐comers population but the approved indication was restricted to a biomarker‐defined population, as well as challenges in clinical trial design in the context of precision medicine. The prominent role of biomarkers in optimizing trial design and identifying a population most likely to benefit from treatment underlines the significance of a comprehensive understanding of disease biology and drug mechanisms. Our review illustrates that biomarker‐driven approaches enhance the likelihood of identifying optimal patient populations, potentially streamlining trials through accelerated approval pathways for cancer drug development.",

    "abstract": "Bispecific T‐cell engagers (bsTCEs) have emerged as a promising class of cancer immunotherapy. BsTCEs enable physical connections between T cells and tumor cells to enhance T‐cell activity against cancer. Despite several marketing approvals, the development of bsTCEs remains challenging, especially at early clinical translational stages. The intricate design of bsTCEs makes their pharmacologic effects and safety profiles highly dependent on patient's immunological and tumor conditions. Such context‐dependent pharmacology introduces considerable uncertainty into translational efforts. In this study, we developed a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) model, through context unification, that can facilitate the translation of bsTCEs preclinical data into clinical activity. Through characterizing the formation dynamics of immunological synapse (IS) induced by bsTCEs, this model unifies a broad range of contexts related to target affinity, tumor characteristics, and immunological conditions. After rigorous calibration using both experimental and clinical data, the model enables consistent translation of drug potency observed under diverse experimental conditions into predictable exposure–response relationships in patients. Moreover, the model can help identify optimal target‐binding affinities and minimum efficacious concentrations across different clinical contexts. This QSP approach holds significant promise for the future development of bsTCEs.",

    "abstract": "This article summarizes the lessons learned from the COCKTAIL study: an open, three‐armed, single‐center study including patients with obesity scheduled for treatment with Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or nonsurgical calorie restriction, and a normal‐ to overweight control group. The clinical implications of the results from multiple peer‐reviewed articles describing the effects of RYGB, severe caloric restriction, weight loss, and type 2 diabetes on the in vivo activity and protein expression of drug‐metabolizing enzymes (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A) and transporters (DMETs; organic anion‐transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp)) are discussed in the perspective of three clinically relevant questions: (1) How should clinicians get the dose right in patients after RYGB? (2) Will drug disposition in patients with obesity be normalized after successful weight loss? (3) Are dose adjustments needed according to obesity and diabetes status? Overall, RYGB seems to have a lower impact on drug disposition than previously assumed, but clinicians should pay close attention to drugs with a narrow therapeutic range or where a high maximum drug concentration may be problematic. Whether obesity‐related alterations of DMETs normalize with substantial weight loss depends on the DMET in question. Obesity and diabetes downregulate the in vivo activity of CYP2C19 and CYP3A (only obesity) but whether substrate drugs should be dose adjusted is also dependent on other factors that influence clearance, that is, liver blood flow and protein binding. Finally, we recommend frequent and individualized follow‐up due to high inter‐ and intraindividual variability in these patients, particularly following RYGB.",

    "abstract": "Hydrocodone, tramadol, codeine, and oxycodone are commonly prescribed opioids that rely on activation by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). CYP2D6 inhibitors can significantly decrease CYP2D6 activity, leading to reduced generation of active metabolites, and impairing pain control. To understand this impact, we assessed emergency department (ED) visits in patients initiating these CYP2D6‐dependent opioids while on CYP2D6‐inhibitor antidepressants vs. antidepressants that do not inhibit CYP2D6. This retrospective cohort study included adult patients prescribed CYP2D6‐dependent opioids utilizing electronic health records data from the University of Florida Health (2015–2021). The association between ED visits and inhibitor exposure was tested using multivariable logistic regression. The primary analysis had 12,118 patients (72% female; mean (SD) age, 55 (13.4)) in the hydrocodone/tramadol/codeine cohort and 5,547 patients (64% female; mean (SD) age, 53.6 (14.2)) in the oxycodone cohort. Hydrocodone/tramadol/codeine‐treated patients exposed to CYP2D6‐inhibitor antidepressants ( n = 7,043) had a higher crude rate of pain‐related ED visits than those taking other antidepressants ( n = 5,075) (3.28% vs. 1.87%), with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.75 (95% CI: 1.36 to 2.24). Similarly, in the oxycodone cohort, CYP2D6‐inhibitor antidepressant‐exposed individuals ( n = 3,206) had a higher crude rate of ED visits than individuals exposed to other antidepressants ( n = 2,341) (5.02% vs. 3.37%), with aOR of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.27–2.27). Similar findings were observed in secondary and sensitivity analyses. Our findings suggest patients with concomitant use of hydrocodone/tramadol/codeine or oxycodone and CYP2D6 inhibitors have more frequent ED visits for pain, which may be due to inadequate pain control.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab is a major treatment for recurrent or advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, data on its use and pharmacokinetics (PK) in older patients are limited. This open‐label, multicenter, observational study evaluated real‐world data on the safety, efficacy, and PK of pembrolizumab in older patients with NSCLC. In 99 patients aged ≥75 years, PK was determined by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry on pretreatment samples. Performance status (PS), geriatric assessment (GA), overall response rate (ORR), progression‐free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. The median age was 78 (75–87) years. PS was 2–3 in 14 patients. The median ORR, PFS, and OS were 47.5%, 8.0, and 20.5 months, respectively. Although PK and ORR were not significantly associated, patients with the lowest Cycle 1‐trough quartile (Q1) experienced poorer PFS (Q1 vs. Q2–4; 3.4 vs. 11.8 months, P = 0.006) and OS (Q1 vs. Q2–4; 9.9 vs. 21.7 months, P = 0.005) than in other quartiles overall, and even in the PD‐L1 ≥50% subset (PFS, Q1 vs. Q2–4; 4.1 vs. 14.7 months, P = 0.005; OS, Q1 vs. Q2–4; 9.4 vs. 22.1 months, P = 0.010). The Q1 subgroup was characterized by poor PS and lower albumin, and more frequent “weight loss ≥ 10%” on the GA. Pembrolizumab therapy had similar PK and efficaciousness in older as well as younger patients. In patients with PS ≥2, low albumin, and vulnerable GA, early increases in PK levels are less likely, potentially diminishing efficacy even when PD‐L1 ≥50%.",

Estimation of GFR without a race variable via the CKD‐EPI Scr 2021 equation is now recommended. We examined the impact of using the CKD‐EPI Scr 2021 vs. 2009 equation on the ABCD‐GENE score for post‐PCI patients. A total of 4335 adult patients ( n = 925 Black) who underwent PCI and CYP2C19 genotyping were included, with GFR estimated for each patient via the CKD‐EPI Scr 2021 and CKD‐EPI 2009 equations. The ABCD‐GENE score, calculated based on each GFR estimation, was compared. With the CKD‐EPI Scr 2021 vs. 2009 equation, median (IQR) eGFR was lower (74 [55–94] vs. 81 [60–103] mL/min/1.73 m 2 , P < 0.001), and CKD prevalence was higher (31% vs. 25%, P < 0.001) among Black patients, whereas eGFR was higher (85 [65–99] vs. 80 [61–94] mL/min/1.73m 2 , P < 0.001), and CKD prevalence was lower (20% vs. 24%, P < 0.001) in non‐Black patients. This led to 12 (1%) Black patients being reclassified from low to high risk of poor clopidogrel response and 30 (1%) non‐Black patients being recategorized from high to low risk ( P < 0.001 for both comparisons). Removal of the race variable from GFR estimation significantly impacted the prediction of clopidogrel effectiveness via the ABCD‐GENE score.",

    "abstract": "Riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ) has been proposed as a biomarker for breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) activity. In recent studies in mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans, BCRP‐inhibiting drugs increased the plasma concentration of riboflavin. We showed recently that ticagrelor inhibits BCRP and raises the plasma concentrations of the BCRP substrate rosuvastatin in healthy volunteers. In the same drug–drug interaction study, we now investigated whether ticagrelor affects the plasma concentrations of riboflavin. Intake of 90 mg ticagrelor increased the ratio between the peak plasma riboflavin concentration and the fasting riboflavin concentration before ticagrelor administration by 1.20‐fold (90% confidence interval, 1.10–1.32; P = 0.006) compared to placebo. In vitro , riboflavin was transported by BCRP and multidrug‐resistance‐associated protein 4 (MRP4) but no clear transport was observed by MRP2, MRP3, or the P‐glycoprotein. Moreover, ticagrelor inhibited the transport of riboflavin in BCRP‐ and MRP4‐expressing membrane vesicles with unbound 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.020 and 1.1 μM, respectively. Based on vesicle and tissue protein expression data, the small intestinal MRP4‐mediated efflux clearance of riboflavin (1.2–1.4 nL/min/mg) was estimated to be similar to that mediated by BCRP (0.23–1.3 nL/min/mg). As MRP4 is expressed in the basolateral membrane of enterocytes, it may facilitate the absorption of riboflavin and impair the utility of riboflavin as a biomarker of intestinal BCRP. To conclude, ticagrelor modestly raises the plasma concentration of riboflavin probably by inhibiting intestinal BCRP. Inhibition of intestinal MRP4 may have reduced the absorption of riboflavin and limited the effect of ticagrelor on riboflavin levels.",

For women who take mifepristone and then do not take misoprostol, which is the second component of the medical abortion regimen, it is possible that their pregnancy may continue to live birth. Since mifepristone is commonly used for medical abortion up to 9–10 weeks gestation, any adverse or teratogenic effects on the developing embryo/fetus must be considered, given exposure during the critical time of its development and organogenesis. Toxicology and teratology reports have cited studies demonstrating teratogenic effect of mifepristone in some animals. Current clinical guidelines for women exposed to mifepristone in the first trimester of pregnancy state that it is not known to be teratogenic based on limited published evidence from humans. The aim of this narrative systematic review was to investigate embryonic/fetal exposure to mifepristone and any association with congenital or fetal anomalies. This study was conducted by systematic searches of health databases from inception to February 2024. The references of relevant citations were manually searched to retrieve any additional citations not captured in database searching. Congenital anomalies and adverse outcomes were encountered at various doses of mifepristone exposure. A number of the congenital anomalies encountered in this review were explained by circumstances other than exposure to mifepristone. The present systematic review did not find data to support mifepristone being implicated as a teratogen.",

    "abstract": "Optimized dosages provide a secure foundation for the development of well‐tolerated and effective oncology drugs. Project Optimus, an initiative within the Oncology Center of Excellence, strives to reform the dosage optimization and dosage selection paradigm in oncology. This initiative stems from the availability of targeted drugs and from the demand for more tolerable dosages from patients, caregivers, and advocates. Reforming dosage optimization for oncology drugs requires a paradigm shift from the one employed for cytotoxic chemotherapy to one that understands and considers the unique attributes of targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and cellular therapy. Limited characterization of dosage during drug development may result in (1) patients not staying on a therapy long‐term due to poor tolerability, (2) failure to establish positive benefit–risk in clinical trials for regulatory approval (3) withdrawal of drugs from the market (4) removal of indications of drugs from the market. Timely access to drugs is important for all patients with cancer, so it is vital to iteratively analyze all nonclinical and clinically relevant data at each stage of development and leverage quantitative approaches, innovative trial designs, and regulatory support to arrive at dosages with favorable benefit–risk. This review highlights the key challenges and opportunities to embracing this new paradigm and realizing the full potential of new oncology therapies.",

    "abstract": "Cedirogant is an inverse agonist of retinoic acid‐related orphan receptor gamma thymus developed for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Cedirogant induces cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 while inhibiting P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, and OATP1B3 in vitro . Static drug–drug interactions (DDIs) predictions suggested possible clinical induction of CYP3A4, and inhibition of P‐gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1, leading to challenges in interpreting DDI studies between cedirogant and substrates of CYP3A, P‐gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1/3. Here the effects of cedirogant on the pharmacokinetics of two statin drugs were investigated in healthy participants. Coproporphyrin‐I (CP‐I), a selective endogenous OATP1B biomarker, was used to assess the impact of cedirogant on OATP1B. Cedirogant (375 mg once daily) increased rosuvastatin maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) and area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC tau ) by 141% and 55%, respectively when co‐administered, whereas atorvastatin C max increased by 40% with no effect on its AUC tau compared with administration of rosuvastatin/atorvastatin alone. Cedirogant did not increase CP‐I exposures, indicating no clinical OATP1B inhibition. The increased rosuvastatin exposure and minimal change in atorvastatin exposure with co‐administration of cedirogant is attributed to BCRP inhibition and interplay between P‐gp/BCRP inhibition and CYP3A induction, respectively. Correlation analysis with data from two investigational drugs (glecaprevir and flubentylosin) demonstrated that OATP1B1 R ‐value of > 1.5 and [ C max, u ]/[OATP1B1 IC 50 ] of > 0.1 are associated with > 1.25‐fold increase in CP‐I C max ratio. This demonstrates the utility of CP‐I in disentangling mechanisms underlying a complex DDI involving multiple transporters and enzymes and proposes refined criteria for static OATP1B inhibition predictions.",

Yet, its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood. This study aimed to unravel the effect of colchicine on monocyte and neutrophil phenotype and function. A randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled cross‐over intervention study was executed in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. In neutrophils, colchicine treatment decreased CD62L expression and NGAL release upon ex vivo stimulation and increased PMA‐induced ROS production. The effects of colchicine on monocytes were limited to a decrease in HLA‐DR expression in the intermediate and nonclassical monocytes. Also, on the level of RNA expression, colchicine did not affect monocyte phenotype, while affecting various immunomodulating genes in neutrophils. Overall, our study suggests that treatment with colchicine affects neutrophil function, particularly by reducing neutrophil recruitment, lowering concentrations of NGAL, and changing the expression of various genes with immunomodulatory potential, whereas the effect on monocytes is limited.",

Endogenous biomarkers could be used to improve risk prediction of such renal DDIs. While a number of biomarkers for renal DDIs have been described so far, multiple criteria for valid biomarkers have frequently not been investigated, for example, specificity, metabolism, or food effects. Therefore, there is a need for novel biomarkers of renal DDIs. Here, we investigated the global metabolomic effects following the administration of two classical inhibitors of renal transport proteins [cimetidine (OCT2/MATEs), probenecid (OATs)] in human plasma and urine of healthy volunteers. Additionally, we investigated metabolomic effects of two inhibitors of other transporters [verapamil (P‐glycoprotein), rifampin (organic anion transporting polypeptides)] as controls. This analysis shows that both cimetidine and probenecid affect compounds involved in caffeine metabolism, carnitines, and sulfates. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the effects of all four inhibitors on endogenous compounds identified multiple promising new sensitive and specific biomarker candidates for OCT2/MATE‐ or OAT‐mediated DDIs. For OCT2/MATEs, 5‐amino valeric acid betaine (median log 2 ‐fold change of estimated renal elimination: −3.62) presented itself as a promising candidate. For OATs, estimated renal elimination of 7‐methyluric acid and cinnamoylglycine (median log 2 ‐fold changes −3.10 and −1.92, respectively) was both sensitive and specific. This study provides comprehensive information on metabolomic effects of transport protein inhibition in humans and identifies putative new sensitive and specific biomarkers for renal transporter‐mediated DDIs.",

    "abstract": "Ketamine provides the highest safety profile among sedatives for procedural sedation and analgesia in the pediatric emergency setting. However, it can cause vomiting and recovery agitation. No studies have examined epigenetic factors, such as microRNAs, for predicting the occurrence of these adverse events. Neuronal‐derived extracellular vesicle microRNA profiles were studied to predict the occurrence of ketamine‐induced vomiting and recovery agitation in children. For this aim, a single‐center prospective pharmacoepigenetic study was performed and 50 children who underwent procedural sedation with intravenous ketamine as the only sedative drug were enrolled between October 2019 and November 2022. MiRNA profiling in plasma neural‐derived extracellular vesicles was analyzed through next‐generation sequencing and measured before treatment with ketamine. Twenty‐two patients experienced vomiting or recovery agitation. Among the 16 differentially expressed microRNAs, the upregulated miR‐15a‐5p and miR‐484 targeted genes related to N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity, including glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2A (GRIN2A). Preliminary data confirmed lower GRIN2A levels in patients who developed these events. Downregulated miR‐126‐3p and miR‐24‐3p targeted AMPA receptor‐associated genes. Functional analyses of gene targets revealed the enrichment of glutamatergic and neurotrophins signaling. Recovery agitation was associated with this network. Vomiting was related to dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. Three miRNAs (miR‐18a‐3p, miR‐484, and miR‐548az‐5p) were identified as predictive biomarkers (AUC 0.814; 95% CI: 0.632–0.956) for ketamine‐induced vomiting and recovery agitation. MicroRNA profiles can predict the development of ketamine‐induced vomiting or recovery agitation in children. This study contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying ketamine‐induced adverse events.",

    "abstract": "T‐cell‐engaging bispecific antibodies (TCEs) that target tumor antigens and T cells have shown great promise in treating cancer, particularly in hematological indications. The clinical development of TCEs often involves a lengthy first‐in‐human (FIH) trial with many dose‐escalation cohorts leading up to an early proof of concept (POC), enabling either a no‐go decision or dose selection for further clinical development. Multiple factors related to the target, product, disease, and patient population influence the efficacy and safety of TCEs. The intricate mechanism of action limits the translatability of preclinical models to the clinic, thereby posing challenges to streamline clinical development. In addition, unlike traditional chemotherapy, the top dose and recommended phase II doses (RP2Ds) for TCEs in the clinic are often not guided by the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), but rather based on the integrated dose–response assessment of the benefit/risk profile. These uncertainties pose complex challenges for translational and clinical pharmacologists (PK/PD scientists), as well as clinicians, to design an efficient clinical study that guides development. To that end, experts in the field, under the umbrella of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, have reviewed learnings from published literature and currently marketed products to share perspectives on the FIH and clinical pharmacology strategies to support early clinical development of TCEs.",

This research supports the approved intravenous clinical dose regimen, summarizing the exposure–response relationships for clinical safety and efficacy. A population pharmacokinetic model and E max logistic regression exposure–response models for safety and efficacy were developed using data from 439 patients with relapsed/refractory non‐Hodgkin lymphoma and 159 patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, respectively, from a Phase I/II study (NCT02500407). Data from 0.2 to 60 mg across fixed dosing (Cohort A) and Cycle 1 step‐up dosing (Cohort B) were used. Exposure–response models, using two‐cycle area‐under‐the‐concentration curve (AUC 0–42 ) as the primary exposure endpoint, accurately depicted the complete response and objective response rate data across a 600‐fold AUC 0–42 range. The approved clinical dose regimen of 1/2/60/30 mg achieved near‐maximal efficacy, with model‐estimated CR and ORR (90% confidence interval) of 63.1% (49.7–75.0) and 79.1% (69.1–87.7), respectively. The exposure–response analysis for Grade ≥ 2 cytokine release syndrome identified receptor occupancy (%) within the first two cycles as a driver, with CRS dissipating beyond the first dosing cycle. No exposure‐dependent increases were observed for other serious adverse events, including neutropenia and infections. The approved intravenous step‐up dose regimen (i.e., step doses of 1 and 2 mg on Day 1 and 8, respectively) mitigated severe CRS risk, allowing safe administration of loading (60 mg) and target doses (30 mg every 3 weeks) to achieve a favorable benefit–risk profile.",

    "abstract": "Saroglitazar magnesium, a dual PPAR α/γ agonist, currently in Phase III for treating primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), was evaluated for its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, safety, and pharmacodynamics in participants with cholestatic liver disease (CLD) across different levels of hepatic impairment (HI) and participants with severe renal impairment (RI). Three PK studies comparing saroglitazar with healthy controls were conducted: Study 1 involved daily oral doses of 1 or 2 mg for 4 weeks in 12 PBC cirrhosis participants with mild or moderate HI; Study 2 assessed single‐dose PK (2 or 4 mg) in eight non‐cirrhotic CLD participants; Study 3 evaluated single‐dose PK (2 mg) in eight participants with severe RI. On day 1, saroglitazar exposure increased by 14.6–42% in mild HI vs. normal, but by day 28, levels were similar, indicating no accumulation. In moderate HI, exposure was significantly increased by 50.4–85% on days 1 and 28, with 34–46% lower clearance despite a similar half‐life. The moderate HI group had a 59% higher exposure than the non‐cirrhotic group. Saroglitazar (1 and 2 mg) reduced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels by 17–40% after 4 weeks in participants with abnormal baseline ALP. Single‐dose PK in non‐cirrhotic CLD (2 and 4 mg) and severe RI (2 mg) was comparable to matched controls without significant safety issues. Overall, saroglitazar (1 and 2 mg) was safe and well‐tolerated in cholestatic cirrhosis with mild HI and participants with severe RI without major PK changes. Moderate HI increased exposure and decreased clearance without any safety concerns.",

    "abstract": "Degenerative cerebellar ataxias comprise a heterogeneous group of rare and ultra‐rare genetic diseases. While disease‐modifying treatments are now on the horizon for many ataxias, robust trial designs and analysis methods are lacking. To better inform trial designs, we applied item response theory (IRT) modeling to evaluate the natural history progression of several ataxias, assessed with the widely used scale for assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA). A longitudinal IRT model was built utilizing real‐world data from the large autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA) registry. Disease progression was evaluated for the overall cohort as well as for the 10 most common ARCA genotypes. Sample sizes were calculated for simulated trials with autosomal recessive spastic ataxia Charlevoix–Saguenay (ARSACS) and polymerase gamma (POLG) ataxia, as showcased, across multiple design and analysis scenarios. Longitudinal IRT models were able to describe the changes in the latent variable underlying SARA as a function of time since ataxia onset for both the overall ARCA cohort and the common genotypes. The typical progression rates varied across genotypes between relatively high in POLG (~ 0.98 SARA points/year at SARA = 20) and very low in COQ8A ataxia (~ 0.003 SARA points/year at SARA = 20). Smaller trial sizes were required in case of faster progression, longer trials (~ 75–90% less with 5 years vs. 2 years), and larger drug effects (~ 70–80% less with 100% vs. 50% inhibition). Simulating under the developed IRT model, the longitudinal IRT model had the highest power, with a well‐controlled type I error, compared to total score models or end‐of‐treatment analyses. The established longitudinal IRT framework allows efficient utilization of natural history data and ultimately facilitates the design and analysis of treatment trials in rare and ultra‐rare genetic ataxias.",

    "abstract": "The abundance of drug metabolic enzymes (DMEs) and transporters (DTs) in the human gastrointestinal tract significantly affects xenobiotic exposure in the circulating system, the basis of these compounds acting on humans. However, accurately predicting individual exposure in healthy subjects remains challenging due to limited data on protein levels throughout the gastrointestinal tract within the same individuals and inadequate assessment of factors influencing these levels. Therefore, we conducted a clinical study to obtain biopsy samples from 8 different gastrointestinal segments in 24 healthy Chinese volunteers. Concurrently, blood and fecal samples were collected for genotypic analysis and fecal microbiota metagenomic sequencing. Using an optimized LC–MS/MS method, we quantified the absolute protein abundance of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, P‐gp, and BCRP from the stomach to the colon. Our results revealed significant regional differences in protein expression: CYP3A4 was the most abundant in the small intestine, whereas CYP2C9 was predominantly found in the colon. CYP2D6 was primarily located in the ileum, while other DMEs/DTs showed higher concentrations in the jejunum. Meanwhile, the enzyme abundance in the small intestine and colon and the relative ratio of transporters in different regions to the jejunum were accurately calculated, providing valuable data for refining the physiological parameters in the virtual gastrointestinal tract of Chinese healthy population in PBBMs. Additionally, BMI, IBW, sex, age, genotype, and fecal microbiota were identified as critical factors influencing the protein levels of these DMEs/DTs throughout the gastrointestinal tract, with notable regional differences. Consequently, this study provides a unique foundation for understanding xenobiotic absorption in humans.",

    "abstract": "One in six Americans uses cannabidiol‐based or cannabis‐derived products. Cannabidiol is a substrate of CYP3A, but its role as a potential CYP3A inhibitor remains unclear. We hypothesized that cannabidiol would inhibit CYP3A‐mediated metabolism of tacrolimus. This report is an interim analysis of an open‐label, three‐period, fixed‐sequence, crossover study in healthy participants. Participants first received a single dose of tacrolimus 5 mg orally. After washout, participants later received cannabidiol titrated to 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days to reach a steady state, followed by a second single dose of tacrolimus 5 mg orally. Tacrolimus concentrations in whole blood were measured by UHPLC–MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. Twelve participants completed all periods of the study. The maximum concentration ( C max ) of tacrolimus increased 4.2‐fold ( P < 0.0001) with cannabidiol (40.2 ± 13.5 ng/mL) compared with without cannabidiol (9.85 ± 4.63 ng/mL). The area under the concentration‐vs.‐time curve (AUC 0‐∞ ) increased 3.1‐fold ( P < 0.0001). No change in half‐life ( t 1/2 ) was observed. This study demonstrates that cannabidiol increases tacrolimus exposure. Our data suggest the need for dose reduction in tacrolimus and frequent therapeutic dose monitoring in transplant patients taking cannabidiol concomitantly. Whether this observed interaction occurred due to the inhibition of CYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5 in the liver, intestine, or both, or intestinal drug transporters (e.g., p‐glycoprotein) during the first‐pass elimination remains to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disease caused by deficient lysosomal glycogen degradation, and includes both late‐onset (LOPD) and severe infantile‐onset (IOPD) phenotypes. Due to very small patient numbers in IOPD and the high phenotypic heterogeneity observed in this population, a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP)‐based “digital twin” approach was developed to perform an in silico comparison of the efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa vs. the standard of care, in a virtual population of IOPD patients. A QSP model was developed that represents key elements of Pompe disease pathophysiology, including tissue glycogen accumulation and the elevation of the biomarker urine Hex4 in both LOPD and IOPD patients. In this approach, the QSP model was used to generate digital twins of each IOPD patient enrolled in the avalglucosidase alfa clinical program, considering their respective disease burden, demographics, and treatment history. This virtual cohort supplemented clinical observations by simulating and comparing tissue glycogen and urine Hex4 following avalglucosidase alfa treatment vs. the standard of care. The digital twin analysis supports the interpretation that the enhanced reduction in urine Hex4 observed following avalglucosidase alfa treatment is attributable to greater tissue glycogen clearance. Overall, this study provides mechanism‐based insight into avalglucosidase alfa efficacy across the phenotypic spectrum of Pompe disease and demonstrates the value of applying a QSP‐based digital twin analysis to support rare disease drug development.",

The work presented here aimed to evaluate MarzAA and SoC treatment of bleeding events on a standardized four‐point efficacy scale (poor, fair, good, and excellent). Two continuous‐time Markov modeling approaches were explored; a four‐state model analyzing all four categories of bleeding improvement and a two‐state model analyzing a binarized outcome (treatment failure (poor/fair), and treatment success (good/excellent)). Different covariates impacting improvement of bleeding episodes as well as a putative relationship between MarzAA exposure and improvement of bleeding episodes were evaluated. In the final four‐state model, higher baseline diastolic blood pressure and higher age (> 33 years of age) were found to negatively and positively impact improvement of bleeding condition, respectively. Bleeding events occurring in knees and ankles were found to improve faster than bleeding events at other locations. The covariate effects had most impact on early treatment success (≤ 3 hours) whereas at later timepoints (> 12 hours), treatment success was similar for all patients indicating that these covariates might be clinically relevant for early treatment response. A statistically significant relationship between MarzAA zero‐order absorption and improvement of bleedings ( P < 0.05) were identified albeit with low precision. No statistically significant difference in treatment response between MarzAA and intravenous SoC was identified, indicating the potential of MarzAA for treatment of episodic bleeding events with a favorable subcutaneous administration route.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to improve upon a published population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for venlafaxine (VEN) in the treatment of depression in older adults, then investigate whether CYP2D6 metabolizer status affected model‐estimated PK parameters of VEN and its active metabolite O‐desmethylvenlafaxine. The model included 325 participants from a clinical trial in which older adults with depression were treated with open‐label VEN (maximum 300 mg/day) for 12 weeks and plasma levels of VEN and O‐desmethylvenlafaxine were assessed at weeks 4 and 12. We fitted a nonlinear mixed‐effect PK model using NONMEM to estimate PK parameters for VEN and O‐desmethylvenlafaxine adjusted for CYP2D6 metabolizer status and age. At both lower doses (up to 150 mg/day) and higher doses (up to 300 mg/day), CYP2D6 metabolizers impacted PK model‐estimated VEN clearance, VEN exposure, and active moiety (VEN + O‐desmethylvenlafaxine) exposure. Specifically, compared with CYP2D6 normal metabolizers, (i) CYP2D6 ultra‐rapid metabolizers had higher VEN clearance; (ii) CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers had lower VEN clearance; (iii) CYP2D6 poor metabolizers had lower VEN clearance, higher VEN exposure, and higher active moiety exposure. Overall, our study showed that including a pharmacogenetic factor in a population PK model could increase model fit, and this improved model demonstrated how CYP2D6 metabolizer status affected VEN‐related PK parameters, highlighting the importance of genetic factors in personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairments, common sequelae of acquired brain injury (ABI), significantly affect rehabilitation and quality of life. Currently, there is no solid evidence‐base for pharmacotherapy to improve cognitive functioning after ABI, nevertheless off‐label use is widely applied in clinical practice. This meta‐analysis and meta‐regression aims to quantitatively aggregate the available evidence for the effects of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of cognitive impairments following ABI. We conducted a comprehensive search of Embase, Medline Ovid, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases for randomized controlled and crossover trials. Meta‐analytic effects were calculated for each pharmaceutical agent and targeted neuromodulator system. Cognitive outcome measures were aggregated across cognitive domains. Of 8,216 articles, 41 studies (4,434 patients) were included. The noradrenergic agent methylphenidate showed a small, significant positive effect on cognitive functioning in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI; k = 14, d = 0.34, 95% confidence interval: 0.12–0.56, P = 0.003). Specifically, methylphenidate was found to improve cognitive functions related to executive memory, baseline speed, inhibitory control, and variability in responding. The cholinergic drug donepezil demonstrated a large effect size, albeit based on a limited number of studies ( k = 3, d = 1.68, P = 0.03). No significant effects were observed for other agents. Additionally, meta‐regression analysis did not identify significant sources of heterogeneity in treatment response. Our meta‐analysis supports the use of methylphenidate for enhancing cognitive functioning in patients with TBI. Although donepezil shows potential, it warrants further research. These results could guide clinical decision making, inform practice guidelines, and direct future pharmacotherapeutic research in ABI.",

    "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) provide meaningful knowledge of drug‐related adverse events (AEs) that are not captured in standard drug development and postmarketing surveillance. Using variables obtained from EHR data in the University of California San Francisco de‐identified Clinical Data Warehouse, we aimed to evaluate the potential of machine learning to predict two hematological AEs, thrombocytopenia and anemia, in a cohort of patients treated with linezolid for 3 or more days. Features for model input were extracted at linezolid initiation (index), and outcomes were characterized from index to 14 days post‐treatment. Random forest classification (RFC) was used for AE prediction, and reduced feature models were evaluated using cumulative importance (cImp) for feature selection. Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia and anemia occurred in 31% of 2,171 and 56% of 2,170 evaluable patients, respectively. Of the total 53 features, as few as 7 contributed at least 50% cImp, resulting in prediction accuracies of 70% or higher and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.886 for grade 3+ thrombocytopenia and 0.759 for grade 3+ anemia. Sensitivity analyses in strictly defined patient subgroups revealed similarly high predictive performance in full and reduced feature models. A logistic regression model with the same 50% cImp features showed similar predictive performance as RFC and good concordance with RFC probability predictions after isotonic calibration, adding interpretability. Collectively, this work demonstrates potential for machine learning prediction of AE risk in real‐world patients using few variables regularly available in EHRs, which may aid in clinical decision making and/or monitoring.",

    "abstract": "A recent meta‐analysis found no benefit of uric acid‐lowering therapy including febuxostat on death, cardiovascular events, or renal impairment. However, there may be populations that benefit from febuxostat in reducing mortality and cerebral and cardiovascular events. The aim of the present study was to examine the clinical benefit of febuxostat in elderly patients stratified by age using Febuxostat for Cerebral and CaRdiorenovascular Events PrEvEntion StuDy (FREED) data. FREED was a randomized study involving patients aged 65 years or older with hyperuricemia and risk factors for cerebral, cardiovascular, or renal diseases. A total of 1,070 patients were included in this post hoc analysis, divided into 2 age groups: 65–74 years and ≥ 75 years. Patients were randomized into febuxostat and non‐febuxostat groups, with uric acid levels monitored for 36 months. The primary composite end point included cerebral, cardiovascular, and renal events. In patients aged between 65 and 74 years, febuxostat significantly reduced the risk of future cerebral and cardiorenovascular events. However, no effects of febuxostat were found in the older population aged ≥ 75 years. Heterogeneity in potential interactions between the age and febuxostat treatment was particularly observed in non‐fatal cerebral and cardiovascular events and all‐cause death. Patients aged ≥ 75 years exhibited more pre‐existing factors associated with cerebral and cardiorenovascular events than those aged 65–74 years. The effectiveness of febuxostat varies by age group, with potential benefits for patients aged 65–74 years. The effects of febuxostat are complex and it is important to consider patient characteristics in its clinical use.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19)‐associated pulmonary aspergillosis superinfection with cytokine storm is associated with increased mortality. This study aimed to establish a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PK) model to investigate the disease‐drug–drug interactions between voriconazole and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients with COVID‐19 with elevated interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) levels carrying various CYP2C19 phenotypes. The model was constructed and validated using PK data on voriconazole, ritonavir, and IL‐6, and was subsequently verified against clinical data from 78 patients with COVID‐19. As a result, the model predicted voriconazole, ritonavir, and IL‐6 PK parameters and drug–drug interaction‐related fold changes in healthy subjects and patients with COVID‐19 with acceptable prediction error, demonstrating its predictive capability. Simulations indicated ritonavir could increase voriconazole exposure to CYP2C19 intermediate and poor metabolizers rather than decrease it, in contrast to what is indicated in the drug package insert. However, the predicted ritonavir exposures were comparable across subjects. In patients with COVID‐19, both ritonavir and IL‐6 increased voriconazole trough concentrations, which may lead to CYP2C19 phenotype‐dependent overexposure. In conclusion, COVID‐19‐induced IL‐6 elevation and ritonavir increased voriconazole exposure, and the magnitude of interactions was influenced by CYP2C19 phenotype. Thus, caution is warranted when prescribing voriconazole concomitantly with Paxlovid in patients with COVID‐19.",

    "abstract": "The beneficial effects of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with low albuminuria levels have not been established. This study aimed to compare the effects of dapagliflozin on kidney injury biomarkers in patients with CKD stratified by albuminuria level. We prospectively enrolled healthy volunteers (HVs; n = 20) and patients with CKD ( n = 54) with and without diabetes mellitus. Patients with CKD were divided into two age‐matched and sex‐matched subgroups according to urinary albumin–creatinine ratio (uACR) levels (<300 mg/g and ≥300 mg/g). The CKD group received dapagliflozin (10 mg/day). Urine samples were collected before treatment and after 3 and 6 months of dapagliflozin. Urinary kidney injury molecule‐1 (KIM‐1), interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), and mitochondrial DNA nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit‐1 (mtND1) copy number were measured. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of patients with CKD was lower than that of HVs ( P < 0.001). During the study period, eGFR decreased and uACR did not change in the CKD group. Kidney injury markers were significantly elevated in patients with CKD compared with those in HVs. Dapagliflozin reduced urinary KIM‐1, IL‐1β, and mtDNA copy number in patients with CKD after 6 months of treatment. In further, the levels of urinary KIM‐1 and IL‐1β, patients with CKD decreased after 6 months of dapagliflozin treatment regardless of albuminuria level. Dapagliflozin reduced urinary kidney injury biomarkers in patients with CKD, regardless of albuminuria level. These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors may also attenuate the progression of low albuminuric CKD.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent use of skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) and opioids has been linked to an increased risk of injury. However, it remains unclear whether the injury risks differ by specific SMR when combined with opioids. We conducted nine retrospective cohort studies within a US Medicaid population. Each cohort consisted exclusively of person‐time exposed to both an SMR and one of the three most dispensed opioids—hydrocodone, oxycodone, and tramadol. Opioid users were further divided into three cohorts based on the initiation order of SMRs and opioids—synchronically triggered, opioid‐triggered, and SMR‐triggered. Within each cohort, we used Cox proportional hazard models to compare the injury rates for different SMRs compared to methocarbamol, adjusting for covariates. We identified 349,543, 139,458, and 218,967 concurrent users of SMRs with hydrocodone, oxycodone, and tramadol, respectively. In the oxycodone‐SMR‐triggered cohort, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were 1.86 (95% CI, 1.23–2.82) for carisoprodol and 1.73 (1.09–2.73) for tizanidine. In the tramadol‐synchronically triggered cohort, the adjusted HRs were 0.69 (0.49–0.97) for metaxalone and 0.62 (0.42–0.90) for tizanidine. In the tramadol‐SMR‐triggered cohort, the adjusted HRs were 1.51 (1.01–2.26) for baclofen and 1.48 (1.03–2.11) for cyclobenzaprine. All other HRs were statistically nonsignificant. In conclusion, the relative injury rate associated with different SMRs used concurrently with the three most dispensed opioids appears to vary depending on the specific opioid and the order of combination initiation. If confirmed by future studies, clinicians should consider the varying injury rates when prescribing SMRs to individuals using hydrocodone, oxycodone, and tramadol.",

    "abstract": "A proof‐of‐concept study with the combination of guselkumab and golimumab in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) has shown that the combination therapy resulted in greater efficacy than the individual monotherapies. The current analysis evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of guselkumab and golimumab in both the combination therapy and individual monotherapies. Blood samples were collected to evaluate serum concentrations and immunogenicity of guselkumab and golimumab. Population PK (PopPK) models were developed to assess the effects of combination therapy and other potential covariates on the PK of guselkumab and golimumab. The guselkumab PK was comparable between monotherapy and combination therapy, whereas golimumab concentrations were slightly higher with combination therapy. The anti‐guselkumab antibody incidence was low with both monotherapy and combination therapy, and guselkumab immunogenicity did not impact the clearance. Conversely, the anti‐golimumab antibody incidence with combination therapy was lower than that for monotherapy. PopPK analysis suggested that the slightly higher golimumab concentrations with combination therapy were partially due to lower immunogenicity and thus lower clearance with combination therapy. C‐reactive protein (CRP) was also a significant covariate on golimumab clearance. The greater improvement of inflammation with combination therapy, as shown by reductions in CRP, may have also contributed to the higher golimumab concentrations. Combination therapy slightly decreased the clearance of golimumab, but not guselkumab clearance, in patients with UC. Lower immunogenicity and greater improvement of inflammation with combination therapy were potential mechanisms for slightly increased golimumab concentrations with combination therapy as compared with golimumab monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric drug dosing is challenged by the heterogeneity of developing physiology and ethical considerations surrounding a vulnerable population. Often, pediatric drug dosing leverages findings from the adult population; however, recent regulatory efforts have motivated drug sponsors to pursue pediatric‐specific programs to meet an unmet medical need and improve pediatric drug labeling. This paradigm is further complicated by the pathophysiological implications of obesity on drug distribution and metabolism and the roles that body composition and body size play in drug dosing. Therefore, we sought to understand the landscape of pediatric drug dosing by characterizing the dosing strategies from drug products recently approved for pediatric indications identified using FDA Drug Databases and analyze the impact of body size descriptors (age, body surface area, weight) on drug pharmacokinetics for several selected antipsychotics approved in pediatric patients. Our review of these pediatric databases revealed a dependence on body size‐guided dosing, with 68% of dosing in pediatric drug labelings being dependent on knowing either the age, body surface area, or weight of the patient to guide dosing for pediatric patients. This dependence on body size‐guided dosing drives the need for special consideration when dosing a drug in overweight and obese patients. Exploratory pharmacokinetic analyses in antipsychotics illustrate possible effects of drug exposure when applying different dosing strategies for this class of drugs. Future efforts should aim to further understand the pediatric drug dosing and obesity paradigm across pediatric age ranges and drug classes to optimize drug development and clinical care for this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Autologous chimeric antigen receptor T‐cell (CAR‐T) therapies have garnered unprecedented clinical success with multiple regulatory approvals for the treatment of various hematological malignancies. However, there are still several clinical challenges that limit their broad utilization for aggressive disease conditions. To address some of these challenges, allogeneic cell therapies are evaluated as an alternative approach. As compared with autologous products, they offer several advantages, such as a more standardized “off the shelf” product, reduced manufacturing complexity, and no requirement of bridging therapy. As with autologous CAR‐T therapies, allogeneic cell therapies also present clinical pharmacology challenges due to their in vivo living nature, unique pharmacokinetics or cellular kinetics (CKs), and complex dose‐exposure‐response relationships that are impacted by various patient‐ and product‐related factors. On top of that, allogeneic cell therapies present additional unique challenges, including attenuated in vivo persistence and graft‐vs.‐host disease risk as compared with autologous counterparts. This review draws comparison between autologous and allogeneic cell therapies, summarizing key engineering aspects unique to allogeneic cell therapy. Clinical pharmacology learnings from emerging clinical data of allogeneic cell therapy programs are also highlighted, with particular emphasis on CK, dose‐exposure‐response relationship, lymphodepletion regimen, repeat dosing, and patient‐ and product‐related factors that can impact CK and patient outcomes. There are specific unique challenges and opportunities arising from the development of allogeneic cell therapies, especially in optimizing lymphodepletion and establishing a regimen for repeat dosing. This review highlights how clinical pharmacologists are well positioned to help address these challenges by leveraging novel clinical pharmacology and modeling and simulation approaches.",

This study scrutinizes DTx clinical trials from 2005 to 2022, analyzing their growth, funding, underlying medical specialties, and other R&D characteristics, using ClinicalTrials.gov data. Our analysis includes trials categorized via the ICD‐11 system, covering active, recruiting, or completed studies and considering trials listing multiple conditions. In analyzing 5,889 registered DTx trials, we document a more than five‐fold increase in such trials since 2011, and a compound annual growth rate of 22.82% since 2005. While most trials were single‐center, the median number of study subjects increased in recent years, driven by larger interventional trials. The key disciplines driving this growth were psychiatry, neurology, oncology, and endocrinology. Mental health dominated DTx trials in recent years, led by neurocognitive disorders, substance abuse disorders, and mood disorders. Industry funding varied across disciplines and was particularly high in visual system diseases and dermatology. DTx trials have surged since 2005, accelerated by recent growth in mental health trials. These trends mirror developments toward remote healthcare delivery, amplified by digital health investments during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Growing numbers of participants in DTx trials point to increased demand for more robust trials. However, because most trials are single‐center and country‐specific, more international cooperation and harmonized evaluation standards will be essential for DTx trials to become more efficient and provide validation across countries, health systems, and groups of individuals.",

We identified policy documents, technical guidance documents, and cases on official Chinese government websites and extracted their contents separately. We consulted experts from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) and academic institutes and searched case‐related articles for enrichment. We also searched and included articles related to the use of RWE/Real‐world data in Chinese regulatory decisions. Six trial versions of technical guidance documents, 7 case studies, and 40 articles related to the Chinese regulatory decisions were included in this study. Based on the technical guidance, data quality, and appropriate study design and statistical analysis are the main concerns for RWE generation. The cases and articles related to regulatory decisions revealed 9 main concerns, including data sources and applicability, data quality, strength of existing evidence, appropriate study design and statistical analysis, regulated and transparent process for analysis and evidence generation, product safety and efficacy, product characteristics and clinical needs, ethical considerations and data security, and communicate adequately with regulatory authorities. Among these concerns, data issues are central. Preliminary attempts have been made by the NMPA to promote the use of RWE, but substantial challenges still remain.",

After stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting, Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome. Of 68,607 patients (mean age: 65 years, 45% females), 33,658 (49%) received long‐acting ESAs and 34,949 (51%) received short‐acting ESAs. There was no difference in the risk of MACE associated with receipt of short‐ vs. long‐acting ESAs (HR: 1.02 (95% CI: 0.98–1.08)). However, long‐acting (vs. short‐acting) ESA receipt was associated with a lower risk of all‐cause mortality (HR: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87–0.96)). Compared with short‐acting ESAs, long‐acting ESAs were associated with a lower risk of all‐cause mortality, with no difference in the risk of MACE. Future studies with a longer follow‐up are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "The randomized AMBORA trial showed that medication errors are frequent in patients treated with oral antitumor therapeutics and that they can be substantially reduced by an intensified clinical pharmacological/pharmaceutical care program. While randomized controlled trials are essential to generate clinical evidence, their generalizability in real‐world is not always given. The AMBORA care program was implemented in clinical routine within the AMBORA Competence and Consultation Center (AMBORA Center) at the Comprehensive Cancer Center Erlangen‐EMN, allowing a thorough comparison of medication error frequencies and characteristics. Our primary analysis compared data at therapy initiation of new oral antitumor therapeutics from the AMBORA trial intervention group ( n = 98) and the AMBORA Center ( n = 142). Medication errors involving the oral antitumor therapeutics were twofold higher in real‐world compared to the randomized controlled trial (mean 0.83 ± 0.80 per patient vs. 0.41 ± 0.53, P < 0.001). We observed more complex oral antitumor therapeutic regimens, a higher median number of medications, and a higher ECOG status in clinical routine vs. the randomized trial. A high percentage of medication errors was completely solved in both groups (85.7% vs. 88.3%, ns). Medication error characteristics within the complete medication (oral antitumor therapeutics and concomitant medication) were similar in both groups (e.g., patient‐related causes, drug–drug/drug–food interactions). Taken together, medication errors were even more frequent in clinical routine than in the randomized controlled trial and a high rate was solved in clinical routine by a clinical pharmacological/pharmaceutical care program.",

    "abstract": "B‐ and T‐lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA; CD272) is an immunoglobulin superfamily member and part of a family of checkpoint inhibitory receptors that negatively regulate immune cell activation. The natural ligand for BTLA is herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM; TNFRSF14), and binding of HVEM to BTLA leads to attenuation of lymphocyte activation. In this study, we evaluated the role of BTLA and HVEM expression in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem autoimmune disease. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers ( N = 7) were evaluated by mass cytometry by time‐of‐flight to establish baseline expression of BTLA and HVEM on human lymphocytes compared with patients with SLE during a self‐reported flare ( N = 5). High levels of BTLA protein were observed on B cells, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in healthy participants. HVEM protein levels were lower in patients with SLE compared with healthy participants, while BTLA levels were similar between SLE and healthy groups. Correlations of BTLA‐HVEM hub genes' expression with patient and disease characteristics were also analyzed using whole blood gene expression data from patients with SLE ( N = 1,760) and compared with healthy participants ( N = 60). HVEM , being one of the SLE‐associated genes, showed an exceptionally strong negative association with disease activity. Several other genes in the BTLA‐HVEM signaling network were strongly (negative or positive) correlated, while BTLA had a low association with disease activity. Collectively, these data provide a clinical rationale for targeting BTLA with an agonist in SLE patients with low HVEM expression.",

    "abstract": "Nearly two decades after the Peck and Cross article ‘“Getting the dose right: facts, a blueprint, and encouragements” was published, a review of dose recommendations for biologics shows that the success in getting the dose right appears to have improved given the relatively low incidence of drug withdrawals and dosing/label changes. However, the clinical experience with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) following approval has been less than perfect. In inflammatory diseases, the disease burden changes with time and high treatment failure rates have been reported. In addition, the use of concomitant steroids and immunosuppressant drugs with MAbs is common. These concomitant agents have their own safety issues and many immunosuppressant agents are not well‐tolerated although they have been shown to reduce the incidence of anti‐drug antibodies (ADA). This same complexity is seen in MAbs used in oncology as well, although with these agents the doses appear to be higher than needed, which results in high treatment costs and incidence of adverse events. Given the complexity of MAb pharmacokinetics, which makes providing a detailed description of dose options difficult, product labeling should include the options for alternative dose strategies and potentially include the use of therapeutic drug monitoring with dose individualization which have been shown to improve clinical response and reduce the incidence of ADA. So, while the recommended dosing for biologics seems improved over the issues noted 17 years ago, we still have some work to do.",

The approved oral dosing regimen for these patients was a starting dose of 600 mg/m 2 with titration up to a maximum of 900 mg/m 2 twice daily. Data to support efficacy in pediatric patients were derived from established pharmacokinetic (PK) relationships across approved populations, a PK study in pediatric liver transplant recipients, and information from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database. Information supporting safety was based on comparing mycophenolic acid (MPA) exposure with that in pediatric kidney transplant recipients, the published literature, and post‐marketing safety reports. Efficacy in pediatric patients was established based on extrapolation of efficacy from studies in adult liver, adult heart, and pediatric kidney transplant populations, and similarity in MPA exposure between pediatric and adult patients. Review of the data supported an oral dosing regimen for pediatric heart transplant and liver transplant recipients consisting of a starting dose of 600 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 900 mg/m 2 b.i.d. A dosage range for MMF is recommended recognizing that the MMF dose may be modified in clinical practice for myriad factors. The dosage recommendations in the labeling for pediatric liver and pediatric heart transplant patients are intended to permit individualized dosing based on clinical assessment of these factors.",

A national cohort study based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database enrolled 944 patients with T2D who had experienced AMI and were treated with SGLT2i and 8,941 patients who did not receive SGLT2i, respectively, from May 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019. We used propensity score matching to balance covariates across study groups. The follow‐up period was from the index date to the independent occurrence of the study outcomes, discontinuation of the index drug, or the end of the study period (December 31, 2020), whichever occurred first. The SGLT2i group exhibited a significantly lower incidence of cardiovascular death (0.865% per year vs. 2.048% per year; hazard ratio (HR): 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24–0.76; P = 0.0042), heart failure hospitalization (1.987% per year vs. 3.395% per year; HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39–0.89; P = 0.0126), and all‐cause mortality (3.406% per year vs. 4.981% per year, HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50–0.95; P = 0.0225) compared with the non‐SGLT2i group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of AMI, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, major adverse cardiovascular events, composite renal outcomes, or lower limb amputation. These findings suggest that the use of SGLT2i may have favorable effects on clinical outcomes in patients with T2D after AMI.",

    "abstract": "The multifaceted IL‐2/IL‐2R biology and its modulation by promising therapeutic agents are highly relevant topics in the cancer immunotherapy field. A novel CD25‐Treg‐depleting antibody (Vopikitug, RG6292) has been engineered to preserve IL‐2 signaling on effector T cells to enhance effector activation and antitumor immunity, and is currently being evaluated in the clinic. The Entry into Human‐enabling framework described here investigated the characteristics of RG6292, from in vitro quantification of CD25 and RG6292 pharmacology using human tissues to in vivo assessment of PK/PD/safety relationships in cynomolgus monkeys as non‐human primate species (NHP). Fundamental knowledge on CD25 and Treg biology in healthy and diseased tissues across NHP and human highlighted the commonalities between these species in regard to the target biology and demonstrated the conservation of RG6292 properties between NHP and human. The integration of in vitro and in vivo PK/PD/safety data from these species enabled the identification of human relevant safety risks, the selection of the most appropriate safe starting dose and the projection of the pharmacologically‐relevant dose range. The first clinical data obtained for RG6292 in patients verified the appropriateness of the described approaches as well as validated the full clinical relevance of the projected safety, PK, and PD profiles from animal to man. This work shows how the integration of mechanistic non‐clinical data increases the predictive value for human, allowing efficient transition of drug candidates and optimizations of early clinical investigations.",

    "abstract": "Although the treatment landscape has rapidly evolved over the last years, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancers. With recent advances, both immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)‐based chemotherapy constitute the standard treatment for advanced HCC. A systematic search of randomized clinical trials employing TKIs was performed in 17 databases, obtaining 25 studies evaluating the prognosis, tumor response, and presence of adverse events (AEs) related to TKIs in HCC. Overall effect sizes were estimated for the hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), either extracted or calculated with the Parmar method, employing STATA 16. Heterogeneity was assessed by Chi‐square‐based Q ‐test and inconsistency ( I 2 ) statistic; source of heterogeneity by meta‐regression and subgroup analysis; and publication bias by funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's test. The research protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023397263). Meta‐analysis revealed a correlation between survival and tumor response parameters and TKI treatment vs. placebo, despite detecting high heterogeneity. Combined TKI treatment showed a significantly better objective response rate (ORR) with no heterogeneity, whereas publication bias was only detected with time to progression (TTP). Few gastrointestinal and neurological disorders were associated with TKI treatment vs. placebo or with combined treatment. However, a higher number of serious AEs were related to TKI treatment vs. sorafenib alone. Results show positive clinical benefits from TKI treatment, supporting the approval and maintenance of TKI‐based therapy for advanced HCC, while establishing appropriate strategies to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Africans are extremely underrepresented in global genomic research. African populations face high burdens of communicable and non‐communicable diseases and experience widespread polypharmacy. As population‐specific genetic studies are crucial to understanding unique genetic profiles and optimizing treatments to reduce medication‐related complications in this diverse population, the present study aims to characterize the pharmacogenomics profile of a rural Ugandan population. We analyzed low‐pass whole genome sequencing data from 1998 Ugandans to investigate 18 clinically actionable pharmacogenes in this population. We utilized PyPGx to identify star alleles (haplotype patterns) and compared allele frequencies across populations using the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase PharmGKB. Clinical interpretations of the identified alleles were conducted following established dosing guidelines. Over 99% of participants displayed actionable phenotypes across the 18 pharmacogenes, averaging 3.5 actionable genotypes per individual. Several variant alleles known to affect drug metabolism (i.e., CYP3A5*1 , CYP2B6*9 , CYP3A5*6 , CYP2D6*17 , CYP2D6*29 , and TMPT*3C )—which are generally more prevalent in African individuals—were notably enriched in the Ugandan cohort, beyond reported frequencies in other African peoples. More than half of the cohort exhibited a predicted impaired drug response associated with CFTR, IFNL3, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19, and approximately 31% predicted altered CYP2D6 metabolism. Potentially impaired CYP2C9, SLCO1B1, TPMT, and DPYD metabolic phenotypes were also enriched in Ugandans compared with other African populations. Ugandans exhibit distinct allele profiles that could impact drug efficacy and safety. Our findings have important implications for pharmacogenomics in Uganda, particularly with respect to the treatment of prevalent communicable and non‐communicable diseases, and they emphasize the potential of pharmacogenomics‐guided therapies to optimize healthcare outcomes and precision medicine in Uganda.",

    "abstract": "The 2022 United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) draft guidance on diversity plan (DP), which will be implemented through the Diversity Action Plans by December 2025, under the 21st Century Cures Act, marks a pivotal effort by the FDA to ensure that registrational studies adequately reflect the target patient populations based on diversity in demographics and baseline characteristics. This white paper represents the culminated efforts of the International Consortium of Quality and Innovation (IQ) Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Working Group (WG) to assess the implementation of the draft FDA guidance by members of the IQ consortium in the discipline of clinical pharmacology (CP). This article describes current practices in the industry and emphasizes the tools and techniques of quantitative pharmacology that can be applied to support the inclusion of a diverse population during global drug development, to support diversity and inclusion of underrepresented patient populations, in multiregional clinical trials (MRCTs). It outlines strategic and technical recommendations to integrate demographics, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities, in multiregional phase III registrational studies, through the application of quantitative pharmacology. Finally, this article discusses the challenges faced during global drug development, which may otherwise limit the enrollment of a broader, potentially diverse population in registrational trials. Based on the outcomes of the IQ survey that provided the current awareness of diversity planning, it is envisioned that in the future, industry efforts in the inclusion of previously underrepresented populations during global drug development will culminate in drug labels that apply to the intended patient populations at the time of new drug application or biologics license application rather than through post‐marketing requirements.",

Adult model establishment involved the optimization of fraction metabolized by CYP3A4 (0.92 for entrectinib and 0.98 for M5) using data from an itraconazole DDI study. This model captured well the exposure changes of entrectinib and M5 seen in adults co‐administered with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. In pediatrics, reasonable prediction of entrectinib and M5 pharmacokinetics in ≧2 year olds was achieved when using the default models for physiological development and enzyme ontogenies. However, a two to threefold misprediction of entrectinib and M5 exposures was seen in <2 year olds which may be due to missing mechanistic understanding of gut physiology and/or protein binding in very young children. Model predictions for ≧2 year olds showed that entrectinib AUC(0− t ) was increased by approximately sevenfold and five to threefold by strong and high‐moderate and low‐moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, respectively. Based on these victim DDI predictions, dose adjustments for entrectinib when given concomitantly with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors in pediatric subjects were recommended. These simulations informed the approved entrectinib label without the need for additional clinical pharmacology studies.",

Using a retrospective cohort of 1,032 breast cancer patients on tamoxifen therapy, we examined the association of solanidine metabolites with CYP2D6 activity and its correlation with tamoxifen metabolism. Solanidine, 4‐OH‐solanidine, or SSDA was detected in 99.7% ( N = 1,029) of plasma samples. Decreased solanidine metabolite ratios were found in CYP2D6 intermediate and poor metabolizers ( P < 0.0001). Patients on CYP2D6 strong inhibitors had a 77.6% and 94.2% decrease in 4‐OH‐solandine/solanidine ( P < 0.0001) and SSDA/solanidine ( P < 0.0001), respectively. The ratio of endoxifen to tamoxifen was highly correlated with both 4‐OH‐solandine/solanidine (ρ = 0.3207, P < 0.0001) and SSDA/solanidine (ρ = 0.5022, P < 0.0001) ratios. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine that 4‐OH‐solanidine/solanidine and SSDA/solanidine ratios below 2.1 and 0.8, respectively, predicted endoxifen concentrations of <16 nM. In conclusion, solanidine, 4‐OH‐solanidine, and SSDA are diet‐derived biomarkers of CYP2D6 activity. Moreover, in patients on tamoxifen therapy, 4‐OH‐solanidine/solanidine and SSDA/solanidine predicted endoxifen levels including the inhibitory effects of concomitantly prescribed CYP2D6‐interacting medications. Accordingly, 4‐OH‐solanidine/solanidine or SSDA/solanidine ratio has the potential to be particularly useful prior to initiation of tamoxifen or for determining the impact of CYP2D6 drug interactions, as well as prior to switching from an aromatase inhibitor to tamoxifen.",

    "abstract": "Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) are an emerging class of anticancer therapeutics. TCIs are designed to selectively engage their targeted proteins via covalent warheads. From the drug development standpoint, the covalent inhibition mechanism is anticipated to elicit the following theoretical benefits: (i) an extended duration of therapeutic action that is determined by the target protein turnover rate and not necessarily by drug half‐life, (ii) a lower therapeutic dose owing to greater pharmacological potency, (iii) lower risk of off‐target binding and associated adverse events, and (iv) reduced drug–drug interaction (DDI) liability due to high selectivity and low dose. Elucidating the clinical relevance of these expected benefits requires an integrated assessment of pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, safety, and DDI data. In this review, we compared the clinical pharmacology attributes of FDA‐approved oncology TCIs within the last 10 years against their reversible inhibitor (RI) counterparts. Our findings indicated that (i) PK half‐lives of TCIs were typically shorter and (ii) at their respective recommended clinical doses per drug label, the molar unbound steady state areas under the concentration‐time curve (AUC ss ) of TCIs were lower than those of RIs, but with longer clinically observed durations of response. However, (iii) there was no conclusive evidence supporting improved clinical safety profiles for TCIs, and (iv) DDI perpetrator profiles appeared to be similar between TCIs and RIs. The overall clinical pharmacology comparison of TCI vs. RI surveyed in this paper suggested that at least two of the four forecasted clinical benefits were achieved by TCIs.",

    "abstract": "Many new opportunities surround rare pediatric disease drug development, thanks to key advances in regulatory thinking and in the scientific community. As rare disease drug development brings challenges to the developers in terms of limited understanding of natural history, heterogeneity in drug response, as well as difficulty recruiting patients in pivotal trials, there has never been a greater need for quantitative integration. To understand how International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ) member companies approach pediatric rare disease drug development, the rare pediatric subteam of the Clinical Pharmacology Leadership Group (CPLG) sponsored Pediatrics Working Group conducted a baseline survey to assess the four main pillars of this quantitative innovation, namely, biomarkers and surrogate end points, statistical methodologies, model‐informed drug development, as well as public–private partnerships. The survey was administered by IQ and yielded 13 evaluable responders from represented companies. This article presents the key findings from this baseline identifying survey, highlighting the key blind spots, and providing insightful expert opinions to address those gaps. In summary, we call an urgent attention to the community on the opportunities to enhance integration and within‐industry learnings from this analysis on aspects related to platform studies, end‐to‐end quantitative integration, and sharing of trial‐level placebo data for better understanding of disease progression and more efficient trial designs. We collectively hope that these findings will stimulate discussion and debate around cross‐industry sharing and collaboration to better delineate principles and further enhance the efficiency of rare pediatric disease drug development.",

    "abstract": "Around 50% of the drugs used in children have never been tested for safety and efficacy in this vulnerable population. Immature drug elimination pathways can lead to drug toxicity when pediatric doses are determined using empirical methods such as body‐surface area or body‐weight‐normalized adult dosing. In the absence of clinical data, physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling has emerged as a useful tool to predict drug pharmacokinetics in children. These models utilize developmental physiological data, including age‐dependent differences in the abundance of drug‐metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET), to mechanistically extrapolate adult pharmacokinetic data to children. The reported abundance data of hepatic DMET proteins in subcellular fractions isolated from frozen tissue are prone to high technical variability. Therefore, we carried out the proteomics‐based quantification of hepatic drug transporters and conjugating enzymes in 50 pediatric and 8 adult human hepatocyte samples. Out of the 34 studied proteins, 28 showed a significant increase or decrease with age. While MRP6, OAT7, and SULT1E1 were highest in < 1‐year‐old samples, the abundance of P‐gp and UGT1A4 was negligible in < 1‐year‐old samples and increased significantly after 1 year of age. Incorporation of the age‐dependent abundance data in PBPK models can help improve pediatric dose prediction, leading to safer drug pharmacotherapy in children.",

Post‐marketing studies are crucial for monitoring safety and efficacy, with post‐marketing requirements (PMRs) mandated by the regulatory agencies to ensure compliance. This study aims to compare PMR statuses, objectives, and pivotal trial characteristics of orphan drugs approved by the FDA ( n = 154) and EMA ( n = 79) from 2008 to 2018, shedding light on regulatory differences and their impact on drug development. Contrary to expectations, our analysis found no significant disparity in the proportion of orphan drugs with and without PMRs approved by both the FDA (48.1%) and EMA (55.7%). Safety concerns surrounding orphan drugs post‐approval, attributed partly to pivotal trial design, underscore the need for robust post‐marketing surveillance. While the FDA primarily focuses on post‐marketing safety (36.1%), the EMA places a higher emphasis on both efficacy and safety (47.1%), reflecting distinct approaches to PMR management between the two regulatory bodies. The observed trend of delayed PMRs at the EMA (47.1%) highlights the importance of effective cooperation between regulators and pharmaceutical companies to ensure the timely completion of PMRs and enhance drug safety.",

The relevance of these transporters in clinical pharmacology is well acknowledged. Recent research has also underscored the critical role of membrane transporters as targets in human diseases, including their involvement in rare genetic disorders. This review focuses on transporters for water‐soluble B vitamins, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and biotin, essential cofactors for metabolic enzymes. Mutations in transporters, such as SLC19A3 (thiamine), SLC52A2, and SLC52A3 (riboflavin), and SLC5A6 (multiple B vitamins including pantothenic acid and biotin) are linked to severe neurological disorders due to their role in the blood–brain barrier, which is crucial for brain vitamin supply. Current treatments, mainly involving vitamin supplementation, often result in variable response. This review also provides a short perspective on the role of the transporters in the blood‐cerebrospinal fluid barrier and highlights the potential development of pharmacologic treatments for rare disorders associated with mutations in these transporters.",

    "abstract": "The mainstay of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been combination oral therapy. While oral ART is highly effective, nonadherence remains a chief concern. Addressing this concern in recent years is the emergence of long‐acting antiretrovirals for the treatment and prevention of HIV‐1 infection. The most recently approved long‐acting antiretroviral is the first‐in‐class capsid inhibitor lenacapavir (LEN) for heavily treatment‐experienced adults with multidrug‐resistant HIV‐1 infection. Due to its biannual subcutaneous dosing scheme to inhibit the HIV‐1 capsid, LEN exhibits unique pharmacokinetics and reinforces an evolving era of ART. In this review, we evaluate published and accepted research articles, conference proceedings, and clinical trial records to provide a comprehensive overview of LEN for treatment and preliminary data for the prevention of HIV‐1 infection. These data include clinical trials outcomes, in vitro and in vivo resistance profiles, and preclinical data supporting downstream indications. We also discuss the unique clinical pharmacology of LEN with the goal of serving as a resource toward subsequent physiologically based, population‐based, and other miscellaneous pharmacometric‐focused analyses. Given the dynamic nature of the HIV treatment and prevention research fields, we also discuss ongoing studies related to LEN for treatment‐naïve adults and for prevention. Lastly, we discuss important pharmacologic gaps in special populations, drug–drug interactions, and at the sites of action germane to HIV treatment and prevention. The information discussed in this review will provide knowledge and understanding of the unique pharmacologic properties of LEN to assist clinicians and researchers as they navigate the dynamic HIV research landscape.",

    "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most prevalent pediatric rheumatic disease. While disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), especially biologics, have greatly transformed the management of JIA, there remain some unmet medical needs that require new treatment options. The objective of this work was to describe and apply a modeling and simulation approach to extrapolate upadacitinib efficacy from the adult diseases, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), to their respective pediatric diseases, polyarticular course JIA (pcJIA), and juvenile PsA (JPsA). A population pharmacokinetic model characterized upadacitinib pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients using data from two phase I studies in pediatric patients with pcJIA ( N = 51) or atopic dermatitis ( N = 33). Efficacy simulations were conducted using previously developed exposure–response models in adults with RA and PsA. Real‐world pcJIA and JPsA patient databases were leveraged to construct representative patient profiles for the targeted population. Following administration of the proposed weight‐based dosing regimen, the model‐predicted median upadacitinib plasma exposures in pediatric patients were within 20% of those in adult RA and PsA patients receiving the approved adult regimen. Simulations demonstrate that upadacitinib efficacy in pcJIA and JPsA is predicted to be non‐inferior to that in adults with RA or PsA, respectively. The results of this work enabled recent approvals of upadacitinib for the treatment of polyarticular JIA and JPsA in the United States. Upadacitinib safety in pediatrics is being further evaluated in ongoing clinical trials.",

Clinical pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and short‐term placebo‐controlled safety data were available from clinical studies (NCT04156620 and NCT04209205) with the to‐be‐marketed IV formulation using a maintenance dosage 3 mg/kg every 4 weeks (q4w), which was different from the dose approved (1.75 mg/kg q4w). The IV dosage of 3 mg/kg utilized in these two trials resulted in exposures ( C max,ss ) significantly higher than those for the approved subcutaneous (SC) regimens. Further, there is limited long‐term safety information available for this 3 mg/kg q4w IV dose. To address this important limitation, a model‐informed drug development (MIDD) approach was employed to leverage available clinical PK, efficacy, and safety data from the secukinumab development program to identify a maintenance IV dosing regimen, 1.75 mg/kg IV q4w, that better approximated the relevant SC secukinumab exposures for which efficacy and safety have been established. The MIDD analyses were used to support approval of this IV dosing regimen not directly studied in the indications sought for licensure, PsA, AS, and nr‐AxSpA.",

The mode‐of‐action consists in removal of disease‐causing amyloid accumulations by activating phagocytic immune cells, a mechanism without precedent in cardiology. To select a safe and potentially efficacious dose range and treatment duration for a combined first‐in‐human and proof‐of‐concept clinical phase Ib study, we developed a mechanistic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that can predict NI006 exposure, its effects on cardiac amyloid load and on LWVT, which is a predictor of heart failure in this disease. The PK/PD model predictions supported 0.3 mg/kg monthly dosing as a safe starting dose and identified 10–60 mg/kg monthly as the potentially efficacious dose range with substantial and dose dependent cardiac amyloid burden reduction within 4 months for 60 mg/kg and 10 months for 10 mg/kg. These predictions were in good agreement with the observed primary results of the clinical phase Ib study where amyloid burden was measured by imaging. This novel translational PK/PD model provided important predictions to guide the design of the phase Ib study of NI006, indicating the value of this approach to integrate preclinical results into clinical trial design and increase translational success.",

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare glycogen storage disease caused by mutations in the enzyme acid α‐glucosidase (GAA) resulting in pathological accumulation of glycogen in muscle tissues leading to progressive weakness and respiratory dysfunction. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with GAA is currently the sole treatment option for patients with Pompe disease. ERT burdens patients with frequent intravenous infusions while insufficiently halting disease progression due to incomplete ERT skeletal muscle distribution. Glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) has been proposed as a substrate reduction therapy (SRT) target for Pompe disease. Here, we report results from the first‐in‐human study of the orally available GYS1 inhibitor MZE001 in healthy subjects. In 88 participants, MZE001 was well‐tolerated up to a single dose of 480 mg BID and multiple doses of 720 mg BID for 10 days. Noncompartmental analysis determined that the half‐life and C trough concentrations of MZE001 could provide efficacious exposures with once or twice daily oral dosing. Change from baseline of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) glycogen, which correlated with muscle glycogen levels in preclinical models, was significantly reduced dose‐dependently following 10 days of MZE001 treatment in healthy subjects. A muscle biopsy sub‐study demonstrated that 10 days of MZE001 (480 mg BID) dosing safely and substantially lowered muscle glycogen stores in healthy adults. This correlated with the PBMC exposure response and supports the use of PBMC glycogen reduction as a surrogate for muscle response, and MZE001 potential for development as the first oral substrate reduction therapy for patients with Pompe disease.",

    "abstract": "Dexamethasone (DEX) is currently the treatment of choice for patients with oxygen‐dependent COVID‐19. It has been observed, primarily in vitro , that dexamethasone induces the expression of CYP3A and the ABCB1 gene, which encodes P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp). This has raised concerns about potential interactions between DEX and substrates of CYP3A and P‐gp, such as direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). Currently, there is limited robust evidence to support a clinically significant interaction between DEX and DOAC. Using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK), we investigated the impact of DEX administered in the context of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban (APX) and rivaroxaban (RVX). After validating the induction effect of the DEX compound on two CYP3A4 substrates using the limited available studies, we optimized the compound in a COVID‐19 patient population, where significantly higher DEX plasma concentrations were observed compared to healthy volunteers. Our PBPK‐based PK simulations showed a 20% decrease in the AUC of APX and RVX in a worst‐case scenario and when DEX was administered at 6 mg PO for 10 days. This finding confirms the limited clinical data currently available and supports the use of APX and RVX with DEX in COVID‐19 patients at low‐risk for thrombo‐embolism. In addition, our results suggest that prednisone (PRED), when used at an equipotent dose, could serve as a viable alternative to DEX, given its less pronounced induction effect on APX and RVX. Further research is needed to validate these findings and to explore the clinical implications of using PRED in place of DEX in such scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), and norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) antidepressants can cause hyponatremia through syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This study assesses the differential risks of hyponatremia associated with commonly prescribed SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram), SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine) and NRI (bupropion), as well as omeprazole as a reference, with a retrospective observational cohort study in the All of Us Research Program, a national multicenter research cohort containing de‐identified electronic health records (EHR). Participants who had been prescribed monotherapy with any of eight common antidepressants were included, with each drug considered as a separate arm indexed with a start date. Events were defined as the first occurrence of a low plasma sodium measurement or a clinical diagnosis recorded for either hyponatremia or SIADH. Those who did not have events were censored at their last plasma sodium measurement. A total of 17,439 individuals were exposed to one of the eight antidepressants as monotherapy. The overall incidences for hyponatremia were 0.87% in the first 30 days and 10.5% in the first 3 years in the antidepressant arms. Compared to sertraline, duloxetine (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37 [1.19–1.58]) and escitalopram (HR = 1.16 [1.01–1.33]) were associated with the highest overall risk of hyponatremia, and bupropion (HR = 0.83 [0.73–0.94]) and paroxetine (HR = 0.78 [0.65–0.93]) were associated with the lowest risk. The risks were unchanged after adjusting for comorbidity and polypharmacy. Such information could help guide providers in managing patients and their risks of hyponatremia when on common antidepressants.",

This cross‐sectional study aimed to assess the characteristics of efficacy evidence for novel drugs approved in China. This study included 240 novel drugs approved by the NMPA for 256 indications between 2018 and 2022. Compared with imported original drugs, the trials of innovative drugs were less frequently subjected to be randomized (67.7% vs. 80.3%; P = 0.01) and placebo (32.3% vs. 45.5%; P = 0.02), and more likely to use external control and surrogate endpoint. There was a significant difference in all features between pivotal trials of drugs with conditional approval and regular approval. Among imported original drugs, the drug for urgent clinical needs used placebo control (58.1% vs. 39.5%; P < 0.001) and scale endpoint more frequently, whereas rare disease drugs seldom utilized active control. The median number of subjects across all pivotal trial intervention groups was 197 (IQR, 86–379), with a median trial duration of 6.0 months (IQR, 3.0–12.7). The median number of pivotal trials per indication for imported original drugs was higher than that of innovative drugs (2.0 [IQR, 1.0–3.0] vs. 1.0 [IQR, 1.0–1.0]; P < 0.001). The innovative drugs typically had either one pivotal trial or one trial plus supportive evidence, both of which accounted for 79.8% of all indications of innovative drugs. The most commonly applied types of supportive evidence across all indications were additional studies and mechanistic evidence. This study illustrated the characteristics of the quality and quantity of efficacy evidence. Special regulatory programs and special drug catalogs offered the agency regulatory flexibility with respect to evidentiary requirements.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenetics‐predicted drug metabolism may not match clinically observed metabolism due to a phenomenon known as phenoconversion. Phenoconversion can occur when an inhibitor or inducer of a drug‐metabolizing enzyme is present. Although estimates of phenoconversion in adult populations are available, prevalence estimates in youth populations are limited. To address this gap, we estimated the prevalence of phenoconversion in 1281 youth (6–24 years) receiving pharmacotherapy for mental health conditions and who had pharmacogenetics testing completed for four genes ( CYP2B6 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 ). Self‐reported medication and cannabidiol/cannabis use were collected at the time of pharmacogenetics testing. Nearly, half (46%) of the cohort was estimated to be phenoconverted for one of the four genes examined. Comparison of metabolizer phenotype frequencies before and after adjustment for phenoconversion showed significantly more youth had actionable phenotypes for CYP2C19 (60.3% vs. 69.1%; P =< 0.001), CYP2D6 (49.3% vs. 63.0%; P =< 0.001), and CYP3A4 (8.5% vs.12.2%; P = 0.003) after phenoconversion adjustment. Of youth who were phenoconverted, 24% had a change in their metabolizer phenotype that would lead to current pharmacogenetics‐based prescribing guidelines recommending a change to standard prescribing (dose adjustment, alternative medication). Our findings indicate a high prevalence of cytochrome P450 phenoconversion among youth receiving pharmacotherapy for mental health conditions. Adjustment for phenoconversion should be considered when implementing pharmacogenetics testing in youth populations to improve the clinical utility of this testing in practice.",

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of vitiligo using a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to August 2023, with additional studies from ClinicalTrials.gov and company websites. We assessed outcomes, including percentage improvement in total vitiligo area score index (TVASI) and facial vitiligo area score index (FVASI); the proportion of patients achieving 50% improvement in TVASI (TVASI50) and 50% and 75% improvement in FVASI (FVASI50 and FVASI75); the risk of treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), infections, and skin‐related adverse events (AEs). Five studies with 1,550 participants were included. JAK inhibitors were associated with a higher proportion of TVASI50 (relative risk [RR] 2.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24–5.78) and FVASI75 (RR 3.97, 95%CI 2.62–6.02) responders than placebo. JAK inhibitors significantly increased the risk of skin‐related AEs (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.29–2.98) compared with placebo. However, the risk of TEAEs, SAEs, and infections was not significantly different between the JAK inhibitor and placebo groups. Subgroup analysis showed that JAK1 and JAK1/2 inhibitors were more effective than JAK3 inhibitors. However, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the route of administration affects the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in vitiligo. These findings indicate that JAK inhibitors are effective in repigmentation and well tolerated in patients with vitiligo.",

    "abstract": "Three sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment strategies, stabilizing oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb), lowering 2,3‐BPG, and inducing fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression aim to prevent red blood cell (RBC) sickling by reducing tense‐state sickle hemoglobin that contributes to polymer formation. Induction of 30% HbF is seen as the gold standard because 30% endogenous expression is associated with a lack of symptoms. However, the level of intervention required to achieve equivalent polymerization protection by the other strategies is uncertain, and there is little understanding of how these approaches could work in combination. We sought to develop an oxygen saturation model that could assess polymerization protection of all three approaches alone or in combination by extending the Monod‐Wymann‐Changeux model to include additional mechanisms. Applying the model to monotherapies suggests 51% sickle hemoglobin (HbS) occupancy with an oxyHb stabilizer or lowering RBC 2,3 BPG concentrations to 1.8 mM would produce comparable polymerization protection as 30% HbF. The model predictions are consistent with observed clinical response to the oxyHb stabilizer voxelotor and the 2,3‐BPG reducer etavopivat. The model also suggests combination therapy will have added benefit in the case of dose limitations, as is the case for voxelotor, which the model predicts could be combined with 20% HbF or 2,3‐BPG reduction to 3.75 mM to reach equivalent protection as 30% HbF. The proposed model represents a unified framework that is useful in supporting decisions in preclinical and early clinical development and capable of evolving with clinical experience to gain new and increasingly confident insights into treatment strategies for SCD.",

However, the relationship between CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism and PPI‐induced nephrotoxicity is unclear. In this study, we aimed to analyze the association between the time of occurrence of renal injury by PPIs, including lansoprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, and vonoprazan, and CYP2C19 metabolizer status classified by CYP2C19 genotypes. Patients prescribed PPIs were reviewed in this retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was the time to a 30% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline. In patients treated with lansoprazole, the time to a 30% decrease in eGFR for the CYP2C19 poor metabolizer (PM) group was significantly shorter than that for the non‐PM group (hazard ratio for PM vs. non‐PM, 2.43, 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 4.87, P = 0.012). In contrast, in patients that received esomeprazole, rabeprazole, or vonoprazan, no significant differences were found in the time to a 30% decrease in eGFR between non‐PM and PM groups. The adjusted hazard ratios for the time to a 30% eGFR decrease in patients treated with lansoprazole were significantly higher for CYP2C19 PM, hypertension, and a history of myocardial infarction. In conclusion, this retrospective study showed that CYP2C19 metabolizer status was associated with the time to a 30% eGFR decrease in patients treated with lansoprazole, but not with esomeprazole, rabeprazole, or vonoprazan.",

    "abstract": "Within the European Union, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) is an important source of information for healthcare professionals and patients that allows them to understand important risks and uncertainties associated with the use of a medicine. However, the EPAR sections describing such important uncertainties can differ substantially in wording, length, and detail, thereby potentially limiting understanding. In this study, we therefore present a natural language processing approach to cluster sentences extracted from the sections on uncertainties in EPARs of centrally authorized medicines, as a steppingstone to harmonization of text describing uncertainties. We used a BERT language model together with dimensionality reduction (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)) and clustering (Density‐Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)) to identify semantic similarities between sentences. Clusters were labeled according to an overarching topic by reviewing the semantically similar sentences. Each cluster was also characterized according to medicine‐related characteristics, such as efficacy or side effects. In total, 1,648 medicines were included in this study. For 573 of these medicines (authorized July 27, 2010 to December 31, 2022), we identified an EPAR that described a complete regulatory dossier and contained sections on uncertainties. Of these, 553 EPARs could be attributed to unique active substance‐indication combinations. In these 553 EPARs, we identified 13,105 sentences in sections on uncertainties, leading to 26 clusters of which 2 were labeled as noise. The clusters and associated topics provided in this article can be used by regulators and medicine developers as a steppingstone toward a unified way of communicating uncertainties identified during the EMA process to the broader public.",

Children requiring anticoagulant therapy were enrolled into 5 age cohorts (0 to < 6 months ( N = 12), 0.5 to < 2 years ( N = 13), 2 to < 6 years ( N = 13), 6 to < 12 years ( N = 13), and 12 to < 18 years ( N = 15)) receiving tablet or oral suspension of edoxaban at doses expected to be equivalent to 30 or 60 mg once daily (q.d.) in adult subjects with VTE. Sixty‐six pediatric subjects were enrolled and completed the study. Edoxaban plasma concentration peaked between 1 and 3 hours and declined rapidly until 4–8 hours. The range of mean total apparent clearance across 5 age cohorts at low and high doses was 0.47 to 1.11 L/h/kg. The ranges of mean volume of central compartment and apparent peripheral volume were 2.31 to 3.59 L/kg and 1.92 to 4.14 L/kg, respectively. Across all age groups, the estimated median exposures were within the 0.5‐ to 1.5‐fold of the median area under the plasma drug concentration‐time curve (AUC) in adult subjects receiving corresponding doses (30 mg q.d. for low dose and 60 mg q.d. for high dose). In all age groups, PD parameters (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and anti‐Factor Xa activity) showed a linear PK‐PD relationship and were in line with previous adult data. The results support further evaluation of the pediatric doses in larger pivotal trials.",

    "abstract": "In rare diseases, such as hemophilia A, the development of accurate population pharmacokinetic (PK) models is often hindered by the limited availability of data. Most PK models are specific to a single recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) concentrate or measurement assay, and are generally unsuited for answering counterfactual (“what‐if”) queries. Ideally, data from multiple hemophilia treatment centers are combined but this is generally difficult as patient data are kept private. In this work, we utilize causal inference techniques to produce a hybrid machine learning (ML) PK model that corrects for differences between rFVIII concentrates and measurement assays. Next, we augment this model with a generative model that can simulate realistic virtual patients as well as impute missing data. This model can be shared instead of actual patient data, resolving privacy issues. The hybrid ML‐PK model was trained on chromogenic assay data of lonoctocog alfa and predictive performance was then evaluated on an external data set of patients who received octocog alfa with FVIII levels measured using the one‐stage assay. The model presented higher accuracy compared with three previous PK models developed on data similar to the external data set (root mean squared error = 14.6 IU/dL vs. mean of 17.7 IU/dL). Finally, we show that the generative model can be used to accurately impute missing data (< 18% error). In conclusion, the proposed approach introduces interesting new possibilities for model development. In the context of rare disease, the introduction of generative models facilitates sharing of synthetic data, enabling the iterative improvement of population PK models.",

The study, nested in two multicenter prospective cohort studies, focused on patients who received a mycophenolate drug and were followed up for 1–3 years. Mycophenolate mofetil MIPD was prescribed as per local practice, on a regular basis, when deemed necessary, or not at all. The MIPD group included 341 KTRs and the control group 392. At 3 years, rejection‐free survival was respectively 91.2% and 80.6% ( P < 0.001) and the cumulative incidence of rejection 5.08% vs. 12.7% per patient × year (hazard ratio = 0.49 (0.34, 0.71), P < 0.001), corresponding to a 2.5‐fold reduction. Significant association with rejection‐free survival was confirmed in patients at low or high risk of rejection ( P = 0.017 and 0.013) and in patients on tacrolimus, but not on cyclosporine ( P < 0.001 and 0.205). The mycophenolate mofetil MIPD group had significantly more adverse effects, but most occurred before the first AUC 0–12h , suggesting some may be the reason why MIPD was ordered.",

    "abstract": "Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor or adjusted‐dose prasugrel has been used for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, few studies have directly compared these two drugs. In this study, we compared the real‐world applications and outcomes of these two drugs in patients with ACS who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the data of eligible patients with ACS who had undergone PCI at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital System between June 2019 and December 2021. The primary efficacy‐related outcome was the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and the primary safety‐related outcome was major bleeding. Inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity score was performed to reduce confounding effects. The study included 2,636 patients; of them, 429 received prasugrel and 2,207 received ticagrelor. No significant between‐group difference was observed in the risk of MACE (13.1 vs. 13.1 events per 100 person‐years, respectively, hazard ratio (HR): 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71–1.43). Both groups exhibited similar rates of major bleeding (3.9 vs. 4.1 events per 100 person‐years, respectively, subdistribution HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.68–1.35). In real‐world settings, adjusted‐dose prasugrel and ticagrelor exhibit comparable safety and efficacy profiles in East Asian patients with ACS after PCI. Our findings offer valuable insights for future clinical decision making and patient management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Real‐world evidence (RWE) is increasingly considered in regulatory decision making. When, and to which extent, RWE is considered relevant by regulators likely depends on many factors. This review aimed to identify factors that make RWE necessary or desirable to inform regulatory decision making. A scoping review was conducted using literature databases (PubMed, Embase, Emcare, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) and websites of regulatory agencies, health technology assessment agencies, research institutes, and professional organizations involved with RWE. Articles were included if: (1) they discussed factors or contexts that impact whether RWE could be necessary or desirable in regulatory decision making; (2) focused on pharmacological or biological interventions in humans; and (3) considered decision making in Europe or North America, or without a focus on a specific region. We included 118 articles in the scoping review. Two major themes and six subthemes were identified. The first theme concerns questions addressable with RWE, with subthemes epidemiology and benefit–risk assessment. The second theme concerns contextual factors, with subthemes feasibility, ethical considerations, limitations of available evidence, and disease and treatment‐specific aspects. Collectively, these themes encompassed 43 factors influencing the need for RWE in regulatory decisions. Although single factors may not make RWE fully necessary, their cumulative influence could make RWE essential and pivotal in regulatory decision making. This overview contributes to ongoing discussions emphasizing the nuanced interplay of factors influencing the necessity or desirability of RWE to inform regulatory decision making.",

    "abstract": "Vancomycin continuous infusion (CI) has suggested benefits over intermittent infusion: reduced nephrotoxicity, higher target attainment, and simpler therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Empiric dosing regimens range from 30–60 mg/kg/day and it is unclear which regimen results in optimal exposure. This study evaluates whether a dosing regimen of 45 mg/kg/day after a 20 mg/kg loading dose for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50 mL/min results in adequate exposure. We retrospectively analyzed plasma concentrations from patients treated with vancomycin CI as routine clinical care between February and October 2021. Patients under 18 years old, with renal replacement therapy, reduced creatinine clearance (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration < 50 mL min/1.73 m 2 ) or outpatient antibiotic therapy were excluded. Dose, renal function, and blood draw procedures were assessed for each measured vancomycin sample. Initially, 121 samples were included. Subsequently, 7 samples, 6 of which with concentrations ≥ 40 mg/L, were verified to be incorrectly drawn and excluded. With doses of 40–50 mg/kg/day concentrations ranged from 18.4–61.0 mg/L. Only 25% were within the target window of 17–25 mg/L and 15% were ≥ 40 mg/L. Supratherapeutic concentrations were observed in 89% of samples from patients dosed 40–60 mg/kg/day with eGFR 50–80 mL/min. Concluding, an empiric dosing regimen of 45 mg/kg results in too high vancomycin exposure and thus we recommend lower doses and differentiation according to renal function. Additionally, when measuring concentrations over 40 mg/L incorrect sampling must be excluded before dose adjustment and the large variability in exposure between patients, warrants the need for swift TDM.",

    "abstract": "Thiazide diuretics, widely used in hypertension, cause a variety of adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic variants that interact with thiazide‐use to increase the risk of these adverse reactions. Using UK Biobank data, we first performed genomewide variance quantitative trait locus (vQTL) analysis of ~ 6.2 million SNPs on 95,493 unrelated hypertensive White British participants (24,313 on self‐reported bendroflumethiazide treatment at recruitment) for 2 blood (glucose and urate) and 2 urine (potassium and sodium) biomarkers. Second, we conducted direct gene–environment interaction (GEI) tests on the significant ( P < 2.5 × 10 −9 ) vQTLs, included a second UK Biobank cohort comprising 13,647 unrelated hypertensive White British participants (3,478 on thiazides other than bendroflumethiazide) and set significance at P = 0.05 divided by the number of vQTL SNPs tested for GEIs. The vQTL analysis identified eight statistically significant SNPs for blood glucose (5 SNPs) and serum urate (3 SNPs), with none being identified for the urinary biomarkers. Two of the SNPs (1 glucose SNP: CDKAL1 intron rs35612982, GEI P = 6.24 × 10 −3 ; and 1 serum urate SNP: SLC2A9 intron rs938564, GEI P = 4.51 × 10 −4 ) demonstrated significant GEI effects in the first, but not the second, cohort. Both genes are biologically plausible candidates, with the SLC2A9 ‐mediated interaction having been previously reported. In conclusion, we used a two‐stage approach to detect two biologically plausible genetic loci that can interact with thiazides to increase the risk of thiazide‐associated biochemical abnormalities. Understanding how environmental exposures (including medications such as thiazides) and genetics interact, is an important step toward precision medicine and improved patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and European national/regional health technology assessment (HTA) organizations consider the availability of existing treatments when evaluating a new drug. Since disagreement about the availability of alternative treatments may impact patient access to new drugs, this study aimed to investigate whether the EMA and HTA organizations agreed on the availability of alternative treatments and whether a lack of alternative treatments was associated with HTA organizations' added benefit assessment outcomes. For 97 innovative drugs authorized in 2019–2021 (excluding vaccines and diagnostic tools), assessments by the EMA and AEMPS (Spain), AIFA (Italy), HAS (France), IQWiG/G‐BA (Germany), NICE (England and Wales), and ZIN (the Netherlands) were identified. Until 1 June 2022, 429 HTA drug‐indication combinations were identified for these 97 drugs, of which 205 exactly matched the EMA's indication. For those, the overall agreement between the EMA and HTA organizations on whether alternative treatments were available was 87%. The agreement of HTA organizations with the EMA on whether available treatments were either pharmacological on‐label, pharmacological off‐label, or non‐pharmacological was 87%, 21%, and 57%, respectively. For all 429 HTA drug‐indication combinations, absence of alternative treatments as considered by HTA organizations was associated with a higher chance to provide added benefit: risk ratio 1.8 (95%‐CI 1.4–2.3). In conclusion, although there was high overall agreement between the EMA and HTA organizations about whether alternative treatments exist, there were differences in the types of treatment considered. Parallel joint scientific consultations could inform drug developers about relevant alternative treatments to facilitate patient access to innovative drugs.",

Model‐informed drug development strategies were applied to bridge observations from phase 2b to predictions for a proposed phase 3 study design to assess the probability of achieving the target efficacy outcome. A longitudinal exposure‐response model of the time course of the 4 Mayo subscores (rectal bleeding, stool frequency, physician's global assessment, and endoscopic subscore) in patients with UC receiving placebo or ritlecitinib was developed using population modeling approaches and an item response theory framework. The quantitative relationships between the 4 Mayo subscores accommodated the prediction of composite endpoints such as total Mayo score and partial Mayo score (key endpoints from phase 2b), and modified clinical remission and endoscopic remission (proposed phase 3 endpoints). Clinical trial simulations using the final model assessed the probability of candidate ritlecitinib dosing regimens (including those tested in phase 2b and alternative) and phase 3 study designs for achieving target efficacy outcomes benchmarked against an approved treatment for moderate‐to‐severe UC. The probabilities of achieving target modified clinical remission and endoscopic improvement outcomes at both weeks 8 and 52 for ritlecitinib 100 mg once daily was 74.8%. Model‐based assessment mitigated some of the risk associated with proceeding to pivotal phase 3 trials with dosing regimens of which there was limited clinical experience.",

    "abstract": "Safety data on the use of monoclonal antibodies inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 in pregnancy are scarce. This study queried VigiBase®, the World Health Organization global pharmacovigilance database, to search for signals of disproportionate reporting for pregnancy outcomes with alirocumab and evolocumab. As of November 22, 2023, there were 45 safety reports of exposure to evolocumab ( N = 31) and alirocumab ( N = 14) in pregnancy. Most of them originated from Europe ( N = 25, 55.6%) and were more frequently reported by healthcare professionals ( N = 35, 77.8%). Median patient age was 37 years (25th–75th percentiles; 32–41 years). Drug exposure occurred during pregnancy in 36 (80.0%) safety reports, via paternal exposure during pregnancy in four (8.9%), during lactation in three (6.7%), and in two safety reports the time of drug exposure remained unknown. Twenty safety reports (57.8%) merely reported drug exposure, while 19 (42.2%) also reported pregnancy outcomes, however, without specific maternal toxicities or patterns of birth defects. Spontaneous abortion was reported in eight safety reports without representing a signal of disproportionate reporting compared with either the full database (reporting odds ratio, ROR, 0.06 95% confidence interval, CI 0.03–0.12) or statins (ROR 0.16, 95% CI 0.08–0.32). In conclusion, this study showed that, currently, there are no signals of increased reporting of spontaneous abortion with alirocumab and evolocumab compared with the full database and statins in VigiBase®. Notwithstanding, lack of disproportionality is not synonymous with safety and, as disproportionality analyses depend on the number of safety reports that progressively accumulate in VigiBase®, they should be repeated at regular intervals to confirm the results of the present study.",

    "abstract": "HepQuant tests quantify liver function from clearance of deuterium‐ and 13C‐labeled cholates administered either intravenously and orally (SHUNT) or orally (DuO). Hepatic impairment studies have relied on clinical or laboratory criteria like Child‐Pugh classification to categorize the degree of hepatic dysfunction. We compared HepQuant tests with Child‐Pugh classification in predicting the pharmacokinetics of ampreloxetine. Twenty‐one subjects with hepatic impairment (8 Child‐Pugh A, 7 Child‐Pugh B, and 6 Child‐Pugh C), and 10 age‐ and sex‐matched controls were studied. The pharmacokinetics of ampreloxetine were measured after oral administration of a single dose of 10 mg. Disease severity index (DSI), portal‐systemic shunting (SHUNT%), hepatic reserve, and hepatic filtration rates (HFRs) were measured from serum samples obtained after intravenous administration of [24‐ 13 C]‐cholate and oral administration of [2,2,4,4‐ 2 H]cholate. Ampreloxetine plasma exposure (AUC 0‐inf ) was similar to controls in Child‐Pugh A, increased 1.7‐fold in subjects with Child‐Pugh B, and 2.5‐fold in subjects with Child‐Pugh C and correlated with both Child‐Pugh score and HepQuant parameters. The variability observed in ampreloxetine exposure (AUC 0‐inf ) in subjects with moderate (Child‐Pugh B) and severe hepatic impairment (Child‐Pugh C) was explained by HepQuant parameters. Multivariable regression models demonstrated that DSI, SHUNT%, and Hepatic Reserve from SHUNT and DuO were superior predictors of ampreloxetine exposure (AUC 0‐inf ) compared to Child‐Pugh score. HepQuant DSI, SHUNT%, and hepatic reserve were more useful predictors of drug exposure than Child‐Pugh class for ampreloxetine and thus may better optimize dose recommendations in patients with liver disease. The simple‐to‐administer, oral‐only DuO version of the HepQuant test could enhance clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Amantadine, despite being on the market for 55 years, has several unknown aspects of its pharmacokinetics especially related to the influence of covariates such as age, disease, or interactions linked to amantadine's renal elimination. As amantadine is used in Parkinson's disease and is considered a potential candidate in COVID treatment and other diseases, there is an unmet need for thorough understanding of its pharmacokinetic in special populations, such as the elderly. We aimed to mechanistically describe amantadine pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and shed some light on the differences in drug behavior between healthy volunteers (18–65 years) and an elderly/geriatric population (65–98 years) using PBPK modeling and simulation. The middle‐out PBPK model includes mechanistic description of drug renal elimination, specifically an organic cation transporter (OCT)2‐mediated electrogenic bidirectional transport (basolateral) and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE)1‐mediated efflux (apical). The model performance was verified against plasma and urine data reported after single and multiple dose administration in healthy volunteers and elderly patients from 18 independent studies. The ratios of predicted vs. observed maximal plasma concentration and area under the concentration–time curve values were within 1.25‐fold. The model illustrates that renal transporter activity is expected to decrease in healthy elderly compared to healthy volunteers, which is in line with literature proteomic data for OCT2. The model was applied to assess the potential of reaching toxicity‐related plasma concentrations in different age groups of geriatric subjects.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) has been an important tool to project safety and efficacy of novel or repurposed therapies for the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Here, we present a QSP modeling framework to predict response to antiviral therapeutics with three mechanisms of action (MoA): cell entry inhibitors, anti‐replicatives, and neutralizing biologics. We parameterized three distinct model structures describing virus‐host interaction by fitting to published viral kinetics data of untreated COVID‐19 patients. The models were used to test theoretical behaviors and map therapeutic design criteria of the different MoAs, identifying the most rapid and robust antiviral activity from neutralizing biologic and anti‐replicative MoAs. We found good agreement between model predictions and clinical viral load reduction observed with anti‐replicative nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) and neutralizing biologics bamlanivimab and casirivimab/imdevimab (REGEN‐COV®), building confidence in the modeling framework to inform a dose selection. Finally, the model was applied to predict antiviral response with ensovibep, a novel DARPin therapeutic designed as a neutralizing biologic. We developed a new in silico measure of antiviral activity, area under the curve (AUC) of free spike protein concentration, as a metric with larger dynamic range than viral load reduction. By benchmarking to bamlanivimab predictions, we justified dose levels of 75, 225, and 600 mg ensovibep to be administered intravenously in a Phase 2 clinical investigation. Upon trial completion, we found model predictions to be in good agreement with the observed patient data. These results demonstrate the utility of this modeling framework to guide the development of novel antiviral therapeutics.",

In this review, we present the factors that have contributed to this successful collaboration between relevant stakeholders and that led to a surge of activities around how regulatory science became embedded in the ecosystem of medicines research, clinical pharmacology, policymaking and regulation. We distinguished three pivotal episodes: (i) TI Pharma Escher‐project, (ii) Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board as catalyst of the big jump, and (iii) Regulatory Science Network Netherlands and multistakeholder engagement. The research agenda has been influenced by the dynamic evolution of legal frameworks in Europe, such as the EU orphan medicines legislation of 2001 and the EU pharmacovigilance legislation of 2012. All these developments have inspired and have raised pertinent regulatory sciences questions. Furthermore, clinical pharmacology as a discipline has been very influential in shaping regulatory science, contributing to discussions on the level of clinical evidence that is necessary to justify marketing approval of a new medicine. With a growing interest of multiple parties such as academics, European Medicines Agency, national agencies, patient organizations and EFPIA, connecting regulatory science activities is key.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression networks associated with placebo effects are understudied; in this study, we identified transcriptomic profiles associated with placebo responsivity. Participants suffering from chronic pain underwent a verbal suggestion and conditioning paradigm with individually tailored thermal painful stimulations to elicit conditioned placebo effects. Participants reported pain intensity on a visual analog scale (VAS) anchored from zero = no pain to 100 = maximum imaginable pain. RNA was extracted from venous blood and RNA sequencing and validation tests were performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with placebo effects, controlling for sex and level of pain. Unbiased enrichment analyses were performed to identify biological processes associated with placebo effects. Of the 10,700 protein‐coding genes that passed quality control filters, 667 were found to be associated with placebo effects (FDR <0.05). Most genes (97%) upregulated were associated with larger placebo effects. The 17 top transcriptome‐wide significant genes were further validated via RT‐qPCR in an independent cohort of chronic pain participants. Six of them ( CCDC85B , FBXL15 , HAGH , PI3 , SELENOM , and TNFRSF4 ) showed positive and significant ( P < 0.05) correlation with placebo effects in the cohort. The overall DEGs were highly enriched in regulation of expression of SLITs and ROBOs (R‐HSA‐9010553, FDR = 1.26e−33), metabolism of RNA (R‐HSA‐8953854, FDR = 1.34e−30), Huntington's disease (hsa05016, FDR = 9.84e−31), and ribosome biogenesis (GO:0042254, FDR = 2.67e−15); alternations in these pathways might jeopardize the proneness to elicit placebo effects. Future studies are needed to replicate this finding and better understand the unique molecular dynamics of people who are more or less affected by pain and placebo.",

    "abstract": "Nonracemic amisulpride (SEP‐4199) is an investigational 85:15 ratio of aramisulpride to esamisulpride and currently in clinical trials for the treatment of bipolar depression. During testing of SEP‐4199, a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) disconnect was discovered that prompted the development of a controlled‐release (CR) formulation with improved therapeutic index for QT prolongation. Observations that supported the development of a CR formulation included (i) plasma concentrations of amisulpride enantiomers were cleared within 24‐hours, but brain dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) occupancies, although achieving stable levels during this time, required 5 days to return to baseline; (ii) nonracemic amisulpride administered to non‐human primates produced significantly greater D2R occupancies during a gradual 6‐hour administration compared with a single bolus; (iii) concentration–occupancy curves were left‐shifted in humans when nonracemic amisulpride was gradually administered over 3 and 6 hours compared with immediate delivery; (iv) CR solid oral dose formulations of nonracemic amisulpride were able to slow drug dissolution in vitro and reduce peak plasma exposures in vivo in human subjects. By mathematically solving for a drug distribution step into an effect compartment, and for binding to target receptors, the discovery of a novel PK/PD model (termed here as Distribution Model) accounted for hysteresis between plasma and brain, a lack of receptor saturation, and an absence of accumulation of drug occupancy with daily doses. The PK/PD disconnect solved by the Distribution Model provided model‐informed drug development to continue in Phase III using the non‐bioequivalent CR formulation with diminished QT prolongation as dose‐equivalent to the immediate release (IR) formulation utilized in Phase II.",

In this real‐world study, we aimed to examine if the administration of presumably risky medications for G6PD‐deficient patients was followed by hemolysis. The study is based on data from Clalit Health Services database that provides inclusive health care for more than half of the Israeli population (~ 4.7 million). Within the database, we identified all G6PD‐deficient patients by G6PD <6 U/g Hb. Within the G6PD‐deficient cohort, we identified all hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of hemolysis (January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2022), validated the cases, and identified the culprit event. For the rest of the G6PD‐deficient patients with no‐hemolysis, we recorded filled prescriptions of medications listed as presumably risky. We identified 31,962 G6PD‐deficient patients. Within the cohort, there were 71 cases of major hemolysis requiring hospitalization (0.2% of the cohort), of whom 51 (71.8%) had been caused by ingestion of fava beans, six (8.5%) were associated with an infection, and three (4.2%) suggested to be associated with medications (nitrofurantoin, phenazopyridine, and a “pain killer”). Within the 31,875 patients with no major hemolysis, nitrofurantoin has been prescribed safely to 1,366 G6PD‐deficient males and females; hundreds/thousands of G6PD‐deficient patients had been prescribed safely ciprofloxacin, glibenclamide, ofloxacin, phenazopyridine, sulfamethoxazole/cotrimoxazole, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, glimepiride, mesalazine, and sulfacetamide. In this real‐world study, we are showing that a list of medications, suspected previously as carrying risks for hemolysis in G6PD‐deficient patients, have been prescribed safely to G6PD‐deficient patients, providing reassurance to patients, prescribers, and regulators.",

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a triad of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric problems. Caused by CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT), the disease involves a complex network of pathogenic mechanisms, including synaptic dysfunction, impaired autophagy, neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and extrasynaptic excitotoxicity. Although current therapies targeting the pathogenesis of HD primarily aim to reduce mHTT levels by targeting HTT DNA, RNA, or proteins, these treatments only ameliorate downstream pathogenic effects. While gene therapies, such as antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs and gene editing, have emerged in the field of HD treatment, their safety and efficacy are still under debate. Therefore, pharmacological therapy remains the most promising breakthrough, especially multi‐target/functional drugs, which have diverse pharmacological effects. This review summarizes the latest progress in HD drug development based on clinicaltrials.gov search results (Search strategy: key word “Huntington's disease” in HD clinical investigational drugs registered as of December 31, 2023), and highlights the key role of multi‐target/functional drugs in HD treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "The ability of freely available in silico tools to predict the effect of non‐synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in pharmacogenes on protein function is not well defined. We assessed the performance of seven sequence‐based (SIFT, PolyPhen2, mutation accessor, FATHMM, PhD‐SNP, MutPred2, and SNPs & Go) and five structure‐based (mCSM, SDM, DDGun, CupSat, and MAESTROweb) tools in predicting the impact of 118 nsSNPs in the CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2D6 , and DPYD genes with known function (24 normal, one increased, 42 decreased, and 51 no‐function). Sequence‐based tools had a higher median (IQR) positive predictive value (89% [89–94%] vs. 12% [10–15%], P < 0.001) and lower negative predictive value (30% [24–34%] vs. 90% [80–93%], P < 0.001) than structure‐based tools. Accuracy did not significantly differ between sequence‐based (59% [37–67%]) and structure‐based (34% [23–44%]) tools ( P = 0.070). Notably, the no‐function CYP2C9*3 allele and decreased function CYP2C9*8 allele were predicted incorrectly as tolerated by 100% of sequenced‐based tools and as stabilizing by 60% and 20% of structure‐based tools, respectively. As a case study, we performed mutational analysis for the CYP2C9*1, *3 (I359L), and *8 (R150H) proteins through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using S ‐warfarin as the substrate. The I359L variant increased the distance of the major metabolic site of S ‐warfarin to the oxy‐ferryl center of CYP2C9, and I359L and R150H caused shifts in the conformation of S ‐warfarin to a position less favorable for metabolism. These data suggest that MD simulations may better capture the impact of nsSNPs in pharmacogenes than other tools.",

We show how the two approaches fit into an evidence‐development strategy that naturally builds on the incremental insights gained.",

    "abstract": "The expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is highly variable and associated with factors, such as age, genotype, sex, and disease states. In this study, quantification of metronidazole metabolizing CYP isoforms (CYP2A6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7) in human liver microsomes from 115 children and 35 adults was performed using a quantitative proteomics method. The data confirmed age‐dependent increase in CYP2A6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 abundance, whereas, as expected, CYP3A7 abundance showed postnatal decrease with age. In particular, the fold difference (neonatal to adulthood levels) in the protein abundance of CYP2A6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 was 14, 11, and 20, respectively. In contrast, protein abundance of CYP3A7 was > 125‐fold higher in the liver microsomes of neonates than of adults. The abundance of CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 was associated with genotypes, rs4803381 and rs776746, respectively. A proteomics‐informed physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to describe the pharmacokinetics of metronidazole and its primary metabolite, 2‐hydroxymethylmetronidazole. The model revealed an increase in the metabolite‐to‐parent ratio with age and showed a strong correlation between CYP2A6 abundance and metabolite formation ( r 2 = 0.75). Notably, the estimated contribution of CYP3A7 was ~ 75% in metronidazole clearance in neonates. These data suggest that variability in CYP2A6 and CYP3A7 in younger children poses the risk of variable pharmacokinetics of metronidazole and its active metabolite with a potential impact on drug efficacy and safety. No sex‐dependent difference was observed in the protein abundance of the studied CYPs. The successful integration of hepatic CYP ontogeny data derived from a large liver bank into the pediatric PBPK model of metronidazole can be extended to other drugs metabolized by the studied CYPs.",

Current strategies predominantly focus on the therapeutic treatment of affected skeletal muscle tissue. However, certain results point to the fact that with successful treatment of skeletal muscle, DMD‐exposed latent phenotypes in tissues, such as cardiac and smooth muscle, might lead to adverse effects and even death. Likewise, it is now clear that the absence of dystrophin affects the function of the nervous system, and that this phenotype is more pronounced when shorter dystrophins are absent, in addition to the full‐length dystrophin that is present predominantly in the muscle. Here, I focus on the systemic aspects of DMD, highlighting the ubiquitous expression of the dystrophin gene in human tissues. Furthermore, I describe therapeutic strategies that have been tested in the clinic and point to unresolved questions regarding the function of distinct dystrophin isoforms, and the possibility of current therapeutic strategies to tackle phenotypes that relate to their absence.",

This work characterized the pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib in CD patients and evaluated the relationships between upadacitinib steady‐state plasma exposures and efficacy as well as safety parameters during the 12‐week induction and the 52‐week maintenance periods, to provide dosing recommendations for the treatment of CD. Upadacitinib pharmacokinetics in CD patients administered the extended‐release formulation were consistent with patient populations in other approved indications. None of the evaluated CD‐specific patient characteristics (e.g., disease location and prior gastrointestinal surgeries) had a meaningful impact on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. Exposure–response analyses during 12‐week induction treatment showed that response across all evaluated efficacy end points were approaching a plateau at median plasma exposures associated with 45 mg QD. Analyses for the maintenance period demonstrated that 30 mg QD is predicted to provide an additional 8% to 10% benefit for endoscopic response and endoscopic remission compared with 15 mg QD in patients who failed biologics. The analyses for safety showed a statistically significant relationship between increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures and the percentage of patients experiencing >2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin from Baseline during induction and showed shallow relationships for serious infections and herpes zoster during the maintenance period. These results demonstrated adequate absorption of the extended‐release formulation of upadacitinib in CD patients. The exposure–response analyses confirmed that 45 mg QD dose maximized efficacy as induction treatment and supported the selection of 15 mg QD or 30 mg QD as the maintenance doses.",

Several multinational pharmaceutical companies contributed case studies illustrating the application of the MIDD approach in practice. Training videos were created and divided into several modules: introducing the MIDD landscape for drug development and regulatory science, a review of various model types used for MIDD, discussions of how models inform drug development and regulatory decisions, future goals of MIDD, and discussions on the interconnectedness of models used for MIDD. Examples and vignettes from stakeholders and thought leaders were included. These educational materials fill a gap between academic and “on the job training” for regulators, academic, and industry scientists, delivering insights and value for those performing modeling and non‐modelers reviewing the output of modeling and simulation work. A total of 13 hours of video content is currently available. A small panel of FDA reviewers is currently beta‐testing the learning management system (LMS). Future efforts for this MIDD training initiative will include expansion of the content via an expanded and diverse faculty, 1:1 online mentorship sessions, and eventually broader access to this resource consistent with an open science approach and curriculum. The MIDD training LMS can accommodate a diverse learning ecosystem; further development may also accommodate different audiences in the future.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular tacrolimus concentration in CD3 + T lymphocytes is proposed to be a better representative of the active component of tacrolimus than the whole blood concentration. However, intracellular measurements are complicated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the relationship between intracellular and whole blood tacrolimus concentrations in a population pharmacokinetic model. Twenty‐eight de novo kidney transplant recipients, treated with a once‐daily oral extended‐release tacrolimus formulation, were followed during the first‐month post‐transplantation. Additional whole blood and intracellular tacrolimus concentrations were measured at day 6 ± 1 (pre‐dose, 4 and 8 hours post‐dose) and day 14 ± 3 (pre‐dose) post‐transplantation. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling software (NONMEM). The ratio between intracellular ( n = 109) and whole blood ( n = 248) concentrations was best described by a two‐compartment whole blood model with an additional intracellular compartment without mass transfer from the central compartment. The ratio remained stable over time. Prednisolone dose influenced the absorption rate of tacrolimus, while hemoglobin, CYP3A4*22 allele carrier, and CYP3A5 expresser status were associated with the oral clearance of tacrolimus ( P ‐value < 0.001). Furthermore, the intracellular tacrolimus concentrations were correlated with the intracellular production of interleukin‐2 ( P ‐value 0.015). The intracellular tacrolimus concentration can be predicted from a measured whole blood concentration using this model, without the need for repeated intracellular measurements. This knowledge is particularly important when the intracellular concentration is ready to be implemented into clinical practice, to overcome the complexities of cell isolation and analytical methods.",

A total of 196 patients were enrolled for primary outcome analysis. Compared to medium‐concentration group, only the very low‐concentration group obtained significant inferior primary outcomes, including overall remission rate, relapse‐free survival rate, and relapse rate at 6 months. For secondary outcomes, the very low‐concentration group experienced more frequent treatment failure in 12 months, whereas the high‐concentration group suffered a higher risk of adverse events than the medium‐concentration group. For steroid‐resistant NS, very low‐ and low‐concentration groups required longer time to achieve remission compared to medium‐concentration group. For steroid‐sensitive NS, the very low‐concentration group suffered a higher relapse frequency than medium‐concentration group. Lastly, the dose of tacrolimus required for children with different CYP3A5 genotypes with or without Wuzhi capsules was analyzed. In conclusion, tacrolimus may be targeted to C 0 of 4–7 ng/mL during the first 6 months in children with NS. For steroid‐resistant NS, C 0 of 5–7 ng/mL can achieve a rapid remission.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a new type of drug lag, known as “drug loss” has emerged in Japan. It is a condition where the development of a drug approved in other countries has not been initiated in Japan. For 265 new drugs approved in the United States or Europe during 2010–2020, only 31% had commenced development in Japan as of December 31, 2020. A characteristic feature of Japanese guidelines on new drug development is that, in principle, clinical trial data in Japanese participants are required in each study phase. Given key players in new drug development are shifting from large pharmaceutical companies to emerging biopharma companies, primarily based outside Japan, the necessity for Japanese data may contribute to the drug lag. This study aimed to clarify the guideline adherence to new drug applications in Japan. Of the 159 new drugs approved in Japan between April 2019 and March 2024, the clinical data packages for almost all drugs included both pharmacokinetic (PK) data and efficacy and safety data in Japanese participants, irrespective of the study phase or design. We identified three flexible development approaches: the absence of Japanese dose–response data (39.6%), absence of Japanese confirmatory data generated from phase III randomized controlled trials (35.2%), and post‐hoc Japanese PK data (43.0%, 34/79). Biologics, orphan drug designation, antineoplastic agents, and same applicant and originator were identified as factors significantly associated with these flexibilities. The results will help foreign companies, including emerging biopharmas, in formulating effective new drug development strategies, potentially alleviating the drug lag in Japan.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have studied potential corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation from drug–drug interactions (DDIs), raising unresolved questions about their real‐world impact. This retrospective case‐crossover study investigated the effects of QT‐prolonging drugs and DDIs on QTc prolongation in hospitalized patients aged 45 years and above. The cohort comprised patients who had multiple hospitalizations and developed QTc prolongation (QTc > 500 ms or an increase of >60 ms from baseline) at least 24 hours after admission between 2011 and 2019. Conditional logistic regression compared drug exposure between hospitalizations with QTc prolongation (case window) and those without (reference window). Among 2,276 patients (mean age 71; 43.8% female), the use of QT‐prolonging drugs significantly increased the risk of QTc prolongation (odds ratio: 2.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.95–3.02)). The risk was higher with drugs of “known risks” (OR: 3.78 (2.91–4.90)) and “conditional risk” (OR: 2.08 (1.65–2.62)). DDIs, particularly involving multiple “known risk” drugs (OR: 7.86 (4.96–12.45)), strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors (OR: 5.57 (2.75–11.30)), or the concurrent use of ≥4 QT‐prolonging drugs with any risk (OR: 5.28 (3.96–7.03)) substantially increased the risk. Cautious prescribing for patients with multiple risk factors is important to minimize the likelihood of QTc prolongation. However, when considering enhanced monitoring or drug choices, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the overall risk of QT prolongation against the benefits of treatment to ensure optimal patient care.",

    "abstract": "Physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling offers a viable approach to predict induction drug–drug interactions (DDIs) with the potential to streamline or reduce clinical trial burden if predictions can be made with sufficient confidence. In the current work, the ability to predict the effect of rifampin, a well‐characterized strong CYP3A4 inducer, on 20 CYP3A probes with publicly available PBPK models (often developed using a workflow with optimization following a strong inhibitor DDI study to gain confidence in fraction metabolized by CYP3A4, f m,CYP3A4 , and fraction available after intestinal metabolism, Fg), was assessed. Substrates with a range of f m,CYP3A4 (0.086–1.0), Fg (0.11–1.0) and hepatic availability (0.09–0.96) were included. Predictions were most often accurate for compounds that are not P‐gp substrates or that are P‐gp substrates but that have high permeability. Case studies for three challenging DDI predictions (i.e., for eliglustat, tofacitinib, and ribociclib) are presented. Along with parameter sensitivity analysis to understand key parameters impacting DDI simulations, alternative model structures should be considered, for example, a mechanistic absorption model instead of a first‐order absorption model might be more appropriate for a P‐gp substrate with low permeability. Any mechanisms pertinent to the CYP3A substrate that rifampin might impact (e.g., induction of other enzymes or P‐gp) should be considered for inclusion in the model. PBPK modeling was shown to be an effective tool to predict induction DDIs with rifampin for CYP3A substrates with limited mechanistic complications, increasing confidence in the rifampin model. While this analysis focused on rifampin, the learnings may apply to other inducers.",

    "abstract": "Methadone has a high potential for risky drug–drug interactions that can lead to opioid overdose, yet evidence on the magnitude of this risk remains limited. Since methadone is transported via P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp), the use of statins that inhibit P‐gp may elevate methadone plasma concentrations, potentially leading to opioid overdose. We explored this hypothesis by examining whether concomitant use of methadone and P‐gp‐inhibiting statins was associated with opioid overdose. Using Medicaid claims data from 2003 to 2020, we conducted a cohort study among new concomitant users of methadone and statins. We compared overdose rates among individuals exposed to P‐gp‐inhibiting statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, or lovastatin) vs. those exposed to rosuvastatin (negative control), adjusting for baseline covariates. We identified 69,263 individuals newly exposed to methadone and a statin of interest; the overall incidence rate of opioid overdose was 26.0 per 1,000 person‐years. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for methadone + P‐gp‐inhibiting statins consistently showed no association, ranging from 0.76 (95% CI = 0.48–1.22) for atorvastatin to 0.78 (95% CI = 0.50–1.22) for simvastatin, compared with methadone + rosuvastatin. Similar results were observed in sensitivity analysis that treated all P‐gp‐inhibiting statins as a single exposure group, as well as analyses stratified by baseline diagnosis of opioid use disorder or overdose, the duration of baseline methadone use, and calendar year intervals. Our findings suggest that concomitant use of methadone with simvastatin, atorvastatin, or lovastatin is not associated with the risk of opioid overdose compared to concomitant use of methadone and rosuvastatin.",

In 2015, FDA formed the NTI Drug Working Group to develop a consistent approach to identify NTI drugs and resolve NTI‐related scientific and regulatory issues in a transparent and collaborative manner. One key objective of the NTI Drug Working Group is to evaluate potential NTI drugs based on five general characteristics of NTI drugs as highlighted in the case example for theophylline drug products. As of January 5, 2024, there are 33 drug products, with 14 distinct active ingredients, specified as NTI drugs in their respective product‐specific guidances (PSGs) for generic drug development. Future collaborative efforts with other agencies to harmonize the terms and definitions for NTI drugs may help enhance clarity and consistency during the drug development and the regulatory review process.",

    "abstract": "In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), infections represent a significant concern, particularly given the immunomodulatory effects of disease‐modifying agents (DMAs). High‐efficacy DMAs (heDMAs) play a pivotal role in delaying MS progression, yet their use also raises concerns regarding the risk of infection. This study aimed to compare the infection risk with the use of heDMA and moderate‐efficacy disease‐modifying agents (meDMAs) in MS patients. This retrospective cohort study involved adult (18–64 years) MS patients with incident DMA use based on the 2015–2019 MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. Patients initiating heDMAs (natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and ocrelizumab) or meDMAs (interferon beta‐1a, interferon beta‐1b, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, and glatiramer acetate) were included. The outcomes of interest were comparative risk of overall infection, serious infection, and frequently reported types of infection. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated in inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) based on Cox proportional hazard models. Among 10,003 eligible incident DMA users, 22.92% of patients initiated heDMAs. The IPTW‐CPH model revealed that patients with heDMAs were associated with a higher risk of serious infection (aHR: 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06–1.44) and urinary tract infection (UTI; aHR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.14–1.30). Sensitivity analyses with different follow‐up periods yielded consistent findings with the main analyses. In MS, heDMAs were associated with a greater risk of serious infection and UTI compared with meDMAs. These findings suggest the need to carefully monitor and manage the infection risk to optimize the use of heDMAs in MS.",

    "abstract": "Direct measurement of spatial–temporal drug penetration and exposure in the human central nervous system (CNS) and brain tumors is difficult or infeasible. This study aimed to develop an innovative mechanistic modeling platform for quantitative prediction of spatial pharmacokinetics of systemically administered drugs in the human CNS and brain tumors. A nine‐compartment CNS (9‐CNS) physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic model was developed to account for general anatomical structure and pathophysiological heterogeneity of the human CNS and brain tumors. Drug distribution into and within the CNS and tumors is driven by plasma concentration–time profiles and governed by drug properties and CNS pathophysiology. The model was validated by comparisons of model predictions and clinically observed data of six drugs (abemaciclib, ribociclib, pamiparib, olaparib, temuterkib, and ceritinib) in glioblastoma patients. As rigorously validated, the 9‐CNS model allows reliable prediction of spatial pharmacokinetics in different regions of the brain parenchyma (i.e., parenchyma adjacent to CSF and deep parenchyma), tumors (i.e., tumor rim, bulk tumor, and tumor core), and CSF (i.e., ventricular CSF, cranial and spinal subarachnoid CSF). By considering inter‐individual plasma pharmacokinetic variability and CNS/tumor heterogeneity, the model well predicts the inter‐individual variability and spatial heterogeneity of drug exposure in the CNS and tumors as observed for all six drugs in glioblastoma patients. The 9‐CNS model is a first‐of‐its kind, mechanism‐based computational modeling platform that enables early reliable prediction of spatial CNS and tumor pharmacokinetics based on plasma concentration–time profiles. It provides a valuable tool to assist rational drug development and treatment for brain cancer.",

    "abstract": "While drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and their pharmacokinetic (PK) mechanisms are well‐studied prior to drug approval, severe adverse drug reactions (SADRs) caused by DDIs often remain underrecognized due to limitations in pre‐marketing clinical trials. To address this gap, our study utilized a literature database, applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and conducted multi‐source electronic health record (EHR) validation to uncover underrecognized DDI‐SADR signals that warrant further investigation. PubMed abstracts related to DDIs from January 1962 to December 2023 were retrieved. We utilized PubTator Central for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify drugs and SADRs and employed SciFive for Relation Extraction (RE) to extract DDI‐SADR signals. The extracted signals were cross‐referenced with the DrugBank database and validated using logistic regression, considering risk factors including patient demographics, drug usage, and comorbidities, based on EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the All of Us research program. From 160,321 abstracts, we identified 111 DDI‐SADR signals. Seventeen were statistically significant (13 by one EHR and 4 by both EHR databases), with 9 being previously not recorded in the DrugBank. These included methadone‐ciprofloxacin‐respiratory depression, oxycodone‐fluvoxamine‐clonus, tramadol‐fluconazole‐hallucination, simvastatin‐fluconazole‐rhabdomyolysis, ibrutinib‐amiodarone‐atrial fibrillation, fentanyl‐diltiazem‐delirium, clarithromycin‐voriconazole‐acute kidney injury, colchicine‐cyclosporine‐rhabdomyolysis, and methadone‐voriconazole‐arrhythmia (odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.9 to 35.83, with P ‐values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.017). Utilizing NLP to extract DDI‐SADRs from Biomedical Literature and validating these findings through multiple‐source EHRs represents a pioneering approach in pharmacovigilance. This method uncovers clinically relevant SADRs resulting from DDIs that were not evident in pre‐marketing trials or the existing DDI knowledge base.",

    "abstract": "Adagrasib is a potent, highly selective, orally available, small molecule, covalent inhibitor of G12C mutated KRAS. As both a substrate and strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, adagrasib inhibits its own CYP3A4‐mediated metabolism following multiple dosing, resulting in time‐dependent drug–drug interaction (DDI) liabilities. A physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed and verified using a combination of physicochemical, in vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data from healthy volunteers and cancer patients. The PBPK model well‐described the single and multiple‐dose adagrasib PK data as well as DDI data with itraconazole, rifampin, midazolam, warfarin, dextromethorphan, and digoxin, with model predictions within 1.5‐fold of the observed clinical data. The PBPK model was used to predict untested scenarios including the clinical victim and perpetrator DDI liabilities at the approved dosing regimen of 600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) in cancer patients. Strong, moderate, and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 are predicted to have a negligible effect on the steady‐state exposure of adagrasib 600 mg b.i.d. resulting from the significant inactivation of CYP3A4 by adagrasib. Additionally, strong and moderate inducers of CYP3A4 are predicted to decrease adagrasib exposure by 68% and 22%, respectively. As a perpetrator, adagrasib 600 mg b.i.d. is predicted to be a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, and an inhibitor of P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp). These results successfully supported regulatory interactions with the United States Food and Drug Administration regarding dosing recommendations for when adagrasib is used concomitantly with other medications, supporting a range of label claims in lieu of clinical trials.",

After screening titles and abstracts, full articles investigating the clinical implementation of MIPD were included for data extraction. Of 790 records identified, 15 publications were included. A total of 72 barriers and facilitators across seven categories were extracted through a hybrid thematic analysis. Barriers comprised limited data for model validation, unclear regulatory pathways for model endorsement and additional drug level measurements required for certain types of MIPD. Facilitators encompassed the development of user‐friendly MIPD tools continuously updated based on user feedback and data. Collaborative efforts among diverse stakeholders for model validation and implementation, along with education of end‐users, may promote the utilization of MIPD in patient care. Despite ongoing challenges, this systematic review revealed various strategies to facilitate the clinical implementation of MIPD.",

    "abstract": "Atazanavir has been reported to increase total serum bilirubin level up to ninefold. It is widely believed that the observed total bilirubin elevation is primarily due to UGT1A1 inhibition. However, UGT enzymes are well‐known as a low‐affinity and high‐capacity system, and the observed drug–drug interaction mediated by UGTs is usually less than twofold. There were discrepancies in the explanation of total bilirubin elevation due to UGT1A1 inhibition alone, suggesting the contribution of other mechanism(s) to the interaction. As atazanavir is a potent OATP1B1/3 inhibitor and the hepatic uptake of both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin are mediated by OATP1B1/3, these transporters could be involved in the bilirubin–atazanavir interaction. To better understand the roles of UGT1A1 and OATP1B1/3 in this interaction, it would be useful to characterize the contribution of each individual pathway to the interaction. As multiple compounds, pathways, and potentially UGT1A1 polymorphism are involved, a thorough physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) analysis was utilized to integrate the information from various relevant in vitro and clinical studies to quantitatively estimate the contribution of UGT1A1 and OATP1B1/3 inhibition to the interaction between bilirubin and atazanavir. The PBPK analysis indicated that UGT1A1 inhibition plays a modest role in bilirubin and atazanavir interaction contributing less than 33%. The results also suggested that unconjugated bilirubin is less sensitive than raltegravir upon UGT1A1 inhibition, therefore, unconjugated bilirubin may not be a useful endogenous biomarker for UGT1A1 inhibition. The analysis demonstrated that the metabolism of unconjugated bilirubin shares common features of other UGT enzyme‐mediated reactions.",

    "abstract": "Bisacodyl is a widely used laxative that stimulates both motility and secretion. Our aim was to exploit the unique capabilities of MRI to define bisacodyl's mode of action. Two placebo‐controlled cross‐over trials were performed, one using a single dose of Bisacodyl 5 mg while the second dosed daily for 3 consecutive days. Serial MRI was performed every 75 minutes. Primary endpoint: ascending colon water content as assessed by T1AC AUC 300–450 minutes . Secondary endpoints included: small bowel water content, whole gut transit time (WGTT), colonic volumes, stool frequency, and consistency using Bristol Stool Form Score (BSFS). Exploratory endpoints: changes in the serial segmental volumes were quantified from the number of “mass movements” defined as episodes when segmental volume change from the previous scan was > 20% of baseline volume. We also measure the time to defecate after dosing. After 3 days of bisacodyl, ascending colon water content (T1) was 62% greater than after placebo, mean difference T1 AUC 300–450 minutes 50.2 (61.0) sec.min, 95% CI (9.2, 91.2), P = 0.02, while after a single dose difference was only 11% ( P = 0.58). Both single and repeated doses shortened WGTT ( P < 0.049) and time to defecate ( P 0.01). Only repeated doses significantly increased small bowel water content ( P < 0.03), the number of “mass movements” ( P = 0.048), bowel frequency ( P = 0.006), and BSFS ( P = 0.03). Repeated, compared to single dosing of Bisacodyl, additionally increases small bowel and colon water content and increases the number of “mass movements” thereby increasing its laxative effect. MRI is a non‐invasive, patient‐acceptable technique for evaluating drugs which alter secretion and/or motility.",

The population pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of axatilimab were characterized in healthy participants and patients with solid tumors or cGVHD using data from four clinical studies with 325 participants, including 278 patients with cGVHD. The model structure reflected the mechanism of action of axatilimab: blocking CSF‐1R signaling with axatilimab reduces the circulating levels of cells in the mononuclear phagocytic cell lineage (including nonclassical monocytic cells (NCMCs) and Kupffer cells), resulting in increases in circulating enzymes owing to reduced clearance by Kupffer cells. The structural model consisted of a two‐compartment axatilimab PK model and turnover PD models for CSF‐1, NCMCs, aspartate transaminase (AST), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Axatilimab PK and CSF‐1 equations also included saturable clearance components to reflect the competitive binding of axatilimab and CSF‐1 to CSF‐1R. Covariate search was conducted with the conditional sampling use for the stepwise approach based on correlation tests (COSSAC) approach. Covariate effects on model parameters, steady‐state axatilimab exposure, and NCMC concentrations were assessed. The final population PK/PD model was mathematically described with 6 ordinary differential equations and 39 model parameters. Among the 11 statistically significant covariates, one (body weight) and two (participant population type and baseline CPK) covariates affected axatilimab steady‐state exposure and steady‐state NCMC levels by > 20%, respectively. These results informed the axatilimab dosing strategy in patients with cGVHD.",

    "abstract": "The US Food and Drug Administration can require risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) programs for prescription drugs to ensure the benefits of use outweigh the risks. We conducted a national survey of physicians' experiences prescribing eight REMS‐covered drugs: (1) ambrisentan; (2) bosentan; (3) clozapine; (4) isotretinoin; (5–7) the multiple myeloma (MM) drugs lenalidomide, pomalidomide, thalidomide; and (8) sodium oxybate. Between May 2022 and January 2023, we surveyed 5,331 physician prescribers of these drugs, and 1,295 (24%) returned surveys (range: 149 for bosentan to 226 for MM drugs). Although 765 (68%) respondents thought the certification process provided useful drug information, 757 (67%) wanted materials to include benefit data and 944 (84%) non‐REMS‐related risk data. A majority (704, 63%) thought the safe use requirements facilitated discussion with patients, but a similar number (637, 57%) attributed delayed medication access to these requirements. In multivariable modeling, MM drug and isotretinoin respondents were less likely than sodium oxybate respondents to agree that the certification process provided useful drug information (MM drug: odds ratio (OR) = 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.25–0.55; isotretinoin: OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.25–0.61), and isotretinoin, clozapine, and bosetan respondents were more likely than sodium oxybate respondents to agree that the safe use requirements often delayed medication access (isotretinoin: OR = 5.83, 95% CI = 3.70–9.19; clozapine: OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.08–2.54; bosentan: OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.12–2.85). Most physicians believe REMS programs convey useful drug safety information and facilitate discussion with patients but also seek information on benefits and non‐REMS‐related risks and better integration of REMS processes into clinical workflows.",

    "abstract": "With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, there is growing interest in utilizing adaptive platform clinical trials (APTs), in which multiple drugs are compared with a single common control group, such as a placebo or standard‐of‐care group. APTs evaluate several drugs for one disease and accept additions or exclusions of drugs as the trials progress; however, little is known about the efficiency of APTs over multiple stand‐alone trials. In this study, we simulated the total development period, total sample size, and statistical operating characteristics of APTs and multiple stand‐alone trials in drug development settings for hospitalized patients with COVID‐19. Simulation studies using selected scenarios reconfirmed several findings regarding the efficiency of APTs. The APTs without staggered addition of drugs showed a shorter total development period than stand‐alone trials, but the difference rapidly diminished if patient's enrollment was accelerated during the trials owing to the spread of infection. APTs with staggered addition of drugs still have the possibility of reducing the total development period compared with multiple stand‐alone trials in some cases. Our study demonstrated that APTs could improve efficiency relative to multiple stand‐alone trials regarding the total development period and total sample size without undermining statistical validity; however, this improvement varies depending on the speed of patient enrollment, sample size, presence/absence of family‐wise error rate adjustment, allocation ratio between drug and placebo groups, and interval of staggered addition of drugs. Given the complexity of planning and implementing APT, the decision to implement APT during a pandemic must be made carefully.",

A prospective, two‐armed, single‐blind, randomized controlled trial compared management aided by a web‐based dose calculator (NextDose) with standard clinical care. Participants were 240 adults receiving warfarin therapy following cardiac surgery, followed up until the first outpatient appointment at least 3 months after warfarin initiation. We compared the percentage of time spent in the international normalized ratio acceptable range (%TIR) during the first 28 days following warfarin initiation, and %TIR and count of bleeding events over the entire follow‐up period. Two hundred thirty‐four participants were followed up to day 28 (NextDose: 116 and standard of care: 118), and 228 participants (114 per arm) were followed up to the final study visit. Median %TIR tended to be higher for participants receiving NextDose guided warfarin management during the first 28 days (63 vs. 56%, P = 0.13) and over the entire follow‐up period (74 vs. 71%, P = 0.04). The hazard of clinically relevant minor bleeding events was lower for participants in the NextDose arm (hazard ratio: 0.21, P = 0.041). In NextDose, there were 89.3% of proposed doses accepted by prescribers. NextDose guided dose management in cardiac surgery patients requiring warfarin was associated with an increase in %TIR across the full follow‐up period and fewer hemorrhagic events. A theory‐based, pharmacologically guided approach facilitates higher quality warfarin anticoagulation. An important practical benefit is a reduced requirement for clinical experience of warfarin management.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation decreases the activity of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain (NOD)‐like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is responsible for regulating the inflammatory response, and its genetic polymorphisms have been linked to inflammatory diseases such as asthma. However, there have been few studies on the effect of NLRP3 on CYP3A activity. We aimed to investigate the association between polymorphisms in the NLRP3 gene and plasma 4β‐hydroxycholesterol (4βOHC), an endogenous marker of CYP3A activity, in patients with asthma. In this observational study including 152 adult asthma patients, we analyzed 10 NLRP3 gene single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Plasma 4βOHC levels were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The results showed that five SNPs were associated with significantly lower plasma 4βOHC concentrations. Among these SNPs, rs3806265, rs4612666, rs1539019, and rs10733112 contributed to a significant increase in plasma IL‐6 concentrations. Moreover, a multivariate regression model showed that the rs3806265 TT, rs4612666 CC, rs1539019 AA, and rs10733112 TT genotypes were significant factors for decreased plasma 4βOHC, even after including patient background factors and CYP3A5 *3 (rs776746) gene polymorphisms as covariates. These results were also observed when plasma 4βOHC concentrations were corrected for cholesterol levels. We conclude that NLRP3 gene polymorphisms are involved in increasing plasma IL‐6 concentrations and decreasing plasma 4βOHC concentrations in patients with asthma. Therefore, NLRP3 gene polymorphisms may be a predictive marker of CYP3A activity in inflammatory diseases such as asthma.",

    "abstract": "Tamoxifen is widely used in patients with hormone receptor‐positive breast cancer. The polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for metabolic activation of tamoxifen, resulting in substantial interindividual variability of plasma concentrations of its most important metabolite, Z‐endoxifen. The Z‐endoxifen concentration thresholds below which tamoxifen treatment is less efficacious have been proposed but not validated, and prospective trials of individualized tamoxifen treatment to achieve Z‐endoxifen concentration thresholds are considered infeasible. Therefore, we aim to validate the association between Z‐endoxifen concentration and tamoxifen treatment outcomes, and identify a Z‐endoxifen concentration threshold of tamoxifen efficacy, using pharmacometric modeling and simulation. As a first step, the CYP2D6 Endoxifen Percentage Activity Model (CEPAM) cohort was created by pooling data from 28 clinical studies (> 7,000 patients) with measured endoxifen plasma concentrations. After cleaning, data from 6,083 patients were used to develop a nonlinear mixed‐effect (NLME) model for tamoxifen and Z‐endoxifen pharmacokinetics that includes a conversion factor to allow inclusion of studies that measured total endoxifen but not Z‐endoxifen. The final parent‐metabolite NLME model confirmed the primary role of CYP2D6, and contributions from body weight, CYP2C9 phenotype, and co‐medication with CYP2D6 inhibitors, on Z‐endoxifen pharmacokinetics. Future work will use the model to simulate Z‐endoxifen concentrations in patients receiving single agent tamoxifen treatment within large prospective clinical trials with long‐term survival to identify the Z‐endoxifen concentration threshold below which tamoxifen is less efficacious. Identification of this concentration threshold would allow personalized tamoxifen treatment to improve outcomes in patients with hormone receptor‐positive breast cancer.",

The clinical effects of SSTR5 antagonism remain unknown. Herein, we evaluated the effects of SCO‐240, an oral SSTR5 antagonist, in healthy individuals. This randomized, single‐center, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase I study included healthy Japanese and White individuals. The effects of ascending single oral doses of SCO‐240 were evaluated in healthy individuals. The main outcome measures were safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics (gallbladder contractions and levels of serum insulin and plasma glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1)). The levels of pituitary hormones were evaluated in our exploratory analysis. The results indicated that SCO‐240 was safe and well‐tolerated at all tested doses. Oral SCO‐240 was readily absorbed, with its systemic exposure increasing in a dose‐dependent manner. The median time to maximum concentration and mean terminal half‐life of SCO‐240 were 3–4 and 10.2–12.6 hours, respectively, in the ascending dose section. No clinically meaningful changes in SCO‐240 pharmacokinetic profiles were observed between fed and fasted or between Japanese and White individuals. No increase in gallbladder contractions or levels of insulin and GLP‐1 were detected. SCO‐240 induced robust growth hormone (GH) secretion without altering the levels of other pituitary hormones. In conclusion, the study is the first to demonstrate that SSTR5 antagonism stimulates GH secretion in humans. SCO‐240 was safe and well‐tolerated and exhibited once‐daily oral dosing potential. The robust effects of SCO‐240 on GH secretion suggest that it may be a treatment option for GH‐related disorders.",

Here, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for identifying drug–drug interaction (DDI) signals and differentiating between individual drug and drug combination signals. This framework is coupled with a systems pharmacology approach for automated biological plausibility assessment. Integrating statistical and biological evidence, our method achieves a 16.5% improvement (AUC: from 0.620 to 0.722) with drug‐target‐adverse event associations, 16.0% (AUC: from 0.580 to 0.673) with drug enzyme, and 15.0% (AUC: from 0.568 to 0.653) with drug transporter information. Applying this approach to detect potential DDI signals of QT prolongation and rhabdomyolysis within the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), we emphasize the significance of systems pharmacology in enhancing statistical signal detection in pharmacovigilance. Our study showcases the promise of data‐driven biological plausibility assessment in the context of challenging post‐marketing DDI surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Warfarin dosing remains challenging due to substantial inter‐individual variability, which can lead to unsafe or ineffective therapy with standard dosing. Model‐informed precision dosing (MIPD) can help individualize warfarin dosing, requiring the selection of a suitable model. For models developed from clinical data, the dependence on the study design and population raises questions about generalizability. Quantitative system pharmacology (QSP) models promise better extrapolation abilities; however, their complexity and lack of validation on clinical data raise questions about applicability in MIPD. We have previously derived a mechanistic warfarin/international normalized ratio (INR) model from a blood coagulation QSP model. In this article, we evaluated the predictive performance of the warfarin/INR model in the context of MIPD using an external dataset with INR data from patients starting warfarin treatment. We assessed the accuracy and precision of model predictions, benchmarked against an empirically based reference model. Additionally, we evaluated covariate contributions and assessed the predictive performance separately in the more challenging outpatient data. The warfarin/INR model performed comparably to the reference model across various measures despite not being calibrated with warfarin initiation data. Including CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotypes as covariates improved the prediction quality of the warfarin/INR model, even after assimilating 4 days of INR data. The outpatient INR exhibited higher unexplained variability, and predictions slightly exceeded observed values, suggesting that model adjustments might be necessary when transitioning from an inpatient to an outpatient setting. Overall, this research underscores the potential of QSP‐derived models for MIPD, offering a complementary approach to empirical model development.",

    "abstract": "The endothelin A receptor antagonist zibotentan, combined with the sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, is being investigated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease with high proteinuria. To allow women of childbearing potential access to this treatment, highly effective contraception is required and drug interactions compromising contraception reliability must be avoided. This study investigated the risk of pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between zibotentan and the contraceptives ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. A single‐sequence, within‐participant comparison study was conducted in 24 healthy women of non‐childbearing potential, comparing the PK of ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel alone and with zibotentan. Single oral doses of 0.06 mg ethinyl estradiol/0.3 mg levonorgestrel were administered on Days 1 and 15; zibotentan 10 mg was dosed orally, once‐daily through Days 6–19. PK profiles were determined and ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel PK was compared between Day 1 and 15 based on geometric least‐squares mean ratios of PK parameters, including maximum observed concentration ( C max ) and area under the plasma concentration–time curve from zero to infinity (AUC inf ). Co‐administration with zibotentan did not affect ethinyl estradiol PK (geometric mean ratio [90% confidence interval] C max 1.05 [0.99–1.11], AUC inf 1.00 [0.96–1.05]), while a weak interaction (increased exposure) was observed for levonorgestrel ( C max 1.12 [1.02–1.23], AUC inf 1.30 [1.21–1.39]), which was regarded as without clinical relevance. Plasma exposure of ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel was not reduced by multiple‐dose zibotentan. In conclusion, contraception containing ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel is regarded possible under zibotentan‐containing treatments. This expands choices for women of childbearing potential, supporting diversity in the ZENITH High Proteinuria trial.",

    "abstract": "Building trust in public health agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become a key government priority. Understanding the roots of FDA mistrust is important if the agency is to develop targeted messaging and reforms aimed at building confidence in the agency. We conducted a survey of 2,021 respondents in the US probing attitudes toward the FDA. The primary outcome was FDA trust, defined as the mean score that each respondent assigned to the FDA across four prespecified axes: (1) competence and effectiveness; (2) commitment to acting in the best interests of the American public; (3) abiding by the rules and regulations set forth by policy or law; and (4) expertise in health, science, and medicine. On multivariable ordinal logistic regression, FDA mistrust was associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–0.88), rural community (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75–0.96), conservative political views (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.74–0.81), worse self‐reported health (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80–0.98), lower satisfaction with health care received (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.56–0.71), less attention to health and science news (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64–0.80), and not having children under the age of 18 (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60–0.86). These findings underscore the challenges faced by US political leaders in convincing a heterogeneous American public to trust the FDA. The FDA should develop and deploy targeted outreach strategies to populations with lower levels of trust and strengthen internal processes that minimize biases and ensure sound decision‐making.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the combined influence of pregnancy and genetic polymorphisms on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) of women receiving antiretroviral therapy. Women receiving efavirenz‐containing antiretroviral therapy were recruited from two hospitals in Nigeria during 2017–2020. Sparse CVF and plasma samples were obtained during pregnancy to assess the possible association between drug concentration and CYP2B6 polymorphisms (stage I). Participants were stratified into three CYP2B6 516G>T ( rs3745274) genotype groups and re‐enrolled for intensive pharmacokinetic sampling (stage II). Overall, 159 women (142 pregnant and 12 postpartum) contributed samples in stage I (88 CVF, 81 plasma and 73 paired). CYP2B6 516G>T (rs3745274) remained independently associated with log 10 efavirenz CVF concentration during pregnancy after adjusting for plasma concentration, with β (Log 10 efavirenz concentration, 95%CI) of 0.204 (0.027, 0.382), P = 0.025). Median (IQR) efavirenz C min in CVF during pregnancy ( n = 12) vs. postpartum ( n = 12) was 243 ng/mL (168–402) vs. 447 ng/mL (159–974), C max was 1,031 ng/mL (595–1,771) vs. 1,618 ng/mL (675–2,695), and AUC 0‐24h was 16,465 ng.h/mL (9,356–30,417) vs. 30,715 ng.h/mL (10,980–43,714). CVF‐to‐plasma AUC ratio was 0.36 during pregnancy and 0.46 postpartum. Upon stratification, efavirenz clearance during pregnancy was 57.9% higher than postpartum in patients with the CYP2B6 516GT genotype; the AUC 0‐24h and C max were 33.8% and 8.6% lower, respectively. Efavirenz C min in CVF exceeded the protein binding‐adjusted IC 90 (PBIC 90 ) of 126 ng/mL during pregnancy and postpartum. Efavirenz is well distributed into the CVF; both pregnancy and CYP2B6 polymorphisms affect the extent of exposure.",

    "abstract": "Alnuctamab, a B‐cell maturation antigen (BCMA)‐targeting T‐cell engager, has demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity in the phase I study CC‐93269‐MM‐001 treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Identification of a recommended Phase III dose (RP3D) was a key objective, as such population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) and exposure–response analysis was critical. Intravenous (IV) alnuctamab was administered in fixed doses (0.15–10 mg) or in step‐up doses to a maximum 10‐mg target dose. Subcutaneous (SC) step‐up doses of 3 and 6 mg were followed by a target dose range of 10–60 mg. Concentration data from IV and SC alnuctamab administration was pooled and was well described by a two‐compartment PopPK model with first‐order absorption and elimination. Covariate analysis determined that the inclusion of baseline soluble BCMA (sBCMA) on clearance significantly improved model fitting. Individual exposure parameters were estimated from the final model to characterize exposure–response relationships. Switching from IV to SC administration improved the safety profile of alnuctamab by limiting the frequency of grade ≥2 CRS events. A significant exposure–CRS relationship was observed after the first SC dose, but not subsequent dose administrations. Exposure–safety analysis did not find a statistically significant relationship between increasing exposure and the probability of key safety events of interest. Logistic regression analysis for patients administered SC alnuctamab identified that increased exposure significantly increased the probability of response, although the additional benefit was minimal at exposures above 30 mg target dose. Considering the totality of exposure–response data, the clinical pharmacology assessment supported a SC RP3D of 3/6/30 mg.",

    "abstract": "Getting the dose right is a key challenge in drug development; model‐informed drug development (MIDD) provides powerful tools to shape dose strategies and inform decision making. In this tutorial, the case study of the ZENITH trials showcases how a set of clinical pharmacology and MIDD approaches informed an impactful dose strategy. The endothelin A receptor antagonist zibotentan, combined with the sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, has yielded a robust and significant albuminuria reduction in the Phase IIb trial ZENITH‐CKD and is being investigated for reduction of kidney function decline in a high‐risk chronic kidney disease population in the Phase III trial ZENITH High Proteinuria . Endothelin antagonist treatment has, until now, been limited by the class effect fluid retention. ZENITH‐CKD investigated a wide range of zibotentan doses based on pharmacokinetics in renal impairment, competitor‐data exposure–response modeling, and clinical trial simulations. Recruitment delays reduced interim analysis data availability; here, supportive dose–response modeling recovered decision‐making confidence. At trial completion, the low‐dose arm enabled Phase III dose selection between Phase IIb doses. Dose–response modeling of efficacy and Kaplan–Meier analyses of tolerability identified a kidney‐function‐based low‐dose strategy of 0.25 or 0.75 mg zibotentan (with 10 mg dapagliflozin) to balance benefit/risk in ZENITH High Proteinuria . The applied clinical pharmacology and MIDD principles enabled successful Phase IIb dose finding, rationalized and built confidence in the innovative Phase III dosing strategy and identified a potential therapeutic window for zibotentan/dapagliflozin, providing the opportunity for a significant improvement in the treatment of chronic kidney disease with high proteinuria.",

    "abstract": "Determination of serum creatinine concentrations and subsequent calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) is a cornerstone of clinical medicine. Crucial clinical decisions such as drug treatment discontinuations are based on eGFR calculated from serum creatinine measurements. However, creatinine is not only filtered in the kidneys, but also actively secreted into urine. Creatinine transporters such as OCT2, OCT3, MATE1, MATE2‐K, and OAT2 expressed in proximal tubular cells are responsible for active renal secretion of creatinine. Multiple drugs (e.g., oral antitumor drugs) inhibit these transporters thereby causing a pseudo‐worsening of kidney function with an increase in serum creatinine concentrations and a decrease in eGFR while other methods for eGFR determination (e.g., by cystatin C) reveal normal kidney function. Since US Prescribing Information (PI) and European Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) are the most relevant source of information for physicians, we investigated the quality of information in US PI/German SmPCs of drugs with clear evidence for pseudo‐worsening of kidney function. 514 drugs putatively interacting with creatinine transporters were identified. For 149 of those drugs, an increase in serum creatinine concentrations has been described. Available data confirmed the existence of pseudo‐worsening of kidney function for 30 of those drugs, for the remaining 119 drugs existing data are insufficient. Only 23.5% (12/51) of the 30 drugs' PI/SmPCs contained unambiguous statements on this proven pseudo‐worsening of kidney function and gave clear recommendations for clinical management. Taken together, inadequate information provided in PI or SmPCs on the pseudo‐worsening of kidney function poses patients at unnecessary risks.",

We sought to evaluate antihypertensive drug effectiveness and prescribing patterns among self‐identified Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic), Non‐Hispanic Black (Black), and Non‐Hispanic White (White) populations that enrolled in the NIH All of Us Research Program, a US longitudinal cohort. We employed a self‐controlled case study method using electronic health record and survey data from 17,718 White, Hispanic, and Black participants who were diagnosed with essential hypertension and prescribed at least one of 19 commonly used antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness was determined by calculating the reduction in systolic blood pressure measurements after 28 or more days of drug exposure. Starting systolic blood pressure and effectiveness for each medication were compared for self‐reported Black, Hispanic, and White participants using adjusted linear regressions. Black and Hispanic participants were started on antihypertensive medications at significantly higher SBP than White participants in 13 and 7 out of 19 medications, respectively. More Black participants were prescribed multiple antihypertensive medications (58.46%) than White (52.35%) or Hispanic (49.9%) participants. First‐line HTN medications differed by race and ethnicity. Following the 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline release, around 64% of Black participants were prescribed a recommended first‐line antihypertensive drug compared with 76% of White and 82% of Hispanic participants. Effect sizes suggested that most antihypertensive drugs were less effective in Hispanic and Black, compared with White, participants, and statistical significance was reached in 6 out of 19 drugs. These results indicate that Black and Hispanic populations may benefit from earlier intervention and screening and highlight the potential benefits of personalizing first‐line medications.",

    "abstract": "Burosumab is indicated for treatment of a rare bone disease, X‐linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the relationship between a treatment response biomarker and patient‐reported outcomes (PROs). Longitudinal data for PROs were obtained from adults with XLH from a phase III study. Individual rich time profiles of the biomarker, serum phosphate were simulated using a prior population pharmacokinetic‐pharmacodynamic model to calculate serum phosphate exposure metrics for each 28‐day treatment cycle, which were then merged with PROs data. Item response theory parameters were first estimated to map a latent variable, ψ, that is, disability score, relative to baseline. Next, the relationships between serum phosphate exposures and ψ were modeled using a nonlinear mixed‐effect (NLME) modeling approach. A combined item response theory–NLME model with average serum phosphate as a predictor of ψ described PROs data well. The model estimates suggested 28%, 31%, and 25% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, brief pain inventory, and brief fatigue inventory scores, respectively, with every unit increase in average serum phosphate from the lower limit of normal (2.5 mg/dL). Additionally, a time effect of ~ 0.08% improvements each week was estimated. The analysis suggested that burosumab treatment‐induced improvements in serum phosphate levels are associated with improvements in PROs in adults with X‐linked hypophosphatemia. The analyses confirmed the importance of prolonged serum phosphate level correction in adult patients with XLH. These results can be useful to guide the design of further studies and to design treatment optimization strategies.",

The main goal of this tutorial is to provide an informed perspective on pediatric dose selection for renally excreted drugs, using these four DOACs as case examples.

    "abstract": "In the current landscape, regulatory agencies face the challenge of reconciling timely authorizations for novel medicines addressing life‐threatening conditions with thorough evaluations of their benefits and risks. This challenge is pronounced with advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), where expedited approval mechanisms and orphan drug designations are often applied, making post‐authorization measures a crucial mechanism to address uncertainties. We compared post‐authorization measures imposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency on ATMPs approvals, from 2009 to 2023. A systematic extraction of FDA postmarketing requirements (PMRs) and EMA‐imposed post‐authorization measures (PAMs) from publicly available regulatory documents was conducted. Descriptive analysis focused on post‐authorization measure categories, objectives, study designs, and their status and registration rates. A total of 15 ATMPs were approved in both jurisdictions over the study period. For these products, the EMA imposed 53 PAMs (34 Annex II conditions and 19 Specific Obligations), whereas the FDA imposed 27 PMRs. As of December 2023, 15 EMA‐imposed PAMs were fulfilled, with no explicit fulfilments indicated for FDA PMRs. Both agencies promoted real‐world data use in around half of the imposed PAMs (23 by EMA vs. 15 by FDA), marking regulators' growing recognition of Real‐World Evidence for decision‐making. This study highlights disparities between imposed PAMs: EMA imposed more PAMs, covering efficacy, safety, and quality aspects, while the FDA required fewer measures focusing on specific safety concerns. These discrepancies primarily reflect distinct regulatory structures and approaches to further post‐authorization data collection between the EMA and FDA, rather than disparities in initial benefit/risk assessments.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the study was to describe the population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole in hospitalized patients. Furthermore, this study used the model to optimize dosing regimens of cotrimoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and in patients with renal insufficiency or with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). This was a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data from hospitalized patients treated with cotrimoxazole. We developed two population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) models: a model of trimethoprim and an integrated model with both sulfamethoxazole and N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentrations. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the optimal dosing regimen. A total of 348 measurements from 168 patients were available. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and CRRT were included as covariates on the clearance of all three compounds. Cotrimoxazole TID 1,920 mg and b.i.d. 2,400 mg led to sufficient exposure for infections with P. jirovecii in patients without renal insufficiency. To reach equivalent exposure, a dose reduction of 33.3% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 and of 16.7% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates in patients with a reduced eGFR. CRRT increased the clearance of sulfamethoxazole, but not trimethoprim or N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole, compared with the median clearance in the population. Doubling the sulfamethoxazole dose is needed for patients on CRRT to reach equivalent exposure.",

Using a public database, we identified new molecular entities (NMEs) approved for hematologic malignancies in the US from January 2011 to December 2022. They were divided into those submitted by non‐global companies (non‐global group) and those by global companies (global group). We identified 48 NMEs, of which 19 (40%) were classified as non‐global. Of these, 13 (68%) were from US‐based companies. In the non‐global group, 63% (12/19) of the NMEs had received accelerated approval in the US, of which only 50% (6/12) had a post‐approval confirmatory trial by September 2023. Regarding the impact on the approval in the European Union (EU) and Japan, the unapproval rate of 2 years after US approval was higher in the non‐global group than in the global group in the EU (56% vs. 21%) and Japan (94% vs. 64%). In conclusion, many NMEs from non‐global companies had received accelerated approval in the US based on phase I/II trials. NMEs from non‐global companies had a higher unapproval rate at 2 years in both the EU and Japan.",

    "abstract": "Bispecific T‐cell engagers (Bi‐TCEs) have revolutionized the treatment and management of both hematological and solid tumor indications with opportunities to become best‐in‐class therapeutics for cancer. However, defining the dose and dosing regimen for the first‐in‐human (FIH) studies of Bi‐TCEs can be challenging, as a high starting dose can expose subjects to serious toxicity while a low starting dose based on traditional minimal anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) approach could lead to lengthy dose escalations that exposes seriously ill patients to sub‐therapeutic dosing. Leveraging our in‐depth and broad clinical development experience across three generations of Bi‐TCEs across both liquid and solid tumor indications, we developed an innovative modified MABEL approach for starting dose selection that integrates knowledge based on the target biology, indication, toxicology, in vitro , in vivo pharmacological evaluations, and translational pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, together with anticipated safety profile. Compared to the traditional MABEL approach in which high effector to target (E:T) cell ratios are typically used, our innovative approach utilized an optimized E:T cell ratio that better reflects the tumor microenvironment. This modified MABEL approach was successfully applied to FIH dose selection for a half‐life extended (HLE) Bi‐TCE for gastric cancer. This modified MABEL approach enabled a 10‐fold higher starting dose that was deemed safe and well tolerated and saved at least two dose‐escalation cohorts before reaching the projected efficacious dose. This approach was successfully accepted by global regulatory agencies and can be applied for Bi‐TCEs across both hematological and solid tumor indications for accelerating the clinical development for Bi‐TCEs.",

    "abstract": "Trichuris trichiura is a soil‐transmitted helminth causing intestinal disease. Albendazole is the standard treatment despite its moderate efficacy, which is improved when co‐administered with ivermectin. A fixed‐dose combination adds practical advantages mainly for mass drug administration. The aim of this article is to define the population pharmacokinetic models and exposure–response of an innovative albendazole/ivermectin combination. Data were obtained from a phase I clinical trial in healthy adults and from a phase II trial in children and adolescents infected with T. trichiura . Nonlinear mixed‐effects models were built for albendazole and ivermectin using NONMEM®. Area under the curve was calculated using the empirical Bayes estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of each individual and used for evaluation of exposure–response between cure rate and pharmacokinetic exposure. The pharmacokinetics of albendazole was described using a two‐compartmental model with first‐order absorption and the pharmacokinetics of ivermectin was described using a two‐compartmental model with zero‐order followed by first‐order absorption. Clearance and volume of distribution increased with body weight for both albendazole and ivermectin. Day 1 area under the curve of albendazole and ivermectin from the children and adolescents treated with the combination regimens were similar to the healthy adults treated with control drugs. A flat exposure–response relationship was observed between the cure rate and drug exposure. Population pharmacokinetic of a combination of albendazole and ivermectin in children, adolescents, and adults, either healthy or infected by T. trichiura was described. The dosage selected in the phase II trial was appropriate for the subsequent phase III.",

    "abstract": "Effectively treating multidrug‐resistant bacterial infections remains challenging due to the limited drug development pipeline and a scarcity of novel agents effective against these highly resistant pathogens. Bacteriophages (phages) are a potential addition to the antimicrobial treatment arsenal. Though, phages are currently being tested in clinical trials for antibiotic‐resistant infections, phages lack a fundamental understanding of optimal dosing in humans. Rationally designed preclinical studies using in vitro and in vivo infection models, allow us to assess clinically relevant phage +/− antibiotic exposure (pharmacokinetics), the resulting treatment impact on the infecting pathogen (pharmacodynamics) and host immune response (immunodynamics). A mechanistic modeling framework allows us to integrate this knowledge gained from preclinical studies to develop predictive models. We reviewed recently published mathematical models based on in vitro and/or in vivo data that evaluate the effects of varying bacterial or phage densities, phage characteristics (burst size, adsorption rate), phage pharmacokinetics, phage–antibiotic combinations and host immune responses. In our review, we analyzed study designs and the data used to inform the development of these mechanistic models. Insights gained from model‐based simulations were reviewed as they help identify crucial phage parameters for determining effective phage dosing. These efforts contribute to bridging the gap between phage therapy research and its clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Rare diseases, affecting millions globally, present significant drug development challenges. This is due to the limited patient populations and the unique pathophysiology of these diseases, which can make traditional clinical trial designs unfeasible. Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) models offer a promising approach to expedite drug development, particularly in rare diseases. QSP models provide a mechanistic representation of the disease and drug response in virtual patients that can complement routinely applied empirical modeling and simulation approaches. QSP models can generate digital twins of actual patients and mechanistically simulate the disease progression of rare diseases, accounting for phenotypic heterogeneity. QSP models can also support drug development in various drug modalities, such as gene therapy. Impactful QSP models case studies are presented here to illustrate their value in supporting various aspects of drug development in rare indications. As these QSP model applications continue to mature, there is a growing possibility that they could be more widely integrated into routine drug development steps. This integration could provide a robust framework for addressing some of the inherent challenges in rare disease drug development.",

    "abstract": "Implementation of pharmacogenetic testing in clinical care has been slow and with few exceptions is hindered by the lack of real‐world evidence on how to best target testing. In this retrospective register‐based study, we analyzed a nationwide cohort of 1,425,000 patients discharged from internal medicine or surgical wards and a cohort of 2,178 university hospital patients for purchases and prescriptions of pharmacogenetically actionable drugs. Pharmacogenetic variants were obtained from whole genome genotype data for a subset ( n = 930) of the university hospital patients. We investigated factors associated with receiving pharmacogenetically actionable drugs and developed a literature‐based cost–benefit model for pre‐emptive pharmacogenetic panel testing. In a 2‐year follow‐up, 60.4% of the patients in the nationwide cohort purchased at least one pharmacogenetically actionable drug, most commonly ibuprofen (25.0%) and codeine (19.4%). Of the genotyped subset, 98.8% carried at least one actionable pharmacogenetic genotype and 23.3% had at least one actionable gene‐drug pair. Patients suffering from musculoskeletal or cardiovascular diseases were more prone to receive pharmacogenetically actionable drugs during inpatient episode. The cost–benefit model included frequently dispensed drugs in the university hospital cohort, comprising ondansetron (19.4%), simvastatin (7.4%), clopidogrel (5.0%), warfarin (5.1%), (es)citalopram (5.3%), and azathioprine (0.5%). For untargeted pre‐emptive pharmacogenetic testing of all university hospital patients, the model indicated saving €17.49 in direct healthcare system costs per patient in 2 years without accounting for the cost of the test itself. Therefore, it might be reasonable to target pre‐emptive pharmacogenetic testing to patient groups most likely to receive pharmacogenetically actionable drugs.",

We conducted intensive and sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in a subset of Ugandan women participating in a randomized controlled trial of monthly IPTp with SP vs. DP vs. DP + SP. Intensive PK sampling was performed from day 0 to 23 after dosing at 28 weeks gestation in 87 participants across treatment arms. Sparse sampling was performed on day 28 (trough) after dosing at 20 and 28 gestational weeks in additional 196 participants receiving SP vs. DP + SP. Intensive PK analysis demonstrated that compared with SP alone, co‐administration of DP + SP was associated with lower maximal concentrations, the area under the concentration–time curves (AUC), and day 23 concentrations of sulfadoxine (25%, 25%, and 27%) and pyrimethamine (26%, 34%, and 32%) ( P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Sparse PK results demonstrated participants co‐administered DP + SP had lower trough concentrations after dosing at 20 and 28 gestational weeks for sulfadoxine (6%, P = 0.68 and 31%, P = 0.023, respectively) and pyrimethamine (18%, P = 0.032 and 33%, P < 0.001, respectively) compared with SP alone. Co‐administration of DP + SP was associated with a 19% reduction in piperaquine AUC ( P = 0.046), but no significant difference in other PK parameters compared with DP alone. In summary, co‐administration of DP + SP was associated with significantly reduced SP exposure, with a greater magnitude during the third vs. second trimester. The clinical consequences of this interaction are yet unknown.",

    "abstract": "Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can cause a reversible decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which may influence dosing recommendations for renally excreted medications. In practice, GFR is typically estimated by serum creatinine concentration, but creatinine may not be a reliable indicator of GFR decline in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use. Alternative filtration markers such as cystatin C, β‐trace protein (BTP), and β2‐microglobulin (B2M) may be more appropriate, but little is known about how these markers are affected by SGLT2 inhibitor use. Therefore, we determined creatinine, cystatin C, BTP, and B2M concentration in a crossover study of 35 people with type 2 diabetes receiving 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment or placebo. Estimated GFR (eGFR) based on creatinine (eGFRcre), cystatin C (eGFRcys), their combination (eGFRcomb), or a panel of all four markers (eGFRpanel) was compared with measured GFR (mGFR) based on plasma clearance of chromium‐51 labeled ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( 51 Cr‐EDTA). Dapagliflozin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in mGFR (−9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , P < 0.001) but not a corresponding increase in concentration of any filtration marker. No eGFR equation accurately predicted change in mGFR between treatment periods, but eGFRcomb and eGFRpanel yielded the highest overall accuracy relative to mGFR across both treatment periods. These findings highlight the stability in performance gained by combining multiple filtration markers but suggest that eGFR in general is not an ideal metric for assessing short‐term GFR decline in people initiating SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.",

This work exemplifies a model‐informed drug development approach that evaluated burosumab pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics in the ultrarare tumor‐induced osteomalacia population to support adult and pediatric dosing. Data from tumor‐induced osteomalacia participants were combined with data from X‐linked hypophosphatemia to understand pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics and covariates specific to tumor‐induced osteomalacia. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic simulations were performed using final models to support dosing recommendations for adults and extrapolation to pediatric patients. Burosumab pharmacokinetics were described using a one‐compartment model with first‐order absorption and body weight as a significant covariate. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships were described using a sigmoidal Emax model with significant covariates of baseline fibroblast growth factor 23 on baseline fasting serum phosphate and potency of burosumab response and tumor‐induced osteomalacia disease state resulting in a steep slope of response; however, the covariates are not clinically meaningful. Simulations demonstrated that, in pediatric patients, starting doses of burosumab 0.3 and 0.4 mg/kg every 2 weeks at steady state would achieve normal serum phosphate levels in ≥ 30% of patients with relatively low risk of hyperphosphatemia (< 3%). In adults, burosumab 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg every 4 weeks achieves similar percentages of responders and a relative low risk of hyperphosphatemia (< 7%). Serum phosphate titration‐based burosumab dosing increased the probability of achieving normal serum phosphate levels. The models supported a model‐informed drug development approach for global approvals of titration‐based burosumab dosing, guided by monitoring fasting serum phosphate levels.",

    "abstract": "There is a scarcity of information related to the financial impact of acute kidney injury (AKI), and even more so the economics of drug‐associated AKI (D‐AKI). Our goal was to provide a comprehensive summary of the economic burden of D‐AKI by evaluating the costs of D‐AKI compared to not developing AKI and cost savings associated with nephrotoxin stewardship approaches. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify articles from database inception through November 2023. The main outcomes included AKI incidence, resource use, and cost of nephrotoxin stewardship programs/D‐AKI event or no event. Key findings were summarized based on whether the study compared the cost of D‐AKI vs. no AKI or identified potential cost savings associated with a nephrotoxin stewardship method to prevent D‐AKI or worsening D‐AKI. All costs were adjusted to USD2023. Twenty‐five studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight studies compared the cost of D‐AKI to no AKI. Total admission costs of patients who developed D‐AKI ranged from $47,696 to $173,569. Nineteen studies implemented nephrotoxin stewardship with 12 substituting a less nephrotoxic drug; five using therapeutic drug monitoring and two altering drug dosing to limit exposure. Overall, these prevention strategies ranged from $5,171 to $364,973 in total medical cost savings and $17 to $942 in total cost savings per patient‐day.

    "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of nimodipine correlate with long‐term outcome of patients after subarachnoidal hemorrhage (aSAH) by impeding cerebral ischemia. However, pharmacological data on simultaneous serum vs. CSF and intraparenchymal nimodipine values are rarely reported in larger patient groups. Nimodipine concentrations were determined in plasma, CSF, and cerebral interstitial fluid (ISF), at steady state after oral (6 × 60 mg/day) and intravenous (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/h) administrations in 10 patients after aSAH. Area under the concentration time curve (AUC 0–24 ) for intravenous nimodipine was highest at an infusion rate of 2 mg/h in plasma (1335.87 ± 591.09 mg*h/L), followed by CSF (39.53 ± 23.07 mg*h/L), resulting in an overall CSF penetration ratio of 3.8% (±1.5) (AUC CSF /AUC plasma ). In contrast, nimodipine levels were significantly lower in both plasma (AUC 0–24 298.32 ± 206.52 mg*h/L) and CSF (AUC 0–24 34.8 ± 16.56 mg*h/L) after oral administration. In cerebral ISF, low amounts of nimodipine were detectable in only 4 patients at an infusion rate of 1.5 and 2 mg/h as well as following oral administration. We found significantly higher CSF nimodipine levels in patients during intravenous compared to oral administration. In contrast, only low amounts of nimodipine were detected in the ISF after both oral and intravenous administration. Our findings strongly suggest that the main clinical nimodipine effect of impeding life threatening cerebral ischemia is mediated through significant higher CSF levels after intravenous administration, more likely effective than oral administration.",

    "abstract": "NMD670 is a first‐in‐class inhibitor of skeletal muscle‐specific chloride channel ClC‐1, developed to improve muscle weakness and fatigue in neuromuscular diseases. Preclinical studies show that ClC‐1 inhibition enhances muscle excitability, improving muscle contractility and strength. We describe the first‐in‐human, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study, which evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of NMD670 in healthy male and female subjects. Single‐ascending doses (50–1,600 mg) were administered in a (partial) cross‐over design; multiple‐ascending doses (200–600 mg q.d.; 400 mg b.i.d.) were administered in a parallel design. Differences in pharmacokinetics between males/females and fed/fasted states were evaluated. Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated using muscle velocity recovery cycles (MVRC) and analyzed using mixed‐effects modeling. NMD670 was generally safe and well‐tolerated in healthy subjects, with the only dose‐related adverse event being myotonia occurring at the highest dose levels tested (single dose of 1,200, and 1,600 mg). Moreover, NMD670 significantly increased the following MVRC parameters after a single dose of 1,200 mg compared with placebo: early supernormality (estimated difference (ED) 2.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.379, 3.70; P = 0.0242); early supernormality after 5 conditioning stimuli (ED 2.51; 95%CI 0.599, 4.41; P = 0.0177); supernormality at 20 ms (ED 2.78; 95%CI 1.377, 4.181; P = 0.0021). Importantly, the results of this study indicate pharmacological target engagement at well‐tolerated dose levels in healthy subjects; firstly, because myotonia was an expected exaggerated on‐target pharmacological effect, and secondly, because the effects on MVRC indicate increased muscle cell excitability. This study in healthy subjects indicates proof‐of‐mechanism and provides a solid base for translation to patients with neuromuscular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Escitalopram is commonly prescribed for depressive and anxiety disorders in elderly patients, who often show variable drug responses and face higher risks of side effects due to age‐related changes in organ function. The CYP2C19 polymorphism may further affect escitalopram pharmacokinetics in elderly patients, complicating dose optimization for this group. Previous pharmacogenetic studies examining the impact of CYP2C19 phenotype on escitalopram treatment outcomes have primarily focused on younger adults, leaving a gap in understanding its effects on the elderly. The aim of this investigation is to determine the impact of CYP2C19 phenotypes on escitalopram exposure in geriatrics using a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model with geriatric‐specific parameters and our clinical sample of 88 elderly patients with major depressive disorder. Based on PBPK simulations, the exposure of escitalopram in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PMs) was 2.1‐fold higher compared with CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EMs). In line with PBPK results, the dose‐normalized trough concentration in our clinical sample varied according to CYP2C19 phenotype ( P = 0.0132), with PMs having a 1.6‐fold higher concentration than EMs. Based on simulated and observed results, it is suggested that an escitalopram dose of 10 mg/day maybe appropriate for PMs, while a maximum dose of 20 mg/day could be used for EMs and IMs who do not achieve therapeutic responses at 10 mg/day. These findings suggest that CYP2C19 genotyping in elderly patients could be beneficial for tailoring dosing regimens in clinical practice, potentially improving treatment outcomes and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions associated with escitalopram in this vulnerable group.",

However, uncertainties remain for IVD developers (device manufacturers), regulators, and other healthcare stakeholders on the specifics of collecting fit‐for‐purpose RWD and using RWE for regulatory decision‐making. We report on a unique approach to medical device regulatory review called the Open Hand Initiative, by which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and device manufacturers collaborate to ensure the appropriate use of RWD/RWE to support regulatory decision‐making. Normally, regulatory submission interactions are confidential; in the Open Hand approach, device manufacturers share high‐level learnings from pre‐submission interactions to advance the use of reliable and relevant RWD/RWE for regulatory decision‐making. In a pilot study, the Open Hand approach was applied to pre‐submission interactions regarding the use of RWD/RWE for transition of SARS‐CoV‐2 serology IVDs with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to full market authorization. Participants in the pilot agreed that the candid discussions were key to identifying barriers to efficient, timely, and robust RWE generation for IVD premarket submissions. The pilot also led to valuable lessons learned around current regulatory requirements for RWE, SARS‐CoV‐2 testing complexities, and the impact that the rapidly evolving COVID‐19 pandemic had on RWD availability and quality. The Open Hand Initiative can be applied more broadly to guide device manufacturers in collecting high‐quality RWD to generate RWE for premarket applications.",

    "abstract": "Clinical research has historically failed to include representative levels of historically underrepresented populations and these inequities continue to persist. Ensuring representativeness in clinical trials is crucial for patients to receive clinically appropriate treatment and have equitable access to novel therapies; enhancing the generalizability of study results; and reducing the need for post‐marketing commitments focused on underrepresented groups. As demonstrated by recent legislation and guidance documents, regulatory agencies have shown an increased interest in understanding how novel therapies will impact the patient population that will receive them. Despite these efforts, a systematic approach to measure and optimize representativeness remains underdeveloped. Here, we introduce the novel Population Optimization, Representativeness Evaluation, and Fine‐tuning Framework, designed to quantify and enhance representativeness. Our framework includes methods for evaluating overall and subgroup representativeness, identifying drivers of non‐representativeness, and optimizing eligibility criteria to achieve representative populations. We demonstrate our framework by selecting patients who met the eligibility criteria for nine oncology clinical trials from a nationwide electronic health record‐derived de‐identified database and quantifying the representativeness of each trial's eligible population. This framework addresses gaps in current literature by providing a comprehensive, data‐driven approach to enhance the representativeness of clinical trials, thereby supporting regulatory and internal decision‐making processes. This framework is adaptable to various disease indications and can be extended to evaluate enrolled study samples, ensuring that clinical trials are representative.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials are primarily conducted to estimate causal effects, but the data collected can also be invaluable for additional research, such as identifying prognostic measures of disease or biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy. However, these exploratory settings are prone to false discoveries (type‐I errors) due to the multiple comparisons they entail. Unfortunately, many methods fail to address this issue, in part because the algorithms used are generally designed to optimize predictions and often only provide the measures used for variable selection, such as machine learning model importance scores, as a byproduct. To address the resulting unclear uncertainty in the selection sets, the knockoff framework offers a model‐agnostic, robust approach to variable selection with guaranteed type‐I error control. Here, we review the knockoff framework in the setting of clinical data, highlighting main considerations using simulation studies. We also extend the framework by introducing a novel knockoff generation method that addresses two main limitations of previously suggested methods relevant for clinical development settings. With this new method, we empirically obtain tighter bounds on type‐I error control and gain an order of magnitude in computational efficiency in mixed data settings. We demonstrate comparable selections to those of the competing method for identifying prognostic biomarkers for C‐reactive protein levels in patients with psoriatic arthritis in four clinical trials. Our work increases access to the knockoff framework for variable selection from clinical trial data. Hereby, this paper helps to address the current replicability crisis which can result in unnecessary research efforts, increased patient burden, and avoidable costs.",

Although statins are well‐tolerated generally, however, the report of statin‐related adverse event and statin intolerance are common in China, which results in insufficient use of statins and poor adherence.

Based on that, this consensus carefully summarized the statin‐related gene polymorphism and statin usage issue among Chinese population, and comprehensively reviewed global research data on statin intolerance, referenced guidelines, and consensus literature on statin intolerance in foreign and different regions, proposes an appropriate and easy to implement statin intolerance definition as well as corresponding diagnostic criteria and management strategies for Chinese clinicians, in order to improve the clinical application of statin drugs and enhance the prevention and treatment level of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in China.",

We characterized the relationship of mirikizumab systemic exposure with efficacy and safety end points in patients with UC using phase II (NCT02589665) and III (NCT03518086, NCT03524092) trial data. Exposure–response models were developed for clinical remission, clinical response, endoscopic remission, and change in modified Mayo score following induction (50–1,000 mg i.v. every 4 weeks) and maintenance (200 mg s.c. every 4 or 12 weeks) treatment. These models evaluated observed and pharmacokinetic model‐predicted mirikizumab exposures as the exposure measure. Key safety event rates were compared across mirikizumab exposure quartiles in the phase III trial. Mirikizumab efficacy in patients with UC showed an apparent positive association with systemic exposure following both induction and maintenance. However, further analysis found this relationship to be overstated by the presence of confounding factors that were not among the tested patient covariates. While prior biologic experience and baseline disease severity showed statistically significant influences on estimated placebo effect, no patient factors affected the mirikizumab effect parameters in any of the phase III exposure–response models. There was no apparent mirikizumab concentration relationship with any adverse event of special interest. When the phase II and III data and confounding are considered together, efficacy was unlikely to be strongly affected by variation in exposures across individual patients at the phase III dose. Together with the previously demonstrated mirikizumab exposure insensitivity to patient factors, these findings indicate that mirikizumab dose adjustment to patient characteristics is not required.",

Despite this increased activity, a significant unmet need remains, and the responsibility to meet this need is augmented by enhanced genomic, biologic, medical, analytical, and informatic tools. It is recognized that the development of an effective and safe rare/ultra‐rare disease therapeutic faces a number of challenges with an important role noted for clinical pharmacology. Clinical pharmacology is foundationally an integrative discipline which must be embedded in and is interdependent upon understanding the pathogenic biology, clinical presentation, disease progression, and end‐point assessment of the disease under study. This manuscript presents an overview and two case examples of this integrative approach, the development of C5‐targeted therapeutics for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis and asfotase alpha for the treatment of hypophosphatasia. The two presented case examples show the usefulness of understanding the biological drivers and clinical course of a rare disease, having relevant animal models, procuring informative natural history data, importing assessment tools from relevant alternative areas, and using integrated applied clinical pharmacology to inform target engagement, dose, and the cascade of pharmacodynamic and clinical effects that follow. Learnings from these programs include the importance of assuring cross‐validation of assays throughout a development program and continued commitment to understanding the relationship among the array of Pd end points and clinical outcomes. Using an integrative approach, substantive work remains to be done to meet the unmet needs of patients with rare/ultra‐rare disease.",

This population analysis characterized pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin and free (unconjugated) MMAE, identified covariates affecting pharmacokinetics, and evaluated weight‐based dosing for enfortumab vedotin. Exposure–response analyses characterized relationships between enfortumab vedotin and free MMAE exposures and efficacy/safety endpoints. Data from 748 patients with locally advanced or mUC in 5 clinical studies were analyzed using nonlinear mixed‐effects modeling. Patients received enfortumab vedotin 0.50–1.25 mg/kg every 3 weeks or on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28‐day cycle. Relevant covariates retained in final models were evaluated for clinical relevance to enfortumab vedotin and free MMAE exposures. Although some covariates produced differences in exposure, the magnitude of changes was not clinically meaningful. Simulations indicated weight‐based dosing yielded more consistent exposures across body weight groups vs. a hypothetical fixed‐dose regimen of enfortumab vedotin 95 mg (calculated for median body weight, 75 kg). Exposure–response analysis showed average enfortumab vedotin concentrations were not a statistically significant predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.72–1.14; P = 0.41); all exposure quartiles had a greater median overall survival than chemotherapy (11.0–12.6 vs. 9.0 months). Enfortumab vedotin and free MMAE exposures were statistically significant predictors of grade ≥ 3 treatment‐related adverse events (both P < 0.0001). This analysis supports enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28‐day cycle.",

A one‐compartment model with first‐order absorption best described clavulanic acid pharmacokinetics with postnatal age as a covariate on the inter‐individual variability of clearance. Oral bioavailability was 24.4% in neonates up to 10 days of age. An oral dosing regimen 90 mg/kg/day amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (4:1 ratio) resulted in 40.2% of simulated patients achieving 100% f T > C T,2mg/L . An amoxicillin/clavulanic acid ratio of 4:1 is preferred for neonatal oral regimens due to the higher exposure along the entire % f T > C T range (0–100%) as ratios higher than 4:1 might result in inadequate exposure. Our results highlight substantial exposure differences (% f T > C T ) when using threshold concentrations of 1 mg/L vs. 2 mg/L. This first population pharmacokinetic model for clavulanic acid in neonates may serve as a foundational step for future research, once more precise clavulanic acid targets become available.",

    "abstract": "An over‐the‐counter product berberine (a major alkaloid in goldenseal) is a substrate of the uptake transporter OCT1 and the metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6. The two genes exhibit common functional polymorphisms. Approximately 9% of Europeans and white Americans are either poor CYP2D6 metabolizers or poor OCT1 transporters. In this study, we investigated the effects of OCT1 and CYP2D6 polymorphisms on berberine pharmacokinetics in humans. We confirmed in vitro that berberine is an OCT1 substrate ( K M of 7.0 μM, CL int of 306 ± 29 μL/min/mg). Common OCT1 alleles *3 to *6 showed uptake reduced by at least 65% and Oct1/2 knockout mice showed 3.2‐fold higher AUCs in liver perfusion experiments. However, in humans, poor OCT1 transporters did not show any differences in berberine pharmacokinetics compared with reference participants. In contrast, CYP2D6 polymorphisms significantly affected berberine metabolism, but exclusively in females. Females who were poor CYP2D6 metabolizers had an 80% lower M1‐to‐berberine ratio. General linear model analyses suggest strong synergistic, rather than additive, effects between female sex and CYP2D6 genotype. Overall, berberine displayed low oral bioavailability, yet females had a 2.8‐fold higher AUC and a 3.6‐fold higher C max than males ( P < 0.001). These effects were only partially attributable to the sex‐ CYP2D6 genotype interaction. In conclusion, despite berberine being an OCT1 substrate, OCT1 deficiency did not affect berberine pharmacokinetics in humans. In contrast, CYP2D6 emerges as a critical enzyme for berberine metabolism in females, but not in males, highlighting sex‐specific differences. We suggest that factors beyond CYP2D6 metabolism are determining berberine's systemic exposure, especially in males (NCT05463003).",

Those that pass the review are subsequently subject to deliberation by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Councils (MHLW‐PAFSC), and the MHLW legislatively grants approval based on its positive opinions. However, little is known regarding the relationship between the PMDA review and the MHLW decision. We retrospectively assessed the MHLW decision of NDAs that passed the PMDA review at the initial MHLW‐PAFSC deliberation from 2002 to 2022. The reasoning behind a non‐supportive opinion from the MHLW‐PAFSC and the sponsor's actions to overcome unresolved issues were also documented. A total of 2,117 of 2,153 (98.3%) NDAs that passed the PMDA review were approved at the initial MHLW‐PAFSC deliberation with a positive opinion. The remaining 36 applications were not approved at the initial deliberation and subjected to continued deliberation because of a non‐supportive opinion from the councils, although 29 were finally approved through revision of the application document (24 applications), re‐analysis of the data (1 application), or additional clinical trials (4 applications). Seven applications have not been approved, of which one was refused, four were withdrawn, and two were unknown. The MHLW approves NDAs that passed the PMDA review at the initial deliberation at a high rate, suggesting that NDAs only suitable for approval passed the review and reached the MHLW‐PAFSC deliberation. Only a few NDAs were not approved at the initial deliberation; however, most of them were finally approved.",

    "abstract": "The No‐POPPY study (NCT03396588), a double‐blind, randomized trial compared morphine with clonidine therapy for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) and found that the duration of treatment was similar across groups. This is significant because perinatal use of morphine has the potential for neurodevelopmental consequences. Still, the clonidine group reached symptom stabilization (Finnegan score (FS) < 8) later than the morphine group and had a more significant number of patients who required adjunct therapy. However, the mean FS was consistently lower in the clonidine group after day 6. This prompted us to use pharmacokinetic (PK) and parametric time‐to‐event (TTE) modeling to simulate dosage schedules that may decrease the time to stabilization and reduce the need for adjunct therapy. Population PK (popPK) analysis was conducted, and the final model was a one‐compartment model with first‐order absorption and elimination, incorporating allometric scaling and age effect on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume (V/F). The population estimates for CL/F and V/F were 13.6 L/h/70 kg and 416 L/70 kg, respectively, similar to the reported values. A Weibull model described the TTE data best, followed by incorporating predicted average concentrations to yield the final Weibull accelerated failure time model. Simulations of dosing strategies showed that increasing both the starting and maximum doses could potentially shorten the time to stabilization, and thus, length of treatment and hospital stay. Given the hypothesis‐generating nature of this analysis, the recommended dosing regimens should be tested prospectively to evaluate their benefits.",

There is interest in leveraging real‐world data (RWD) from electronic health records (EHRs) to construct external control (EC) arms to supplement RCT control arms and form hybrid control (HC) arms. This investigation showed the use of an HC arm in second‐line metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The RCT experimental arm (atezolizumab + PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase (Atezo + PEGPH20)) was compared with an HC arm consisting of patients treated with modified FOLFOX6 or gemcitabine/nab‐paclitaxel from the MORPHEUS PDAC internal control arm supplemented with data from a nationwide EHR‐derived de‐identified database as the EC arm. The EC arm was constructed by applying key inclusion/exclusion criteria from the MORPHEUS PDAC trial to patients from the real‐world cohort. Baseline variables were balanced using propensity score matching and covariate adjustment. Three analysis approaches—Cox model with pooled‐control data, Cox model with control arm‐specific frailty, and Bayesian analysis using a commensurate prior—were assessed. Overall survival was similar between the treatment arms. The direction and magnitude of hazard ratios (HRs) from the multiple HC analyses (HRs ranged from 1.02 to 1.06) were comparable with the reported trial HR (HR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.56, 1.49). This analysis demonstrates the feasibility and applicability of leveraging RWD in clinical trial design to supplement clinical trial control arms.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing knowledge of pregnancy‐induced changes in physiology that may alter maternal and fetal pharmacokinetics, evidence‐based antenatal doses are lacking for most drugs. Pharmacokinetic modeling and expanding clinical data in pregnancy may support antenatal doses. We aimed to develop and pilot a comprehensive and user‐driven Framework for Dose Selection in Pregnancy to support the clinical implementation of a best‐evidence antenatal dose for sertraline. After initial development and evaluation by experts, the framework prototype was piloted to formulate an antenatal dosing strategy for sertraline in depression and anxiety disorders. Next, the framework was reviewed and assessed for usability by a multidisciplinary working committee of end‐users comprising healthcare practitioners, experts from other disciplines including pharmacometrics, reproductive toxicology and medical ethics, alongside pregnant women and a partner. The resulting framework encompasses the following: rationale for drug selection, a comprehensive analysis of pharmacokinetic and dose‐related efficacy and safety data, and implementation aspects including feasibility and desirability of the recommended antenatal dose based on a structured maternal and fetal benefit–risk assessment. An antenatal dose recommendation for sertraline, as a case study, was formulated using this approach and endorsed for clinical use by the working committee. Future applications of the framework for other drugs can further demonstrate its suitability for developing best evidence, acceptable and clinically feasible antenatal doses.",

    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy for children living with HIV (CLHIV) under 3 years of age commonly includes lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). However, the original liquid LPV/r formulation has taste and cold storage difficulties. To address these challenges, LPV/r oral pellets have been developed. These pellets can be mixed with milk or food for administration and do not require refrigeration. We developed the population pharmacokinetic (PK) model and assessed drug exposure of LPV/r oral pellets administered twice daily to CLHIV per World Health Organization (WHO) weight bands. The PK analysis included Kenyan and Ugandan children participating in the LIVING studies (NCT02346487) receiving LPV/r pellets (40/10 mg) and ABC/3TC (60/30 mg) dispersible tablets. Population PK models were developed for lopinavir (LPV) and ritonavir (RTV) to evaluate the impact of RTV on the oral clearance (CL/F) of LPV. The data obtained from the study were analyzed using nonlinear mixed‐effects modeling approach. Data from 514 children, comprising a total of 2,998 plasma concentrations of LPV/r were included in the analysis. The LPV and RTV concentrations were accurately represented by a one‐compartment model with first‐order absorption (incorporating a lag‐time) and elimination. Body weight influenced LPV and RTV PK parameters. The impact of RTV concentrations on the CL/F of LPV was characterized using a maximum effect model. Simulation‐predicted target LPV exposures were achieved in children with this pellet formulation across the WHO weight bands. The LPV/r pellets dosed in accordance with WHO weight bands provide adequate LPV exposures in Kenyan and Ugandan children weighing 3.0 to 24.9 kg.",

    "abstract": "Neutropenia is the major dose‐limiting toxicity of irinotecan‐based therapy. The objective of this study was to assess whether inclusion of germline genetic variants into a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model can improve prediction of irinotecan‐induced grade 4 neutropenia and identify novel variants of clinical value. A semimechanistic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was used to predict neutrophil response over time in 197 patients receiving irinotecan. Covariate analysis was performed for demographic/clinical factors and 4,781 genetic variants in 84 drug response‐ and toxicity‐related genes to identify covariates associated with neutrophil response. We evaluated the predictive value of the model for grade 4 neutropenia reflecting different clinical scenarios of available data on identified demographic/clinical covariates, baseline and post‐treatment absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs), individual pharmacokinetics, and germline genetic variation. Adding 8 genetic identified covariates (rs10929302 ( UGT1A1 ), rs1042482 ( DPYD ), rs2859101 ( HLA‐DQB3 ), rs61754806 ( NR3C1 ), rs9266271 ( HLA‐B ), rs7294 ( VKORC1 ), rs1051713 ( ALOX5 ), and ABCB1 rare variant burden) to a model using only baseline ANCs improved prediction of irinotecan‐induced grade 4 neutropenia from area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC‐ROC) of 50–64% (95% confidence interval (CI), 54–74%). Individual pharmacokinetics further improved the prediction to 74% (95% CI, 64–84%). When weekly ANC was available, the identified covariates and individual pharmacokinetics yielded no additional contribution to the prediction. The model including only ANCs at baseline and at week 1 achieved an AUC‐ROC of 78% (95% CI, 69–88%). Germline DNA genetic variants may contribute to the prediction of irinotecan‐induced grade 4 neutropenia when incorporated into a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. This approach is generalizable to drugs that induce neutropenia and ultimately allows for personalized intervention to enhance patient safety.",

This paper aims to develop a pharmacological SAMS risk stratification (PSAMS‐RS) score using a previously developed PSAMS phenotyping algorithm that distinguishes objective vs. nocebo SAMS using electronic health record (EHR) data. Using our PSAMS phenotyping algorithm, SAMS cases and controls were identified from Minnesota Fairview EHR, with the statin user cohort divided into derivation (January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2018) and validation (January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020) cohorts. A Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression model was applied to identify significant features for PSAMS. PSAMS‐RS scores were calculated and the clinical utility of stratifying PSAMS risk was assessed by comparing hazard ratios (HRs) between fourth vs. first score quartiles. PSAMS cases were identified in 1.9% (310/16,128) of the derivation and 1.5% (64/4,182) of the validation cohorts. Sixteen out of 38 clinical features were determined to be significant predictors for PSAMS risk. Patients within the fourth quartile of the PSAMS scores had an over sevenfold (HR: 7.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.03–12.45, derivation cohort) or sixfold (HR: 6.1, 95% CI: 2.15–17.45, validation cohort) higher hazard of developing PSAMS vs. those in their respective first quartile. The PSAMS‐RS score is a simple tool to stratify patients' risk of developing PSAMS after statin initiation which could inform clinician‐guided pre‐emptive measures to prevent PSAMS‐related statin nonadherence.",

    "abstract": "Varenicline, the most efficacious smoking cessation monotherapy, produces abnormal dreams. Although genetic contributions to varenicline‐associated nausea and cessation have been identified, the role of genetics in abnormal dreams is unknown. We conducted a genomewide association study (GWAS) of abnormal dreams in 188 European ancestry smokers treated with varenicline (NCT01314001). Additive genetic models examined the likelihood of experiencing abnormal dreams 2 weeks following varenicline initiation. For the top locus, we tested for selectivity to varenicline, effects on cessation, replication, and generalizability to African ancestry (AA) individuals. The top GWAS variant associated with abnormal dreams was rs901886, mapping to intron 2 of ICAM5 on chromosome 19. The prevalence of abnormal dreams in those with rs901886 CC, CT, and TT genotypes was 15%, 36%, and 62%, respectively (odds ratio = 2.94 for T vs. C, 95% confidence interval = 1.92–4.55, P = 2.03e −7 ; T allele frequency = 52%). This rs901886 association was selective to varenicline ( P values > 0.05 on nicotine patch and placebo). There were also positive associations for rs901886 T (vs. C allele, P = 0.03) and for abnormal dreams ( P = 0.06) with varenicline‐aided cessation. Neither rs901886 ( P = 0.40) nor abnormal dreams ( P = 0.24) were associated with adherence. A similar direction of effect of rs901886 on abnormal dreams was observed in a second varenicline trial (NCT01836276). In AA individuals ( n = 137), rs901886 was not associated with abnormal dreams ( P = 0.41), but there was an association for a variant located ~ 74.4 kb 5′ of ICAM5 ( P = 2.56e −3 ). Variation in ICAM5 may influence abnormal dreams and cessation on varenicline. These findings provide additional support for genetically optimized smoking cessation approaches.",

    "abstract": "Drug recalls occur frequently and have the potential to impact considerable numbers of patients and healthcare providers. However, in the absence of a comprehensive overview the extent of conducted recalls and their impact on patients remains unknown. To address this, we developed a comprehensive overview of drug recalls affecting patients. We compiled this overview based on the drug recall registrations from the Jeroen Bosch Hospital (JBZ), the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), and the Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association (KNMP). A retrospective data analysis was conducted to identify drug recalls that affected patients. Specifically, we defined these as drug recalls that required patients to actively switch their drug to a different batch or brand of the same drug or to switch to a drug within the same or a different class of drugs. To quantify the impact, we used real‐world drug dispensing data. Between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2021, we identified 48 drug recalls that necessitated patients to make active changes to their medications an estimated 855,000 times. Most of the affected patients (292,000) were required to switch to a different brand of the same drug, whereas in 95,000 cases patients had to switch to a drug from another drug class. Our study suggests that a significant number of patients are affected by drug recalls. Future efforts are needed to elucidate patients’ experiences and preferences regarding drug recalls, which could provide valuable insights to aid decision‐making by relevant (national) authorities concerning drug recalls.",

Nineteen adults with T1D were randomized to YG1699 10 mg, YG1699 25 mg, and dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily for 1 week in different orders. The primary end point was the difference in area under the curve (AUC) in plasma glucose (AUC 0–120min ) after an MMTT between treatment groups. Mean change in plasma glucose after an MMTT (AUC 0–120min ) was lower for YG1699 10 mg vs. dapagliflozin (89.51% of baseline vs. 102.13%, 90% confidence interval (CI) vs. dapagliflozin, −6% to −16%, P = 0.0003) and for YG1699 25 mg (84.83% vs. 102.13%, 90% CI vs. dapagliflozin −13% to −22%, P < 0.0001). At 120 minutes, mean glucose values on no treatment, dapagliflozin, YG1699 10 mg, and YG1699 25 mg were 149 (SE 7.6), 141 (SE 6.1), 128 (SE 6.9), and 115 (SE 7.8) mg/dL, respectively. Insulin dose requirements were lower for YG1699 10 mg and 25 mg vs. dapagliflozin for bolus insulin, and for YG1699 10 mg vs. dapagliflozin for total daily insulin. Safety profiles were similar between treatment groups. YG1699 reduced post‐prandial glucose more than dapagliflozin in people with T1D on insulin pump therapy. The results were consistent with dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition by YG1699.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports related to in utero exposure of marketed immunosuppressive biologics led to clinical recommendations to delay live vaccinations for infants due to the concern of reduced vaccine effectiveness and/or increased risk of vaccine‐related disease. These delays can increase the risk of children contracting vaccine preventable diseases, yet the alternative cessation of biologics during pregnancy may result in increased autoimmune disease activity for the pregnant person, raising complex benefit–risk (B‐R) considerations and trade‐offs. Our goal is to develop a conceptual framework for B‐R assessment based on the key benefits and risks pregnant people would consider for themselves and their children when continuing (vs. discontinuing) a biologic during pregnancy. The proposed framework defines the decision contexts, key domains and attributes for potential benefits, and risks of biologic use during pregnancy, informed by a literature review of indications for biologics and refined with key clinical stakeholders. The framework includes both the pregnant person taking the biologic and the infant potentially exposed to the biologic in utero , with potential benefit and risk domains and attributes for each participant. To advance this conceptual framework, there are considerations of potential biases and uncertainty of available data that will be imperative to address when quantifying the B‐R framework. For these reasons, we recommend the formation of a consortium to ensure development of a robust, validated framework that can be adopted in the healthcare setting.",

    "abstract": "Transdermal nicotine patches (TNPs), administering nicotine into the bloodstream through skin, have been widely used as nicotine replacement therapy, and exposure to nicotine can be detected by measurement of plasma cotinine concentration. In animal studies, nicotine treatment could increase the number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), but the effect of TNPs on circulating EPCs and their activity in humans remained unclear. This study aimed to explore the influence of TNPs on circulating EPCs with surface markers of CD34, CD133, and/or KDR, and colony‐forming function plus migration activity of early EPCs derived from cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after TNP treatments in young healthy nonsmokers. In parallel, pulse wave analysis (PWA) was applied to evaluate the vascular effect of TNP treatments. Twenty‐one participants (25.8 ± 3.6 years old, 10 males) used TNP (nicotine: 4.2 mg/day) for 7 consecutive days. During the treatment, the CD34 + EPCs progressively increased in number. In addition, the number of EPCs positive for CD34/KDR, CD133, and CD34/CD133 were also increased on day 7 of the treatment. Furthermore, the early EPC colony‐forming function and migration activity were increased with the plasma cotinine level positively correlating with change in colony‐forming unit number. PWA analyses on day 7, compared with pretreatment, did not show significant change except diastolic pressure time index, which was prolonged and implied potential vascular benefit. In conclusion, 7‐day TNP treatments could be a practical strategy to enhance angiogenesis of circulating EPCs to alleviate tissue ischemia without any hemodynamic concern.",

    "abstract": "Although great progress has been made in the fine‐tuning of diplotypes, there is still a need to further improve the predictability of individual phenotypes of pharmacogenetically relevant enzymes. The aim of this study was to analyze the additional contribution of sex and variants identified by exome chip analysis to the metabolic ratio of five probe drugs. A cocktail study applying dextromethorphan, losartan, omeprazole, midazolam, and caffeine was conducted on 200 healthy volunteers. CYP2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5, and 1A2 genotypes were analyzed and correlated with metabolic ratios. In addition, an exome chip analysis was performed. These SNPs correlating with metabolic ratios were confirmed by individual genotyping. The contribution of various factors to metabolic ratios was assessed by multiple regression analysis. Genotypically predicted phenotypes defined by CPIC discriminated very well the log metabolic ratios with the exception of caffeine. There were minor sex differences in the activity of CYP2C9, 2C19, 1A2, and CYP3A4/5. For dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), IP6K2 (rs61740999) and TCF20 (rs5758651) affected metabolic ratios, but only IP6K2 remained significant after multiple regression analysis. For losartan (CYP2C9), FBXW12 (rs17080138), ZNF703 (rs79707182), and SLC17A4 (rs11754288) together with CYP diplotypes, and sex explained 50% of interindividual variability. For omeprazole (CYP2C19), no significant influence of CYP2C:TG haplotypes was observed, but CYP2C19 rs12777823 improved the predictability. The comprehensive genetic analysis and inclusion of sex in a multiple regression model significantly improved the explanation of variability of metabolic ratios, resulting in further improvement of algorithms for the prediction of individual phenotypes of drug‐metabolizing enzymes.",

We aimed to assess the application and quality of MBMA studies. We searched multiple databases to identify MBMA in pharmaceutical research. Eligible MBMA should incorporate pharmacological concepts to construct mathematical models and quantitatively examine and/or predict drug effects. Relevant information was summarized to provide an overview of the application of MBMA. We used AMSTAR‐2 and PRISMA 2020 checklists to evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of included MBMA, respectively. A total of 143 MBMA studies were identified. MBMA was increasingly used over time for one or more areas: drug discovery and translational research ( n = 8, 5.6%), drug development decision making ( n = 42, 29.4%), optimization of clinical trial design ( n = 46, 32.2%), medication in special populations ( n = 15, 10.5%), and rationality and safety of drug use ( n = 71, 49.7%). The included MBMA covered 17 disease areas, with the top three being nervous system diseases ( n = 19, 13.2%), endocrine/nutritional/metabolic diseases ( n = 17, 11.8%), and neoplasms ( n = 16, 11.1%). Of these MBMA studies, 138 (96.5%) were rated as very low quality. The average rate of compliance with PRISMA was only 51.4%. Our findings suggested that MBMA was mainly used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs, with a focus on chronic diseases. The methodological and reporting quality of MBMA should be further improved. Given AMSTAR‐2 and PRISMA checklists were not specifically designed for MBMA, adapted assessment checklists for MBMA should be warranted.",

This retrospective cohort study included patients with VA prescriptions who underwent PGx testing. We quantified prescriptions active or recently expired at the time of PGx testing. We constructed two co‐primary polypharmacy (≥10 medications) end points: (i) based on all medications and (ii) requiring that at least one medication was affected by a pharmacogene of interest. Pharmacogenes and actionable phenotypes of interest included poor and ultrarapid metabolizers for CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 and intermediate and normal metabolizers for CYP3A5 . Patients were classified as having 0, 1, and 2+ total phenotypes across all genes. Of the 15,144 patients screened, 13,116 met eligibility criteria. Across phenotype cohorts, there was no significant association with polypharmacy using all medications, number of total medications, or number of medications affected by phenotypes. However, there was a significant difference in patients with polypharmacy prescribed ≥1 medication impacted by PGx across phenotype groups: 2,514/4,949 (51%), 1,349/2,595 (52%), 204/350 (58%) ( P = 0.03, OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.02–1.67). The median number of medications affected by PGx phenotypes with ≥1 PGx‐impacted medication across phenotype groups was a median of 0 (IQR 0, 0), 0 (IQR 0, 0), and 1 (IQR 0, 1) ( P < 0.001). In patients prescribed ≥1 medication impacted by PGx, those with more actionable pharmacogenomic phenotypes were more likely to meet polypharmacy criteria.",

Anticoagulants are useful for practical pharmacotherapy in Asian populations, but their responses are different from those in Caucasian populations. Therefore, we aimed to identify the most useful anticoagulant using a nationwide insurance claims database in Japan. We extracted information on patients with NVAF treated with DOACs or warfarin for the first time between September 2015 and February 2018 to conduct a retrospective observational cohort study using the claims database of Japan. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) of effectiveness and safety endpoints among DOACs or warfarin after adjusting for backgrounds by propensity scores (inverse probability weighting). Using negative control outcomes, we considered renal function as an unmeasured confounding factor. After adjusting for their backgrounds, patients treated with DOACs showed higher effectiveness endpoints (stroke or systemic embolism) than those treated with warfarin (HR; 0.72–0.81) and higher safety in terms of safety end points (clinically significant bleeding) (HR; 0.80–0.88). The net clinical benefit, which reflects the actual clinical usefulness, indicates the advantages of DOACs over warfarin (HR; 0.75–0.82). Dabigatran had lower usefulness than edoxaban and rivaroxaban in Japanese patients treated with NVAF, even after considering the unmeasured confounding factor of kidney function. Based on practical clinical data, edoxaban and rivaroxaban were the most useful anticoagulants in Japanese patients with NVAF.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon was discovered about a hundred years ago and its role in health and disease is under continuous investigation. Glucagon is a counter regulatory hormone secreted by alpha cells of the pancreas in response to multiple stimuli. Although some of glucagon's actions and its clinical application have been described, clinical experience with glucagon has been historically overshadowed by that of insulin. To date, the role of glucagon's actions in pharmacotherapy has been under explored. Glucagon plays a considerable role as a hormonal regulator via its known actions on the liver. The rise in obesity and diabetes mellitus prevalence is bringing focus to glucagon's known physiological roles and possible clinical applications. Six glucagon products and a glucagon analog are approved for use in the United States. Clinical pharmacology studies provide crucial support of glucagon's actions as evident from comprehensive pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics evaluations in humans. Here, we briefly describe the established physiological role of glucagon in humans and its known relationship with disease. We later summarize the clinical pharmacology of available glucagon products with different routes of administration.",

    "abstract": "The global rise in polypharmacy has increased both the necessity and complexity of drug–drug interaction (DDI) assessments, given the growing potential for interactions involving more than two drugs. Leveraging large‐scale healthcare claims data, we piloted a semi‐automated, high‐throughput case‐crossover‐based approach for drug–drug–drug interaction (3DI) screening. Cases were direct‐acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) users with either a major bleeding event during ongoing dispensings for potentially interacting, enzyme‐inhibiting antihypertensive drugs (AHDs) (Study 1), or a thromboembolic event during ongoing dispensings for potentially interacting, enzyme‐inducing antiseizure medications (ASMs) (Study 2). 3DI detection was based on screening for additional drug exposures that served as acute outcome triggers. To mitigate direct effects and confounding by concomitant drugs, self‐controlled estimates were adjusted using negative cases (external “control” DOAC users with the same outcomes but co‐dispensings for non‐interacting AHDs or ASMs). Signal thresholds were set based on P ‐values and false discovery rate q ‐values to address multiple comparisons. Study 1: 285 drugs were examined among 3,306 episodes. Self‐controlled assessments with q ‐value thresholds yielded 9 3DI signals (cases) and 40 DDI signals (negative cases). External adjustment generated 10 3DI signals from the P ‐value threshold and no signals from the q ‐value threshold. Study 2: 126 drugs were examined among 604 episodes. Assessments with P ‐value thresholds yielded 3 3DI and 26 DDI signals following self‐control, as well as 4 3DI signals following adjustment. No 3DI signals met the q ‐value threshold. The presented self‐ and externally‐controlled approach aimed to advance paradigms for real‐world higher order drug interaction screening among high‐susceptibility populations with pre‐existent DDI risk.",

However, the traditional CBZ dosing paradigm can lead to several adverse events (AEs). This study tested a shorter CBZ dosing regimen using the CYP3A4‐sensitive index substrate midazolam (MDZ). This was a fixed‐sequence arm of an open‐label, phase I study (NCT04840888). Healthy participants ( n = 15) aged 18–63 years received oral doses of 1.2 mg MDZ alone (Day 1), CBZ b.i.d. alone (100 mg Days 2–4; 200 mg Days 5–7; 300 mg Days 8–10 and 12–13), and 300 mg CBZ b.i.d. plus 1.2 mg MDZ (Days 11 and 14). One participant (6.7%) experienced constipation due to treatment with CBZ plus MDZ on Day 11. One participant (6.7%) experienced urticaria (Days 12–13), and two participants (13.3%) experienced somnolence (Days 8–10) due to treatment with 300 mg CBZ b.i.d. alone. All AEs were mild. For MDZ, the geometric mean (90% CI) ratio (vs. Day 1) of the area under the curve (AUC 0–∞) was 0.28 (0.24–0.31) on Day 11 and 0.26 (0.23–0.29) on Day 14. The AUC (0–12 hours) of CBZ was 114,000 ng∙h/mL on Day 11 and 105,000 ng∙h/mL on Day 14. Steady‐state concentrations of CBZ and induction of CYP3A4 were achieved on Day 11. The data are consistent with predictions of physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic models in Simcyp. The 9‐day dosing regimen for CBZ induction was well‐tolerated by healthy participants, supporting the use of a shorter CBZ regimen for CYP3A4 induction studies.",

    "abstract": "This research study investigates the intricate relationship among COVID‐19, maternal and infant health, and breastfeeding practices, with a specific focus on assessing the transfer of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir into human milk. Our aim is to provide critical insights to those managing COVID‐19 treatment in lactating individuals. The InfantRisk Center Human Milk Biorepository contained human milk and corresponding health information for eight mother–infant dyads exposed to standard doses of maternal nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (300 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir taken orally twice daily for 5 days). The primary outcomes measured were drug levels in milk using liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry and reporting the tolerance of the breastfed infant. Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir was measurable in all participants at a mean concentration of 33.48 ng/mL (ritonavir) and 729 ng/mL (nirmatrelvir). The estimated infant dose via milk was 0.0024 mg/kg/12 h (ritonavir) and 0.054 mg/kg/12 h (nirmatrelvir). The estimated relative infant dose was 0.19% (ritonavir) and 1.43% (nirmatrelvir) well under the standard 10% safety threshold. Among the eight infants exposed in this study, there were no reported adverse events. Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir is the recommended treatment for ambulatory COVID‐19 patients with mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19 infection at high risk for progression to severe disease. Although its use is recommended in lactating women, there are no previous studies on the transfer of nirmatrelvir into human milk. The study findings endorse the current approach of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use in lactating women and encourage healthcare providers to consider prescribing this treatment irrespective of lactation status when indicated.",

The present work aimed to characterize the viral response based on a pooled analysis of exposure–response (E–R) from five studies in treatment‐experienced and integrase‐resistant (INI‐r) patients infected with HIV‐1. Importantly, model‐based simulations of the E–R relationships with DTG provided insight into the clinical relevance of known intrinsic (e.g., sub‐population with Q148‐driven integrase mutation) and extrinsic (food, enzyme inducers, and metal cation‐containing products) factors expected to influence the DTG E–R relationship. Model‐based post hoc exposure metrics ( C min and C avg ) were incorporated into a mechanistic population viral dynamic model describing the short‐term effect of DTG on log10 HIV‐1 RNA viral load over 8 or 10 days. In addition, the impact of DTG in combination with background ARTs on the 24‐week HIV RNA response was also assessed using logistic regression. There was good concordance between model‐based predictions and observed virologic response on day 10 and week 24. The E–R model‐based simulations exploring the potential impact of a higher dose (100 mg b.i.d.) of DTG in subpopulations experiencing exposure changes due to covariates did not show clinically relevant changes in virological response compared with the approved 50 mg b.i.d. clinical dose. Overall, our study confirmed the current recommendation of dolutegravir 50 mg b.i.d. in the integrase inhibitor‐resistant (INI‐r) population.",

    "abstract": "Immuno‐oncology (IO) is a growing strategy in cancer treatment. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) can selectively infect cancer cells and lead to direct and/or immune‐dependent tumor lysis. This approach represents an opportunity to potentiate the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as pembrolizumab. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative models for the aforementioned scenarios. In this work, we developed a mechanistic framework describing viral kinetics, viral dynamics, and tumor response after intratumoral (i.t.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration of V937 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab. The model accounts for tumor shrinkage, in both injected and non‐injected lesions, induced by: viral‐infected tumor cell death and activated CD8 cells. OV‐infected tumor cells enhanced the expansion of CD8 cells, whereas pembrolizumab inhibits their exhaustion by competing with PD‐L1 in their binding to PD‐1. Circulating viral levels and treatment effects on tumor volume were adequately characterized in all the different scenarios. This mechanistic‐based model has been developed by combining top‐down and bottom‐up approaches and provides individual estimates of viral and ICI responses. The robustness of the model is reflected by the description of the tumor size time profiles in a variety of clinical scenarios. Additionally, this platform allows us to investigate not only the contribution of processes related to the viral kinetics and dynamics on tumor response, but also the influence of its interaction with an ICI. Additionally, the model can be used to explore different scenarios aiming to optimize treatment combinations and support clinical development.",

    "abstract": "The priority review voucher was established to incentivize research and development of treatments for traditionally underfunded diseases and was extended to medical countermeasures from 2016 to 2023, despite limited evidence of an association between the voucher program and increased product development. To determine whether the voucher program has incentivized initiation of new medical countermeasures in clinical trials, we created three cohorts of material threats: (i) COVID‐19, (ii) opioid pharmaceutical‐based agents, and (iii) all others. Using the Citeline Trialtrove database, we determined the number of medical countermeasures initiated in clinical trials from 2009–2016 and 2017–2023. Eligibility of COVID‐19 products for the voucher was confirmed with the issuance of a voucher for remdesivir in October 2020, so we compared January 2020–October 2020 to November 2020–July 2023. We fit two Poisson models—before and after voucher creation—within each cohort. Among COVID‐19 medical countermeasures, there was a decrease in the proportion of drugs initiated before (4.5%; 95% CI, 1.0 to 8.3%) vs. after voucher eligibility (−5.1%; 95% CI, −6.1 to −4.0%) ( P = 0.01). Among opioid pharmaceutical‐based agents medical countermeasures, the rate of new drugs initiated did not change from 2009–2016 (8.1%, 95% CI, −4.4 to 22.6%) to 2017–2023 (5.6%; 95% CI, −3.2 to 15.2%) ( P = 0.82). Among all other medical countermeasures, the rate of new drugs initiated also did not change from 2009–2016 (6.6%; 95% CI, −5.6 to 20.8%) to 2017–2023 (−14.8%; 95% CI, −29.2 to 2.0%) ( P = 0.15). The priority review voucher program was not associated with stimulating new clinical testing of investigational medical countermeasures.",

    "abstract": "Cetuximab was initially developed and approved as a first‐line treatment in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) for weekly administration (250 mg/m 2 Q1W with 400 mg/m 2 loading dose). An every‐2‐weeks schedule (500 mg/m 2 Q2W) was approved recently by several health authorities. Being synchronized with chemotherapy, Q2W administration should improve patients' convenience and healthcare resource utilization. Herein, we present evidence of non‐inferiority of Q2W cetuximab, compared with Q1W dosing using pharmacometrics modeling and clinical trial simulation (CTS). Pooled data from five phase I–III clinical trials in 852 patients with KRAS wild‐type mCRC treated with Q1W or Q2W cetuximab were modeled using a population exposure–tumor size (TS) model linked to overall survival (OS); exposure was derived from a previously established population pharmacokinetic model. A semi‐mechanistic TS model adapted from the Claret model incorporated killing rate proportional to cetuximab area under the concentration‐time curve over 2 weeks (AUC) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status as covariate on baseline TS. The OS was modeled with Weibull hazard using ECOG, baseline TS, primary tumor location, and predicted percent change in TS at 8 weeks as covariates. Model‐based simulations revealed indistinguishable early tumor shrinkage and survival between Q2W vs. Q1W cetuximab. CTS evaluated OS non‐inferiority (predefined margin of 1.25) in 1,000 trials, each with 2,000 virtual patients receiving Q2W or Q1W cetuximab (1:1), and demonstrated non‐inferiority in 94% of cases. Taken together, these analyses provide model‐based evidence for clinical non‐inferiority of Q2W vs. Q1W cetuximab in mCRC with potential benefits to patients and healthcare providers.",

We aimed to assess the effects of sacubitril/valsartan on survival in patients with HFrEF and concomitant significant MR. All patients from a single center who underwent echocardiography between June 2008 and December 2020, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 40% and hemodynamically significant MR were recruited. Patients were categorized according to drug use and year of the index echocardiogram into the angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), non‐ARNI before 2017, and non‐ARNI after 2017 groups. Patients in the ARNI and non‐ARNI after 2017 groups were compared directly, whereas patients in the non‐ARNI before 2017 group were matched to the ARNI group in a 3:1 ratio. The outcome of interest was all‐cause mortality. Death was compared between the groups using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. After exclusion by criteria and matching, there remained 610 patients in the ARNI group, 434 in the non‐ARNI after 2017 group, and 1,722 in the non‐ARNI before 2017 group. During follow‐up, all‐cause mortality was significantly lower in the ARNI group compared with both non‐ARNI after 2017 and non‐ARNI before 2017 groups. Multivariate analysis of both pairs of comparison between groups found the use of ARNI to be significantly associated with increased survival. In patients with HFrEF and concomitant significant MR, treatment with sacubitril/valsartan was associated with lower risks of all‐cause death.",

This study conducted a systematic review to evaluate the progress made from the implementation of pharmacometrics in clinical drug development and its adoption into drug approval by regulatory authorities in Africa. We performed a comprehensive literature search using major databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. The study included articles published until 2024, with no lower cutoff. Articles were excluded if not addressing the research question or of pharmacometrics studies done outside Africa with no collaboration with African researchers (study setting). For the review, a total of 121 articles were included for analysis. Among the reported pharmacometrics approaches, Population pharmacokinetics modeling approaches are the most used (95 (78.5%)). South Africa and Uganda researchers have the most research output in pharmacometrics in Africa (82 (89.1%) and 7 (7.61%), respectively), with the University of Cape Town (South Africa) producing the highest (71 (78.8%)) of all article in Africa. The most studied conditions are TB (43 (35.5%)), HIV (33 (27.3%), TB and HIV (22 (18.2%)), and malaria (12 (9.92%). Pharmacometrics is gaining momentum in Africa, and the progress made since inception will significantly improve the safety and efficacy of therapeutic agents used to treat HIV, TB, and other emerging conditions.",

We present data from the first‐in‐human study aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) following single ascending doses of BMS‐986308 in healthy adult participants. Forty healthy participants, aged from 20 to 55 years, and body mass index (BMI) from 19.8 to 31.6 kg/m 2 were assigned to 1 of 5 dose cohorts (1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg) and randomized (6:2) to receive BMS‐986308 oral solution or matching placebo. Following administration, BMS‐986308 was rapidly absorbed with a median time to maximum concentration ( T max ) of 1.00 to 1.75 h and exhibiting a mean terminal half‐life ( t 1/2 ) of approximately 13 h. Dose proportionality was evident in BMS‐986308 area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC), while maximum concentration (C max ) was slightly greater than dose‐proportional. We observed that urine output (or diuresis; mL) and urinary sodium excretion (or natriuresis; mmol) increased in a dose‐dependent manner, starting at a minimum pharmacologically active dose of 30 mg. The largest mean changes from baseline in diuresis and natriuresis occurred in both the 6‐ and −24 h post‐dose period following administration of 100 mg (1683.0 mL and 2055.3 mL, and 231.7 mmol and 213.7 mmol, respectively; *** P < 0.001). Overall, single‐dose BMS‐986308 was found to be safe, well‐tolerated, with an excellent PK profile, and substantial diuretic and natriuretic activity.",

The sequelae of severe hypercalcemia together with direct complications from tumor dissemination in patients with advanced disease are usually fatal. Due to its rarity, formal studies to guide the diagnosis and management of parathyroid carcinoma are lacking. However, recent data from case reports, case series, and registry studies suggest the emergence of new and effective treatment approaches for this understudied disease. We reviewed existing literature on the diagnosis and management of parathyroid carcinoma. Our findings suggest that traditional approaches such as surgical resection for both localized and metastatic diseases continue to play an important role in patient management. For patients with unresectable disease, newer systemic treatment approaches, including the use of temozolomide and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, may offer clinical benefit.",

    "abstract": "The use of partial residual plots (PRPs) was explored as a model diagnostic tool in Model‐based Meta‐Analysis (MBMA). Mathematical derivations illustrating the concepts were followed by an MBMA example using publicly available literature data of anti‐depressive treatments with fluoxetine and venlafaxine. An E max dose–response model was identified for venlafaxine while a constant drug effect combining all dose levels vs. placebo was identified for fluoxetine. The larger the mean baseline Hamilton Depression Rating (HAMD) score, the larger the expected drug effect ( P = 0.0122), based on the likelihood ratio test. Mean baseline HAMD score (range) was 25.4 (23.5, 29.4) and 20.8 (15, 26) while mean placebo change from baseline (range) was −9.02 (−12.2, −4.8) and − 6.22 (−10.9, −1.3) for venlafaxine and fluoxetine, respectively. Average baseline HAMD score appeared larger for venlafaxine compared to fluoxetine, albeit a wider range for fluoxetine. Placebo response seemed lower but also more variable in fluoxetine compared to venlafaxine studies. Observed data points tended to deviate from model predictions when the mean baseline HAMD and placebo response values associated with those data points differed substantially from the corresponding values used for the model prediction. Normalizing observed data addressed this, providing a “like‐to‐like” comparison with model predictions in PRP when assessing the effect of one covariate (dose) after normalizing for other covariates/effects (placebo response and mean baseline). PRPs provide a robust integrated diagnostic tool in MBMA that uses all data to show the correlation between response and any covariate while controlling for other covariates included in the model.",

We aimed to confirm or refute the associations between concomitant use of individual OACs and DPP‐4is and serious bleeding in a large US database, using self‐controlled case series (SCCS) and case‐crossover (CCO) designs. The study population was eligible Medicare beneficiaries co‐exposed to a DPP‐4i (precipitant) and either an OAC (object drug) or lisinopril (negative control object drug) in 2016–2020. For the SCCS, we used conditional Poisson regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RRs) between each co‐exposure (vs. not) and serious bleeding and divided the RR by the adjusted RR for the corresponding lisinopril + precipitant pair to obtain ratios of RRs (RRRs). For the CCO, we estimated the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of exposure to the precipitant in the focal window vs. referent window using multivariable conditional logistic regression and divided the ORs in the object drug‐exposed cases over the ORs in negative object drug‐exposed cases to obtain the ratios of ORs (RORs). The adjusted RRRs for serious bleeding ranged from 0.32 (0.05–1.91) for apixaban/lisinopril + saxagliptin to 3.49 (1.29–9.48) for warfarin/lisinopril + linagliptin.

    "abstract": "The CRISPR‐based gene editing therapy exagamglogene autotemcel (exa‐cel) recently received FDA approval for patients with severe sickle cell disease (SCD). The approval was based on a phase III trial (CLIMB SCD 121), which showed 97% efficacy of this treatment in eliminating vaso occlusive crises (VOCs) for 12 consecutive months. To help contextualize results from this trial, we aimed to investigate the proportion of patients with severe SCD who remain VOC‐free for a 1‐year period in routine clinical care. Using Medicaid claims data (2000–2018), we identified a cohort of patients, 12–35 years old with severe SCD, defined by ≥ 2 VOCs per year for 2 consecutive years, who met other exa‐cel trial inclusion criteria to mimic a trial‐like population. A VOC was identified using ICD diagnosis codes during hospitalization and ER visits. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with no VOCs during a 1‐year follow‐up. A total of 7,425 patients with severe SCD [mean (SD) age: 20.5 (6.0) years, 54.6% females, 84% African Americans], had a mean of 5.2 VOCs, 5.1 ER visits and 3.5 hospitalizations per year during the baseline period. The proportion of patients with no VOCs during the 1‐year follow‐up was 7.7% (95% confidence interval: 7.1%–8.3%). In conclusion, less than one in 12 patients with severe SCD achieved VOC‐free status within 1 year in routine clinical care. These findings suggest that the high efficacy observed for exa‐cel in the trial, if replicated in routine clinical care, could translate into a significant public health impact.",

    "abstract": "Vincristine (VCR) can cause vincristine‐induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) during the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the mechanisms are complicated. The aim of this study was to investigate the influencing factors on the population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) related to VIPN, including clearance routes, drug–drug interactions (DDI), and genetic characteristics. Pediatric patients being treated for ALL were recruited to PK study where VCR and its metabolite (M1) were measured using a novel assay. The incidence of VIPN was also recorded. DNA sequencing of relevant PK and PD genes was performed. PopPK and PK/PD models were developed, pharmacogenetic and DDI analyses were conducted. In total, 79 children were recruited. The results showed that allometric scaling, ABCB1‐rs1128503 genotype, and posaconazole (POS) significantly improved the PopPK model fit. VIPN was significantly correlated with the exposure of VCR. Co‐administration with POS shifted the effect curve for VIPN to the left, indicating increased VIPN risk at the same exposure levels. No significant effects on VIPN were observed for CYP3A5 (rs776746), CYP3A4 (rs2242480), CEP72 (rs924607), or various ABCB1 variants (rs1128503, rs2032582, rs1045642, rs4728709, rs4148737, and rs10276036), nor with the co‐administration of fluconazole or dasatinib. In summary, co‐administration of POS increased VCR exposure by 0.4‐fold and raised the risk of VIPN, with an occurrence probability generally exceeding 0.7. Therapeutic drug monitoring of VCR in clinical practice may be necessary to enable appropriate dose adjustments and individualized treatment.",

    "abstract": "There had been concerns about the acute complications during or shortly after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMVr) and molnupiravir (MOL). This study aimed to compare the risks of selected acute safety events in patients treated with or without NMVr or MOL using the COVID‐19 oral treatment safety assessment data, constructed through the linkage of nationwide databases: National COVID‐19 registry, Real‐time Prescription Surveillance, and National Health Insurance data. We identified all adults diagnosed with COVID‐19 between January and November 2022, and then constructed two cohorts by matching up to four patients without antiviral treatment records to NMVr or MOL users using propensity score matching. Outcomes of interest were incident‐selected cardiac (i.e., atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmia, bradycardia), neurological (i.e., seizure, neuropathy, encephalomyelitis), and miscellaneous (i.e., acute pancreatitis, acute liver injury, dysgeusia) events. A total of 739,935 NMVr users were matched with 2,951,690 comparators and 150,431 MOL users with 759,521 comparators. NMVr users were at lower risk for developing selected cardiac events (hazard ratio 0.74 [95% CI 0.65–0.87] for atrial fibrillation, 0.81 [0.65–0.99] for other arrhythmia, and 0.82 [0.70–0.96] for bradycardia) and dysgeusia (0.58 [0.45–0.74]). For MOL users, the risk was lower for atrial fibrillation (0.72 [0.53–0.96]) and dysgeusia (0.34 [0.18–0.65]). Overall, there were no increased risks of acute complications during and shortly after treatment with oral COVID‐19 antivirals. Rather, the findings underscore their effectiveness in attenuating the risk of potential acute sequelae of COVID‐19.",

    "abstract": "Accurate clinical translation of preclinical research remains challenging, primarily due to species‐specific differences and disease and patient heterogeneity. An important recent advancement has been development of microphysiological systems that consist of multiple human cell types that recapitulate key characteristics of their respective human systems, allowing essential physiologic processes to be accurately assessed during drug development. However, an unmet need remains regarding a quantitative method to evaluate the similarity between diverse sample types for various contexts of use (CoU)‐specific pathways. To address this gap, this study describes the development of pathway‐based similarity measurement (PBSM), which leverages RNA‐seq data and pathway‐based information to assess the human relevance of preclinical models for specific CoU. PBSM offers a quantitative method to compare the transcriptomic similarity of preclinical models to human tissues, shown here as proof of concept for liver and cardiac tissues, enabling improved model selection and validation. Thus, PBSM can successfully support CoU selection for preclinical models, assess the impact of different gene sets on similarity calculations, and differentiate among various in vitro and in vivo models. PBSM has the potential to reduce the translational gap in drug development by allowing quantitative evaluation of the similarity of preclinical models to human tissues, facilitating model selection, and improving understanding of context‐specific applications. PBSM can serve as a foundation for enhancing the physiological relevance of in vitro models and supporting the development of more effective therapeutic interventions.",

The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative assembled a diverse project team from across the patient, academic, regulatory, and industry sectors of practice to advance the use of DPM for decision making in clinical trials and medical product development. This team conducted a scoping review to explore current applications of DPM and convened a multi‐stakeholder expert meeting to discuss its value in medical product development. In this article, we present the scoping review and expert meeting output and propose key questions that medical product developers and regulators may use to inform clinical development strategy, appreciate the therapeutic context and endpoint selection, and optimize trial design with disease progression models. By expanding awareness of the unique value of DPM, this article does not aim to be technical in nature but rather aims to highlight the potential of DPM to improve the quality and efficiency of medical product development.",

There were two important learnings from the survey: (i) pharmaceutical companies do not use a consistent methodology to assess renal function in their drug development programs. (ii) there has been significant improvement in predicting how kidney function affects drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and thus dose recommendations. Applying model‐based methods such as population PK, physiologically‐based PK (PBPK), and virtual controls has enabled earlier prediction of how kidney function influences PK, leading to the participation of more patients with impaired kidney function in Phase 2 and 3 trials.",

Hence, we aim to assess the association between DAA treatment and mortality rate among Medicare beneficiaries with HCV‐related HCC. This retrospective cohort study screened 19,813 adults in 2013–2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked with Medicare data. Patients with HCV‐related HCC initiating DAA therapy after their first HCC diagnosis were compared with patients with HCV‐related HCC who received no HCV treatment. After inverse probability treatment weighting, multivariable Cox proportional hazards models compared mortality rates between the groups. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were based on HCC stage (early vs. advanced), type of HCC treatment (curative, palliative, none), and DAA treatment duration. In total 3,777 patients with HCV‐related HCC were identified (mean age: 68.2 years, 75.2% male, 61.8% White), of whom 19% initiated DAA therapy. Crude incidence mortality rates were 17.9 and 90.7 deaths per 100 person‐years in the DAA and HCV‐untreated groups, respectively. Cox regression models indicated that DAA therapy was associated with decreased risk of all‐cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% CI 0.31–0.36). Median survival time was 45.7 (95% CI 40.9–57.9) months in the DAA group and 7.7 (95% CI 7.3–8.2) months in the HCV‐untreated group ( P < 0.001). All subgroup and sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main analyses. DAA therapy was associated with survival benefits for patients with HCV‐related HCC regardless of the stage or type of HCC treatment and should not be withheld from this population of Medicare beneficiaries.",

In vitro studies suggest GLPG3970 strongly inhibits breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), indicating a possible interaction with BCRP substrates such as sulfasalazine (SSZ; a probe substrate for intestinal BCRP inhibition) and methotrexate (MTX), both inflammatory disease medications. Two open‐label, nonrandomized, phase I, drug–drug interaction (DDI) studies assessed the pharmacokinetics of SSZ 1,000 mg (NCT04720183) and MTX 7.5 mg (EudraCT: 2020‐000391‐37) with and without GLPG3970 350 mg. Healthy participants aged 18–55 years with wild‐type homozygous BCRP genotype (c421C/C) received: SSZ on day (D)1, GLPG3970 + SSZ on D5, and GLPG3970 2 hours after SSZ on D9 ( N = 8; SSZ/GLPG3970 DDI study); MTX on D1, GLPG3970 + MTX on D5, and GLPG3970 on D6–8 ( N = 15; MTX/GLPG3970 DDI study). Primary end points were AUC and C max (“exposure”) of SSZ and its metabolite (sulfapyridine [SPD]), SPD:SSZ AUC ratio (SSZ/GLPG3970 study), and AUC and C max (“exposure”) of MTX (MTX/GLPG3970 study). DDIs were evaluated using the geometric mean ratio of each end point; a > 2‐fold increase in SSZ or MTX exposure was deemed clinically relevant. GLPG3970 demonstrated mild inhibition of intestinal BCRP in vivo : GLPG3970 + SSZ increased SSZ exposure ~1.7–1.8‐fold and decreased SPD:SSZ ratio ~ 2‐fold vs. SSZ alone. GLPG3970 administered 2 hours after SSZ did not change the magnitude of the interaction. GLPG3970 + MTX had no relevant effect on MTX pharmacokinetics vs. MTX alone. Therefore, the strong in vitro BCRP inhibition was not confirmed in vivo . No safety concerns were observed when GLPG3970 was coadministered with SSZ or MTX.",

This study investigated the association between the use of β‐blockers and prognosis in hospitalized HF patients with and without AF in Japan. Patients hospitalized with the first episode of acute HF were identified from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan between April 2014 and March 2021. Associations of β‐blocker use and prognosis were compared by propensity score matching among the AF or non‐AF group. A mixed‐effects survival model was used, and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Among 428,650 patients discharged with HF in 4,433 hospitals, 175,174 (40.9%) were ≥ 85 years old, 151,873 (35.4%) had complicated AF, and 236,457 (55.2%) were β‐blocker users. In a matched AF group, β‐blocker use was associated with a lower composite outcome of all‐cause mortality or HF rehospitalization (HR [95% CI], 0.95 [0.93–0.97]). A similar result was obtained in a matched non‐AF group (0.95 [0.94–0.96]). In addition, the HRs in patients aged ≥ 85 years and female patients were 1.00 [0.98–1.02] and 1.01 [0.98–1.03] in the AF group and 1.03 [1.01–1.05] and 0.98 [0.97–1.00] in the non‐AF group, respectively.

    "abstract": "Acute arterial hypertension within the critical care context may necessitate the administration of intravenous antihypertensive agents. Nicardipine and urapidil are notable for their application in intensive care units. Nonetheless, dihydropyridine calcium channel inhibitors (DCCIs) such as nicardipine are implicated in the impairment of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, potentially disrupting oxygenation. This study aimed to assess the differences in patient oxygenation when these antihypertensive agents are administered intravenously. This bicentric, prospective, observational investigation spanning five intensive care units evaluated patients requiring intravenous nicardipine or urapidil. Oxygenation data were recorded from the start of therapy until the 12th hour. Comparative analysis was performed between patient groups based on the antihypertensive agent administered, along with subgroup investigations to identify populations with an elevated risk of hypoxemia. From November 2021 to November 2023, 197 patients were included: 98 (50%) were treated with nicardipine, and 99 (50%) were treated with urapidil. Hypoxemia occurred in 97 (49%) patients and was more prevalent in the nicardipine cohort, affecting 65 (66%) patients, as opposed to 32 (32%) patients in the urapidil cohort (RR 2.05, 95% CI [1.48–2.82], P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant association between patients with pulmonary atelectasis (RR 2.30, 95% CI [1.4–3.7], P < 0.001) and obesity (RR 2.7, 95% CI [1.5–4.6], P < 0.001). Considering these findings, cautious consideration of the patient's respiratory status should be exercised when initiating intravenous DCCI treatment. However, given the limitations of this study, a controlled trial on hypertension management in the ICU is needed.",

Drugs targeting the sphingosine‐1‐phosphate receptor show potential anti‐convulsant effects in animal models and decrease cortical excitability in patients with multiple sclerosis, but available compounds alter lymphocyte trafficking and cause immunosuppression, limiting their clinical anti‐epileptic potential. TRV045 is a selective sphingosine‐1‐phosphate subtype 1 receptor agonist without effects on lymphocyte trafficking, demonstrating efficacy in animal models of epilepsy, with the potential to target abnormal cortical excitability. This randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐way cross‐over, multiple‐dose study evaluated the effects of TRV045 on cortical excitability in healthy male adults, measured by pharmaco‐electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Subjects received TRV045 250 mg or placebo, once daily for 4 days, in randomized order. Endpoints were analyzed with a mixed effects model analysis of covariance. Twenty‐five of the 27 subjects completed the study. There was a significant increase in alpha power with eyes open after treatment with TRV045 on Day 1, increasing after 4 days of dosing. Less pronounced significant effects in beta, gamma, and delta power were observed after 4 days. For TMS‐Electromyography there was a non‐significant decreased post‐dose single‐pulse peak‐to‐peak amplitude on Day 1 only, and there were no effects on paired‐pulse parameters. Several significant TMS‐Electroencephalography clusters were seen after 4 days of dosing. These findings show that TRV045 has central nervous system activity with evolving effects following repeated dosing. These data support further studies to elucidate the mechanism of action of TRV045 and its potential anti‐epileptic effects.",

    "abstract": "Antibody‐based therapeutic proteins (TPs) emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for chronic inflammatory diseases. During clinical development, the impact of disease on pharmacokinetics (PK) should be carefully considered to reliably extrapolate PK from healthy volunteers (HVs) in early‐phase studies to patients in later‐phase studies. This paper aimed to provide an overview of the impact of chronic inflammatory diseases on the PK of antibody‐based TPs. A literature search was conducted on Drugs@FDA and PubMed, yielding 30 TPs with author‐drawn conclusions about PK differences between HVs and patients with inflammatory diseases. Nine out of 30 TPs suggested PK differences in patients with inflammatory diseases compared with HVs, and patients mostly appeared to have higher drug clearance or lower drug exposure compared with HVs. However, the remaining 21 TPs appeared to have no apparent PK differences between patients and HVs. Based on ratios of reported drug clearance in patients vs. HVs (N: 31 ratios for 22 TPs), the difference in TP clearance due to inflammatory diseases did not exceed twofold (mean clearance ratio: 1.23; standard deviation: 0.25), with the most noticeable difference (>50% higher clearance) observed in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. Covariate assessment in published population PK models of TPs revealed that higher baseline C‐reactive proteins and lower baseline albumin levels tend to be correlated with higher TP clearance. Future investigation is necessary to further elucidate the mechanism behind the inflammatory disease‐mediated PK differences.",

    "abstract": "Drug labels summarize essential safety information for healthcare professionals and patients. However, studies have reported a discordance of safety information in drug labeling among countries/regions. We aimed to identify the characteristics of adverse events associated with discordant safety warnings during the initial labeling of new drugs approved at approximately the same time in Japan, the United States, and the European Union. Safety warning discordance/concordance between two countries/regions and the explanatory variables were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. The safety warning concordance rate was 71.0% (152/214) for the United States and the European Union, 59.5% (135/227) for Japan and the United States, and 64.3% (144/224) for Japan and the European Union. A significant association with discordant safety warnings was revealed for “adverse event rate” and “warning status in a similar drug” between the United States and the European Union; “adverse event rate,” “adverse event included in important medical event list,” and “warning status in a similar drug” between Japan and the United States; and “adverse event included in important medical event list” and “warning status in a similar drug” between Japan and the European Union. Clarifying and publicizing the reasons for safety warnings, along with an awareness of the factors associated with the discordance identified in this study, will help healthcare professionals, patients, marketing authorization holders, and regulatory authorities around the world share the background of country/region‐specific warnings, reducing the possibility of confusion among them due to the discrepancies.",

    "abstract": "While cell and gene therapies (CGTs) have emerged as promising modalities to treat conditions with limited therapeutic options, their unconventional development is fraught with uncertainty, rendering them high‐risk assets for many pharmaceutical companies. Here, we assess the clinical development trajectories of CGT products by estimating probabilities of successful clinical trial phase transitions and the likelihood of achieving regulatory approval. We included all CGT products entering clinical development from 1993 to 2023 and intended for marketing in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland. Associations between product success and characteristics were investigated. In sub‐analyses, we examined the clinical trajectories of two promising product types, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapies and adeno‐associated viral (AAV) vector‐based gene therapies. We identified 995 CGT products corresponding to 1,961 development programs. A total of 44 CGTs secured at least one regulatory approval, corresponding to an overall likelihood of approval of 5.3% (95% CI 4.0–6.9). Development programs with an orphan designation had a higher likelihood of approval than those without (9.4%, 95% CI 6.6–13.3 vs. 3.2%, 95% CI 2.0–4.9), while programs for oncology indications had a lower likelihood of approval compared to those for non‐oncology indications (3.2%, 95% CI 1.6–5.1 vs. 8.0%, 95% CI 5.7–11.1). CAR T cells and AAV gene therapies had a similar overall likelihood of approval of 13.6% (95% CI 7.3, 23.9) and 13.6% (95% CI 6.4, 26.7), respectively. In conclusion, CGT products have a low overall likelihood of approval with variability based on orphan status, therapeutic area, and product type.",

    "abstract": "Insulin secretagogues and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are commonly co‐prescribed for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Case reports suggesting that co‐administration of insulin secretagogues with ACEIs is associated with an increased risk of serious hypoglycemia have led to warnings regarding a drug–drug interaction in widely used drug compendia. However, subsequent studies have had inconsistent results. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the evidence that concomitant use of ACEIs and insulin secretagogues increases the risk of serious hypoglycemia. MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to July 2023 for studies evaluating adults with T2D treated with insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas or meglitinides, and exposed to an ACEI. The primary outcome was serious hypoglycemia. A literature search yielded 472 papers, of which five met the inclusion criteria. The heterogeneity of the studies precluded meta‐analysis. Two studies using multiple methods to address bias found no association between hypoglycemia and concomitant use of ACEI and insulin secretagogues. Three studies found potential associations, but only one was statistically significant; these studies were at serious or critical risk of bias due to potential confounding from lack of adjustment for renal dysfunction. The higher quality studies found no association between the concomitant use of insulin secretagogues with ACEI and hypoglycemia. Drug compendia and electronic health records should consider updating and removing alerts warning of a drug–drug interaction between insulin secretagogues as a class and ACEIs.",

    "abstract": "Sotatercept is a breakthrough, first‐in‐class biologic, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Exposure‐response (E‐R) analyses and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling were performed for sotatercept after intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) administrations. Clinical endpoints included 6‐minute walk distance (6MWD), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and probability of N‐terminal pro‐B natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) concentrations < 300 pg/mL for efficacy, and hemoglobin (Hgb) for safety from two Phase 1 studies, two Phase 2 studies, and one Phase 3 study. E‐R models using nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach were developed for 6MWD and PVR, while Cox proportional hazards model and semi‐mechanistic PK/PD model were used for NT‐proBNP and Hgb. Covariate analyses were conducted to identify significant predictors of variability for each of these clinical endpoints. Modeling results showed that increasing sotatercept average concentration ( C avg ) at week 24 is associated with increased predicted 6MWD, increased probability of NT‐proBNP concentration < 300 pg/mL, decreased predicted PVR, and increased Hgb which was clinically manageable. All these responses approached their corresponding plateaus at a C avg range associated with the dose of 0.7 mg/kg Q3W SC. Statistically relevant covariates included age and iron supplementation which slightly increased Hgb‐mediated effect for 6MWD, PAH disease duration, and baseline therapy infusion with prostacyclin for PVR, and WHO functional class for NT‐proBNP. The magnitudes of the impact of these covariates are not clinically meaningful. Taken together, these results support an appropriate benefit–risk profile for the FDA‐approved target dose for sotatercept of 0.7 mg/kg Q3W SC.",

    "abstract": "Sotrovimab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody for the early treatment of mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐ 19. A phase I, open‐label, randomized, parallel‐group study was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics, relative bioavailability, safety, and tolerability of two concentrations of sotrovimab administered intramuscularly at different injection sites in healthy volunteers. The study consisted of three parts (A, B, and C) and the pharmacokinetic results from Part A are reported herein. In Part A, participants were randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to a 500 mg dose of 62.5 mg/mL sotrovimab administered into dorsogluteal muscle, or 100 mg/mL sotrovimab administered into dorsogluteal, anterolateral thigh, or deltoid muscles. Formulation concentration did not impact exposure following dorsogluteal administration; the point estimates (90% confidence interval [CI]) of the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of area under the curve (AUC) inf and maximum serum concentration ( C max ) for dorsogluteal administration of 100 mg/mL vs. 62.5 mg/mL intramuscular sotrovimab were 0.95 (0.86–1.05) and 1.14 (1.02–1.27), respectively. However, the administration of 100 mg/mL sotrovimab in thigh or deltoid resulted in increased exposure relative to gluteal injections; the point estimates (90% CI) of the GMRs for 100 mg/mL intramuscular sotrovimab administered into thigh or deltoid muscles vs. 100 mg/mL administered dorsogluteally were 1.63 (1.46–1.83) and 1.50 (1.34–1.67) for AUC inf , and 1.82 (1.60–2.08) and 1.49 (1.31–1.69) for C max , respectively. Notably, thigh and deltoid administration also resulted in lower variability in key pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, C max , apparent clearance and volume of distribution, and earlier achievement of C max , than dorsogluteal intramuscular administration of sotrovimab.",

    "abstract": "Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) deficiency is strongly associated with thiopurine‐induced myelosuppression. Currently, testing for NUDT15 deficiency is based on the genotyping of the most frequent and clinically characterized no‐function variants, that is, * 2 , * 3 and * 9 . The Hispanic/Latino‐predominant variant NUDT15 * 4 (p.R139H) is classified as “uncertain function” by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium, because of insufficient data to ascertain its clinical actionability. In this study, we evaluated the association of NUDT15 * 4 with mercaptopurine (6‐MP) tolerance in a retrospective cohort of 1,399 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of diverse ancestries. All patients were wildtype for thiopurine methyltransferase gene. Patients were treated with 6‐MP in the context of ALL frontline clinical trials. The tolerated dose of 6‐MP was used to assess drug toxicity during the maintenance phase of ALL therapy. Patients with NUDT15 * 1 /* 4 ( n = 16, all of whom self‐identified as Hispanic/Latino) tolerated a significantly lower dose of 6‐MP than did those with NUDT15 * 1 /* 1 : median [interquartile range] of 39.0 [21.2–52.8] mg/m 2 , vs. 62.2 [47.9–71.6] mg/m 2 , P value < 0.001. No patient homozygous for * 4 was detected. In a separate retrospective validation study, six patients were identified as having NUDT15 * 1 /* 4 by routine clinical pharmacogenetics testing and tolerated a 6‐MP median dose of 38.7 mg/m 2 (IQR, 33.7–54.0), confirming the need for dose reduction attributed to the NUDT15 * 4 variant. These results point to the need to include NUDT15 * 4 in pharmacogenetics‐guided thiopurine dosing algorithms.",

This study explores cardiac healthcare providers' perceptions and experiences of factors influencing medication adherence (MA) in HF patients, with findings contributing to developing a HF‐specific MA assessment scale. Using a cross‐sectional, mixed methods design, we conducted an online survey with both closed and open‐ended questions distributed to cardiac healthcare providers, working at the National University Hospital in Iceland. The survey consisted of 103 questions divided into 18 themes. Analysis included descriptive statistics of the participants' responses to closed responses with simplified scoring. Free‐text responses were grouped into thematic categories and then into subthemes. Of 104 healthcare providers invited, 73 (70%) participated. Key factors identified as most beneficial for supporting MA included supportive patient–provider relationships (97%), selecting suitable drug formulation (96%), healthcare support at home (95%), and multi‐dose dispensing from pharmacies (93%). The youngest and oldest HF patients were believed to be at the highest risk of medication non‐adherence, particularly among males. Other patients estimated at increased risk included those with alcohol and/or substance abuse (89%), those with limited knowledge of medication effects (89%), those perceiving medication as useless (88%), and those with cognitive impairment (86%). Most participants (73%) agreed that healthcare providers should assess and document MA in clinical care. These findings provide a comprehensive overview of factors that cardiac healthcare providers believe influence non‐adherence in HF patients, contributing to the development of a HF‐specific MA scale.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of the currently registered dosing schedules for bedaquiline and delamanid is a barrier to uptake in drug‐resistant tuberculosis treatment across all ages. A simpler once‐daily dosing schedule is critical to ensure patient‐friendly regimens with good adherence. We assessed expected drug exposures with proposed once‐daily doses for adults and compared novel model‐informed once‐daily dosing strategies for children with current World Health Organization (WHO) recommended dosing. A reference individual and virtual pediatric population were generated to simulate exposures in adults and children, respectively. Published population models characterizing the exposures of bedaquiline and its metabolite M2, delamanid, and its metabolite DM‐6705 were utilized. During simulation, child growth during treatment along with several CYP3A4 ontogeny profiles was accounted for. Exposures in children were compared with simulated adult targets to assess the expected treatment efficacy and safety. In adults, the proposed bedaquiline once‐daily dosing (400 mg daily for 2 weeks followed by 100 mg daily for 22 weeks) yielded 14% higher exposures of bedaquiline and M2 compared to the labeled dosing scheme at 24 weeks; for delamanid and DM‐6705, the suggested 300 mg daily dose provided 13% lower exposures at steady state. For children, the cumulative proportions of exposures of both drugs showed < 5% difference between WHO‐recommended and proposed once‐daily dosing. This study demonstrated the use of model‐informed approaches to propose rational and simpler regimens for bedaquiline and delamanid in adults and children. The new once‐daily dosing strategies will be tested in the PARADIGM4TB and IMPAACT 2020 trials in adults and children, respectively.",
